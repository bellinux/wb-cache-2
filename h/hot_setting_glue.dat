40|$|Abstract—Resource-constrained mobile devices pose a {{challenge}} to the design of security mechanisms. Existing host-based malware detection solutions are often resource-intensive. We present a decentralized and resource-aware malware detection architecture for mobile devices. Our approach leverages two key ideas: social collaboration and the concept of a <b>hot</b> <b>set.</b> The <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> concept states that not all malware signatures are equally important. At any given time, some signatures (the <b>hot</b> <b>set)</b> {{are more likely to be}} matched than the others. We leverage this concept by only keeping the <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> of signatures in the main memory of a mobile device, and distributing the whole signature database among devices belonging to the social group of the device owner. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a proof-of-concept (Social-AV) based on an open source anti-malware software, ClamAV. Experiments show that Social-AV reduces the memory consumption to about 55 % of the amount consumed by ClamAV, while retaining the same detection capability.

We propose and evaluate innovative combinations of predictive models and social-aware solutions for the identification of the <b>hot</b> <b>set.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that some of the considered algorithms improve the accuracy of the <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> identification up to 30 % if compared to existing models, and they guarantee stable and robust results even in the context of social network applications characterized by high variability.

Irrespective of whether the <b>setting</b> is <b>hot</b> or cold we find that partners provide higher initial contributions than strangers. In the cold setting (without revision possibility) partners contribute more on average but do not react differently to past contributions by others than strangers. In the <b>hot</b> <b>setting</b> the dynamic contribution plans of strangers are somewhat upward-shifted. Furthermore the contributions of partners decrease more strongly than those of strangers over time in a <b>hot</b> <b>setting.</b> The reason for this effect {{lies in the fact}} that partners react much more strongly to negative experiences than strangers.

40|$|A grand {{challenge}} of distributed query processing is {{to devise a}} self-organizing architecture which exploits all hardware resources optimally to manage the database <b>hot</b> <b>set,</b> minimize query response time, and maximize throughput without single point global coordination. The Data Cyclotron architecture [Goncalves and Kersten 2010] addresses this challenge using turbulent data movement through a storage ring built from distributed main memory and capitalizing on the functionality offered by modern remote-DMA network facilities. Queries assigned to individual nodes interact with the storage ring by picking up data fragments, which are continuously flowing around, that is, the <b>hot</b> <b>set.</b> The storage ring is steered by the Level Of Interest (LOI) attached to each data fragment, which represents the cumulative query interest as it passes around the ring multiple times. A fragment with LOI below a given threshold, inversely proportional to the ring load, is pulled out to free up resources. This threshold is dynamically adjusted in a fully distributed manner based on ring characteristics and locally observed query behavior. It optimizes resource utilization by keeping the average data access latency low. The approach is illustrated using an extensive and validated simulation study. The results underpin the fragment <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> management robustness in turbulent workload scenarios. A fully functional prototype of the proposed architecture has been implemented using modest extensions to MonetDB and runs within a multirack cluster equipped with Infiniband. Extensive experimentation using both microbenchmarks and high-volume workloads based on TPC-H demonstrates its feasibility. The Data Cyclotron architecture and experiments open a new vista for modern distributed database architectures with a plethora of new research challenges...|$|R

For this purpose, the three most promising among the known procedures have been selected, and together with a fourth new developed method, tested for their applicability. As a primary criterion for the evaluation of the measured data, the resolution of the tested methods has been compared. The resolution has been studied as a function of parameters, which are relevant to the results, such asrate of loading, orientation of the seam axis, and loading direction.
