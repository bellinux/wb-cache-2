25|$|After the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, his son Guru Hargobind at age eleven {{became the}} sixth guru of the Sikhs and Sikhism {{dramatically}} evolved {{to become a}} political movement {{in addition to being}} religious. Guru Hargobind carried two swords, calling one spiritual and the other for temporal purpose (known as mīrī and pīrī in Sikhism). According to the Sikh tradition, Guru Arjan asked his son Hargobind to start a military tradition to protect the Sikh people and always keep himself surrounded by armed Sikhs. The building of an armed Sikh militia began with Guru Hargobind. Guru Hargobind was soon arrested by the Mughals and kept in jail in Gwalior. It is unclear <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> he served in prison, with different texts stating it to be between 2 to 12 years. He married three women, built a fort to defend Ramdaspur and created a formal court called Akal Takht, now the highest Khalsa Sikh religious authority.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} nekomata, another cat-like yōkai which {{is said to}} derive from a cat whose tail split into two when it grew older, there are folk beliefs across Japan about how aged cats would turn into bakeneko. There are tales of cats raised for twelve years in Ibaraki Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture, and for {{thirteen}} years in Kunigami District, Okinawa Prefecture, that became bakeneko. In Yamagata District, Hiroshima Prefecture, {{it is said that}} a cat raised for seven years or longer would kill the one that raised it. There are also many regions where when people began raising a cat, they would decide in advance for <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> they would raise it because of this superstition. Also, depending on the area, there are stories in which cats that were killed by humans in a brutal manner would become bakeneko and curse that human. The stories of bakeneko are not only about aged cats, but are also sometimes stories of revenge against cruel humans.|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship between theory and practice was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B. Coxe summarizes the problem succinctly: [...] "Not knowing exactly what you want to do or the material you have to do it with, what is the best way of doing it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of identifying buildings by number is a long-standing tradition at MIT. [...] Although sometimes ridiculed {{as evidence of}} an [...] "engineering mindset", and referred to as [...] "a system that disorients outsiders", this system is somewhat logical, and allows members of the MIT community to quickly locate a room they may never have seen before. [...] This numbering system contrasts with the building identification at other nearby colleges. [...] For example, at Harvard University, knowing the location of [...] "Maxwell-Dworkin" [...] will not help in locating [...] "Claverson" [...] or [...] "Larsen" [...] — no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> of experience one may have, one either knows these locations or has no idea where they may be. [...] Under the MIT numbering scheme, community members will know approximately where Building NW95 must be, {{even if they have}} never been near there. [...] Using the MIT building number system, students can even extrapolate a building number for a fanciful future annexation of Cambridge City Hall.|$|E

[...] Additionally, University of California scientists and other independent experts recommend containment measures in urban areas, but that full-scale airplane spraying should be saved for crop areas that agricultural departments are trying to protect in the Central Valley. [...] Oakland city council member Jane Brunner questioned the location of the sprayings in interviews and in her resolution against the efforts, stating, [...] "A very curious issue for me is that they're spraying in Richmond, Berkeley and Oakland, but they are not spraying in Danville, Walnut Creek and out in the valley." [...] In April 2008, Oakland City Attorney John Russo, in an article expressing his reasons for opposing the spray, said that state officials cannot describe the amount of the chemical it will take to rid the state of apple moths, nor <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> the spray will need to be conducted.

2500|$|The biblical {{regulations}} {{state that}} the land was to rest a [...] "Sabbath" [...] when the Children of Israel came to the land God was giving them Israel. The Seder Olam Rabbah (second century AD), stated that this verse meant that the counting was not to start until after the Israelites had gained control of Canaan, which the Seder Olam, based upon received tradition, placed at 14 years after their entry into the land. This interpretation has been largely adopted in later rabbinic scholarship. One reason for this interpretation of the Levitical text was that if counting started before the land was completely conquered, it would require the Israelites to return the land to the Canaanites within 50 years; similar nationalistic concerns {{about the impact of}} the Jubilee on land ownership have been raised by Zionist settlers. From a legal point of view, the Jubilee law effectively banned sale of land as fee simple, and instead land could only be leased for no more than 50 years. The biblical regulations go on to specify that the price of land had to be proportional to <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> remained before the Jubilee, with land being cheaper the closer it is to the Jubilee.|$|E
