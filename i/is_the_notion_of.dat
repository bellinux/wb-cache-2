5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees {{of grief and}} mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Less {{commonly}} encountered <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> difunctional (or regular) relation, {{defined as}} a relation R such that R=RR−1R.|$|E

5000|$|Included within SB7 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "price to beat" [...] or PTB, {{an idea of}} a {{regulated}} rate {{governing the}} pricing behavior of the former utilities.|$|R
50|$|Another clear {{symptom of}} the {{upgrading}} of <b>the</b> imperial status <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor as an incarnation of the majesty of Rome; thus lèse majesté became high treason.|$|R
25|$|A {{specifically}} Christian influence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> the Fall of man, which {{influenced the}} Ainulindalë, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, {{and the fall}} of Númenor.|$|E
25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> pointwise {{convergence}} of sequence of functions extended to sequence of random variables. (Note that random variables themselves are functions).|$|E
25|$|Central to homological algebra <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> exact sequence; {{these can}} be used to perform actual calculations. A {{classical}} tool of homological algebra is that of derived functor; the most basic examples are functors Ext and Tor.|$|E
5000|$|According to David, [...] "The {{basic concept}} was John Ordover's, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> using several already {{existing}} characters. I fleshed out {{the concept and}} created the original characters." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Peter David, {{the basic}} concept for New Frontier was Ordover's, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> using several already {{existing}} characters, with David having fleshed out {{the concept and}} created the original characters.|$|R
50|$|Recurring {{themes in}} his work <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> time, history and the transience of human existence. His artwork also explores the {{relationship}} between the creators and the consumers of art, and combines elements of contemplation with humour and playfulness.|$|R
25|$|The {{time scale}} {{calculus}} is a unification {{of the theory}} of difference equations with that of differential equations, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> hybrid dynamical system.|$|E
25|$|Rational {{singularities}} over a {{field of}} characteristic zero are Cohen–Macaulay. Toric varieties over any field are Cohen–Macaulay. The minimal model program makes prominent use of varieties with klt (Kawamata log terminal) singularities; in characteristic zero, these are rational singularities and hence are Cohen–Macaulay, One successful analog of rational singularities in positive characteristic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> F-rational singularities; again, such singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the notion}} of a {{fundamental}} cycle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a fundamental cutset. By deleting just one edge of the spanning tree, the vertices are partitioned into two disjoint sets. The fundamental cutset is defined as the set of edges that must be removed from the graph G to accomplish the same partition. Thus, each spanning tree defines a set of V−1 fundamental cutsets, one for each edge of the spanning tree.|$|E
5000|$|... “What {{appealed to}} me <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> doing things that {{appeared}} miraculous” Jackson once recalled. [...] "I was interested in spiritualism. I was interested in things like bullet catching, things that really challenged individual sensibilities, that <b>were</b> frightening, on <b>the</b> edge." ...|$|R
50|$|Fundamental to <b>the</b> Fourierian ideal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{collective}} {{living and}} the rational performance of domestic duties. Individual households were seen as both wasteful in terms of duplicated effort performed and isolating of individuals - {{standing in the way}} of true cooperation and social harmony.|$|R
40|$|Complex {{manifolds}} {{modeled after}} projective space or hyperquadrics {{have been studied}} in connection with uniformization, twistor theory, and Fano geometry.

25|$|In Islam, {{the concept}} 'īthār' (إيثار) (altruism) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through {{complete}} forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah {{on the human}} body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance lies in sacrifice {{for the sake of}} the greater good; Islam considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.|$|E
25|$|Another infinitary class {{intermediate}} between Boolean algebras {{and complete}} Boolean algebras <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a sigma-algebra. This is defined analogously to complete Boolean algebras, but with sups and infs limited to countable arity. That is, a sigma-algebra is a Boolean algebra with all countable sups and infs. Because the sups and infs are of bounded cardinality, unlike {{the situation with}} complete Boolean algebras, the Gaifman-Hales result does not apply and free sigma-algebras do exist. Unlike the situation with CABAs however, the free countably generated sigma algebra is not a power set algebra.|$|E
25|$|A central {{feature of}} honing theory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a {{potentiality}} state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that {{participate in the}} encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences {{are relevant to the}} current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.|$|E
5000|$|One of his {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} epistemology <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Introception", or [...] "Knowledge through Identity". This represents a transcendent form of knowledge which is neither conceptual nor empirical. It <b>is</b> perhaps <b>the</b> simplest and clearest definition ever proposed, {{of what many}} mystics have called [...] "Gnosis".|$|R
50|$|Since Carlsson and Stankiewicz {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a Technological Innovation System, an increasing number of scholars have started focusing on dynamics. A recurring theme within their studies has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> cumulative causation, closely related {{to the idea of a}} virtuous circle or vicious circle, by Gunnar Myrdal.|$|R
50|$|The school {{follows the}} International Primary Curriculum, {{and takes a}} {{holistic}} approach to education. Students are encouraged to develop their curiosity, creativity and character through challenging inquiry driven learning. Promoted <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> individual identity and international awareness whilst independence and an aspiration towards lifelong learning are also nurtured.|$|R
25|$|This psycho-physical {{process is}} further linked with {{psychological}} craving, manas (conceit) and ditthi (dogmas, views). One {{of the most}} problematic views according to the Buddha, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a permanent and solid Self or 'pure ego'. This is because in early Buddhist psychology, there is no fixed self (atta; Sanskrit atman) but the delusion of self and clinging to a self concept affects all one's behaviors and leads to suffering. For the Buddha, there is nothing uniform or substantial about a person, only a constantly changing stream of events or processes categorized under five categories called skandhas (heaps, aggregates), which includes the stream of consciousness (Vijñāna-sotam). False belief and attachment to an abiding ego-entity {{is at the root}} of most negative emotions.|$|E
500|$|After {{the finale}} aired, Pinkner stated in an {{interview}} that [...] "one of the things we love to play with <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> choice versus fate/synchronicity. Clearly, what Peter did {{at the end of that}} episode is that he fundamentally changed the future. Our team is [...] on a separate path. It is unlikely that we’ll get to that specific outcome in 2026. But are events like what happened in Detroit inevitable in any version of the future? TBD." ...|$|E
500|$|Another theme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> network {{executives}} forcing ideas onto a show. The {{interaction between}} the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives approach improvements to the show from a business point of view. They try to incorporate {{what they see as}} a rebellious character with the comment [...] "This is popular with the kids", but the viewers later reject the character. The writers themselves are satirized in the episode, and are depicted as lazy and pretentious with few original ideas.|$|E
30|$|In {{this work}} we give a {{comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} time consistency property of dynamic risk and performance measures, focusing on a the discrete time setup. The two key operational concepts used throughout <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LM-measure and <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> update rule that, we believe, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> key tools for studying time consistency in a unified framework.|$|R
50|$|Johnstone’s {{work was}} {{directly}} related to modernism, moving away from direct representation to abstraction. Central to his work <b>was</b> <b>the</b> materiality of paint and its formal attributes. This was heavily influenced {{by the work of}} the Abstract Expressionists in America. Also, key <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unconscious, as inspired by Surrealism.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It <b>is</b> {{shown how}} <b>the</b> theory of {{commutative}} monads provides an axiomatic framework for {{several aspects of}} distribution theory in a broad sense, including probability distributions, physical extensive quantities, and Schwartz distributions of compact support. Among the particular aspects considered here <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> convolution, density, expectation, and conditional probability...|$|R
500|$|Fodor {{has made}} many and varied criticisms of holism. He {{identifies}} the central problem {{with all the}} different notions of holism as {{the idea that the}} determining factor in semantic evaluation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an [...] "epistemic bond". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning holism strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under holism, can only be determined by the totality of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if we follow the holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the totality of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 Bullen made {{a journey}} to Perth's Small Screen Big Picture. On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always interested me <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what fascinated me is the way we arrive at the choices we make. The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E
2500|$|Almost sure {{convergence}} implies {{convergence in probability}} (by Fatou's lemma), {{and hence}} implies convergence in distribution. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> convergence used in the strong law of large numbers.|$|E
