25|$|Most keys have needle springs made of {{phosphor}} bronze, stainless steel, beryllium copper, or a gold alloy. The B thumb keys {{typically have}} <b>flat</b> <b>springs.</b> Phosphor bronze {{is by far}} the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel also makes a good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.|$|E

50|$|In {{one type}} of microswitch, {{internally}} there are two conductive <b>springs.</b> A long <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is hinged {{at one end of}} the switch (the left, in the photograph) and has electrical contacts on the other. A small curved spring, preloaded (i.e., compressed during assembly) so it attempts to extend itself (at the top, just right of center in the photo), is connected between the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> near the contacts and a fulcrum near the midpoint of the <b>flat</b> <b>spring.</b> An actuator nub presses on the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> near its hinge point.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves {{downward}} {{the upward}} {{force of the}} curved spring reduces causing the motion to accelerate {{even in the absence}} of further motion of the actuator until the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> impacts the normally-open contact. Even though the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> unflexes as it moves downward, the switch is designed so the net effect is acceleration. This [...] "over-center" [...] action produces a very distinctive clicking sound and a very crisp feel.|$|R

5000|$|Spring forceps {{are small}} {{scissors}} used mostly in eye surgery or microsurgery. The handles end in <b>flat</b> <b>springs</b> {{connected with a}} pivot joint. The cutting action is achieved by pressing the handles together. As the pressure is released, the spring action opens the jaws.|$|E
50|$|Steering is by cam and lever. Rear {{suspension}} is by half-elliptical, {{and practically}} <b>flat,</b> <b>springs</b> mounted beneath the axle and on rubber pads. Front springs are splayed. Single-acting hydraulic shock absorbers {{are employed in}} front and back. Bumpers are supplied fore and aft {{and there is a}} folding luggage grid.|$|E
5000|$|Because the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is {{anchored}} and strong in tension the curved spring cannot {{move it to}} the right. The curved spring presses, or pulls, the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> upward, that is away, from the anchor point. Owing to the geometry, the upward force {{is proportional to the}} displacement which decreases as the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves downward. (Actually, the force is proportional to the sine of the angle, which is approximately proportional to the angle for small angles.) ...|$|R
50|$|As the {{actuator}} depresses it flexes the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> {{while the}} curved spring keeps the electrical contacts touching. When the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is flexed enough {{it will provide}} sufficient force to compress the curved spring and the contacts will begin to move.|$|R
50|$|In the {{actuated}} position the curved spring provides some upward force. If the actuator is released this will move the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> upward. As the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves, the force from the curved spring increases. This results in acceleration until the normally-closed contacts are hit. Just {{as in the}} downward direction, the switch is designed so that the curved spring {{is strong enough to}} move the contacts, even if the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> must flex, because the actuator does not move during the changeover.|$|R
50|$|After {{years with}} very little {{innovations}} as the Swiss lever escapement is used in almost all mechanical watches, watchmakers have designed several new types of escapements {{since the beginning of}} the 21st century; Parmigiani Fleurier with its Genequand escapement or Ulysse Nardin with its Ulysse Anchor escapement have taken advantage of the properties of silicon <b>flat</b> <b>springs.</b> The independent watchmaker, De Bethune, has developed a concept where a magnet makes a resonator vibrate at high frequency, replacing the traditional balance spring.|$|E

Maximum static deflection was found to be 13. 43 ?m is under the gravitational force. Furthermore, free vibration characteristics of the selected spring are presented to determine the resonance frequency. Natural frequency of 18. 56 Hz was obtained.

5000|$|The Brögger System is {{a unique}} key {{mechanism}} which does not use the traditional key and mounting rod system of other flute manufacturers. Miyazawa claims it [...] "features an innovative pinless mechanism allowing precise adjustments and balance of the spring tension of each individual key, resulting in a more even, efortless feel for the flutist." [...] Unlike the Brögger System, traditional flutes need to use <b>flat</b> <b>springs</b> which contact {{the body of the}} flute causing friction and wear. The system eliminates this extra wear and tear.|$|E
5000|$|Notwithstanding {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success the Sharps-Borchardt is admired for its strength and accuracy: reputed {{to be one of}} the strongest if not the strongest rifle action ever built before the latter 20th century. The gun was revolutionary at its time for its use of coil springs as opposed to <b>flat</b> <b>springs.</b> [...] These guns were popular among long-range shooters and Creedmore Match competitors. Many were rechambered for use as small bore varmint rifles.

40|$|Clinical {{assessment}} of the osseous anchorage of total hip replacement (THR) is challenging. Implant loosening is the main complication in THR, though possibilities to diagnose a loosened component are limited. Hence, a novel acoustic-mechanical concept was developed, based on oscillators inside the THR, which excite a membrane in bony contact. The oscillators consist of a <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> and an attached magnetic sphere. The excitation is realized using an alternating electromagnetic field. The excited oscillators produce sound, which varies according {{to the extent of}} loosening. The sound can be detected by an externally applied accelerometer. Using laser beam melting, filigree structures of the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> and membranes as one component could be manufactured successfully...|$|R

40|$|Japanese cedar {{wood was}} {{moderately}} compressed by 50 % in the radial (R) direction. The compressed wooden blocks were glued into {{the form of}} a beam with R directions aligned in the longitudinal direction of the beam. The compressed wooden beam (CR) showed excellent ductility and elasticity comparable to synthetic rubbers. The elastic deflection of the CR was further increased when the tensile side was reinforced by a thin compressed wooden plate (CL), because this ensured that the CR was always in a compressed state while tensile stress was supported by the CL. The CR + CL composite exhibited large deflections ten times greater than that of the original cedar lumber, a Charpy value corresponding to the high amount of energy absorbed in impact bending comparable to that of densified wood, and a large critical bending work exceeding that of uncompressed wood {{in the direction of the}} fiber. The soft and durable nature of the composite beam was attributed to the softness and elasticity of the moderately compressed wood, in which the folded cell walls behaved as <b>flat</b> <b>springs...</b>|$|E

The seismic receiver damping is a coil form where k of the spool, in which surface Foucault currents are induced.
