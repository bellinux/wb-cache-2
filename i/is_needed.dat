5|$|During the {{recovery}} phase intravenous fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E

5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} when it <b>is</b> <b>needed,</b> {{pure iron}} {{is produced in}} the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{concentrated}} {{sources of}} oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to trigger combustion.

Temazepam formulations containing 20mg or greater of the drug are placed on List 1, thus requiring doctors to write prescriptions in the List 1 format.|$|E
5|$|Most weekend SLE trains {{also run}} local {{westbound}} in the morning, then express in the afternoon, stopping only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street. Eastbound service is reversed. This is because Branford, Madison, and Clinton only have platforms on the eastbound track, and thus switching <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to platform a westbound train.|$|E

5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|Policy: Social {{marketing}} {{programs can}} {{do well in}} motivating individual behavior change, but {{that is difficult to}} sustain unless the environment they're in supports that change for the long run.

50|$|Working mostly separately, Lynen and Bloch both {{discovered}} {{the steps that}} created squalene and turned the squalene into cholesterol. Initially, Lynen found that acetate activated by Coenzyme A <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> to start the process.
