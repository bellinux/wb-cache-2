50|$|Perlan (English: The Pearl) is a {{landmark}} building in Reykjavík, {{the capital of}} Iceland. It is 25.7 metres (84.3 ft) high. It was originally designed by Ingimundur Sveinsson.

50|$|In some cases, {{this type}} of {{reaction}} is intentionally encouraged. For example, low-cost household batteries typically contain carbon-zinc cells. As part of a closed circuit (the electron pathway), the zinc within the cell will corrode preferentially (the ion pathway) as {{an essential part of}} the battery producing electricity. Another example is the cathodic protection of buried or submerged structures as well as <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> In this case, sacrificial anodes work as part of a galvanic couple, promoting corrosion of the anode, while protecting the cathode metal.|$|E

The grouping together of the boiler and <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> reduces the need for pumps and reduces the amount of pipework needed. Shorter pipe runs also reduce heat loss. The oil-fired boilers originally used became obsolete due to the 1973 oil crisis, the year after the tower opened. The flats now have electric heaters and the plant room although disused, still houses most of the now defunct plant. A planning application was made to convert it into a penthouse apartment but was refused by the local council.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of dynamic performance evaluation for sensible thermal energy storage (TES), with a specific focus on <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> Â We derive transient performance metrics from second law principles {{that can be used}} to guide real-time decision-making aimed toward improving demand response. Â We show how the transient nature of the metrics can be used not only to influence the values of control variables within the system, but also to mitigate adverse effects of disturbances during operation. Â To evaluate these metrics in the context of TES in <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> a thermal stratification model is needed. Â We derive a reduced order model which allows the simulation of tank thermal stratification during all modes of system operation. Â The proposed performance metrics are analyzed in simulation using the dynamic tank model. The results highlight key trade-offs captured by the metrics that can be incorporated into future optimal control design for sensible TES systems. Â...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} characterising the performance of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> {{in terms of their}} temperature distribution. The change in exergy from the stratified state to the delivery state depends on the stored energy and the stratification. lt can thus be used to define the storage efficiency for sensible heat storage devices. The effect of temperature distribution, delivery temperature and tank cross section on exergy is investigated. The advantage that stratification offers over a mixed tank is examined in terms of the storage efficiency and overall solar water heating system performance. Exergy is used to assess the operation of mantle heat exchangers in solar water heating systems and it is shown that an exergy, rather than energy, should be used to ascertain the performance of such heat exchangers. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{industrial}} model solar water heating {{system is designed}} and installed, to heat and supply 110 000 liters of hot water at 85 degrees C per day for an egg powder making plant. It consists of a solar collector field (2560 m(2)), four thermally insulated <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> (57. 5 m(3) capacity each) and the heat distribution system with electrically operated pumps and pneumatic valves for circulation of water.

Performance studies conducted on the various subsystems and on the system as a whole revealed that it is delivering the designed thermal output, and the net savings in furnace oil consumption is 78 % on an annual basis.

40|$|By {{introducing}} a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> {{in a space}} heating system including a heat pump, the system gains flexibility towards the electricity grid. Electricity {{can be converted to}} heat at favourable times and used when required. Model predictive control of such a system requires a controller model which is able to represent the non-linear behaviour of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> In this contribution model predictive control of a building with heat pump and <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> with local electricity production, using a novel iterative linear optimal control approach is compared to the traditional ideal stratification formulation. Although the difference in model mismatch in a single open loop simulation is significant, the difference in total simulated energy cost or thermal discomfort when using model predictive control is limited due to the updating of the model states. As the ideal stratified linear program is solved significantly faster it can be used in simulated model predictive control. However for real-world model predictive control, where the solution time of both methods are acceptable, the iterative linear program results in a 2 % decrease of energy costs while maintaining thermal comfort. status: publishe...|$|R
