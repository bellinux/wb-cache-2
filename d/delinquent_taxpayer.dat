50|$|If an {{individual}} or a business refuses to pay back taxes, tax liens are a last resort to force repayment. A tax lien is a legal claim by a government entity against a noncompliant taxpayer’s assets. To {{get rid of a}} lien, the taxpayer must pay what he or she owes, get the debt dismissed in bankruptcy court or reach an offer in compromise with the tax authorities. Federal and state governments may place tax liens for unpaid federal or state income taxes, while local governments may place tax liens for unpaid local income or property taxes.If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can then use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer’s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles and real property) in order to collect the money it is owed. Tax liens are publicly recorded and may be reported to credit agencies. These two features of tax liens effectively prevent the sale or refinancing of assets to which liens have been attached, and prevent the <b>delinquent</b> <b>taxpayer</b> from borrowing money.|$|E

50|$|In 1872, President Ulysses S.

This was the first restriction of the federal moiety system that had been authorized by Congress in 1853. The Revenue Act of 1872 was considered a first step towards Civil Service Reform by President Ulysses S. Grant. The Revenue Act restricted the U.S. Treasury Department to contract {{to no more than}} three informers to collect taxes from <b>delinquent</b> <b>taxpayers</b> or businesses. The law was initially designed to prevent or reduce the number of false accusations and blackmail by the informers appointed by the Secretary of Treasury to collect taxes.

40|$|Local {{governments in}} the United States still rely on real {{property}} taxation as a dominant source of revenue. Rather than establish a clear, uniform model of tax collection, the federal government allows each state to develop its own form of governance, resulting in over 150 different tax collection systems within the United States. Unfortunately, not all property taxes are paid, and the county government must seize the <b>delinquent</b> <b>taxpayer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s property {{in order to fulfill}} the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s obligation. The Constitution requires the government to give the <b>delinquent</b> <b>taxpayer</b> notice of the pending action. Although recently it appears that the Supreme Court has been increasing the due process requirements for notice before a tax foreclosure sale, the Court has never clearly stated a due process standard for what constitutes constitutionally adequate notice. One of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s most recent attempts to provide guidelines for sufficient notice before a tax foreclosure proceeding was Jones v. Flowers, in which the Court sought to answer the question whether due process requires a state to take additional reasonable steps to provide a property owner with notice of a tax sale when a certified mailing notice of the sale is returned with the state 2 ̆ 2 unclaimed. 2 ̆ 2 This note explores the historical development of the due process notice requirement for tax foreclosure procedures in the United States Supreme Court and Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s development of the notice requirement. Next, this note discusses the Jones case itself, in which in essence, the Court fails to consider the interests of the state in requiring additional steps after the post office returns attempted notice 2 ̆ 2 unclaimed 2 ̆ 2 without providing some indication of what direction the state should follow to meet the due process requirement. Finally, it analyzes some of the problems with the Jones case as well as some questions the Court leaves unanswered and outlines some of the immediate effects the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision has within the state of Arkansas...|$|E
