500|$|In 1935 the {{colliery}} {{was acquired}} by Manchester Collieries. It had large reserves of high-quality coal in the Roger mine below the seams already exploited, and although the mines dipped steeply, was a dry and relatively gas-free pit. Manchester Collieries initially improved coal screening but had plans to develop the colliery and maximise output to 4000 long tons (4480 short tons) per day, involving the complete replacement of the surface works. The Parker shaft was deepened to [...] between 1944 and 1948, and winding installed to accommodate 12-long ton (13.44-short ton) capacity skips. The transport of coal underground was improved by the installation of three-ton mine cars hauled by a battery-powered locomotive and a system of conveyors. A [...] reinforced concrete winding tower was built to house a Koepe-type <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> built by Metropolitan-Vickers.|$|E
2500|$|The ride {{consists}} of [...] of track. The ride features two sections of launch track which power the trains to speeds of , respectively. These launch tracks are {{powered by a}} <b>Friction</b> <b>Wheel</b> Hydraulic system which {{consists of}} a series of high speed drive tires used in succession to propel the trains forward. Riders will experience between 2.5 and 3 times the force of gravity throughout the ride. One cycle of the ride lasts approximately 30 seconds, allowing Jet Rescue to cater for up to 800 riders per hour.|$|E
2500|$|Riders board {{one of two}} trains, each {{featuring}} 16 jet skis. After being {{cleared to}} dispatch, the ride uses a hydraulic <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> mechanism to launch riders {{out of the station}} at a speed of [...] The ride then enters a wide, highly banked helix to the right before perpendicularly crossing over the launch track at a height of [...] The ride then dips to the left and an on-ride photo is taken. The track then levels out and enters a tunnel parallel with the station. Upon entering the tunnel, another set of friction wheels are activated to launch the riders to the faster speed of [...] The opposite end of the tunnel is covered in mist preventing riders from seeing the approaching track. The instant that the train emerges from the tunnel it banks sharply to the right. This is followed by four quick, directional changing turns between rocks and past an animatronic sea lion. The track then elevates off the ground level to cross over the track a second time before entering the brake runs. The ride slowly makes its way into the unload station where riders disembark their jet skis and exit via the merchandise shop. On-ride photos and Jet Rescue merchandise can be purchased here.|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{roller coaster}} wheels {{are made with}} {{polyurethane}} which increase ride efficiency and have no chemical bond to the rail. Steel roller coaster wheel assemblies can change slightly with different manufacturers. A {{good example of this}} is the difference between B&M's track style and Arrow's. On B&M's coasters, the trains have their side <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> {{on the outside of the}} track, allowing the rails to connect from their inner edges. On Arrow coasters, the train has side <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> on the inside of the track, so the rail connectors must [...] "wrap around" [...] the outside of the rail and under the train.|$|R
50|$|Another type of launch is by <b>friction</b> <b>wheels.</b> The launch track {{consists}} {{of a series of}} horizontal tires that pinch the brake fins {{on the underside of the}} train. One example of this is the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure.|$|R
50|$|Today's modern roller coasters, both wooden and steel, {{have the}} same basic design of wheel {{assembly}}. Each wheel assembly has three wheels. Underfriction, or up-stop, wheels; tractor, or running, wheels; and side <b>friction</b> <b>wheels.</b> All of these help the train move safely and smoothly.|$|R
50|$|A <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> launch {{consists}} {{of a series of}} high speed drive tires used in succession to propel the train forward. An example of a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> launch is the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure.|$|E
50|$|Most paper folders push {{paper into}} the machine by use of a {{friction}} wheel; this grabs paper using friction. Friction-feed paper folders do not work well with glossy paper as the <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> slips on the paper's surface. Pneumatic paper folders are preferable for folding glossy paper.|$|E
5000|$|Internal belt-drive ceiling fans. These {{were also}} similar in design to {{gear-drive}} and friction-drive fans; however, {{instead of a}} rubber <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> or toothed gear, a small rubber belt linked the motor to the flywheel. The most notable internal belt-drive ceiling fan was a model sold by Toastmaster.|$|E
50|$|The Daimler Company began {{production}} of motor boats in 1897 from its manufacturing base in Coventry. The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of petroleum and air was ignited by compression into a heated platinum tube. The engine gave about six horse-power. The petrol was fed by air pressure {{to a large}} surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes. Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two bevel <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> which engaged with two larger bevel <b>friction</b> <b>wheels,</b> the intermediate shaft being temporarily disconnected for this purpose. It was not until 1901 that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats.|$|R
50|$|In 1886 Albone applied his {{knowledge}} of low <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> to produce a strong, light weight pony trap. This had a steel axle with ball bearings, and bicycle type steel and rubber wheels. The result was smooth and fast, and the pony trap was popular. The axles were also sold separately, to the Great Northern Railway company.|$|R
50|$|Wheels {{have low}} bearing {{friction}} and pneumatic tyres give low rolling <b>friction.</b> Steel <b>wheels</b> on steel tracks are lower still.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{and some}} countries, a Street Hawk [...] "stunt bike" [...] was {{released}} by ERTL. Roughly {{the same size as}} standard miniature ERTL vehicles, the toy had a plastic rider, on the motorcycle powered by a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel.</b> The packaging suggested various stunts that the owner could attempt to perform with the toy.|$|E
5000|$|Rockin' Tug is a flat ride {{manufactured}} by Zamperla. The ride is manufactured in both traveling and park versions. It {{is the first}} of a line of new [...] "halfpiperides". Zamperla's Disk-O is another popular ride from that [...] "family". The difference is that the Tug has a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel,</b> while the Disk-O is powered driven.|$|E
50|$|Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821 for {{mathematical}} achievements, he had by {{that time}} invented a logometer (an early slide rule), {{and went on to}} design and patent a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> and a clock escapement. These achievements led him into friendship with George Stephenson, and he {{played a role in the}} survey and engineering of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, particularly the crossing of Chat Moss. However, he resigned as a director of the line shortly before its completion.|$|E
50|$|Most Vekoma Junior Coasters {{consist of}} a single train made up of several cars, each with a single row of riders. Some, such as Flight of the Hippogriff at Islands of Adventure in Orlando, operate with two trains. There are three basic models (85 meters, 207 meters, and 335 meters), {{although}} Vekoma also provides custom models. Instead of the chain lift found on most roller coasters, Vekoma Junior Coasters usually use <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> to carry the train up the lift hill.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} if Leonardo ever built a working {{prototype}} of this instrument. The first similar instrument actually to be constructed was the Geigenwerk of 1575 by Hans Heyden, a German instrument inventor. However, Geigenwerk {{is not based on}} Leonardo's designs. It uses several <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> instead of a friction belt to vibrate the strings, and requires two people to play it: one to turn the crank to put the rosined wheels in motion, and the other to work the keys.|$|R
50|$|On 15 October 1909, the railcar ran {{under its}} own power for the first time, {{carrying}} 32 people around the factory. The vehicle was 40 ft (12.2m) long and 10 ft (3m) wide, and with a 20 hp (15 kW) petrol engine, had a speed of 22 mph (35 km/h). The transmission was electric, with the petrol engine driving a generator, and electric motors located on both bogies. This generator also supplied power to the gyro motors and the air compressor. The balancing system used a pneumatic servo, rather than the <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> used in the earlier model.|$|R
50|$|Fueled by the Springfield Armory, the City of Springfield {{quickly became}} a {{national}} center for invention and development. In 1819 Thomas Blanchard developed a special lathe for the consistent mass production of rifle stocks. Thomas Blanchard worked at Springfield Armory for 5 years. The lathe enabled an unskilled workman to quickly and easily turn out identical irregular shapes. The large drum turned two wheels: a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> that followed {{the contours of the}} metal rifle pattern, and the cutting wheel that imitated the movements of the <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> to make an exact replica of the pattern in wood. In the 1840s the old flintlock gave way to a percussion ignition system that increased the reliability and simplicity of longarms.The Springfield Armory was largely involved in the growth and influence of the Industrial Revolution. Much of this grew out of the military's fascination with interchangeable parts, which was based on the theory that {{it would be easier to}} simply replace firearm parts than make battlefield repairs. Mass production of truly interchangeable parts demanded greater use of machines, improved gauging, quality control, and division of labor; all characteristics of the Industrial Revolution. From these individual components, the concept of the assembly line was devised.|$|E
5000|$|Other, usually older bicycle speedometers are cable {{driven from}} one or other wheel, as in the {{motorcycle}} speedometers described above. These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate. The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use {{of the presence of}} e.g. a hub brake, cylinder gear or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> device that pushes against {{the outer edge of the}} rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tyre itself. The former type are quite reliable and low maintenance but need a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tyre size, whereas the latter require little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tyres, the [...] "distance" [...] covered in each wheel rotation by a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.|$|E
50|$|The ride {{consists}} of 560 m of track. The ride features two sections of launch track which power the trains to speeds of 65 and 70 km/h, respectively. These launch tracks are {{powered by a}} <b>Friction</b> <b>Wheel</b> Hydraulic system which {{consists of}} a series of high speed drive tires used in succession to propel the trains forward. Riders will experience between 2.5 and 3 times the force of gravity throughout the ride. One cycle of the ride lasts approximately 30 seconds, allowing Jet Rescue to cater for up to 800 riders per hour.|$|E
50|$|Lift hills usually {{propel the}} train {{to the top of}} the ride via one of two methods: a chain lift {{involving}} a long, continuous chain which trains hook on to and are carried to the top; or a drive tire system in which multiple motorized tires (known as <b>friction</b> <b>wheels)</b> push the train upwards. A typical chain lift consists of a heavy piece of metal called a chain dog, which is mounted onto the underside of one of the cars which make up the train. This is in place to line up with the chain on the lift hill.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wheelset {{driving system}} is a key {{function}} unit of CNC underfloor wheelset lathe, its properties and accuracy play a decisive role for working accuracy of the wheelset (trains, subways etc) tread. At first, it analyses the force of cutting point for wheelsets, and then, contact mechanics analysis and delivering power analysis are established based on <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> and wheelsets’ actual contact mechanics equations on wheelset driving system in this paper. At last, in order to analyze wheelset driving system’s rigidity and degree of deformation with loading condition, modeling analysis and static force analysis are {{set up in the}} finite element software after building wheelset driving system’s three-dimensional model...|$|R
50|$|The car had an {{air-cooled}} 8 hp V-twin cylinder Chater-Lea engine {{driving the}} rear wheels through a two speed transmission with top gear being direct and the lower gear a chain reduction system. Reverse gear was obtained by diverting the drive through two <b>friction</b> <b>wheels,</b> one {{on the front of}} the propeller shaft and a larger one connected to the low gear countershaft in the transmission. The footbrake operated on {{the rear wheels}} with internal expanding shoes and the handbrake controlled a leather faced band contracting onto the main drive shaft. The final drive to the rear axle used a worm drive reduction system.|$|R
50|$|After {{exiting the}} station, the train turns right and {{is taken up}} a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> lift hill to a height of 13 m. A small drop follows the lift hill that then leads into two {{downward}} helices. The train then dips diagonally under the lift hill before elevating and approaching {{the back end of}} the station and passing over top. The train then runs back parallel with the lift hill before entering two separate helices and entering the brake run. The train then returns to the station where riders dismount and exit back into the Kids' WB Fun Zone.|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} handle {{passes through a}} water tank {{at the front of}} the car. The radiator is fixed immediately above this tank. Its sides are of ribbed aluminium castings connected by finned tubes run horizontally across the front of the car. The ribbed aluminium castings inspired Daimler's flutes. The water circulating centrifugal pump is driven by a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> pressing against the flywheel. Two pressure lubricators feed the pump's bearings. The design ensures natural circulation would continue if the pump were out of order. There is a sheet metal casing beneath the engine as a dust-shield.|$|E
50|$|By {{varying the}} {{resistance}} on a flywheel {{attached to the}} pedals. The resistance is controlled by a knob, wheel or lever that the rider operates, causing the flywheel brake (a common bicycle brake, a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel,</b> a magnetic eddy-current brake, a viscoelastic fluid brake, or a strap running around the flywheel) to tighten. On most bikes the brake can be adjusted from completely loose, providing no resistance to pedaling beyond the inertia of the flywheel, to so tight that the rider can not move the pedals. Usually riders who can't pedal at the resistance called out by the instructor are encouraged to ride at a level at which they feel comfortable yet challenged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 We {{introduce}} a methodology for concurrent design that considers {{the allocation of}} tolerances and manufacturing processes for minimum cost. Cost is approximated as a hyperbolic function over tolerance, and worst-case stack-up tolerance is assumed. Two simulated annealing techniques are introduced to solve the optimization problem. The first assumes independent, unordered, manufacturing processes and usesa Monte-Carlo simulation; the second assumes well known individual process cost functions which can be manipulated to create a single continuous function of cost versus tolerance with discontinuous derivatives solved with a continuous simulated annealing algorithm. An example utilizing a system of <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> over the manufacturing processes of turning, grinding, and saw cutting bar stock demonstrates excellent results. 2 ̆...|$|R
50|$|The {{aluminum}} disk was twenty-two {{inches in}} diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just {{over a quarter of}} an inch in thickness. The traversing wheel was eighteen {{inches in diameter}} with a 1.5 in working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was clamped between cast iron members supporting the strawboard rings inside and clamping them sideways. This fibrous <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in swinging boxes so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum-faced driving disk, which is motor driven.|$|E
50|$|Riders {{are seated}} in a dragon-themed train in pairs with a lap bar restraint. The train is taken up a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> lift hill to a height of 13 m. At {{the top of this}} hill, riders can see across Universal Studios Singapore's lagoon and towards othe areas of the park. A small drop follows the lift hill that then leads into two {{downward}} helices. The train then dips diagonally under the lift hill before elevating and approaching the back end of the station and passing over top. The train then runs back parallel with the lift hill before entering two separate helices and entering the brake run. Throughout several times the train passes themed elements including Shrek's Swamp, a forest and Medieval areas.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 the {{colliery}} {{was acquired}} by Manchester Collieries. It had large reserves of high-quality coal in the Roger mine below the seams already exploited, and although the mines dipped steeply, was a dry and relatively gas-free pit.

40|$|International audienceBearings, <b>friction</b> <b>wheels,</b> cams etc. {{are widely}} {{employed}} elements in machine construction. The modeling {{of the dynamics}} of rolling friction plays therefore {{a crucial role in the}} simulation and optimization of such systems. This paper describes a recently developed transient-rolling-friction model with its application to different generic dynamical systems, to simulate the effects of rolling friction or traction on the dynamics of mechanical systems. The results, which are expressed in terms of the complex stiffness arising in the rolling-contact patches, show that the behavior depends on both the amplitude and the frequency of oscillation. For low amplitudes and frequencies, the behavior is quasi linear. For increasing amplitudes and frequencies, however, strong nonlinearities appear, leading to complex behavior...|$|R
50|$|All modern roller {{coasters}} have up-stop wheels that hug {{the bottom of}} the rail. As their name implies, they prevent the train from coming up off the track. Side <b>friction</b> <b>wheels</b> hug the sides of the rail, either the outside or inside, depending on the track manufacturer. These wheels help the train stay {{in the center of the}} two rails to keep the train from derailing. The last wheel set are called tractor wheels, or running wheels. Tractor wheels have a simple but important purpose. These wheels bear the weight of the train on the track, keeping the train running on the track. Tractor wheels may lift off the track in when the vertical g-force is zero or negative, but the up-stop wheels keep the train from coming completely off the rails.|$|R
