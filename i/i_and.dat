5|$|After World War <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> {{with another}} European war looming, {{leaders from the}} {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize about how {{to cooperate with the}} government to avoid the difficulties of World War I. Holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable, they devised a plan of civilian alternative service, based on experience gained by American Friends Service Committee work in Europe during and after World War <b>I</b> <b>and</b> forestry service done by Russian Mennonites in lieu of military service in Tsarist Russia.|$|E

5|$|Although the UN aerial {{reconnaissance}} observed on November 27 that the Chinese {{forces on the}} UN right flank were moving rapidly into the Eighth Army's rear, Walker still ordered {{the rest of the}} Eighth Army to continue the offensive north. Convinced that the collapse of the ROK II Corps was merely a small counterattack by the Chinese, Walker ordered the US <b>I</b> <b>and</b> IX Corps to shift eastward in order to cover the ROK II Corps' sector. By that time, however, the US <b>I</b> <b>and</b> IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses from the Chinese counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E

5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

All the examined species were clearly identified using four primers (OPB- 09, OPB- 10, OPB- 11 and OPB- 12) out of twelve primers tested. The {{total number of}} amplification products produced with these primers was (125) and the fragment size ranged between 300 to 1500 bp. Primer OPB- 10 produced {{the highest number of}} bands (38).
