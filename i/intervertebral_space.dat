40|$|Spondylosis deformans and diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{are usually}} incidental ﬁndings {{and in most}} dogs are either asymptomatic or associated with mild clinical signs. Severe spondylosis defor- mans and DISH can result in complete bony fusion of consecutive vertebral segments. One of the recognised complications following vertebral fusion in human patients is the development of adjacent segment disease, which is deﬁned as degenerative changes, most commonly degenerative intervertebral disc disease, in the mobile vertebral segment neighboring a region of complete vertebral fusion. A similar syndrome following cervical fusion in dogs has been termed the domino effect. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the hypothesis that vertebral fusion occurring secondary to spondylosis deformans or DISH in dogs would protect fused <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spaces</b> from undergoing degeneration, but result in adjacent segment disease at neighbouring unfused <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spaces.</b> Eight dogs with clinical signs of thora- columbar myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar vertebral column, and spondylosis deformans or DISH producing fusion of ≥ 2 consecutive <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spaces</b> were evaluated.

40|$|Objective　To {{analyze and}} compare the {{long-term}} therapeutic effect and image changes of conservative therapy versus lumbar discectomy for lumbar disc herniation to provide valid reference for its clinical treatment. Methods　The clinical data from 182 patients with single-level lumbar disc herniation, who were treated from January 1983 to June 2008 and followed-up for more than 10 years, were analyzed retrospectively. These patients were divided into conservative treatment (CT) group (n= 73) with a mean follow-up time of 17. 61 ± 3. 87 years, and surgery group (n= 109) with a mean follow up time of 17. 17 ± 3. 47 years. In the CT group, 49 patients were male, 24 female; there were 44 patients with L 4 -L 5 disc herniation, and 29 L 5 -S 1 disc herniation. In 109 patients in the surgery group, 71 were male, 38 female; 68 had L 4 -L 5 disc herniation, 41 had L 5 -S 1 disc herniation, {{and all of them}} received lumbar discectomy. The long-term therapeutic effects were reviewed and compared retrospectively in the two groups, including clinical manifestations, image changes, neurofunctional evaluation, height of morbid <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space,</b> adjacent segment <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space</b> and the incidence of cephalad adjacent segment degeneration. Results　Eight of 73 patients received lumbar spinal canal decompression because of intermittent claudication in the CT group, and 13 in surgery group underwent resurgery for recurrent lumbar disc herniation. At final follow up, the height of morbid <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space</b> (0. 62 ± 0. 15 cm) in surgery group was significantly lower than that in CT group (0. 69 ± 0. 13 cm, P < 0. 05), the Oswestry score (23. 9 %± 6. 3 % in surgery group, 23. 3 %± 6. 5 % in CT group) and height of adjacent segment <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space</b> (0. 83 ± 0. 11 cm in surgery group, and 0. 82 ± 0. 11 cm in CT group) were statistically compared, and no significant difference was found between the two groups.

According to UCLA criteria, cephalad adjacent segment degeneration occurred in 8 patients (12 %) of CT group, and in 23 (22 %) of surgery group, and the incidence of cephalad adjacent segment degeneration was significantly higher in surgery group than in CT group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions　The height of morbid <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space</b> is remarkably lower, and less of them trigger clinical symptom from adjacent segment degeneration in patients treated with lumbar discectomy.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} postural reduction and instrumental reduction {{in the treatment of}} thoracolumbar and lumbar vertebra fracture in 40 patients. Under general anaesthesia, postural reduction in a stretching prone position was first performed. Instrumental reduction and fixation were then conducted. Radiographs were made after each reduction. Comparisons between the two films and the fracture films were made based on the changes in prevertebral height of both the fractured vertebra and the adjacent superior and inferior <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spaces.</b> It was found that the recovery of the prevertebral height in postural and instrumental reductions was basically identical. The recovery of the prevertebral height in the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spaces</b> was more significant in instrumental reduction. Both reductions were ineffective in patients whose compression of the diseased vertebra was {{more than two-thirds of the}} normal. In cases of lower lumbar vertebra fractures, the effect of both reductions was unsatisfactory. Our findings indicated that the effectiveness of the reduction of vertebra fracture depends on the quantitative change of the spongy bone of the injured vertebra. Instrumental reduction only exerts an indirect tension.

40|$|Background and Aims: Efficacy of {{epidural}} analgesia depends on {{placement of the}} epidural catheter at the appropriate level.

Ultrasonography (USG) is an alternative technique but requires training and may increase procedure time. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the accuracy of ultrasound (US) imaging with manual palpation for locating the intervertebral level. Material and Methods: We included postoperative adult patients without an epidural catheter who were scheduled to have a chest radiograph in the recovery room. A radio-opaque marker was placed at random at an <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space</b> along the thoracic or lumbar spine of the patient (in the field of the chest radiograph). The level of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space</b> corresponding to the radio-opaque marker was determined by palpation technique by one anesthetist. Two other anesthetists (A and B) blinded to the result of manual palpation, independently used USG to determine the level of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>space.</b> A consultant radiologist assessed the radiographs to determine the correct position of the marker, which was judged to be the accurate space. Results: We recruited a total of 71 patients, of which 64 patients were included in the final analysis. Accurate identification by manual method was 31 / 64 (48 %), by US A was 27 / 64 (42 %) and by US B was 22 / 64 (34 %).

A total of 96 radiographic images from the baseline measurements, axial and anterior lean tractions in 32 asymptomatic subjects were digitized for further analysis. The intra- and inter-examiner reliabilities for measuring the <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spaces</b> were in good ranges (ICCs = 0. 928 - 0. 942). With the application of anterior lean traction, the statistical increases were detected both in anterior and in posterior disc spaces compared to the baseline (0. 29 mm and 0. 24 mm; both P < 0. 01) and axial traction (0. 16 mm and 0. 35 mm; both P < 0. 01). The greater <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spaces</b> obtained during anterior lean traction might be associated with the more even distribution of traction forces over the anterior and posterior neck structures. The neck extension moment through mandible that generally occurred in the axial traction could be counteracted by the downward force of head weight during anterior lean traction.
