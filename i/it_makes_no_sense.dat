On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, {{which in turn is}} why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E

500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting {{to say one}} thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E

2500|$|This {{interpretation}} (and {{the criticism}} of Wittgenstein that arises from it) {{is based on a}} complete misreading, however, because Wittgenstein's argument {{has nothing to do with}} the fallibility of human memory, but rather concerns the intelligibility of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It is not that we will not in fact remember the sensation correctly, but rather that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to talk of our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case.

2500|$|Although Wittgenstein {{certainly}} {{argues that}} the notion of private language is incoherent, because {{of the way in which}} the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. [...] This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of [...] "meaning". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent [...] "sample" [...] or [...] "object" [...] that we can call [...] "meaning". Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a social event; meaning happens between language users. As a consequence, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to talk about a private language, with words that mean something in the absence of other users of the language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{comparison}} {{was also}} made by other critics such as journalist Stephen Totilo and IGN's Cindy White. Totilo wrote that HAL was {{an influence on}} GLaDOS' [...] "psychotic breakdown" [...] seen {{near the end of}} the first Portal title. White wrote HAL and GLaDOS were similar due to both having [...] "a calm, almost childlike, demeanor" [...] which [...] "hides nefarious intentions". She added that [...] "the prospect of being shut down causes them to act out in deadly ways". [...] GamesRadar editor Tyler Wilde stated that while the staff of GamesRadar loves GLaDOS, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to insert a personality core into a robot. He suggested that the scientists either never read 2001: A Space Odyssey, or read it too much. Empire Online listed her as the 12th-best video game character of all time, describing her acts as [...] "HAL-like conduct". Writer Stephen Totilo alluded the final battle with GLaDOS to the scene of David from 2001 disabling HAL, with both scenes involving de-evolving the respective characters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{argument}} from grammar uses traditional grammar to support substance theory. For example, the sentence [...] "Snow is white" [...] contains a grammatical subject [...] "snow" [...] and the predicate [...] "is white", thereby asserting snow is white. The argument holds that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> grammatical <b>sense</b> {{to speak of}} [...] "whiteness" [...] disembodied, without asserting that snow or something else is white. Meaningful assertions are formed by virtue of a grammatical subject, of which properties may be predicated, and in substance theory, such assertions are made with regard to a substance.|$|R

2500|$|Louis Feldman {{states that}} the {{authenticity}} of the Josephus passage on James has been [...] "almost universally acknowledged." [...] Feldman states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus. Feldman states that <b>it</b> would <b>make</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for Origen to show amazement that Josephus did not acknowledge Jesus as Christ (...) , if Josephus had not referred to Jesus at all. Paul L. Maier states that most scholars agree with Feldman's assessment that [...] "few have doubted the genuineness of this passage" [...] Zvi Baras also states that most modern scholars consider the James passage to be authentic.|$|R
2500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was actively}} advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. [...] Quine advanced {{the view that}} in predicate-language sentences like Fx the [...] "x" [...] is {{to be thought of}} as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in [...] "For all things, it is the case that [...] [...] [...]" [...] but the [...] "F" [...] is {{to be thought of as}} an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). [...] For example, it might mean [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{explosion}} of use and interest in SSRIs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focused especially on Prozac, interest grew as well in discontinuation syndromes. In the late 1990s, some investigators thought that symptoms that emerged when antidepressants were discontinued, might mean that antidepressants were causing addiction, and some used the term [...] "withdrawal syndrome" [...] to describe the symptoms. Addictive substances cause physiological dependence, so that drug withdrawal causes suffering. These theories were abandoned, since addiction leads to drug-seeking behavior, and people taking antidepressants do not exhibit drug-seeking behavior. The term [...] "withdrawal syndrome" [...] is no longer used with respect to antidepressants, to avoid confusion with problems that arise from addiction. There are case reports of antidepressants being abused, but these are rare and are mostly limited to antidepressants with stimulant effects and to people who already had a substance use disorder. A 2012 comparison {{of the effects of}} stopping therapy with benzodiazepines and SSRIs argued that because the symptoms are similar, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to say that benzodiazepines are addictive while SSRIs are not. Responses to that review noted that {{there is no evidence that}} people who stop taking SSRIs exhibit drug-seeking behavior while people who stop taking benzodiazepines do, and that the drug classes should be considered differently.|$|E
2500|$|Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, {{brought the}} script to Jersey Film. Before even seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey had {{attempted}} to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got {{a share of the}} project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and [...] "first look" [...] deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it [...] "too demented". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary— who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe— has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: [...] "'This is the worst thing ever written. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b> Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ...So I thought, 'That's that!'" ...|$|E
