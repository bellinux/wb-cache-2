40|$|This Final Report on the Monitoring Phase of {{the former}} Weeks Island Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil storage {{facility}} details the results of five years of monitoring of various surface accessible quantities at the <b>decommissioned</b> <b>facility.</b> The Weeks Island mine was authorized by the State of Louisiana as a Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil storage facility from 1979 until decommissioning of the facility in 1999. Discovery of a sinkhole over the facility in 1992 with freshwater inflow to the facility threatened {{the integrity of the}} oil storage and led to the decision to remove the oil, fill the chambers with brine, and decommission the facility. Thereafter, a monitoring phase, by agreement between the Department of Energy and the State, addressed facility stability and environmental concerns. Monitoring of the surface ground water and the brine of the underground chambers from the East Fill Hole produced no evidence of hydrocarbon contamination, which suggests that any unrecovered oil remaining in the underground chambers has been contained. Ever diminishing progression of the initial major sinkhole, and a subsequent minor sinkhole, with time was verification of the response of sinkholes to filling of the facility with brine. Brine filling of the facility ostensively eliminates any further growth or new formation from freshwater inflow. Continued monitoring of sinkhole response, together with continued surface surveillance for environmental problems, confirmed the intended results of brine pressurization. Surface subsidence measurements over the mine continued throughout the monitoring phase. And finally, the outward flow of brine was monitored as a measure of the creep closure of the mine chambers. Results of each of these monitoring activities are presented, with their correlation toward assuring the stability and environmental security of the <b>decommissioned</b> <b>facility.</b> The results suggest that the decommissioning was successful and no contamination of the surface environment by crude oil has been found...|$|E

40|$|Hanford Nuclear Reservation is a <b>decommissioned</b> <b>facility</b> that {{processed}} and refined radionuclides including Plutonium, Strontium, and Uranium for military purposes.

40|$|As many {{nuclear power}} plants are {{reaching}} their end of lifecycle, the decommissioning of these installations {{has become one of}} the 21 st centuryâ€™s great challenges. Each project may be managed differently, depending on the country, development policies, financial considerations, and the availability of qualified engineers or specialized companies to handle such projects. The principle objective of decommissioning is to place a facility into such a condition that there is no unacceptable risk from the <b>decommissioned</b> <b>facility</b> to public health and safety of the environment. In order to ensure that at the end of its life the risk from a facility is within acceptable bounds, action is normally required. The overall decommissioning strategy is to deliver a timely, costeffective program while maintaining high standards of safety, security and environmental protection. If facilities were not decommissioned, they could degrade and potentially present an environmental radiological hazard in the future. Simply abandoning or leaving a facility after ceasing operations is not considered to be an acceptable alternative to decommissioning. The final aim of decommissioning is to recover the geographic site to its original condition. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} deep-water oil {{exploration}} has increased {{concern for the}} impact of oil activities on marine environment, especially regarding disused or <b>decommissioned</b> <b>facilities</b> offshore. Before the Brent Spar incident, which galvanised international efforts to protect the environment, international and regional legal instruments on decommissioning of offshore oil installations was weak and ineffective in protecting the environment from the effect of disused facilities. This paper examined the efforts made by international and regional actors to remedy the lapses of the pre-Brent Spar legal instruments on decommissioning of offshore oil facilities, especially regarding the new provisions on environmental protection. The paper concluded that the supplementary legal instruments made post-Brent Spar have not radically transformed the legal regime on decommissioning of offshore oil facilities because contracting states still reserve the discretion to permit abandonment of disused facilities...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} seven years, Sandia National Laboratories {{has been active in}} the {{development}} of robotic systems to help remediate DOE`s waste sites and <b>decommissioned</b> <b>facilities.</b> Some of these facilities have high levels of radioactivity which prevent manual clean-up. Tele-operated and autonomous robotic systems have been envisioned as the only suitable means of removing the radioactive elements. World modeling is defined as the process of creating a numerical geometric model of a real world environment or workspace. This model is often used in robotics to plan robot motions which perform a task while avoiding obstacles. In many applications where the world model does not exist ahead of time, structured lighting, laser range finders, and even acoustical sensors have been used to create three dimensional maps of the environment. These maps consist of thousands of range points which are difficult to handle and interpret. This paper presents a least squares technique for fitting range data to planar and quadric surfaces, including cylinders and ellipsoids. Once fit to these primitive surfaces, the amount of data associated with a surface is greatly reduced up to three orders of magnitude, thus allowing for more rapid handling and analysis of world data...|$|R

The tests are conducted on a 50 m by 50 m plot on the University of Arizona`s Maricopa Agricultural Center.

The various subplot areas are instrumented with commercially available instruments such as neutron probes, time domain reflectometry probes, tensiometers, psychrometers, heat dissipation sensors, thermocouples, solution samplers, and cross-hole geophysics electrodes. Measurement depths vary from ground surface to 15 m.
