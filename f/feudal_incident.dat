5000|$|Primer seisin {{is defined}} as [...] "the right which the king had, when any of his tenants died seised of a knight's fee, to receive of the heir, {{provided}} he were of full age, one whole year's profits of the lands, {{if they were in}} immediate possession; and half a year's profits, if the lands were in reversion, expectant on an estate for life" [...] On the death of a tenant-in-chief, for example a feudal baron, his holding was heritable by his son or other right heir. The conveyancing procedure, or procedure of [...] "re-enfeoffment", i.e., re-establishment of tenure in a fief, was as follows. The heir would pay homage to the king, which once received established him irreversibly as the true heir, for the ceremony of homage was {{in the form of a}} sacred vow. Only then could the heir pay his feudal relief to the treasury, which final step would enable him to obtain seisin, i.e., actual possession. Between the death of the previous tenant and the new seisin, there was an empty tenure of the fief, which was legally inconvenient, but tolerated as generally of short duration. It is important to understand that such a tenure did not escheat, even temporarily, to the crown pending the re-enfeoffment of the heir. Yet in the case of a barony, which was an extensive tenure of frequently several dozen manors, the king needed to make certain that the heir who presented himself to pay homage was the true heir, for should his homage be accepted, his status was irreversibly confirmed, and the new baron would be entitled to attend parliament. Time was needed for the sheriff of the shire concerned to make enquiries, sometimes by use of local juries. In order to provide the king with time to make such investigations, the king took temporary seisin of the barony and all its lands, which needed management during the interval, which was termed [...] "primer seisin". It was not a form of escheat, which was an extinguishment of a tenure.Primer seisin can thus be seen as a variety of feudal burden, or <b>feudal</b> <b>incident,</b> that is to say a right exercisable by an overlord over his vassal's holding.|$|E

50|$|The cestui que use {{and trust}} were rooted in medieval law, {{and became a}} legal method to avoid the <b>feudal</b> (medieval) <b>incidents</b> (payments) to an overlord, while leaving the land {{for the use of}} another, who owed nothing to the lord. The law of cestui que tended to defer {{jurisdiction}} to courts of equity as opposed to common law courts. The cestui que was often utilized by persons who might be absent from the kingdom for an extended time (as on a Crusade, or a business adventure), and who held tenancy to the land, and owed <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents</b> to a lord. The land could be left for the use of a third party, who did not owe the incidents to the lord.|$|R

50|$|The {{practice}} arose amongst tenants-in-chief {{of transferring}} the legal title in their lands to feoffees to uses, which effectively established trusts enabling the tenant-in-chief {{to continue to}} use the land and its revenues, but to avoid being officially recognised in law as the legal holder. This exempted him from {{the scope of the}} Inquisition post mortem, as the legal holders were effectively an immortal corporation one or two of whose constituent feoffees could on occasion die, only to be replaced by others. Such avoidance devices were apparently tolerated by the crown for a considerable time, yet on the accession of King Henry VII (1485-1509)the king's ancient right to his <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents</b> was enforced with determination and ruthlessness.|$|R
50|$|Under feudal tenure, a fief {{could not}} be owned {{outright}} but was instead divided into competing interests known as estates in land; thus, a single tract of land could be held both in villein socage by a tenant and in free socage by {{the lord of the}} manor. Villein socage was subject to a number of real burdens and <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents</b> owed to the manorial landlord. For example, the Custom provided for the payment of an annual feu-duty (the cens) by villein socagers to the landlord as both revenue and as a token of submission. The entry fine (lods et ventes) was another mandatory payment, a conveyance fee for villein socages and amounting to a twelfth of the sales price, and derived from the feu-duty, as were other fees and the right of laudatio (retrait lignager).|$|R

Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by {{free and common socage}} and abolished the <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents.</b> The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, and the laws of inheritance and dower were amended.|$|R
5000|$|The {{systems for}} the {{exploitation}} of royal <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents</b> fell into decay by the 15th century, but following the accession of King Henry VII (1485-1509) in 1485, {{and in order to}} replenish the royal treasury, a new importance was placed on fully exploiting such rights. Surveyors, commissioners and from 1514 county feodaries were appointed to actively search for and spy out potential royal wardships, and in each county there were established over wards retained by the king a master, receiver-general, auditor and particular receiver. Liberal rewards were paid to anyone providing information allowing the discovery of a new crown ward. Over all was appointed a [...] "Master of the King's Wards", to be held at the king's pleasure, first established in late 1503, to supervise royal wardships and administer the lands and revenues of wards during the period of crown control, and to sell those not to be retained. The revenues were paid to the Treasurer of the Chamber, that is to say the king's private funds, not into the Treasury.The master originally was required to declare his accounts orally to the king's own person four times a year, which in 1531 was altered to require the rendering of such accounts to general surveyors.|$|R
5000|$|Akin {{to modern}} tax avoidance, {{it was a}} legal loop-hole to avoid the {{suffering}} of the customary <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents,</b> namely the payment of feudal relief on an inheritance, the temporary loss of control of a fiefdom through wardship where the landholder was under the age of majority of 21, and the forcible marriage of a young heiress. Nor could the land-holding escheat, that is to say revert permanenly to the overlord, as was customary where the land-holder died without a legal heir. When the fiefdom was held by a group of feoffees, the death of the beneficial holder was legally irrelevant to its continued holding by them. They simply allowed the lands to continue to be used by the deceased's heir. The feoffees were [...] "an undying corporation which never suffered a minority and could not be given in marriage" [...] (McFarlane, p. 146). The feudal overlord, the king himself if the land was held in-chief, was not entitled to exact feudal relief from the new beneficiary nor was he entitled to seize control of the lands and their revenues until such heir was of full-age, nor was he entitled to sell the heiress in marriage or to marry her to one of his own sons. This had a considerably deleterious effect on the royal finances, which state of affairs was rectified by the aggressive and imaginative new fiscal measures taken by King Henry VII after his accession in 1485.|$|R
5000|$|From the Doctor and Student (1518) [...] "It will be {{somewhat}} long and peradventure somewhat tedious to show all the causes particularly." [...] By the fifteenth century, cestui que use was {{a vehicle to}} defraud creditors. The main use was to leave land, or parts of land {{to members of the}} family other than the primary heir. This was a way to avoid primogeniture inheritance. While the use was intact, the occupant of the land could take advantage of the cestui que use to avoid the feudal payments and duties (incidents). Incidents such as wardship, marriage penalties and other gifts, taxes, fines, fees, and knight service were onerous. Common law did not recognize cestui que uses as such, and there was difficulty fitting these cases into the existing writs and case law. The incidents could not be enforced against a person who was on a Crusade, or other war, or business adventure. They were not present in the kingdom to be enforced to perform. Since the feudal oath was to the person, and not the land, there could be no lien against the land. A hallmark of medieval feudalism was the person to person oath of allegiance. The <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents</b> could not be enforced upon the beneficiaries of the cestui que use, since these were not the owners of the land. The users had not sworn an oath to the lord. Therefore, they owed the lord nothing. The cestui que use had no estate. They had no seisin, nor a trespass, and therefore, ejectment could not be effected. These required possession. Assumpsit was of no avail. In 1402, the Commons had petitioned the king for a remedy against dishonest feoffees to uses, apparently with no result. Cestui que use became a new kind of property and property use.|$|R
5000|$|For some time, {{two kinds}} of {{alienation}} had been occurring. These were [...] "substitution" [...] and [...] "subinfeudation". In substitution, the tenant would alienate his land, and the attendant duties owed to the lord. After alienation, the tenant expected nothing from the new tenant, other than {{the price of the}} alienation. In subinfeudation, the new tenant would become a serf owing feudal duties to the person who alienated. The previous tenant would become the lord to the new tenant. Both these practices had the effect of denying the great lord of the land his rights of feudal estate. The bond of homage was between lord and servant. It was difficult for the medieval mind to think of this in any terms other than as a personal bond. The idea that a feudal bond could be bought or sold was repugnant to the ruling class. All the same, the practice of alienation of rights to the land had been going on in England for some centuries. A tenant who was accepted in homage by the lord could [...] "subinfeudate" [...] to one or more under-tenants. It was difficult or impossible for the overlord to extract any services (such as knight service, rent, homage) from the new tenants. They had no bond to the overlord. Pollock and Maitland give the following example: In the case of subinfeudation, the old tenant was liable for services to the lord. If A enfoeffed to B to hold a knight's service, and then B enfoeffed C to hold as a rent of a pound of pepper per year; B dies leaving an heir within age; A is entitled to a wardship; but it will be worth very little: instead of being entitled to enjoy the land itself until the heir is of age, he will get a few annual pounds of pepper. Instead of enjoying the land by escheat, he will only receive a trifling rent. Quia Emptores in 1290 ended all subinfeudation and made all alienation complete. Once a sale of land was made, the new owner was responsible for all <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} military and socage tenures was the mode of descent. Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally hereditary, it had certainly become so {{at the time of the}} Conquest, and it descended to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held by knight-service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent of socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time followed the old pre-Conquest rule of descent. Thus in the so-called [...] "Laws of Henry I" [...] The lands other than the capital fief and some socage lands were divided among all the sons equally. But by the time of Henry de Bracton the course of descent of lands held by knight-service had so far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case of gavelkind. The military tenant was subject to the <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents,</b> from which the tenant in socage was exempt. These additional fees and obligations were often oppressive. Alienation of lands by will, except in a few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation inter vivos was restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir, in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a tenant had a greater power of alienation over land which he had purchased than over land which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind of land. The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna Carta that a free man should not give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount insufficient to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the rights of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeudation until the passing of the Statute of Quia Emptores. Alienation by a tenant-in-chief of the crown without licence was a ground of forfeiture until 1327, when a fine was substituted.|$|R
5000|$|The escheators {{were ordered}} by a writ from the king's {{chancery}} {{to investigate the}} deaths of tenants-in-chief {{in order to assess}} what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called <b>feudal</b> <b>incidents,</b> comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the mediaeval royal revenues. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a relief, from Latin levo, levare (to lift-up), plus re (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a lord of the manor and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the feudal land tenure of barony had become a fixed sum under clause two of Magna Carta (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would [...] "escheat" [...] (i.e. revert to the demesne of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of [...] "escheats". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which entailed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted {{a significant part of the}} royal revenues in mediaeval times.|$|R
5000|$|The Hundred Court {{meeting place}} {{was on the}} River Wey {{at a place called}} Perry Bridge, or La Perie at the western edge of Shalford. The {{jurisdiction}} of the sheriff's court was much curtailed by private rights. In 1086 Odo, Earl of Kent (and Bishop of Bayeux) held Bramley, its central area. The Victoria County History attributes its conflation with Bramley to its stated size of 6½ hides of land, versus 97 stated to exist before the Norman Conquest in the same 'Domesday Book' survey document. The manorial lords of Bramley, Shalford, Wintershull, and Gomshall, and the rectors of Shalford and Cranleigh also had courts leet, and the lord of Albury view of frankpledge, but the latter gave those profits to the Crown. The lord of Shere claimed view of frankpledge up to 1238, the lord of Albury claimed the same, and it was granted to Bramley by charter of Henry III. These townships paid an annual fine to the sheriff. In 1671 Shere paid the most, at 20s. The royal rights, such as they were, were granted by James VI and I in 1620 to Sir Edward Zouche of Woking Palace, and to the heirs male of Sir Alan his uncle, together with the very large manor of Woking (the main asset), Woking Hundred and other lands, to be held by the service of bringing in the first dish to the king's table on St. James's Day and paying annually £100 (initially [...] but reduced in modern terms by inflation). All <b>feudal</b> system <b>incidents</b> were expressly abrogated at that time. Eventually the hundred rent ceased to be reclaimable from any tenants in the area.|$|R
