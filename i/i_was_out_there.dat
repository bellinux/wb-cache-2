500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Hazel Mangle Rivers, who {{had paid}} $8 for her ticket—"one-tenth of her husband's weekly salary"—was {{quoted in the}} August 29 New York Times. Rivers stated that she was {{impressed}} by Washington's civility: [...] "The people are lots better up here than they are down South. [...] They treat you much nicer. Why, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, [...] "Excuse me," [...] and I said [...] "Certainly!" [...] That's {{the first time that}} has ever happened to me. I believe {{that was the first time}} a white person has ever really been nice to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raekwon {{released}} Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... as {{his first}} solo album, and the third seen from the Wu {{after the release of}} their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), with Method Man's Tical and Ol' Dirty Bastard's [...] released prior. The song [...] "Can It Be All So Simple," [...] from 36 Chambers, marked the first recorded exhibition of Raekwon and Ghostface Killah as a duo, as the two would further establish this alliance on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in Staten Island, New York. In an interview with Wax Poetics, Raekwon explained [...] "I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit I knew and saw. We did the hustlin' thing, we did the crime thing; we did all the things that made us feel like mobsters or Mafiosos in some way." [...] In a different article, Ghostface Killah recollected [...] "Back then I was punchin' a lot of rap niggas in their face, and niggas was getting beat up in the clubs. We were banned from everything. They wouldn't even let me in the Tunnel. Niggas was scared to death when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> wilding. I was fucking niggas up, robbing niggas, fucking a lot of bitches, just doing dumb shit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate, I have {{a better}} chance of getting this than I had of the other places that I applied for. There can hardly be a rush of applicants. When <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> may hear of {{something}} better.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{feeling better}} then, but <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of <b>there,</b> anyway. <b>I</b> couldn't look up yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> I've often wished <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} 'un again, like this. Well, I {{made up my}} mind when first I went for a soldier, that I'd like to 'ave a medal out of it some day. Now I'll get it, if they don't get me!" [...] and he laughed again: [...] "Ah! I've 'ad some good times, an' I've 'ad some bad times----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except, {{knowing that}} others are waiting. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> I used to worry horribly over my mother. She was ill at the time. The cruelest thing in {{war is the}} anxiety of people about each other--nothing touches that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{as though}} by {{eliciting}} the good fortunes {{of his brothers}} I had cast some slur upon himself, he said suddenly: [...] "If the railway had come, as it ought to have, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> I should have done quite well with my fruit farm." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, after I {{came back}} from the Cape I began going there again. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> she took it into her head to write me a letter, rather ill-spelt and funny--but I was touched that she thought of me. And she sent some tobacco and some cigarettes.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> over <b>there,</b> in the Nor'-West," [...] began Mat, nodding {{towards the}} {{particular}} {{point of the}} compass that he mentioned.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{received}} no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling {{to run to}} and fro at his behest, <b>I</b> replied--'Nobody <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> but Joseph.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 'fraid <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> little sister," [...] confessed Noel bravely. [...] "Here we {{can climb}} tree; good chance shoot um with my arrows." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel was speechless. But the attaché laughed. [...] "What he {{has done}} to-day I don't know," [...] he said; [...] "but if it's as {{apocryphal}} as what you say he did two years ago, you've a thundering bad case, sir; for he was then in India, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> visiting him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet his {{stiffness}} of attitude disappeared when Gertie {{had read the}} letter from Joralemon and mused, chin on hand, dreamily melancholy: [...] "I can just see them out sleighing. Sometimes I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Honest, Carl, for all {{the sea and the}} hills here, don't you wish sometimes it were August, and you were out home camping on a wooded bluff over a lake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of you just now when I fell asleep, Susy," [...] he said. He {{did not know why}} he said it; he had not intended to tell her, he had only meant to avoid a direct answer to her question; yet even now he went on. [...] "And I thought of you when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the rose garden waiting to come in here." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{dark in the}} sky, And {{silence is}} where Our laughs rang high; And recall do <b>I</b> That One <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Attar {{competed in}} the women's 800 metres, without having met the Olympic {{qualifying}} time. She had competed at the distance only once, during high school, but not since she had attended college. She said: [...] "The 800 was a good option because <b>I</b> wouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> getting lapped in the 5,000 or something." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{commenced}} {{this letter}} on yesterday, since which I received yours of the 13th. I stick to my promise {{to come to}} Louisville. Nothing new here except what I have written. I have not seen [...] since my last trip, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going <b>out</b> <b>there</b> as soon as I mail this letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, look at me! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> a year, {{and here}} I am with {{only half a}} game leg; times were a lot worse, then, too. I often wish I were back there. Anything's better than London and the War Office." [...] But just {{then he saw the}} padre coming, and took her hand. [...] "Good night, Miss Pierson. Don't worry. That does no good, and there isn't half the risk you think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like it. I can't {{understand}} it. If {{this had}} happened in India I should have said the man had died from some form of snakebite. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> two years, and I've seen a hundred cases of it. The poor devils all looked just like this. But the thing's ridiculous. How could a man be bitten by a snake in a Southampton waterfront boarding-house? Was the door locked when you found him, Mrs. Pickett?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} of it," [...] said Murray Hill triumphantly. [...] "You {{resemble}} him so strongly. Please don't consider me as a stranger a minute longer, for Max and I are like brothers. Indeed, I owe my life to him. Last summer <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on a surveying expedition, and I took typhoid in a little out-of-the-way place where good nursing {{was not to be}} had for love or money. Your brother attended me and he managed to pull me through. He never left me day or night until I was out of danger, and he worked like a Trojan for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something like this, Swiss villa style. I {{remember}} when Jack put it up. Well, {{the last time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> passed <b>there.</b> And {{what do you think}} they've done to it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because Miss Holmes {{seems quite}} crazy about the place, and I expect <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> dragged <b>out</b> <b>there</b> one day," [...] he replied, quite gloomily. It was a prophetic remark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, children, I {{want you}} all to sit up just as {{straight}} and pretty {{as you can and}} give me all your attention for a minute or two. There --that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who <b>is</b> looking <b>out</b> of the window--I am afraid she thinks <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good." [...] And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.|$|R
6000|$|... "But let me {{tell you}} about the trip I took to Mexico with High Jack Snakefeeder, a Cherokee twice removed, a {{graduate}} of a Pennsylvania college and the latest thing in pointed-toed, rubber-heeled, patent kid moccasins and Madras hunting-shirt with turned-back cuffs. He was a friend of mine. I met him in Tahlequah when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> during the land boom, and we got thick. He had got all there was out of colleges and had come back to lead his people out of Egypt. He was a man of first-class style and wrote essays, and had been invited to visit rich guys' houses in Boston and such places.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say I {{paid for}} it. I said I took it. That is, {{as one might}} say, the point of my story. My old friend, {{grateful}} for favours received and wishing to do me a good turn, consented to become my accomplice in another--er--innocent deception. I gave my friends the {{address and telephone number}} of the apartment-house, living the while myself in surroundings of a somewhat humbler and less expensive character. I called every morning for letters. If anybody rang me up on the telephone, the admirable man answered in the capacity of my servant, took a message, and relayed it on to me at my boarding-house. If anybody called, he merely said that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> wasn't a flaw in the whole scheme, my dear, and its chief merit was its beautiful simplicity." ...|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{know what}} or how, {{but it seems}} to me mostly owing to these skies, (every now and then I think, while I have of course seen them every day of my life, I never really saw the skies before,) have had this autumn some wondrously {{contented}} hours--may I not say perfectly happy ones? As I have read, Byron just before his death told a friend that he had known but three happy hours during his whole existence. Then there is the old German legend of the king's bell, to the same point. While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> by the wood, that beautiful sunset through the trees, I thought of Byron's and the bell story, and the notion started in me that I was having a happy hour. (Though perhaps my best moments I never jot down; when they come I cannot afford to break the charm by inditing memoranda. I just abandon myself to the mood, and let it float on, carrying me in its placid extasy.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Dan laughed. [...] "Why, it wasn't such a very ironclad {{engagement}} as all that, Alice. They {{said they}} were going to drive out to Cambridge over the Milldam, and <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to get some of my traps together, and they could pick me up at the Art Museum if they liked. Besides, how could I explain?" ...|$|R
60|$|I wasted my substance, I know I did, On riotous living, so I did, But there's {{nothing on}} record to show I did Worse than my betters have done. They {{talk of the}} money I spent out there-- They hint at the pace that I went out there-- But they all forget <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent <b>out</b> <b>there</b> Alone as a rich man's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course now it <b>is</b> different. <b>I</b> feel {{as young}} {{and as well}} as I did twenty years ago, and can {{thoroughly}} enjoy my life in London, though I still fight very shy of the country. It is a satisfaction to {{me to know that}} things are pretty quiet in India at present, so that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> losing nothing that way, and if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> only holding inspections at Barrakpoor, Dumdum, or on the Maidan at Calcutta. Of course it was pleasant enough in its way, for I never felt the heat; but as a man gets on in life he doesn't have quite so much enjoyment out of it as he used to do. The men around him are a good deal younger than himself. He knows all the old messroom jokes, and one bit of scandal is like scores of others he has heard in his time.|$|R
60|$|Jimmie McDaniel {{was another}} schoolmate. His age and mine about tallied. His father kept the candy-shop {{and he was}} the most envied little chap in the town--after Tom Blankenship ("Huck Finn")--for {{although}} we never saw him eating candy, we supposed that it was, nevertheless, his ordinary diet. He pretended that he never ate it, and didn't care for it because there was nothing forbidden about it--there was plenty of it and he could have {{as much of it as}} he wanted. He was the first human being to whom I ever told a humorous story, so far as I can remember. This was about Jim Wolfe and the cats; and I gave him that tale the morning after that memorable episode. I thought he would laugh his teeth out. I had never been so proud and happy before, and have seldom been so proud and happy since. I saw him four years ago when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> He wore a beard, gray and venerable, that came half-way down to his knees, and yet it was not difficult for me to recognize him. He had been married fifty-four years. He had many children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and also even posterity, they all said-- thousands--yet the boy to whom I had told the cat story when we were callow juveniles was still present in that cheerful little old man.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would have}} to bring home specimens, with {{particulars}} of {{the width of the}} lode. Of course you would crush pieces up and wash them yourself, or get your Indian to wash them; that would give you an approximate idea of the percentage of gold. If it were rich, I could introduce you to men who would advance money for working it, giving you a share of the profits. They would send out a mining expert with you. He would verify your report, and then you would take up the concession. I don't know whether there have been any changes in the regulations, but there is no difficulty in learning how to proceed from one or other of the men to whom I will give you introductions. The thing would not be worth thinking of were it not that the man who always went with me as guide and muleteer is an Indian, and has, I am convinced, a knowledge of some of these places. He was with me all the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I saved his life when a puma sprang upon him, and he more than once hinted that he could make me a rich man, but I had no inclination that way, my income being sufficient for all my wants. Still, on the chance that he is alive--and he was about thirty when he was with me fifteen years ago, so it is probable that he is still to the fore --I will give you a letter to him telling him that you are a dear friend of mine, and that I trust to him to do any service he can for you just as he would have done for myself. Had it not been for that I should never have mentioned the matter to you. These old mines are the dream of every Peruvian. They have been searching for them ever since the conquest of the country, and as they have failed, it is absurd to think that an Englishman would have the slightest chance of lighting upon a mine, still less of finding any of the Incas' treasures. But with the Indian's aid it is just possible that you may find something, though I should advise you most strongly not to build in any way upon the chance. I consider that you cannot possibly win Miss Fortescue; that being so, two years of knocking about will not make your position worse, and by the time you come back, you may have ceased to struggle against fate. It will afford you a remote --but distinctly remote--opportunity of bettering your position, will give you something else to think about besides that young lady's charms, and you may even come to recognize that life is, after all, possible without her. You may shake your head, lad; but you know children cry for the moon sometimes, yet afterwards come to understand {{that it would not be}} a desirable plaything." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2008 Rolling Stone cover story, George Young {{admitted}} to David Fricke that the Blow Up Your Video session {{was when he}} realized his brother Malcolm, who {{had always been a}} heavy drinker, was in the grips of alcoholism: [...] "I saw the signs.
