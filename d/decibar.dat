40|$|The {{forms of}} the {{primitive}} equations of motion and continuity are obtained when an arbitrary thermodynamic state variable [...] restricted only to be vertically monotonic [...] is used as the vertical coordinate. Natural generalizations of the Montgomery and Exner functions suggest themselves. For a multicomponent fluid like seawater the dependence of the coordinate on salinity, coupled with the thermobaric effect, generates contributions to the momentum balance from the salinity gradient, multiplied by a thermodynamic coefficient that can be completely described given the coordinate variable and the equation of state. In the vorticity balance this term produces a contribution identified with the baroclinicity vector. Only when the coordinate variable is a function only of pressure and in situ specific volume does the coefficient of salinity gradient vanish and the baroclinicity vector disappear. This coefficient is explicitly calculated and displayed for potential specific volume as thermodynamic coordinate, and for patched potential specific volume, where different reference pressures are used in various pressure subranges.

Pressure effects are handled by use of the <b>decibar</b> system. The calculated dynamic heights are plotted and contoured. Current directions are obtained by application of the gcostrophic principle; current velocities are computed from the slopes of the surface topography. A table of specific volume anomalies, necessary for the height computation, has been developed. Sources of potential error are reviewed and assessed. The method has been applied to three synoptic surveys of Lake Huron, and the results obtained are both internally con-sistent and in good agreement with the behaviors of other parameters.

APEX floats, made by Teledyne Webb Research, {{are the most common}} element of the current array. SOLO and SOLO-II floats (the latter use a reciprocating pump for buoyancy changes, unlike screw-driven pistons in other floats) were developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Other types include the NINJA float, made by the Tsurumi Seiki Co. of Japan, and the PROVOR float developed by IFREMER in France. Most floats use sensors made by Sea-Bird Electronics, which also makes a profiling float called Navis. A typical Argo float is a cylinder just over 1 metre long and 14 cm across with a hemispherical cap. Thus it has a minimum volume of about 16,600 cubic centimetres (cm3). At Ocean Station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska the temperature and salinity at the surface might be about 6 °C and 32.55 parts per thousand giving a density of sea-water of 1.0256 g/cm3. At a depth of 2000 metres (pressure of 2000 <b>decibars)</b> the temperature might be 2 °C and the salinity 34.58 parts per thousand.

These changes are limited to abyssal {{waters in the}} Princess Elizabeth Trough and the Australian–Antarctic Basin, with little abyssal change evident north of the Southeast Indian Ridge. As in previous studies, significant cooling and freshening is observed in the bottom potential temperature–salinity relations in these two southern basins. In addition, analysis on pressure surfaces shows abyssal warming of about 0. 05 °C and freshening of about 0. 01 Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS- 78) in the Princess Elizabeth Trough, and warming of 0. 1 °C with freshening of about 0. 005 in the abyssal Australian–Antarctic Basin. These 12 -yr differences are statistically significant from zero at 95 % confidence intervals over the bottom few to several hundred <b>decibars</b> of the water column in both deep basins. Both warming and freshening reduce the density of seawater, contributing to the vertical expansion of the water column. The changes below 3000 dbar in these basins suggest local contributions approaching 1 and 4 cm of sea level rise, respectively. Transient tracer data from the 2007 occupation qualitatively suggest that the abyssal waters in the two southern basins exhibiting changes have significant components that {{have been exposed to}} the ocean surface within the last few decades, whereas north of the Southeast Indian Ridge, where changes are not found, the component of abyssal waters that have undergone such ventilation is much reduced. 1...|$|R
40|$|Interdecadal {{temperature}} {{variability of}} the Atlantic Ocean is investigated by differencing hydrographic sections {{taken from the}} 1920 s through the 1990 s. A comprehensive reanalysis of North Atlantic sections and the inclusion of South Atlantic sections show that warming seen previously in the North Atlantic extends to the South Atlantic. The largest statistically significant changes occur on pressure surfaces between 1000 and 2000 <b>decibars</b> (db). Over this pressure range and for latitudes between 32 S and 36 N, temperatures have warmed by about 0. 5 C/century. At 48 N a cooling of about 3 C/century occurred between the 1950 s and 1980 s. These isobaric temperature trends are decomposed into ones along surfaces of constant neutral density, and ones due to the vertical movement of neutral surfaces. The two components are associated with different processes. In the southern North Atlantic (8 – 36 N) the subthermocline warming between the 1950 s and 1980 s appears to be due primarily to downward displacements of neutral surfaces, while the South Atlantic changes occur primarily along density surfaces. The downward displacements in the North Atlantic occur throughout the 1000 – 2000 -db layer, suggesting a volumetric increase (decrease) in the water masses above (below) the intermediate layer. Since calculated wind-driven displacements of the thermocline {{do not agree with}} this analysis, a change in deep water formation rates is the most likely explanation. The South Atlantic warming trend can be extended further back in time and is due to isopycnal advection, which has a much slower signal propagation speed than does the displacement mechanism for the North Atlantic changes. This suggests that warming in Atlantic intermediate waters is due not only to climatic forcing changes over the last four decades, but also to changes on centennial timescales. These oceanic climate changes have origins in both the northern and southern polar seas...|$|R

In the open ocean region qualitative agreement is observed between the wind stress curl and the depth of the surface layer.

In the 1970 s and 1980 s, there was considerable interest in near-equatorial variability at periods of days to weeks associated with oceanic equatorial inertia–gravity waves and mixed Rossby–gravity waves. At that time, the measurements available for studying these waves were much more limited than today: most of the available observations were from scattered island tide gauges {{and a handful of}} short mooring records. More than a decade of the extensive modern data record from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) /Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TRITON) mooring array in the Pacific Ocean is used to reexamine the internal-wave climate in the equatorial Pacific, with a focus on interpretation of the zonal-wavenumber/frequency spectrum of surface dynamic height relative to 500 <b>decibars</b> at periods of 3 – 15 days and zonal wavelengths exceeding 30 ° of longitude. To facilitate interpretation of the dynamic height spectrum and identification of equatorial wave modes, the spectrum is decomposed into separate spectra associated with dynamic height fluctuations that are symmetric or antisymmetric about the equator. Many equatorial-wave meridional modes can be identified, for both the first and second baroclinic mode. Zonal-wavenumber/frequency spectra of the zonal and meridional wind stress components are also examined. The observed wind stress spectra are used with linear theory of forced equatorial waves to provide a tentative explanation for the zonal-wavenumber extent of the spectral peaks seen in dynamic height. Examination of the cross-equatorial symmetry properties of the wind stress suggests that virtually all of the large-scale equatorial inertia–gravity and mixed Rossby–gravity waves examined may be sensitive to both zonal and meridional wind stress...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The general {{circulation}} {{of the ocean}} plays {{a central role in}} the global transport of heat, freshwater, carbon, oxygen, nutrients, and other constituents. The ocean's large-scale circulation strongly influences the distribution of these important quantities and thus shapes both global climate and patterns of marine biological production. Observations of large-scale circulation, however, have traditionally been limited in both space and time because of the resource-intensive nature of shipboard observations and the sheer magnitude of the world's oceans. The focus of this dissertation is to examine the large-scale circulation of the ocean using observations from the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats, which have unprecedented resolution in both space and time. A novel multi-scale optimal analysis method is developed and applied in order to map the hydrographic and velocity data provided by the Argo floats. Using this method monthly estimates of absolute geostrophic velocities, potential temperature, and salinity in the upper 2000 <b>decibars</b> of the global ocean are computed for the period December 2004 to November 2010. These results are then combined with satellite observations of wind stress to assess the extent to which observed geostrophic transports are accurately predicted by Sverdrup balance, a simple but ubiquitous theory of the relationship between wind-forcing and ocean circulation. Within the uncertainties, good agreement is found over a large portion of the global ocean, namely the interior subtropics and tropics, while poorer agreement is found in the high latitudes and boundary regions. The meridional overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean, which plays an important role in the global climate system, is investigated using the computed absolute geostrophic velocity fields, together with eddy thickness fluxes also estimated from the Argo data. The resulting direct observations of the overturning circulation are examined in terms of spatial variability, and the relative contributions of the mean and eddy components of the overturning are determined. In addition to the scientific results found here, this dissertation demonstrates that measurements from the Argo array of profiling floats can be used to quantitatively estimate the large-scale circulation of the global ocean with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Point Sur Transect {{was established in}} 1987 by the Department of Oceanography at the Naval Postgraduate to further the present understanding of long term variability of current and temperature in eastern boundary regions. Seven of these cruises were selected for seasonal comparisons of alongshore geostrophic velocities and water mass characteristics. Geostrophic velocities were referenced to the 1000 <b>decibar</b> surface based on available PEGASUS observations. Anomalies of spiciness calculated as deviations from an average offshore T-S profile {{have been used to}} identify the location and spatial extent of the eastern Pacific water masses. The California Undercurrent (positive spiciness anomaly) was a prominent feature in 6 of the 7 sections analyzed, and was very weak during a period of uncommonly strong equatorward wind stress. The position of the core varied from 12 to 42 km from shore while its strength varied from 10 to 35 cm s, with the maximum flow occurring in winter. The vertical extent of the Undercurrent core covered a region of the continental slope from 70 to 460 m throughout these seven cruises. The nature of the alongshore geostrophic velocities and the location and spatial extent of the undercurrent appear strongly related to specific wind events, both local and remote. Remote wind forcing from the south was believed to cause anomalous, strong poleward flow throughout the entire water column during a period of local equatorward wind stress, while an intrusion of warm, salty water was believed to cause a deep penetration (to 700 m) of the California Current in winter.

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 74 - 76. xii, 76 l charts, graphs, maps, tablesThe Agulhas Current, {{which is}} the western {{boundary}} current of the South Indian Ocean, is here considered {{as an integral part}} of the subtropical gyre whose circulation and water masses are influenced by seasonal variations in the meteorology unique to the Indian Ocean. In this study 3400 hydrological stations in the southwestern Indian Ocean were used. The depth to which motion in the Agulhas Current may be traced is so great that 2500 decibars was chosen as a primary reference level for geostrophic calculations. The vertical distribution of velocity in the current is so constant, however, that geostrophic transports and velocities to 2500 decibars may be accurately estimated by reference to the 1000 <b>decibar</b> level, and accurate surface flow patterns may be obtained with any choice of reference level. Changes in the pressure field in the current are strongly reflected in changes in the temperature field. Accurate estimates of geostrophic transports may therefore be made from temperature observations. Maps of dynamic topography reveal the dependence of the Agulhas Current on the South Equatorial Current as affected by changing meteorological conditions, variations in the width of the South Equatorial Current, and the existence of three large anticyclonic eddy systems in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The Agulhas Current appears as a rapid flow 1500 kilometers long and 300 kilometers wide between the South African coast and the topographic high of the largest of these eddies. The subtropical gyres of the Atlantic and Indian oceans are shown to be separate and distinct, little or no continuous flow taking place from east to west around the southern tip of Africa. The Agulhas Current turns east at about 40 °s, 20 ° E and flows eastward with the West Wind Drift, the boundary between the two currents approximately coinciding with the Subtropical Convergence. Current profiles and maps of volume transport are used to trace the flow of water from the broad, shallow South Equatorial Current to the narrow, deep Agulhas Current where transports may be as high as 100 megatons/ sec during the southern winter and 80 megatons/sec in summer. Seasonal and shorter time-scale variations in the Agulhas Current indicate that cyclonic eddies inshore and anticyclonic eddies offshore are common, resulting in rapid changes in the temperature and velocity fields. The water masses in the Agulhas Current are dominantly Tropical Surface Water and Subtropical Surface Water whose flow into the system depends on seasonal variations in the South Equatorial Current. Tropical Surface Water flows mainly into the northern end of the Madagascar Channel, in greatest quantities in the southern winter, while Subtropical Surface Water enters the Agulhas Current system only past the southern tip of Madagascar, in greatest quantities in the same season. Antarctic Intermediate Water enters the system only from the east. water mass of Red Sea origin flows south down the Madagascar Channel, being observed as far as 38 °s. The flow of high-salinity water may playa major role in the salt budget of the northern Indian Ocean...|$|E
