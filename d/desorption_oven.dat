40|$|Dust. Indoor air. Thermal desorption. Gas chromatography-ultraviolet spectrometry. Nitric oxide A new {{technique}} is described which can measure {{low molecular weight}} compounds adsorbed onto dust parti-cles in a simple yet accurate way. The technique, gas chromatography-ultraviolet spectrometry (GC-UV), com-prises a one-stage thermal <b>desorption</b> <b>oven,</b> a gas flow cell with a miniaturised GC column, and a nitrogen-flushed photo diode array (PDA) detector for fast UV spectra recording. The dust sample is thermally de-sorbed {{in the oven and}} the compounds released are flushed onto the GC column by means of a carrier gas stream. The separated compounds are then registered by the PDA detector and identified by their characteristic gas-phase UV spectra. This method enables the analysis of volatile organic as well as inorganic compounds ad-sorbed onto dust particles, many of which are difficult to analyse together in one single analysis using conven-tional methods. For example, both nitric oxide and am-monia can be analysed, as well as hydrogen sulphide, pyridine, 2 -furaldehyde, 2 -methylfuran, and isoprene. It is concluded that GC-UV may be used as an alternative or to complement other methods for measuring chemi-cals in indoor dusts, thus improving survey and control of the human exposure to particle-bound irritants and other chemicals.

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a system that}} links a thermal <b>desorption</b> <b>oven</b> for aerosol filter samples to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) via a combustion interface. Organic compounds are desorbed from the filter sample in He at 7 temperature steps between 100 and 400 °C and subsequently oxidized to CO 2, which is analyzed for δ 13 C. We tested the system for isotopic fractionation, reproducibility and linearity using organic test compounds and aerosol filter samples. An oxalic acid standard with known δ 13 C value shows no isotopic fractionation when it is desorbed at temperatures well above its melting point. When organic acids are heated at a temperature close to their melting point {{only a fraction of}} the compound (10 – 80 %) evaporates which shows depleted δ 13 C values at this temperature step. At the next higher temperature step, when the rest of the compound is desorbed, δ 13 C values are enriched. This effect is stronger for compounds with a lower molecular weight than for compounds with a higher molecular weight. In ambient samples this should only have a moderate effect on the overall δ 13 C value, since hundreds of different compounds are desorbed at each temperature step. Choosing different values for temperature steps does not strongly change the δ 13 C values for ambient aerosol filter samples. For typical ambient samples the reproducibility lies below ± 0. 3 ‰ for oven temperatures below 200 °C and below ± 0. 5 ‰ for oven temperatures above 200 °C. Tests with oxalic acid and ambient filter samples show that the IRMS is linear for peak areas in the operational range of 1 – 20 V s...|$|E
40|$|We have {{continued}} experiments on {{the reaction of}} iodate with sphagnum peat moss. We have established that iodate added to a suspension of peat moss undergoes reduction and to a significant extent is incorporated in to the peat moss. We have confirmed the incorporation of iodine into the peat matrix using pyrolysis GC/MS. In addition, we have performed a scaled up pyrolysis using the preparative GC system that was described in a previous report. This instrument consisted of a packed column gas chromatograph (SRI 8010) with a TCD detector and injector valve equipped with a thermal desorber. Pyrolysis experiments were performed in a 6 ” tube furnace manufactured by Carbolyte. This programmable furnace has a 0. 5 ” diameter process tube that can hold 8 - 100 mg samples of peat or ion exchange resin. During sample heating helium stream sweeps products from the tube furnace to the carbosieve trap located in the thermal desorber unit. Volatile materials that are collected on the carbosieve trap can {{be transferred to the}} gas chromatograph by actuating the valve and activating the thermal <b>desorption</b> <b>oven.</b> Chromatography is initiated by thermally desorbing trapped volatiles from the carbosieve trap to the GC column (2 mm x 2 m, Porapak Q). The instrument was calibrated with by injecting methyl iodide into the thermal desorber trap. The response factor and retention time of methyl iodide were thus determined. Pyrolysis experiments with 8 - 12 mg of organic matter have been conducted using this experimental apparatus. Experimental results for a two series of incubations are shown in Figure 1. Results for experiments with a peat sample incubated at 40 oC and pH 4. 3 are shown. In addition, the results for a commercially available humic acid at pH 2 are presented. The low pH was used to prevent dissolution of the humic material. During this last quarter we have investigated the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the yield of methyl iodide. We have done experiments with the analytical pyrolysis unit described in previous reports and with the preparative GC. The results of these studies are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 and demonstrate optimum methyl iodide production at 400 oC. The peat (350 mg) was incubated in 20 mL of 2. 7 * 10 - 3 M KIO 3. The suspension pH was established with phosphate buffer and the sample was held in a constant temperature incubator. In most cases the amount of methyl iodide produced by pyrolysis increased with an increase in heating time. Previous reports indicated that organically bound iodine went through a maximum during heating experiments and then slowly decreased. This maximum was not apparent in the pyrolysis results...|$|E

Using this set-up, a number of volatile organic as well as inorganic compounds were identified in indoor dust particles, e. g. nitric oxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, pyridine, 2 -furaldehyde, 2 -methylfuran, and isoprene. Moreover, acrylate monomers were identified in dust samples from a secondary school with problems due to powdering floor polish. An instrumental set-up with higher performance was achieved by interfacing the gas flow cell to a capillary GC column. When airborne indoor dust samples were analysed by this system and by GC-MS under similar conditions of thermal desorption (150 °C) and GC separation, the two analytical systems were found to be complementary. GC-UV together with GC-MS was thus demonstrated to be considerably more powerful than GC-MS alone for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in indoor dust. When airborne dust samples from damp (n= 9) and control (n= 9) residences were analysed for VOC and microorganisms, identifications made by culture and microscopy of the major moulds found, i. e. Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillum, coincided with the identification of VOC known to be produced by these species. A number of additional VOC were also found, some of which may be irritating to the skin, eyes or respiratory tract if present at higher concentrations. Quantitative GC-UV analysis of indoor dust from 389 residences in Sweden showed that the VOC found at the highest concentrations were saturated aldehydes (C 5 -C 10), furfuryl alcohol, 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol, 2 -furaldehyde, and benzaldehyde. Alkenals were also found, notably 2 -butenal (crotonaldehyde), 2 -methyl-propenal (methacrolein), hexenal, heptenal, octenal, and nonenal. GC-UV was also applied (together with GC-MS) to determine VOC in dust from residences of 198 children with symptoms of asthma and/or allergy (cases) and from residences of 202 children without symptoms (controls). The mean concentration of nicotine was found to be significantly higher in dust from case residences, while the mean concentrations of hexane, nonanal, octane, 2 -pentylfuran and tridecanol were significantly higher in dust from control residences. In a stepwise logistic regression model, nicotine, hexanal, furfuryl alcohol, nonane, butanol, and octenal showed increased relative risks, expressed as odds ratios comparing cases with controls. By contrast, benzaldehyde, nonanal, butenal, hexane, tridecanol, and pentylfuran showed decreased relative risks. These findings point to the possibility that not only environmental tobacco smoke but also other emissions in the indoor environment may be linked to the increased prevalence of asthma and/or allergy in children. It is concluded that GC-UV may be used as an alternative or complement to GC-MS for measuring chemicals in indoor dust, thus improving the survey and control of human exposure to particle-bound toxicants and other chemicals.

40|$|Flüchtige organische Verbindungen (volatile organic {{compounds}}, VOCs), besonders rnTerpene, gelten als Vorläufer des sekundären organischen Aerosols (secondary rnorganic aerosols, SOA). Terpene werden von Pflanzen zur Abwehr oder zur rnAttraktion von Bestäubern emittiert. Ungesättigten Verbindungen, wie Sesquiterpene, rnsind sehr ozonolyseempfindlich und weisen nur geringe Konzentrationen in der rnAtmosphäre auf. Zudem lassen sie sich mit handelsüblichen rnThermodesorptionseinheiten meist nicht ohne Artefakte nachweisen, da sie eine hohe rnReaktivität mit vielen Oberflächen zeigen. rnDiese Arbeit präsentiert Forschungsergebnisse der qualitativen und rn(semi) quantitativen Auswertungen flüchtiger organischer Verbindungen in rnLaborstudien und biogenen Emissionsproben (Feldmessungen) mittels rnThermodesorption-Gaschromatographie-Massenspektrometrie (TD-GC/MS). Speziell rnzur Analyse hochreaktiver Verbindungen wurde eine Thermodesorptionseinheit für die rnGC/MS entwickelt. Diese besteht aus einer Kryofokussierung, einem Desorptionsofen rnund einer Heizung. Die Steuerung erfolgt über eine eigens dafür geschaffene rnBedienoberf läche von Labview® an einem PC über eine nachgeschaltete SPS rn(speicherprogrammierbare Steuerung). Das komplette Desorptionsprogramm und der rnStart der GC/MS-Analyse wurden automatisiert. rnDie Quantifizierung alle Proben wurde über Diffusionsquellen und rnVergleichsmessungen durch auf Adsorptionsröhrchen aufgebrachte rnVerdünnungsreihen realisiert. Um Informationen über die mutmaßlichen Vorläufer des rnsekundären organischen Aerosols zu erhalten, wurde zudem eine Ozon-Scrubber-rnMethode basierend auf Propen entwickelt. Diese wurde anhand von Standards in einer rnReaktionskammer getestet und in Feldmessungen erfolgreich angewendet. rnQuantitative Analysen zeigen, dass die meisten Terpene so vollständig vor der rnOzonolyse bewahrt werden können. Für hochreaktive Analyte wie α-Humulen oder rnβ-Caryophyllen wurden Wiederfindungsraten von über 80 % erreicht. So konnte die rnTemperaturabhängigkeit der Terpen-Emissionen der Fichte (Picea abies) in rnFeldmessungen nachgewiesen werden. rnEine weitere Anwendungsmöglichkeit wurde mit der Unterscheidung verschiedener rnArten der gleichen Gattung anhand der Emissionsmuster und der möglichen rnAbgrenzung verschiedener Bestäubertypen am Beispiel der Gattung Salvia untersucht. rnDie Emissionsanalysen zeigen, dass eine Zuordnung der Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse rnzusätzlich zu anderen Vergleichen möglich ist. Das gleiche gilt für die Differenzierung rnvon Bestäubertypen. Die Ergebnisse der Feldmessungen wurden durch rnMethodenvergleich zwischen biogenen Emissionsmessungen mit anschließender rnTD-GC/MS-Analyse und Extraktionen der jeweiligen Blüten/Blätter mit rnanschließender GC/MS-Messung bestätigt. Volatile {{organic compounds}} (VOCs), especially terpenes, {{are considered to}} be rnprecursors of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Terpenes are emitted by plants for rndefence or attracting pollinators. Unsaturated compounds like sesquiterpenes are very rnsentitive to ozone and show only low concentrations in the atmosphere. Due to their rnhigh reactivity on many surfaces artefacts were often formed during sampling and rnmeasuring. rnThis work presents results of qualitative and (semi-) quantitative analyses of volatile rnorganic compounds in laboratory studies and in field measurements with plenty of rnbiogenic emissions by thermodesorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry rn(TD-GC/MS). A new thermodesorption unit as an injector for the GC-MS system, rnconsisting of a cryo trap, a <b>desorption</b> <b>oven</b> and a heating, was developed. The TD unit rnis connected to a GC-MS system by a self-made operating interface of Labview®, rnwhich is automatically controlled by a “SPS” (“speicherprogramierbare Steuerung”). rnThe quantification was achieved by external calibration of adsorption tubes by self-rncertified diffusion sources and comparative measurements of liquid samples. A new rnozone scrubber method based on propene was developed to analyze high reactive rnVOCs in the atmosphere. It was tested with standards in a reaction chamber. rnQuantitative analyses showed that most of the terpene can be completely preserved rnfrom ozonolysis. Recovery rates for high reactive analytes such as αHumulen and rnβ-Caryophyllen are higher than 80 %. This technique was successfully applied in field rnmeasurements to analyze monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. So a temperature rndependence of the terpen emission from spruce (Picea abies) has been indicated. rnCorrelations of different species of the same genus and between varied pollinators by rnthe analyses of flower emissions have been tested on Salvia. The results showed that rnTD-GC/MS is a reliable method for classification of the relationship between different rnspecies of the same genus and for correlation of the differentiation of pollinators. The rnresults of the field measurements were conf irmed by method comparison between rnbiogenic emission samples with TD-GC/MS analysis and extractions of the blossoms rnfollowed by GC/MS measurement. rnThe applications of the TD-GC/MS system in field samples from the West-Irish coast rnshowed that not only organoiodides such as CH 3 I and CH 2 I 2 but also monoterpenes rnand sesquiterpenes could be successfully detected. Moreover, correlations between rnanalyte concentration and environmental parameters such as weather conditions and rnlight intensity were found. rnTo sum up, a new TD-GC/MS system has been developed to determine quantitatively rnvolatile, highly reactive analytes in trace levels. The new ozone scrubber provides the rnpossibility of field measurements under high ozone concentrations. The observed rncorrelations and temperature dependence confirm the large applicability and rnconsistency of the method. This method provides a basis for further detailed investigations on SOA precursors and their influencing factors. For a better rnunderstanding more efforts have to be untertaken in the future...|$|E
