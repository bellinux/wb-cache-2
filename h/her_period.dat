5|$|Isabeau showed great piety, {{essential}} for a queen of <b>her</b> <b>period.</b> During her lifetime, {{and in her}} will, she bequeathed property and personal possessions to Notre Dame, St. Denis, and the convent in Poissy.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of <b>her</b> <b>period,</b> forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E
5|$|The Ulstermen {{eventually}} rouse, {{one by one}} at first, {{and finally}} en masse. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets <b>her</b> <b>period,</b> and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E

30|$|CH was a 34 -year-old woman {{referred}} {{for a second}} opinion. She had had debilitating menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea {{for several years and}} had been advised that she required a hysterectomy. She had started <b>her</b> <b>periods</b> at the age of 11 and had subsequently suffered with anaemia. This was chronic and responded poorly to iron supplements, which she had taken since she was 15 years old. <b>Her</b> <b>periods</b> were also extremely painful; she suffered from severe central menstrual cramps. The combination of the dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia was debilitating.|$|R
50|$|During <b>her</b> <b>periods</b> of {{training}} and preparation for deployment on the west coast, Eversole often visited ports of the Pacific Northwest, and on occasion voyaged to the Hawaiian Islands.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having <b>her</b> <b>period</b> mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
25|$|Isabel granted land at Brewood to Roger de Meyland, {{bishop of}} Coventy and Lichfield. This dates <b>her</b> <b>period</b> of office as being {{at least partly}} {{contemporary}} with his episcopate, approximately 1258-95, although {{it is impossible to}} know whether she preceded or succeeded Mabel.|$|E
25|$|After his election, he has {{to follow}} a six-month {{initiation}} period, during which he {{is not allowed to}} shave or wash. He wears white clothes and nobody is allowed to touch him.

25|$|The {{most popular}} trance {{lecturer}} {{prior to the}} American Civil War was Cora L. V. Scott (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During <b>her</b> <b>period</b> of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.|$|E
60|$|Her new surroundings, however, had {{developed}} Beth's character wonderfully, {{and although she}} still had <b>her</b> <b>periods</b> of sullen depression she was generally as gay and lovable as her two cousins, but in a quieter and more self-possessed way.|$|R

25|$|Sex is not {{considered}} acceptable outside marriage, {{but it is an}} important part of the love and care shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After <b>her</b> <b>period</b> has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E

25|$|On January 11, 2013, Olzon {{announced}} on her official blog {{that she was}} pregnant with her third child, due in spring 2013. This was a contributing factor to her being dismissed. The band then released a statement on their website declaring that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave. Later on, Olzon gave several interviews in which she told that she never agreed with a replacement, even when she was pregnant, and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, culminating on her firing. She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in <b>her</b> <b>period</b> of maternity, mainly because of the difference in their vocal styles.|$|E

25|$|Several {{other leaders}} were {{previously}} affiliated with The Elders. Former Elder Muhammad Yunus {{stepped down as}} a member of the group in September 2009, stating that he was unable to do justice to his membership due to the demands of his work. Aung San Suu Kyi is a former honorary Elder. During <b>her</b> <b>period</b> under house arrest, the Elders kept an empty chair at each of their meetings to mark their solidarity with Suu Kyi and Burma's other political prisoners. In line with the requirement that members of The Elders should not hold public office, Suu Kyi stepped down as an honorary Elder following her election to parliament on 1 April 2012. Li Zhaoxing was present at the launch of The Elders but did not formally join the group.|$|E

25|$|Schooling came to her, {{as it was}} apt {{to come to a}} girl of <b>her</b> <b>period,</b> {{intermittently}} and in variety. She spent a year in a small {{boarding school}} in Plattsburg; an interval at a school kept at the Shurtliff homestead in Middlebury; attendance at the Middlebury Female Semimary; a winter at a village Academy in Rutland, where she recited Latin with boys preparing to enter college as sophomores; and a term or two at “Old T. C. A.” It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street ,that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote on the blackboard the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M. Thomas when in 1910 he conferred on her the degree of Doctor of Letters from Middlebury College, an honor which with characteristic modesty she accepted as a tribute to the women of her generation.|$|E
