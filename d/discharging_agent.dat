50|$|<b>Discharge</b> <b>agents</b> {{are used}} to bleach color from previously-dyed fabrics, {{and can be used}} in a sort of reverse tie-dye. Household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can be used to {{discharge}} fiber reactive dyes on bleach-resistant fibers such as cotton or hemp (but not on wool or silk), though the results are variable, as some fiber reactive dyes are more resistant to bleach than others. It is important to bleach only as long as required to obtain the desired shade, and to neutralize the bleach with agents such as sodium bisulfite, to prevent damage to the fibers. Thiourea dioxide is another commonly used <b>discharge</b> <b>agent</b> that can be used on cotton, wool, or silk. A thiourea dioxide discharge bath is made with hot water is made mildly basic with sodium carbonate. The results of thiourea dioxide discharge differ significantly from bleach discharge. Discharge techniques, particularly using household bleach, are a readily accessible way to tie-dye without use of often messy and relatively expensive dyes.|$|R

40|$|Chemical and {{electrochemical}} reduction methods allow the dispersion, processing, and/or functionalization of discrete sp 2 - hybridised nanocarbons, including fullerenes, nanotubes and graphenes. Electron {{transfer to the}} nanocarbon raises the Fermi energy creating nanocar bon anions, thereby activating an array of possible covalent reactions. The Fermi level may then be partially or fully lowered by intended functionalization reactions, but in general, techniques are required to remove excess charge without inadvertent cova lent reactions that potentially degrade the nanocarbon properties of interest. Here, simple and effective chemical discharging routes are demonstrated for graphenide polyelectrolytes {{and are expected to}} apply to other systems, particularly nanotubides.

40|$|Despite {{the long}} held {{agreement}} that {{a knowledge of}} enclosure integrity is an essential element {{in the design of}} fire protection systems, relatively little information is available concerning the development of enclosure pressure during the <b>discharge</b> of gaseous <b>agents.</b> Room pressure development during clean <b>agent</b> <b>discharges</b> is dependent upon several system-and enclosure-related factors. A major factor influencing the development of room pressure {{is the nature of the}} clean <b>agent.</b> The <b>discharge</b> of inert gas agents is characterized by a rapid buildup of pressure to a maximum, followed by a relatively slow decay in pressure with time. The <b>discharge</b> of halocarbon-based <b>agents</b> on the other hand, is characterized by an initial, relatively rapid negative pressure pulse, due to initial cooling of the enclosure and its contents, followed by a relatively rapid positive pressure pulse. Additional factors influencing the development of room pressure during a clean <b>agent</b> <b>discharge</b> include the enclosure construction, the enclosure integrity (leakage area, hold time), the fire size per enclosure volume ratio, and the agent flow rate. Details of the effects of the above factors on room pressure development for both inert gas and halocarbon-based systems will be reviewed, along with data relating enclosure pressurization to enclosure integrity. Approaches to the evaluation of enclosure strengths for various construction types will be discussed, and recently developed methodologies for the prediction of the pressure dynamics of clean <b>agent</b> <b>discharges</b> will also be reviewed...|$|R

Below 100 nA, electrical charging of insulating materials was prevented. The probe current of 10 nA was suitable for qualitative analysis because the intensities of peaks from these materials were strong enough to detect trace elements at the concentration of 0. 1 wt. % in the sample without interference by sum peaks. Diluted EMI-CH 3 COO can also be used for SEM-EDX quantitative analysis of insulating materials as <b>discharging</b> <b>agents.</b> In contrast, when insulating materials were electrically charged, the obtained spectra contained characteristic X-rays of the insulating materials with low energies and of materials other than the samples such as the sample stage and the collimator in the X-ray detector.

40|$|Textile {{discharge}} printing {{is the most}} versatile and important of {{the methods used for}} introducing design to textile fabrics. In discharge styles, the pattern is produced by the chemical destruction of the original dye in the printed areas. The <b>discharging</b> <b>agents</b> used can be oxidising or reducing agents, acids, alkalis and various salts. However, the most important methods of discharging are based formaldehyde sulphoxylates and thiourea dioxide. Recently, environmental and industrial safety concerns have increased the potential for the use of enzymes in textile processing to ensure eco-friendly production. Formaldehyde sulphoxylate (NaHSO 2.

40|$|Application {{of toxic}} {{antibacterial}} agents is considered necessary to control prevalent fresh water microorganisms that grow in evaporative cooling water systems, but can adversely affect {{the environment and}} human health. However, natural antibacterial water chemistry has been applied in industrial cooling water systems for over 10 years to inhibit microorganisms with excellent results. The water chemistry method concentrates natural minerals in highly-softened water to produce elevated pH and dissolved solids, while maintaining low calcium and magnesium content. The method provides further benefits in water conservation, and generates a small volume of non-toxic natural salt concentrate for cost efficient separation and disposal if required. This report describes the antimicrobial effects of these chemistry modifications in the cooling water environment and the resultant collective inhibition of microbes, biofilm, and pathogen growth.

METHODS SP and non-SP (NSP) cells in the cell line A 549 were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorter. The susceptibility of SP and NSP cells to DDP, 5 -FU, VP 16, NVB and GEM was detected by a drug susceptibility test, and IC 50 s were calculated 24 h afer the chemotherapy; and then afer a 2 -hour IC 50 treatment with 5 chemotherapeutic drugs on the 2 subsets of NSP cells, the intracellular drug levels were determined and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatograph. RESULTS There was no statistical significance in comparison {{of the differences in}} IC 50 s and in intracellular drug levels afer DDP treatment between the 2 subsets (P > 0. 05), (P > 0. 05). However, all IC 50 s of the other 4 drugs were significantly higher in the SP cells than in the NSP cells (P < 0. 01). Afer the chemotherapy, the intracellular drug levels of the other 4 drugs were significantly lower in SP cells than in NSP cells (P < 0. 01).

MethodsThe study population consisted of 144, 526 patients from 733 hospitals that submitted data to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Database in 2007. End points included use of National Quality Forum–endorsed process measures (internal thoracic artery graft; preoperative β-blockade; and <b>discharge</b> β-blockade, antiplatelet <b>agents,</b> and lipid drugs), operative mortality (in-hospital or 30 -day), major morbidity (stroke, renal failure, reoperation, sternal infection, and prolonged ventilation), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons composite score. Procedural volume was analyzed as a continuous variable and by volume strata (450 cases, P <. 0001), and these differences persisted after risk factor adjustment (odds ratio for lowest- vs highest-volume group, 1. 49).

40|$|Ionophoretic {{application}} of ATP to smooth muscle {{cells of the}} rabbit ear artery produced rapid depolarization of the membrane and, {{in the case of}} large doses of ATP, spike potentials or slow oscillatory potentials. The ATP response desensitized rapidly, and required over 70 s for recovery. When the intervals between repetitive {{application of}} ATP were shorter than 70 s, the amplitudes of the ATP responses successively decreased. Ejection of ATP with increasing intensities of current (10 - 15 % of the first) was required to produce successively increasing amplitudes of ATP responses. Repetitive stimulation of perivascular nerves (at intervals of less than 10 s) evoked increasing amplitude of excitatory junction potentials (e. j. p. s). Quinidine (over 5 X 10 (- 5) M) inhibited and theophylline (over 5 X 10 (- 4) M) enhanced the ATP response, with associated depolarization or hyperpolarization of the membrane, respectively. Cocaine (over 10 (- 6) M) depolarized the membrane and enhanced the ATP response. Phentolamine reduced the amplitude of the ATP response with no change in the membrane potential, only when the concentration was extremely high (over 10 (- 4) M). These all therefore appear to represent non-specific interactions with the effects of ATP. Bath application of ATP depolarized the membrane dose dependently and, at concentrations over 5 X 10 (- 7) M, produced spike potentials. The amplitude of electrotonic potentials decreased during the ATP-induced depolarization, thereby suggesting an increase in ionic conductance of the membrane. ADP depolarized the membrane, the effect being weaker than that of ATP. Both AMP and adenosine hyperpolarized the membrane.

Patients reporting penicillin allergy (13 %) were less likely to receive OT trial than those without penicillin allergy (47 % vs. 80 %, p < 0. 001). Adjusting for other factors, penicillin allergy was the largest negative predictor of OT trial (RR 0. 64 [0. 49, 0. 83]).

Previous {{studies have been done}} on the effectiveness of aerosol suppression agents; however, there is very little data related to the potential impacts due to accidental exposure to the <b>agents</b> after <b>discharge</b> into a compartment without a fire, or similarly due to exposure in conjunction with fire suppression.

The research presented in this thesis will focus on comparison of the characteristics of two specific aerosol variants designed for use in a 20 m 3 occupied space. To evaluate the potential for physiological impact, experiments were designed to assess the aerosol systems in fire scenarios similar to those that naval Rapid Response Team (RRT) would experience. Thus, the aerosols were tested in five different scenarios, including fires fuelled by diesel fuel and wood cribs, as well as under cold <b>agent</b> <b>discharge</b> situations. Temperatures in the compartment were monitored throughout each test using 80 Type K thermocouples. The compartment environment and, particularly, evidence of NO¬x, CO, HCN and NH 3 production, were investigated for each situation using Novatech P- 695 and Gastec STR- 800 pre-calibrated tube testing systems. Finally various materials were exposed during the various test situations in order to better assess the potential for corrosion of selected materials due to agent deposition. The thesis includes a detailed description of the experimental design, measurement apparatus and techniques used in the research, as well as key results from each of the tests performed.

The MD- 11 aircraft systems are monitored for proper operation by the Aircraft Systems Controllers (ASC). In most cases, system reconfiguration {{as a result of a}} malfunction is automated. Manual input is required for irreversible actions such as engine shutdown, fuel dump, fire <b>agent</b> <b>discharge,</b> or Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) disconnect. During normal operations, when the cockpit is configured for flight, all annunciators on the overhead panel will be extinguished. This Dark Cockpit immediately confirms to the crew that the panels are correctly configured and that no abnormalities are present. Primary systems annunciations are shown in text on the Alert Area of the Engine and Alert Display (EAD). This eliminates the need to scan the overhead. The MD- 11 aircraft systems can be manually controlled from the overhead area of the cockpit. The center portion of the overhead panel is composed of the primary aircraft systems panels, which include FUEL, AIR, Electrical (ELEC) and Hydraulic (HYD) systems, which are easily accessible from both flight crew positions. Each Aircraft Systems Controller (ASC) has two automatic channels and a manual mode. All rectangular lights are annunciators. All square lights are combined switches and annunciators called switch/lights. Red switch/lights on the overhead (Level 3 alerts) are for conditions requiring immediate crew action. Amber (Level 2 or Level 1 alerts) indicates a fault or switch out of position requiring awareness or crew interaction. Overhead switches used in normal operating conditions will illuminate blue when in use (Level 0 alerts) such as WING ANTI-ICE - ON. An overhead switch/light with BLACK LETTERING on an amber or red background indicates a system failure and that crew interaction is required. A switch/light with blue or amber lettering and a BLACK BACKGROUND indicates a switch out of normal position and that crew action is necessary only if the system is in manual operation...|$|R
40|$|This is the 31 st {{annual review}} of the {{application}} of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This update refers to papers published approximately between August 2014 and July 2015 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in Environmental Analysis 1 that should be {{read in conjunction with}} other related ASUs in the series, namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages; 2 advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques; 3 elemental speciation; 4 X-ray spectrometry; 5 and metals, chemicals and functional materials. 6 In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period included: {{the development of a new}} laser fluorescence instrument for the ultratrace determination of mercury vapour; single particle ICP-MS studies and the coupling of elemental analysers to mass spectrometers for the improved characterisation of carbonaceous aerosols. In the arena of water analysis, methods continue to be developed: for the extraction and preconcentration of elements, As, Cr, Hg and Sb species and determination of elemental constituents in colloidal and NP fractions. Emerging elements of interest include Gd derived from MRI <b>agents</b> <b>discharged</b> at low level from medical facilities in water courses. Instrumental developments reported included the use of MC-ICP-MS for isotopic tracer studies and a review of TXRF techniques and associated preconcentration procedures for trace element analysis. In the period covered by this update several articles have explored the analysis of soil extracts for geochemical prospecting. There has been widening interest in the use of CS-AAS and in the application of techniques capable of direct sample analysis such as slurry sampling ETAAS and ETV-ICP-AES. Portable XRF instrumentation is now being used in many disciplines to quantify trace elements in soils-bringing a need for better transfer of analytical knowledge to non-specialist users-and the growing use of portable XRF in proximal sensing is also noteworthy. Recent research indicates that geological applications still drive many of the instrumental and methodological advances in LA-ICP-MS. Fundamental studies continued to shed light on the processes involved and hence ways of improving the analysis of laser-produced aerosols and to minimise matrix and fractionation effects. A new technique LA-DOF-MS (distance of flight) was described. The utility of LIBS and portable XRF for in situ survey work continues to show promise but issues such as appropriate calibration regimes and data processing protocols will still need to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|This is the 32 nd {{annual review}} of the {{application}} of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This update refers to papers published approximately between August 2015 and June 2016 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in environmental analysis 1 that should be {{read in conjunction with}} other related ASUs in the series, namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages; advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques; elemental speciation; X-ray spectrometry; and metals, chemicals and functional materials. In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period included {{the development of a new}} prototype fluorescence instrument for the ultratrace determination of oxidised mercury species, and coupling of elemental analysers to CRDS alongside the development of FTIR and Raman techniques for the improved characterisation of carbonaceous aerosols. In the arena of water analysis, methods continued to be reported for the speciation of As, Cr and Hg species and, following on from last year, Gd species derived from MRI <b>agents</b> <b>discharged</b> at low level from medical facilities into water courses. Improved methods for the determination of legacy compounds such as organoleads and tins made use of plasma techniques that nowadays are more tolerant of organic solvents. Instrumental developments reported included the use of MC-ICP-MS for isotopic tracer studies and a review of TXRF techniques and associated preconcentration procedures for trace element analysis. In the field of plant and soil analysis, there is a welcome trend in that more workers appear to be optimising their analytical methods (or at least checking their performance, e. g. by analysis of CRMs) even if the main purpose of their study is environmental application rather than fundamental spectroscopy. On-going challenges include: the fact that most speciation methods reported are still too complicated, costly or time consuming, for routine use; the need for more and a wider range of CRMs, especially for speciation analysis and for use with laser-based techniques; and the lack of harmonised analytical methodology, which hinders international environmental regulatory monitoring efforts. In geological applications, a variety of techniques have been employed in the drive towards high resolution multi-elemental imaging of complex solid samples. Recent developments in cell design, aerosol transport and data acquisition for LA-ICP-MS, combined with improvements in ICP mass spectrometer design, provided evidence of its potential for very rapid quantitative 3 D imaging. Elemental and isotope imaging by NanoSIMS enabled accurate U-Pb dating of mineral domains too small for reliable measurements by LA-ICP-MS. Although megapixel synchrotron XRFS is still in its infancy, it too should open up new horizons in the study of trace and major element distributions and speciation in geological materials and offer a complementary method to other imaging techniques. The deployment of ICP-MS/MS technology has resulted in successful method development to overcome several intractable isobaric interferences in the analysis of geological materials by single quadrupole ICP-MS with LA and solution sample introduction. Many more environmental applications using this approach are likely to be reported in future ASUs...|$|R
