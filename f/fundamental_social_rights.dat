2500|$|While free {{movement}} of workers was central to the first European Economic Community agreement, the development of European labour law has been a gradual process. Originally, the Ohlin Report of 1956 recommended that labour standards {{did not need to}} be harmonised, although a general principle of anti-discrimination between men and women was included in the early Treaties. Increasingly, the absence of labour rights was seen as inadequate given the capacity for a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in international trade if corporations can shift jobs and production to countries with low wages. Today, the EU is required under TFEU article 147 to contribute to a [...] "high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States". This has not resulted in legislation, which usually requires taxation and fiscal stimulus for significant change, while the European Central Bank's monetary policy has been acutely controversial during the Eurozone crisis. Under article 153(1), the EU is able to use the ordinary legislation procedure on a list of labour law fields. This notably excludes wage regulation and collective bargaining. Generally, four main fields of EU regulation of labour rights touch (1) individual labour rights, (2) anti-discrimination regulations, (3) rights to information, consultation, and participation at work, and (4) rights to job security. In virtually all cases, the EU follows the principle that member states can always create rights more beneficial to workers. This is because the fundamental principle of labour law is that employees' unequal bargaining power justifies substitution of rules in property and contract with positive social rights so that people may earn a living to fully participate in a democratic society. The EU's competences generally follow principles codified in the Community Charter of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Rights</b> of Workers 1989, introduced in the [...] "social chapter" [...] of the Treaty of Maastricht. Initially the UK had opted-out, because of opposition by the Conservative Party, but was acceded to when the Labour Party won the 1997 general election in the Treaty of Amsterdam.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} central right to health and the figure of {{jurisprudence}} at the biological damage in Italy from a rereading about the Brazilian and Italian juridical ordenament. Initially it is approached the <b>fundamental</b> <b>social</b> <b>right</b> to health in a socio juridical outlook, passing by important socio-historical and constitutional milestones at the search for right to health in Brazil and Italy. It is presented a number of relevant considerations to the Brazilian and Italian juridical ordenament concerning the civil responsibility and damage, making possible {{to go through the}} specific approach on the biological damage and its implications for setting and legitimation. Finally, it is analyzed specific jurisprudence cases from the Court and Supreme Court of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, utilizing the expressions “right to health” and “damage to health” as search arguments on the respective websites of each court, between 20 may 2004 up to 20 may 2009, in other words, the last five years. Thus, it is possible to use the figure of the Italian biological damage as an argument towards to the protection of the right to health in its various meanings, because the essence of this Italian figure is based precisely on the protection of health. Otherwise, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>social</b> <b>right</b> to health is directly related to an essential guarantee for the full development and satisfaction of the life quality, having the center of every living civil rights the be respect for the man, his dignity and their inalienable <b>rights.</b> Thus, <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> imply different levels of obligations: obligations to respect, to protect and fulfill these rights through a legal legitimate and effective instrumental. It is not enough to recognize and declare the right to health, which must also be guaranteed.

40|$|From the Introduction]. The current {{discussion}} on <b>fundamental</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> {{within the context}} of European constitutional reform is stimulating and rich. <b>Fundamental</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> have been at the centre of a rich and imaginative academic and political debate {{since the end of the}} 1980 s and particularly during the 1990 s (see amongst others Däubler 1991; Lord Wedderburn 1995; A. Lyon-Caen and Simitis 1993; Rodríguez-Piñero, Casas 1996). Labour and social security lawyers have intensively participated and contributed to this debate, invoking and stimulating constitutional reform at European level (see especially Bercusson et al. 1996; Blanpain, Hepple, Sciarra, Weiss 1996, and the so called Simitis Report: Commission EC 1999). More recently, the focus of attention on social rights in the European constitution has been on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU) and its prospects for incorporation in Part II of the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (see Kenner 2003 b; Sciarra 2004). Much of the most recent debate on the constitutionalisation of <b>fundamental</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> at the highest normative level of the European legal order has been about the legal relevance and normative weight of EU social rights vis à vis the fundamental market freedoms traditionally guaranteed by the Community economic constitution (Poiares Maduro 1998; Baquero Cruz 2002; Sciarra 2003). The issue of re-balancing negative and positive integration (Scharpf 1999) by protecting <b>fundamental</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> on par with economic freedom and free competition principles has re-gained momentum with the Nice Charter and with its insertion within the new European constitutional Treaty approved by the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference...|$|E

The contributions which the reader will find in the following pages take stock of the current debate on the <b>fundamental</b> status of <b>social</b> <b>rights,</b> and raise a number of interesting perspectives on how to carry that debate forward.

From our bibliographic research, it was concluded that the health administrative model in the Federal Constitution allows the application of the Habermas’ discursive theory premises resulting in an effective improvement of the democratic participation in health administration...|$|R
