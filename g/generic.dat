5|$|Several {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective for treating herpes, including acyclovir, valaciclovir (valacyclovir), famciclovir, and penciclovir. Acyclovir {{was the first}} discovered and is now available in <b>generic.</b> Valacyclovir is also available as a <b>generic</b> and is slightly more effective than aciclovir for reducing lesion healing time.|$|E

5|$|C# has {{explicit}} {{support for}} covariance and contravariance in <b>generic</b> types, unlike C++ which has {{some degree of}} support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is {{marketed as}} <b>generic</b> and under trade names {{including}} Cleocin HCl, Dalacin, Lincocin (Bangladesh), Dalacin, and Clindacin. Combination products include Duac, BenzaClin, Clindoxyl and Acanya (in combination with benzoyl peroxide), and Ziana (with tretinoin).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the FDA {{approved}} a sustained-release formulation of bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, {{intended to be}} taken twice a day (as compared with {{three times a day}} for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA {{approved a}}nother sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in <b>generic</b> form in the United States and Canada. In Canada, <b>generic</b> XR bupropion is distributed by Mylan. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

5|$|Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks, {{described}} by Pixar as a <b>generic</b> 1980s stock car. Strongly resembles a 1978–88 General Motors G-Body {{such as a}} Buick Regal or Chevrolet Monte Carlo.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{available}} as a <b>generic</b> medication and is not very expensive. The wholesale price of a vial is about 0.35 USD.|$|E
5|$|The accident's {{investigation}} {{also brought}} into focus several <b>generic</b> safety issues, such as pressure applied on charter pilots by customers, night flight into airports near mountainous terrain, and {{the ambiguity of}} some Federal Aviation Administration rules.|$|E

5|$|The <b>generic</b> name honors Keigo Mitsukuri, a Japanese {{zoologist}} {{who studied}} at University College London during the 1860s. The specific name honors Alan Owston, an English collector of Asian wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The <b>generic</b> name, Postelsia honors Alexander Philipov Postels, an Estonian-born {{geologist}} {{and artist}} {{who worked with}} Ruprecht, while the specific name, palmaeformis, describes the alga's superficial similarity in appearance to true palms.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many {{amphibia}} originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its <b>generic</b> name in 1833, and also in 1873. The <b>generic</b> name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.|$|E
5|$|The syntax of <b>generic</b> URIs and {{absolute}} URI references was first defined in Request for Comments (RFC) 2396, published in August 1998, and finalized in RFC 3986, published in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, {{and the advent of}} <b>generic</b> programming techniques pioneered by the Standard Template Library, the need for a mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized. In <b>generic</b> programming, it is often difficult or impossible to express types that depend on template parameters, in particular the return type of function template instantiations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Generic</b> Task Type: This layer {{identifies}} the constituent tasks of <b>generic,</b> repetitive processes and the logical dependencies between these tasks.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{according}} to an analysis by the <b>Generic</b> Pharmaceutical Association, <b>generic</b> drugs accounted for 88% of the 4.3 billion prescriptions filled in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} a tree was {{somewhat}} different for different language front ends, and front ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified {{with the introduction of}} <b>GENERIC</b> and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. <b>GENERIC</b> is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front end's intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified <b>GENERIC,</b> in which various constructs are lowered to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The C, C++ and Java front ends produce <b>GENERIC</b> directly in the front end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to <b>GENERIC.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aristotle marked {{two modes}} of {{causation}}: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, both proper and incidental, can be spoken of as actual or potential, and as <b>generic</b> or particular. The same language {{refers to the}} effects of causes, so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes, <b>generic</b> effects to <b>generic</b> causes, and particular effects to particular causes.|$|E
25|$|Prasterone is the <b>generic</b> name of DHEA in English and Italian and its , , and , {{while its}} <b>generic</b> name is {{prasteron}}um in Latin, prastérone in French and its , and prasteron in German.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 84% of {{prescriptions}} in the US {{were filled}} with <b>generic</b> drugs, and in 2014, the use of <b>generic</b> drugs in the United States led to $254 billion in health care savings.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} scandals around the {{approval}} of <b>generic</b> drugs in the late 1980s shook public confidence in <b>generic</b> drugs; there were several instances in which companies obtained bioequivalence data fraudulently, by using the branded drug in their tests instead of their own product, and a congressional investigation found corruption at the FDA, where employees were accepting bribes to approve some <b>generic</b> companies' applications and delaying or denying others.|$|E

25|$|To redress the {{perceived}} imbalance resulting from use of <b>generic</b> he, some authors now adopt a <b>generic</b> she instead, or alternate between she and he. This {{and some other}} {{ways of dealing with}} the problem are described below.|$|E
25|$|We {{have seen}} that forcing can be done using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a poset with a <b>generic</b> subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a <b>generic</b> ultrafilter on B restricts to a <b>generic</b> set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean-valued models are essentially equivalent.|$|E

25|$|In other countries, {{atorvastatin}} calcium {{is made in}} tablet form by <b>generic</b> drug makers {{under various}} brand names including Stator, Atorvastatin Teva, Litorva, Torid, Atoris, Atorlip, Mactor, Lipvas, Sortis, Torvast, Torvacard, Totalip, and Tulip.

25|$|On 5 June 1989, Granada Television {{launched}} a look featuring a translucent pointed G, which rotated into place {{in time to}} the music against a natural scene. When the first ITV <b>generic</b> look was launched, Granada Television refused to adopt it, because the Granada Television logo was incorrectly inserted into the 'V' segment of the logo. The company used a version with its translucent logo shown at the beginning, before continuing with the <b>generic</b> ident and ending with the <b>generic</b> ITV logo.|$|E

25|$|<b>Generic</b> {{operation}} model approach: {{which is}} to devise transformation functions for three primitive operations: insert, delete, and update. This approach needs an operation adaptation process to map application operations to these primitive operations. In this approach, the OT operation model is <b>generic,</b> so transformation functions can be reused for different applications.|$|E
