They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E

5|$|Phan {{was never}} {{known for his}} {{scholarly}} abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity {{that led to his}} quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor Tự Đức. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in Ninh Bình Province, where he punished a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> out of the military and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the Huế court eventually removed Phan from this post.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E

His family's wealth enabled him to attend the independent St Peter's School, York. Such wealth <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> after Terry's of York had advantageously relocated to St Helen's Square, in the centre of York, with business benefiting from the City's intake of 30,000 shoppers and tourists daily as a result of significant developments in rail travel.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen {{to believe that a}} specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as the Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.|$|E
5|$|While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, {{they had}} a strong {{affinity}} for the French. They admired the republican government that <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> from the French Revolution, and they had not forgotten France's aid during the Revolutionary War. When French Ambassador Edmond-Charles Genêt, popularly known as Citizen Genêt, arrived in the United States in April 1793, George Rogers Clark was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the west. Genêt's agent, André Michaux, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the support of Kentuckians toward Clark's expedition. When he gained an audience with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Kentucky Senator John Brown.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{spent the}} rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's {{representative}} and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor Thomas Becket when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques asked her for a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek her views, she provided a moderate perspective on the problem. Matilda explained that she disagreed with Henry's attempts to codify English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rebel}} {{soldiers}} {{had been told}} that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire {{at the front of the}} palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> just a few minutes earlier.|$|E

Morris felt that his problems <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> because he attempted to play excessively on the leg side. He opened his season by punishing the Queenslanders with a score of 253 in a Shield match and then scored 210 against Victoria. In {{the first of these}} innings, Morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team's 400, with the last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting. His Test form was unimpressive though; he started steadily, with 122 runs in the first two Tests, which were won by Australia.|$|E
5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, an expectation <b>had</b> <b>arisen</b> {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this was a response to the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; in some ways, the physical presence of a name acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain of malaria <b>had</b> <b>arisen.</b> The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
