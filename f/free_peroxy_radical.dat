40|$|In the {{atmospheric}} oxidation of organic compounds, <b>free</b> <b>peroxy</b> and oxy <b>radicals</b> {{play a crucial}} role. The traditional view is that <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> react with NO or with other (hydro-) <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals,</b> whereas oxy radicals decompose, undergo a hydrogen shift, or react with O- 2. However, we show in this quantum chemical and statistical-rate investigation {{that the presence of}} a double C=C bond in many (per) oxy radicals formed from isoprene and monoterpenes, the most abundant nonmethane hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere, can result in hitherto neglected ring-closure isomerizations. These processes are shown to be competitive under atmospheric conditions and can substantially alter the predicted oxidation products. As an illustration, the major pathways in the OH-initiated oxidation of beta-pinene are discussed. It is shown that the predominance of the (per) oxy ring-closure routes offers a consistent rationalization for the "anomalously" low observed yields of traditional-pathway oxidation products from this compound. status: publishe...|$|R

Recent laboratory measurements of the rate constants for <b>peroxy</b> radical-peroxy <b>radical</b> reactions show that there are large differences between these rate constants. We present methods of estimating organic <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> self-reaction rate constants from an empirical expression.

40|$|Approximately 500 Tg of 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene (isoprene) is {{emitted by}} {{deciduous}} trees each year. Isoprene oxidation {{in the atmosphere}} is initiated primarily by addition of hydroxyl radicals (OH) to C_ 4 or C_ 1 in a ratio 0. 57 ± 0. 03 (1 σ) to produce two sets of distinct allylic radicals. Oxygen (O_ 2) adds to these allylic radicals either δ (Z or E {{depending on whether the}} allylic radical is cis or trans) or β to the OH group forming six distinct <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> isomers. Due to the enhanced stability of the allylic <b>radical,</b> however, these <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> lose O_ 2 in competition with bimolecular reactions. In addition, the Z-δ hydroxy <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> isomers undergo unimolecular 1, 6 H-shift isomerization. Here, we use isomer-resolved measurements of the reaction products of the <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> to diagnose this complex chemistry. We find that the ratio of δ to β hydroxy <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> depends on their bimolecular lifetime (τ_(bimolecular)). At τ_(bimolecular) ≈ 0. 1 s, a transition occurs from a kinetically to a largely thermodynamically controlled distribution at 297 K. Thus, in nature, where τ_(bimolecular) > 10 s, the distribution of isoprene hydroxy <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> will be controlled primarily by the difference in the relative stability of the <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> isomers.

Intramolecular 1, 6 H-shift isomerization of the Z-δ hydroxy <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> isomers produced from OH addition to C_ 4 is estimated to be ∼ 4 s^(– 1) at 297 K. While the Z-δ isomer is initially produced in low yield, it is continually reformed via decomposition of the β hydroxy <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals.</b> As a result, unimolecular chemistry from this isomer contributes about half of the atmospheric fate of the entire pool of <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> formed via addition of OH at C_ 4 for typical atmospheric conditions (τ_(bimolecular) = 100 s and T = 25 C).

40|$|The {{original}} of NO(X) in {{the summertime}} troposphere over subarctic eastern Canada is investigated by photochemical modeling of aircraft and ground-based measurements from the Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE 3 B). It is found that decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) can account {{for most of the}} NO(X) observed between the surface and 6. 2 km altitude (aircraft ceiling). Forest fires represent the principal source of PAN in the region, implying the same origin for NO(X). There is, however, evidence for an unidentified source of NO(X) in occasional air masses subsiding from the upper troposphere. Isoprene emissions from boreal forests maintain high NO(X) concentrations in the continental boundary layer over eastern Canada by scavenging OH and NO 3, thus slowing down conversion of NO(X) to HNO 3, both in the daytime and at night. This effect is partly compensated by the production of CH 3 CO 3 radicals during isoprene oxidation, which slows down the decomposition of PAN subsiding from the <b>free</b> troposphere. The <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> concentrations estimated from concurrent measurements of NO and NO 2 concentrations during ABLE 3 B are consistent with values computed from our photochemical model below 4 km, but model values are low at higher altitudes.

TORCH I took place during July and August of 2003 in Writtle, Essex, 25 miles northeast of London. TORCH II took place one year later in April and May at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory, 120 miles northeast of London. Originally conceived to compare relatively fresh air masses from London with more processed air masses some distance from London, the two TORCH campaigns rarely experienced wind coming from the London direction. During TORCH I record temperatures hit much of the UK and Europe with ozone mixing ratios exceeding 150 ppbv at the measurement site and <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> having average midday mixing ratios during the heatwave over three times non-heatwave averages. The relationship between the high ozone and <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> mixing ratios is explored. A comparison of measured, modelled and PSS (Photostationary state) <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> for the TORCH I campaign is presented. Although during TORCH II the desired air masses from London did not come {{and there was no}} such heatwave as in TORCH I, the measurement site did experience air masses with a variety of histories. A particular event from the TORCH II field campaign involved high concentrations of propene (3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous or subsequent hourly measurements) at 20 : 00 hours and concomitant five-fold increase in <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> mixing ratio. Radical production is attributed to ozone-alkene reactions and although the importance of such reactions for radical production is well-known, the case study presented represents a clear example occurring in the planetary boundary layer. In order to enhance the capabilities of the PERCA instrument a further inlet was added to it with a view to the seperate measurement of HO 2 from SRiO 2 (the sum of organic <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals).</b> A calibration source for generating HO 2 radicals was built and tested.

The <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> diurnal cycles showed a marked difference between the winter and summer campaigns with maximum concentrations of 12 pptv at midday {{in the summer and}} maximum concentrations as high as 30 pptv (10 min averages) in winter at night.

The <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> concentration shows a distinct anti-correlation with increasing NO x during the daylight hours. At night, <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> increase with increasing NO x indicative of the role of NO 3 chemistry. The average diurnal cycles for net ozone production, N(O 3) show a large variability in ozone production, P(O 3), and a large ozone loss, L(O 3) in summer relative to winter. For a daylight average, net ozone production in summer was higher than winter (1. 51 ± 0. 5 ppbv h ? 1 and 1. 11 ± 0. 47 ppbv h ? 1, respectively). The variability in NO concentration has a much larger effect on N(O 3) than the <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> concentrations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Peroxy</b> <b>radicals,</b> when {{generated}} {{in the presence of}} hindered-amine light stabilizers (HALS), oxidized HALS to produce nitroxides. This reaction, in addition to the scavenging of alkyl radicals by nitroxides, forms a cycle describing HALS as a class of excellent polymer stabilizers. As model systems for the mechanism of the oxidation of HALS, both alkyl peroxy and acyl <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> were produced by photolyzing the photoinitiators, ketones 2, 4 -diphenylpentan- 3 -one and 1 -benzoyl- 1 -hydroxycyclohexane, in oxygen-saturated hexane in the presence of HALS amine I and amino ethers 11 -V. Significant yields of the nitroxide VI were observed in these reactions. Product analysis shows that the chemical yields of nitroxide VI are dependent on the HALS structure and on the electronic properties of <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals,</b> being substantially higher for acylperoxy radicals than for alkyl <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals.</b> ESR analysis shows that the oxidation of HALS amine I to VI was much less temperature dependent than the oxidation of the HALS amino ether 111.

Under the range of conditions encountered the <b>peroxy</b> <b>radical</b> daily maxima varied from 10 to 40 pptv. The diurnal cycles showed an asymmetric shape typically shifted to the afternoon. Using a box model based on the master chemical mechanism the average model measurement agreement was 2. 5 across the campaign.

[HCHO] and the <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> indicative of the importance of HCHO in the remote atmosphere as a HO x source, particularly in the afternoon. The <b>peroxy</b> <b>radicals</b> showed a strong dependence on [NO 2] with a break point at 0. 1 ppbv, where the radicals increased concomitantly with the reactive VOC loading, this is a lower value than seen at representative urban campaigns.

The diel profile of the second missing source peaks in the afternoon and suggests a process that generates RO 2 independently of sun-driven photochemistry, such as ozonolysis of reactive hydrocarbons. The maximum magnitudes of these missing sources (~ 120 and 50 pptv min − 1, respectively) are consistent with previous observations alluding to unexpectedly intense oxidation within forests.
