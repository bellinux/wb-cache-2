5|$|After overhearing a {{government}} radio broadcast with disguised references to nuclear weapons, Lois sneaks on board Air Force One. She manipulates her way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> the Secretary of State, where {{she tells him}} that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and {{makes his way to}} the Fortress of Solitude. There, the spirit of his father, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.|$|E

500|$|As Scully {{arrives on}} the scene, Lambert divides his hostages into [...] "real people" [...] and [...] "monsters", {{claiming}} that Pincus has turned several employees into zombies. Lambert shoots Mark Backus, {{one of the}} purported zombies, {{when he tries to}} disarm him whilst briefly distracted by Mulder. When Lambert demands a camera to broadcast his warning, Scully arranges for a SWAT officer disguised as a cameraman to be sent in the building. Lambert, not knowing that the camera broadcasts only in a closed circuit, tells viewers about Pincus being a monster. As the lights are cut, Lambert forces Mulder to look behind him and see that Pincus, for an instant, is a large insect. Just then, the FBI smashes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> an armored vehicle and kills Lambert before he can open fire.|$|E

500|$|Ritz shunned {{free-standing}} wardrobes due to {{his fear}} of dust settling on them; instead he built cupboards [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> doors matching <b>the</b> panelling. Ritz's ideas of cleanliness and hygiene prompted him to originally have all bedrooms painted in white and all beds made of brass, not wood, for the same reasons. Anything new or potentially useful was available to the guests of the Ritz.|$|R

At the time she worked there, a largely abandoned, run-down wing of the asylum was used to lock up entire hordes of the most insane criminals all at once. When Amanda was young, she was accidentally locked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> the criminals over a holiday weekend.

60|$|A lady obeyed his summons {{and swept}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a most {{unnecessary}} rustling of silk skirts. Mr. Isaacs welcomed her effusively.|$|E
