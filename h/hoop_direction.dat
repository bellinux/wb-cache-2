The aim was to report on the mechanical properties, and failure modes of these stainless steel fiber reinforced polymer composite pipes with a ductile epoxy resin system and to evaluate their performance for potential applications in the offshore industry. The mechanical behavior under quasi-static compression was evaluated experimentally in both axial and radially to the <b>hoop</b> <b>directions,</b> along with the in-plane shear properties. The in-plane mechanical properties were determined by use of resistance strain gauge measurements bonded to the axial and <b>hoop</b> <b>directions</b> of the test samples.

Microscopy, burn-off test, and thickness measurements were performed on the produced test samples to determine the volume fraction of fiber, void content, and thickness. Stainless steel fiber reinforced polymer composite cylindrical pipes with ± 55 layup, and different thickness (three and six layers) were successfully made by the filament winding method. Test results indicate that the steel fiber reinforced polymer composites exhibit a much higher strain-to-failure than a typical UD carbon fiber composite (almost three times) combined with a high stiffness (about 80 GPa).

5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the mandrel and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel. At the same time, the space between the mandrel and outer die walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of weld lines. This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or <b>hoop)</b> <b>direction.</b> The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate.|$|E

However, the railway wheels cannot measure because this it is very large. So it should be measured using a scaled-down model. The problem is, however, how the stress release should be considered. In this analysis, the finite element method (FEM) was applied to estimate the initial stress state using stresses released after cutting a sample obtained by the X-ray method. Railway wheels were studied in this experiment. In the early 1990 s, several railroads in the northeast of the U. S. A. experienced extensive cracking in {{the wheels of the}} commuter trains.

It can be suggested that guessing guess stress release and the redistribution by the FEM analysis is possible. The residual hoop stress of the unused wheel presumed by this research has the residual stress of high compression in the wheel at the center of the rim up to 40 mm depth. It is very safe because the residual stress state is compressive even when a crack occurs, and obstructs the crack’s progress.

The crystal lattice (elastic) strains were measured with neutron diffraction using tubular samples subjected to different combinations of axial load and internal pressure to achieve a range of biaxial stress ratios. Finite element simulations were conducted on virtual polycrystals using loading histories that mimicked the experimental protocols. For this, two-phase microstructures were instantiated based on microscopy images of the grain and phase topologies and on crystallographic orientation distributions from neutron diffraction. Detailed comparisons were made between the measured and computed lattice strains for several crystal reflections in both phases for scattering vectors in the axial, radial and <b>hoop</b> <b>directions</b> that confirm the model's ability to accurate predict the evolving local stress states.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the mechanics of}} the Ring Hoop Tension Test (RHTT), as a means to assess the properties of anisotropic tubes in the <b>hoop</b> <b>direction.</b> This test involves placing a ring extracted from the tube over two close-fitting D-shaped mandrels that are then parted using a universal testing machine. Since the curvature of the ring does not change during loading, the ring undergoes only stretching. We determine the effects of contact pressure, radial stress, and friction between the tube and mandrels using FEA simulations. The effects of the pre-existing thickness eccentricity and of the specimen-making procedure on the recorded RHTT response are also assessed with a combination of experiments and analysis. We tested tubes from Al- 6061 -T 4 with a diameter/thickness ratio of 20. We found that as the friction increases beyond 0. 1 – 0. 15, the state of uniaxial tension is deteriorated, indicating that care must be taken to minimize the tube-mandrel friction. We determined that although these tubes have a relatively large thickness eccentricity (± 4 % of the nominal thickness), this had no effect on the recorded results. We showed that the tubes should not be turned to remove that eccentricity, as the machining process induces damage that is noticeable in the results. We found that the contact pressure and the contact-induced radial stress cause limited deviations from uniaxial tension, comparable to the case of a tube under axial load and internal pressure which is often used for assessing the material properties in the <b>hoop</b> <b>direction.</b> Central in our analyses is the knowledge of the hoop strain field, which was assessed using 3 D Digital Image Correlation.

Due to their superior material properties, such as corrosion-resistance and cost-effectiveness, FRP composite materials have been effectively used {{in a wide variety of}} applications in a number of industries. In recent years, prototype projects in civil infrastructures have demonstrated the effectiveness and the benefits of the use of FRP. However, the performance of FRP-wrapped columns, under severe environmental conditions, has not yet been fully assessed, and thus requires further investigation. ^ The present work investigates the performance of FRP retrofit to columns in terms of their durability. This was accomplished through field monitoring, laboratory tests, and finite element modeling. ^ As part of the field monitoring, temperature data were collected at various locations of the bridge column. Also, visual inspection of the two researched bridges was performed. No evidence of deterioration was detected so far. It was observed that some columns did not receive a final coating while some may present stress concentration due to poor surface smoothing. Also, some columns have experienced damage due to auto accidents; however, it is not clear at this point what effect these may have in the long-term performance. ^ From the corrosion experimental tests, it has been found that FRP has an excellent resistance against aggressive agents even when a single layer is used. From the thermal cycle experiments and numerical simulations, it has been found that minor thermal cycles have no effects on performance of RC-wrapped columns. For large thermal cycles, this study shows some degradation in the ductility in the axial and the <b>hoop</b> <b>directions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of advanced}} composite materials in {{the wide range of}} applications including Space Structures is a great impetus to the development of smart materials. Incorporating these FBG sensors for monitoring the integrity of structures during their life cycle will provide valuable information about viability of the usage of such material. The use of these sensors by surface bonding or embedding in this composite will measure internal strain and temperature, and hence the integrity of the assembled engineering structures. This paper focuses on such a structure, called a composite wound pressure vessel. This vessel was fabricated from the composite material: TRH 50 (a Mitsubishi carbon fiber with a 710 -ksi tensile strength and a 37 Msi modulus) impregnated with an epoxy resin from NEWPORT composites (WDE- 3 D- 1). This epoxy resin in water dispersed system without any solvents and it cures in the 240 - 310 degrees F range. This is a toughened resin system specifically designed for pressure applications. These materials are a natural fit for fiber sensors since the polyimide outer buffer coating of fiber can be integrated into the polymer matrix of the composite material with negligible residual stress. The tank was wound with two helical patterns and 4 hoop wraps. The order of winding is: two hoops, two helical and two hoops. The wall thickness of the composite should be about 80 mil or less. The tank should burst near 3, 000 psi or less. We can measure the actual wall thickness by ultrasonic or we can burst the tank and measure the pieces. Figure 1 shows a cylinder fabricated out of carbon-epoxy composite material. The strain in different directions is measured with a surface bonded fiber Bragg gratings and with embedded fiber Bragg gratings as the cylinder is pressurized to burst pressures. Figure 2 shows the strain as a function of pressure of carbon-epoxy cylinder as it is pressurized with water. Strain is measured in different directions by multiple gratings oriented in both axial and <b>hoops</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R
