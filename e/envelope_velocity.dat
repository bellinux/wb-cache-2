40|$|It was {{recently}} {{shown that the}} bolometric light curves of type II supernovae (SNe) allow an accurate and robust measurement of {{the product of the}} radiation energy in the ejecta, E_r, and the time since the explosion, t, at early phases (t≲ 10 d) of the homologous expansion. This observable, denoted here ET ≡ E_rt is constant during that time and depends only on the progenitor structure and explosion energy. We use a 1 D hydrodynamic code to find ET of simulated explosions of 145 red supergiant progenitors obtained using the stellar evolution code MESA, and relate this observable to the properties of the progenitor and the explosion energy. We show that ET probes only the properties of the <b>envelope</b> (<b>velocity,</b> mass and initial structure), similarly to other observables that rely on the photospheric phase emission. Nevertheless, for explosions where the envelope dominates the ejected mass, M_env/M_ej≳ 0. 6, ET {{is directly related to the}} explosion energy E_exp and ejected mass M_ej through the relation ET ≈ 0. 15 E_exp^ 1 / 2 R_* M_ej^ 1 / 2, where R_* is the progenitor radius, to an accuracy better than 30 %. We also provide relations between ET and the envelope properties that are accurate (to within 20 %) for all the progenitors in our sample, including those that lost most of their envelope. We show that when the <b>envelope</b> <b>velocity</b> can be reasonably measured by line shifts in observed spectra, the envelope is directly constrained from the bolometric light curve (independent of E_exp). We use that to compare observations of 11 SNe with measured ET and <b>envelope</b> <b>velocity</b> to our sample of numerical progenitors. This comparison suggests that many SNe progenitors have radii that are ≲ 500 R_. In the framework of our simulations this indicates, most likely, a rather high value of the mixing length parameter.

In in the continuum limit, {{the dynamics of the}} breathing of DNA is described by the forced-damped nonlinear Schrodinger equation and studied by means of variational method. The analytical solutions are obtained for special cases. It is shown that the breather propagation is decelerated in the presence of damping factor without the external force, while the <b>envelope</b> <b>velocity</b> and the amplitude increase significantly with the presence of external force.

The visual field was examined using program 30 - 2 of the Humphrey field analyser: the mean deviation (MD) and corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD) were calculated as indices for visual field defects.

40|$|An {{investigation}} to deepen {{the connection between}} the family of nonlinear Schrödinger equations and the one of Korteweg-de Vries equations is carried out {{within the context of the}} Madelung's fluid picture. In particular, under suitable hypothesis for the current velocity, it is proven that the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, whose solution is a complex wave function, can be put in correspondence with the standard Korteweg-de Vries equation, is such a way that the soliton solutions of the latter are the squared modulus of the envelope soliton solution of the former. Under suitable physical hypothesis for the current velocity, this correspondence allows us to find envelope soliton solutions of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, starting from the soliton solutions of the associated Korteweg-de Vries equation. In particular, in the case of constant current velocities, the solitary waves have the amplitude independent of the <b>envelope</b> <b>velocity</b> (which coincides with the constant current velocity). They are bright or dark envelope solitons and have a phase linearly depending both on space and on time coordinates. In the case of an arbitrarily large stationary-profile perturbation of the current velocity, envelope solitons are grey or dark and they relate the velocity u 0 with the amplitude; in fact, they exist for a limited range of velocities and have a phase nonlinearly depending on the combined variable x - u 0 s (s being a time-like variable). This novel method in solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation starting from the Korteweg-de Vries equation give new insights and represents an alternative key of reading of the dark/grey envelope solitons based on the fluid language. Moreover, a comparison between the solutions found in the present paper and the ones already known in literature is also presented...|$|E

40|$|An {{exponentially}} expanding Universe, possibly {{governed by}} a cosmological constant, forces gravitationally bound structures to {{become more and more}} isolated, eventually becoming causally disconnected from each other and forming so-called "island universes". This new scenario reformulates the question about which will be the largest structures that will remain gravitationally bound, together with requiring a systematic tool {{that can be used to}} recognize the limits and mass of these structures from observational data, namely redshift surveys of galaxies. Here we present a method, based on the spherical collapse model and N-body simulations, by which we can estimate the limits of bound structures as observed in redshift space. The method is based on a theoretical criterion presented in a previous paper that determines the mean density contrast that a spherical shell must have in order to be marginally bound to the massive structure within it. Understanding the kinematics of the system, we translated the real-space limiting conditions of this "critical" shell to redshift space, producing a projected <b>velocity</b> <b>envelope</b> that only depends on the density profile of the structure. From it we created a redshift-space version of the density contrast that we called "density estimator", which can be calibrated from N-body simulations for a reasonable projected <b>velocity</b> <b>envelope</b> template, and used to estimate the limits and mass of a structure only from its redshift-space coordinates.

The convective velocity field concentrates the magnetic field in sheets and tubular structures in the inter-granular down-flows. Scaling from solar conditions suggests that field strengths as high as 20 kG might be reached locally.

40|$|SummaryIncreasing {{evidence}} suggests functional compartmentalization of interphase nuclei [1]. This includes preferential interior localization of gene-rich and early replicating chromosome regions versus peripheral localization of gene-poor and late replicating chromosome regions [2, 3], association of some active genes with nuclear speckles [4, 5] or transcription “factories” [6], and association of transcriptionally repressed genes with heterochromatic regions [7]. Dynamic changes in chromosome compartmentalization [7 – 9] imply mechanisms for long-range interphase chromatin movements. However, live cell imaging in mammalian cells has revealed limited chromatin mobility [10], described as “constrained diffusion” [11]. None of these studies, though, have examined a chromosome locus undergoing an inducible repositioning between two different nuclear compartments. Here we demonstrate migration of an interphase chromosome site from the nuclear periphery {{to the interior}} 1 – 2 hr after targeting a transcriptional activator to this site.

The observations were carried out with the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope. Among 204 observed objects, 63 detections (36 new) were obtained. We found 4 objects which may be "water fountain" sources (IRAS 15193 + 3132, IRAS 18056 - 1514, OH 16. 3 - 3. 0, and IRAS 18455 + 0448).

40|$|High-resolution (R= 60000) echelle {{spectroscopy}} of the post-AGB supergiant V 5112 Sgr {{performed in}} 1996 - 2012 with the 6 -m telescope BTA has revealed peculiarities {{of the star}} optical spectrum and has allowed the variability of the velocity field in the stellar atmosphere and envelope to be studied in detail. An asymmetry and splitting of strong absorption lines with a low lower-level excitation potential have been detected for the first time. The effect is maximal in BaII lines whose profile is split into three components. The profile shape and positions of the split lines change with time. The blue components of the split absorption lines are shown to be formed in a structured circumstellar envelope, suggesting an efficient dredge-up of the heavy metals produced during the preceding evolution of this star into the envelope. The <b>envelope</b> expansion <b>velocities</b> have been estimated to be 20 and 30 km/s. The mean radial velocity from diffuse bands in the spectrum of V 5112 Sgr coincides with that from the short-wavelength shell component of the NaI D lines, {{which leads to the}} conclusion about their formation in the circumstellar envelope. Analysis of the set of radial velocities Vr based on symmetric absorption lines has confirmed the presence of pulsations in the stellar atmosphere with an amplitude 8 km/s.
