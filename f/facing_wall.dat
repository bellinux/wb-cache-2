5|$|The work {{dates from}} Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is {{regarded}} by art critics as revolutionary {{both as a}} progression of pop art and {{as a work of}} modern art in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, Artist's Studio—Look Mickey, which shows the painting hanging prominently on a <b>facing</b> <b>wall</b> of Lichtenstein's studio.|$|E
25|$|The middle rampart was {{apparently}} rather {{lower than the}} inner rampart, since the middle ditch was rather smaller than the inner ditch.

50|$|The {{blockhouse}} {{has been}} subject to some modifications over the years. Originally the blockhouse did not have windows. Two upper level windows that were cut in the western end-wall before 1916 {{have been replaced by}} a single window, while on the inward <b>facing</b> <b>walls,</b> one upper level window has been enlarged and another added since 1916.

25|$|Opened in 1975, the Shute Park Library is {{the oldest}} of the two {{libraries}} in the system. The building was designed by Will Martin and cost $760,000 to build. With , it is also the smaller of the two locations. The building is triangular in shape, with the north <b>facing</b> <b>wall</b> all glass. Since being expanded in 2013–2014, Shute Park houses over 57,000 litems, ranging from books and videos to audio materials and periodicals. It contains 140 seats and 31 computer terminals.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} {{structure of the}} building itself has {{been the target of}} many complaints, notably due to its poor internal ventilation, and its noticeable lack of exterior windows (there are windows inside the school). This architectural peculiarity is accounted for by the fact that Thornlea was originally intended to be a prototype for an educational model where extrinsic stimuli (such as vegetation, the sky, wildlife) are minimized, while intrinsic stimuli (such as bookshelves, other students in class, computer terminals) are maximized. The idea was that students would then be less distracted and more psychologically conditioned to focus on their studies during the day. However, some classrooms and staff rooms are located {{in the middle of the}} school surrounded by walls. This leads to overheating and poor ventilation in summer. At some point the experiment was abandoned, and a new southern wing was built during the 2000–01 school year, complete with windows for every classroom that has an externally <b>facing</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
500|$|... ´It is {{estimated}} that the aqueduct supplied the city with around [...] {{of water a day}} that took nearly 27 hours to flow from the source to the city. The water arrived in the castellum divisorum at Nîmes – an open, shallow, circular basin 5.5 m in diameter by 1 m deep. It would have been surrounded by a balustrade within some sort of enclosure, probably under some kind of small but elaborate pavilion. When it was excavated, traces of a tiled roof, Corinthian columns and a fresco decorated with fish and dolphins were discovered in a fragmentary condition. The aqueduct water entered through an opening [...] wide, and ten large holes in the <b>facing</b> <b>wall,</b> each [...] wide, directed the water into the city's main water pipes. Three large drains were also located in the floor, possibly to enable the nearby amphitheatre to be flooded rapidly to enable naumachia (mock naval battles) to be held.|$|E

500|$|The Great Tower, or keep, is on {{the south}} side of the {{innermost}} bailey. A roughly square building, four storeys tall, most of its walls are [...] thick, with the exception of its newer northern <b>facing</b> <b>wall,</b> only [...] thick. The Great Tower was constructed in several stages. Originally it was a relatively large gatehouse in the original Norman castle, probably with accommodation over the gateway, before being extended to form the Great Tower in the mid-12th century, although still being used as a gatehouse for the inner bailey. When the innermost bailey was created in the early 13th century, the gateway was then filled in and a new gateway cut into the inner bailey wall just to the east of the Great Tower. Finally, the north side of the tower was rebuilt in the mid-15th century to produce the Great Tower that appears today. The keep has a vaulted basement, [...] high, with Norman wall arcading, and a row of windows along the first floor, since mostly blocked. The arcading echoes that in the chapel, and probably dates from around 1080. The windows and large entrance-way would have looked impressive, but would also have been very hard to defend; this form of tower probably reflected earlier Anglo-Saxon high-status towers and was intended to display lordship. The first floor originally formed a tall hall, [...] across, which was subsequently subdivided into two separate floors.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1909, Bankers Trust {{signed a}} {{long-term}} lease {{agreement with the}} Sampson family, owners of the Stevens Building; lease was preferred to purchase due to high price of Wall Street land. Located on the same Wall-Nassau block as the Gillender Building, the L-shaped, seven-story Stevens Building wrapped around it and possessed far longer facades on both Wall and Nassau Streets. Initially, the press reported that Bankers Trust planned to build a 16-story office building wrapping around the Gillender Building, with the two bottom floors outfitted to be [...] "one of the finest banking rooms in the city". Later, it was disclosed {{that they had been}} negotiating purchase of Gillender Building since April 1909; the deal would have consolidated enough Wall Street land for a new tower with [...] frontage <b>facing</b> <b>Wall</b> Street and [...] on Nassau Street.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{images of}} Durga are seen {{represented}} in the temple, notably on the sanctum and also on the exterior surface of the east <b>facing</b> <b>wall.</b> The shalabhanjikas or two female dwarapalakas guard the doorway, which {{are also in the}} form of the Goddess. The temple is stated to generate [...] "primal energy" [...] in consonance with the characteristics of deity of Durga; the dwarapalika on the left has a bow in her hand and that on the right has a sword. The sanctum depicts Durga on the back wall standing on a lotus, in what is termed as [...] "sambhaga" [...] (standing) posture with four hands, with the upper hands carrying a shankha and a chakra and one lower hand is in an abhaya mudra (posture of a blessing) and the other hand is on hip. The ornament worn is a breast-band without any halter straps. She is surrounded by devotees with a devotee on her left about to decapitate himself as an offering (in another version it is inferred as a flower offering by the devotee), and another devotee (with tied tresses exposing his neck to be cut} on her right mutilating his body parts, also in offering; this was a Hindu rite associated with the Kapalikas. This type of offering to a goddess, though ghastly, is seen in many Durga temples; it is related to the myth of her role as Mahisasuramardini (slayer of demon Mahishasura). Durga images in niches have depictions of the goddess standing on a buffalo head representing the Mahishasura.|$|E

60|$|In Dubedat's studio. Viewed {{from the}} large window the outer door is in the wall on the left at the near end. The door leading to the inner rooms is in the {{opposite}} wall, at the far end. The <b>facing</b> <b>wall</b> has neither window nor door. The plaster on all the walls is uncovered and undecorated, except by scrawlings of charcoal sketches and memoranda. There is a studio throne (a chair on a dais) {{a little to the}} left, opposite the inner door, and an easel to the right, opposite the outer door, with a dilapidated chair at it. Near the easel and against the wall is a bare wooden table with bottles and jars of oil and medium, paint-smudged rags, tubes of color, brushes, charcoal, a small last figure, a kettle and spirit-lamp, and other odds and ends. By the table is a sofa, littered with drawing blocks, sketch-books, loose sheets of paper, newspapers, books, and more smudged rags. Next the outer door is an umbrella and hat stand, occupied partly by Louis' hats and cloak and muffler, and partly by odds and ends of costumes. There is an old piano stool on the near side of this door. In the corner near the inner door is a little tea-table. A lay figure, in a cardinal's robe and hat, with an hour-glass {{in one hand and a}} scythe slung on its back, smiles with inane malice at Louis, who, in a milkman's smock much smudged with colors, is painting a piece of brocade which he has draped about his wife.|$|E

30|$|A “cantilever beam-articulated beam” {{model has}} been {{established}} for the overlying strata at the LLTCC coal mining face. Based on the model, the working resistance of the LLTCC hydraulic support has been determined. Furthermore, the law of top coal and roof movement at the LLTCC coalface has been obtained. In front of <b>face</b> coal <b>wall,</b> the main characteristics of top coal and roof movement are mainly horizontal compressive deformation under abutment pressure; {{in the rear of}} the <b>face</b> coal <b>wall,</b> the characteristics of roof movement are mainly fractures and subsidence, the characteristics of top coal movement are mainly vertical caving movements caused by roof fractures and subsidence. The speed of horizontal deformation of the top coal and roof in front of the <b>face</b> coal <b>wall</b> under abutment pressure is much smaller than that of the vertical subsidence of the top coal and roof after fracture at the rear of the <b>face</b> coal <b>wall.</b>|$|R
40|$|Resonant {{vibrations}} {{have been}} stimulated in thin metal plates using a non-contacting electromagnetic driver. A sinusoidal force was applied in a swept frequency fashion {{and the resulting}} surface displacements were monitored {{through the use of}} an acoustic microphone. It has been found that the presence of a fatigue crack in the sample causes a broadening of the second resonance peak. The Q factors of the resonance curves were determined and are directly correlated with the presence of fatigue cracks in the samples. The broadening of the curves is explained in terms of a microslipping at the crack <b>face</b> <b>walls</b> which reduces the amplitude of the resonant vibration by increasing the damping of the system. A comparison is made between the resonance characteristics of fatigue damaged and notched samples, where the stiffness of the two systems is nearly constant while the interaction between crack <b>face</b> <b>walls</b> is eliminated in the latter.

40|$|The {{formation}} of deformation zones at the backfill soil of wrap <b>faced</b> retaining <b>wall</b> {{is governed by}} the shear strain accumulation. The performance of reinforced soil wall can be improved by observing the location of peak shear strains at dif-ferent depths. The wrap <b>faced</b> reinforced soil <b>walls</b> are modeled using FLAC 3 D. In modeling of wrap <b>faced</b> soil retaining <b>walls,</b> soil is modeled as elasto-plastic with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion modified with hyperbolic soil modulus model. The geotextiles are modeled by using shell structural element. The interfaces are used between shell elements and soil elements for proper interaction. The wall is formed in layers with facing support and after placing last layer the facing support is removed. The octahedral shear strains are determined along length of backfill at different elevations of the wrap <b>faced</b> <b>walls.</b> Horizontal displacements and vertical settlements are also determined to understand the location of shear deformations of reinforced zone and unreinforced backfill. Three deformation modes: localized deformation near face, relative movement of reinforced zone from retained zone and relative compaction at end of reinforcement are observed. 1...|$|R
