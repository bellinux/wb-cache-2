40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a {{research}} programme in which the cutting performance {{of a new generation}} of ceramic cutting tool material is evaluated using the turning process. In part one, the performance of commercial Kyon 2000 sialon ceramic inserts is studied when machining a hardened alloy steel under a wide range of cutting conditions. The aim is to formulate a pattern of machining behaviour in which tool wear is related to a theoretical interpretation of the temperatures and stresses generated by the chip-tool interaction. The work involves a correlation of wear measurement and metallographic examination of the wear area with the measurable cutting data. Four main tool failure modes are recognised: (a) flank and crater wear (b) grooving wear (c) deformation wear and (d) brittle failure Results indicate catastrophic edge breakdown under certain conditions. Accordingly in part two, the edge geometry is modified to give a double rake tool; a negative/positive combination. The results are reported for a range of workpiece materials under orthogonal cutting conditions. Significant improvements in the cutting performance are achieved. The improvements are explained by a study of process parameters; cutting forces, chip thickness ratio, chip contact length, temperature distribution, stress distribution and chip formation. In part three, improvements in tool performance are shown to arise when the <b>edge</b> <b>chamfer</b> on a single rake tool is modified. Under optimum <b>edge</b> <b>chamfer</b> conditions a substantial increase in tool life is obtained compared with the commercial cutting geometry...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{present in}} vitro study aimed {{to assess the}} effects of root surface {{mechanical}} instrumentation on the marginal integrity and adaptation of resin composite crowns. The following null hypotheses were tested: no differences exist between finish line and 1) marginal gap or 2) marginal microleakage before and after manual mechanical periodontal maintenance. A total of 56 intact human mandibular molars were randomly distributed into four groups and subjected to standardized tooth preparations for indirect composite crowns with different marginal finish lines (90 ° shoulder, beveled 90 ° shoulder, feather <b>edge,</b> <b>chamfer).</b> One-half of the specimens {{was used as a}} control and remained untreated, and the remaining half was subjected to root surface procedures simulating five years of semestral mechanical supportive periodontal treatment. The marginal gap and microleakage were evaluated and statistically analyzed. The specimens used as controls showed lower mean marginal gaps than those subjected to the simulated periodontal treatment, whereas the latter showed lower microleakage than the control crowns. Statistically significant differences were recorded for both the experimental variables. The root surface procedures resulted in altered surfaces of the composite crowns. The marginal gap increased after the treatment, whereas the marginal microleakage was reduced. The 90 ° shoulder and the chamfer preparation could be considered a viable option to fabricate composite crowns, but the beveled 90 ° shoulder and the feather edge should not be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the behavior of an <b>edge</b> <b>chamfer</b> on the resulting crushing response of flat laminated composite strips. The effects of variables such as chamfer angle, stacking sequence and material system were addressed. In the present study the material systems used was Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. Chamfer angles of 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° {{were used in the}} present study to simulate the trigger mechanism. Laminate stacking sequences of [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N (N= 4, 8 and 12), were studied using Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. In addition Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy specimens were fabricated with a [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S stacking sequence and tested. Monotonic and cyclic load-unload tests were conducted on an MTS electromechanical machine at a quasi-static stroke rate of 10 - 3 in/s. Monotonic tests were also conducted at stroke rates of 10 - 1 in/s, but restricted to the specimens with 45 ° chamfer specimen. Failure modes observed in [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S specimens included delamination induced lamina/ sub-laminate bending mode, laminate bending mode, brittle fracture mode, catastrophic failure mode, and mixed mode failures. Lamina/sub-laminate bending mode and brittle fracture mode were observed to be the most dominant failure modes, with corresponding high energy absorption. The amount of energy absorption through delamination in cyclic load-unload test was investigated using image analysis and geometry calculations. With an increase in chamfer angle, the peak load, in the load-displacement curve, increased for the 12 and 8 ply laminates, while no significant differences were observed in the 4 viii ply laminates. The load eccentricity due to chamfering forced a global bending dominated failure mode in 4 ply laminates, which resulted in the observed apparent insensitivity to chamfer angle. Due to the 0 ° fiber orientation in [0 º]N stacking sequence, a higher load carrying capacity was observed in comparison to [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S. However, the energy absorption in [± 45 º]N was higher owing to the crushing mode of failure rather than the delamination induced splaying/bending mode observed in [0 º]N laminates. Results from the load-displacement curve showed that the Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy had a higher load carrying capacity than carbon-fiber/epoxy, and this was attributed to the crushing mode being dominant in the fiberglass/epoxy specimens. Although, both fiberglass and carbon-fiber are brittle by nature, there was a shift in the initial load response from linear to non-linear behavior in the load-displacement curve of the [± 45 º]N stacking sequence. The sustained crush region of the load-displacement curves for the [0 º]N laminates exhibited high serrations typically associated with load oscillations in brittle failure. Cyclic load tests revealed the sequence of failure mechanisms in chamfered laminates. While delamination was observed to be the primary driving mechanism, the estimation of energy dissipated due to the same was observed to be small in comparison to the overall energy absorbed...|$|E

Apart from trimming and flushing, they can be used for jointing, rounding <b>edges,</b> <b>chamfering,</b> routing grooves and dados, dovetails, even mortise and tenons. A modern laminate trimmer can perform almost any task that a larger handheld router can do, with the caveat that the smaller machine may be limited in the size of bit that can physically fit within its collet and the base plate. Larger bits, e.g. those that fit a 1/2-inch collet or those with larger blade diameters than the laminate trimmer's smaller baseplate hole, cannot be used at all. The reduced power of a laminate trimmer (3/4 to 1 hp, as opposed to a typical router's 1-3 hp) may also make it unsuitable for heavy-duty router work.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{structures}} is often optimized by gradually decreasing the thickness as the load carrying requirement on the components decreases. Such structures in composites {{are made of}} tapered laminates involving dropping of plies. However, these structures are often prone to early delamination initiation, which leads to premature failure of the component and therefore limits its useful life. In the past, many routes to circumvent this problem have been evolved, {{such as the use}} of adhesive film layers or interleaving the dropped plies between continuous ones. In this work, a novel technique of ply <b>edge</b> <b>chamfering</b> has been developed and employed in the specimen fabrication. Comparisons have been drawn between similarly configured specimens, with and without chamfered ply drops. Static and fatigue test results have shown remarkable improvements, both in terms of complete suppression of delamination around ply drops and in realizing 14. 5 – 77. 6 % higher strength levels in tapered composite test coupons. The experimental data along with their comparative cases are presented.

40|$|AbstractThe {{high heat}} flux {{areas on the}} {{vertical}} divertor targets in the ITER tokamak will consist of cuboid tungsten monoblocks bonded to copper cooling tubes. Three-dimensional ion orbit modelling {{is used to calculate}} the heating of tungsten monoblocks during ELMs at the inner vertical target, where the highest surface energy densities are expected. The presence of thin gaps between monoblocks results in exposed edges onto which the heat flux can be focused. ELM ions are focused by their gyromotion onto the magnetically shadowed, long toroidal edges of the monoblocks. The risk of monoblock edge melting is greater than the risk of full surface melting on the plasma-wetted zone. Alternative shaping solutions such as <b>edge</b> <b>chamfering,</b> filleting, and poloidal beveling do not show promise; the melt zone simply migrates to other locations on the monoblocks. Without ELM mitigation, there is a marginal risk of edge melting due to uncontrolled ELMs in the pre-nuclear phase of ITER operation, and an absolute certainty of it in the burning nuclear phase. To avoid edge melting altogether, the surface energy density would have to limited to less than 0. 15 MJ/m 2...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDelamination is a {{major problem}} in contour milling of fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) causing scrap or rework. Today, delamination avoidance limits overall productivity and tool life. Damage of the top layer of a composite structure is initiated if fibers are not cut during first engagement of the cutting edge, but deflected. Generated cracks propagate due to recurrent contact of fibers with the rotating tool. In contrast, when laser cutting FRP, the heat input often leads to an extensive heat-affected zone (HAZ), particularly in case of large laminate thickness and high energy input. Combination of both processes is a promising approach to overcome the mentioned disadvantages. Experiments indicate that pre-scoring of the top layer is possible with negligible HAZ for FRP materials using proper laser parameters, especially low energy input per unit length. Positioning of the laser scored kerf along the contour to be manufactured by the subsequent milling tool prevents crack propagation along the fiber direction even with a heavily worn milling tool at increased feed rate. Furthermore, laser pre-scoring eliminates protruding fibers and allows for <b>edge</b> <b>chamfering.</b> The process understanding is enhanced using simulation of the laser pre-scoring, particularly considering heat conduction and forced convection, as well as by presenting a model for the mechanism of delamination prevention...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a method of strain {{measurements}} under multi-axial stress condition. By adopting the cube specimen, we can apply the load different from each other in three directions. At the triaxial test, six steel brushes covered the specimen, and there was no space to put wire strain gages or displacement devices on the surfaces of the specimen. Therefore, the cube specimen with <b>chamfered</b> <b>edges</b> was selected to measure strains by utilizing the <b>chamfered</b> <b>edges.</b> Six pairs of displacement measuring devices were set on the <b>chamfered</b> <b>edges</b> of the specimen in three directions (α, β, γ) as shown in Fig. 2. The deformation in a specific direction was measured as the sum of the outputs from a pair of displacement devices placed in the diagonal and opposite edges in the same direction of the specimen. The strains, ε_X, Ε_Y and E_Z in X, Y and Z directions can be written in the equation (10), as the terms higher than the second order are negligibly small. The experimental strains that were measured in the manner described above are compared with the strains that were measured with wire strain gages mounted on its sides, both in the uniaxial compression test of the same specimen. The stress-strain relations of the two were almost the same, so that the validity of the method of strain measurement proposed in this study is experimentally proved...|$|R
