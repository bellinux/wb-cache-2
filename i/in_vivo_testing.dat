5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>testing,</b> {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E

500|$|The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>testing,</b> and {{vivisection}} {{have similar}} denotations but different connotations. Literally, [...] "vivisection" [...] means the [...] "cutting up" [...] {{of a living}} animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica defines [...] "vivisection" [...] as: [...] "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals", although dictionaries {{point out that the}} broader definition is [...] "used only by people who are opposed to such work". The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death. The word [...] "vivisection" [...] is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term [...] "animal experimentation".|$|E

Analysis of disc test results suggested that the gentamicin disc is not adequate for testing the susceptibility of all bacteria to sisomicin or tobramycin. <b>In</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>tests</b> did not confirm all specifics of in vitro tests; results of <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>tests</b> indicated that sisomicin {{may be the most}} active.

5000|$|Intestinal {{permeability}} is {{a measurement}} of intestinal mucosal barrier function and {{is defined as}} [...] "the facility with which intestinal epithelium allows molecules to pass through by non-mediated passive diffusion." [...] Permeability in this respect is mostly related to the measurable passage of ions and small inert molecules. Standard methods for measurement include tissue electrical resistance for in vitro testing and passage of ingested inert molecules of specific molecular weights into the urine for <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>testing.</b> For example, <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>testing</b> using lactulose / mannitol consists of ingesting 5 g lactulose and 2 g mannitol followed by determination of urinary concentrations of lactulose and mannitol 5 hours after ingestion. The percentage lactulose excretion and the lactulose mannitol ratio in the urine are calculated and used {{as a measure of}} intestinal permeability.|$|E

40|$|Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is an {{important}} vegetable comodity in Indonesia, but its production rate is still low. One {{of the factors that}} cause the low productivity is plant diseases.  Damping-off disease often causes the damage of cucumber plant caused by a fungus that lives in the soil as soilborne disease, Phytium sp.  The controlling effort of this disease have been done, for example using Trichoderma sp. as bio-agent, but the utilization of the bio-agent still is not practical so it is difficult to be applied in field. The pellet formula is more effective to be implemented because of the small size and easily moved. The purpose of this research was to produce the pellet formulation with active material of Trichoderma sp.   with rich nutritious content, cheap and easy carrier. This research used two tests, in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test.</b>   The <b>in</b> vitro test used six different pellet formulations, DAT, UAT, TAT, PAT, DDS and ATS.
