5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
25|$|We hate {{poetry that}} has a palpable design upon us—and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not agree, seems to put its hand in its {{breeches}} pocket. Poetry should be great & unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that reason}} alone cannot {{determine}} whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not know the}} outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.|$|E

50|$|Premise Fourteen: From birth on, we are {{individually}} and collectively enculturated to hate life, hate the natural world, hate the wild, hate wild animals, hate women, hate children, hate our bodies, hate and fear our emotions, hate ourselves. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not hate the world, we could not {{allow it to be}} destroyed before our eyes. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not hate ourselves, we could not allow our homes—and our bodies—to be poisoned.|$|R

25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not understand the physics involved.|$|E
25|$|Sampling schemes may {{be without}} {{replacement}} ('WOR'—no element can be selected {{more than once}} in the same sample) or with replacement ('WR'—an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not return the fish to the water (e.g., if we eat the fish), this becomes a WOR design.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E

6000|$|That same {{afternoon}} we were arrested, {{and here we}} are, ready to die <b>if</b> <b>we</b> must, but I swear that I have told you the truth, and I ask you, {{in the name of}} justice, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have <b>done</b> anything wrong, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not act like loyal and true citizens, even though we were pitted against an emissary of the devil? ...|$|R

25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know exactly {{what is going to}} come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E
25|$|Satisfactory {{as it may}} be to note {{his general}} {{acceptance}} for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will be wise not to ignore. I have {{on more than one occasion}} brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E

500|$|Williams felt music lacked energy, citing Limp Bizkit's [...] "Nookie" [...] as {{the last}} {{energetic}} record. Williams suggested his engineer, Andrew Coleman, to [...] "put the drums and bass on the right, keys in the middle, and the mothafucking guitar and backgrounds on the left". Coleman denied his request, saying, [...] "those systems were different back then. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that, you'll be in a club and all you will hear {{on one side of}} the club is drums and on the other side, just chords." ...|$|E
60|$|True, once I {{ventured to}} ask my {{companion}} where he thought we were going, to which he replied, much to my surprise, that he didn't know and didn't care; that it was quite certain <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not go forward we could not expect to get on, {{and that in the}} ordinary course of things <b>if</b> <b>we</b> proceeded we should undoubtedly come to something. To this I replied, in a meditative tone, that there was much truth in the observation, and that, at any rate, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not come to something, something would certainly come to us.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2013, Aymond {{issued a}} {{statement}} of regret that his predecessor, Archbishop Philip Hannan, and the local church leadership ignored the arson attack on a local gay bar that killed 32 people 40 years earlier. Aymond wrote to Time magazine that [...] "In retrospect, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not release a statement we should {{have to be in}} solidarity with the victims and their families....

500|$|In {{reply to}} this objection, some utilitarians have {{put forward a}} [...] "radical proposal"; {{although}} they accept utilitarianism as the correct moral theory, {{it would be more}} beneficial <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not proclaim this fact, and keep it a well-guarded secret. [...] "Utilitarianism would then become an esoteric doctrine, accepted by only a few philosophers who would, if challenged, deny its existence in public.". This form of Utilitarianism (commonly named as Government House utilitarianism), whilst having historically held traction (Mill's publications being in the 19th century), no longer presents such a convincing case in light of modern education levels and opportunities.|$|E
500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, I will tell you this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E
500|$|Pacquette {{earned a}} call-up to the Dominica {{national}} {{team for the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification CONCACAF First Round match against Barbados on 6 February 2008. Barbados went into the match as heavy favourites but fell behind to Pacquette's goal on his international debut, which finished as a 1–1 draw. After making his debut, manager Christopher Ericson said [...] "He is great in front of goal, powerful and full of effort and work. I only {{hope that we can}} get him some more support up front in the next game – <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> I am sure we can win it". He also played in the 1–0 defeat in the second leg on 26 March.|$|E

500|$|That We Can Play was {{recorded}} {{with a single}} stereo Pro Tools track and [...] "outboard, secondhand vintage synths and sequencers". Ford explained {{the process of making}} each song in an interview with XLR8R: [...] "It's almost like we just sit down with gear and are like, 'Whoa, this sounds sweet,' and then we'll make a beat, and be like, 'What <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this?' and something comes out and we move from there. Where it gets really complex—and you can't be a slacker—is you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks—and it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work." ...|$|E
500|$|Changes {{brought on}} by the {{exponential}} growth of human population (at the time of the book's publication, over 6 billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years) and the worldwide scale of resource consumption, have altered the picture, however. [...] Ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed (since the 1980s) nature's capacity for regeneration. [...] We are now using more than 125% of nature's yearly output. [...] "If civilization is to survive, it must live on the interest, not the capital of nature" [...] (129). [...] He concludes that [...] "now is our chance to get the future right"—the collapse of human civilization is imminent <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not act now to prevent it (132).|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
