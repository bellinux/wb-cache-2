5|$|Surviving {{letters from}} the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to {{celebrate}} the Easter Mass {{and to deal with}} pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor kept him from attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good.</b> He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.|$|E
5|$|The town is sited on {{the hills}} {{adjoining}} the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.|$|E
5|$|Thored's {{relationship}} with the English monarchy under Æthelred II seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good.</b> Ælfgifu, the first wife of King Æthelred II, was probably Thored's daughter. Evidence {{for this is that}} in the 1150s Ailred of Rievaulx in his De genealogia regum Anglorum wrote that the wife of Æthelred II was the daughter of an ealdorman (comes) called Thored (Thorth). Historian Pauline Stafford argued that this marriage was evidence that Thored had been a local rather than royal appointment to the ealdormanry of York, and that Æthelred II's marriage was an attempt to woo Thored. Stafford was supported in this argument by Richard Fletcher.|$|E

To determine the financial performance Rokan Hulu District Government used the financial ratio analysis of the region, especially the current ratio, cash ratio, debt to equity ratio, and the ratio of debt to income areas. The results showed that in 2010 the current ratio <b>is</b> less <b>good,</b> but the current ratio in 2011 - 2014 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> so that the Government Rokan Hulu is able to repay short-term debt through current assets. Cash ratio in 2010 showed less well, whereas in 2011 - 2014 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> this shows the Government Rokan Hulu is still able to satisfy the debt that must be met with existing cash and securities. Debt to equity ratio in 2010 - 2014 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> where it <b>is</b> marked by the trend of the ratio is less than 1 (one) year after year.

5|$|Various feeding {{behaviours}} were proposed before {{more complete}} remains of Deinocheirus were known, {{and it was}} early on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal with giant arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz found that the hands of Deinocheirus were unsuited for grasping, but could instead {{have been used to}} tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky compared the forelimbs of Deinocheirus to sloths, leading him to hypothesise that Deinocheirus was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the ecological niches for Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that Deinocheirus had the largest vertical feeding range due to its hip height, and specialised in eating high foliage.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{was back}} in Paris in May 1147 {{to meet with the}} new pope, Eugene III; among the issues {{probably}} discussed was Theobald's dispute with Bernard of St David's. Relations at this time between Theobald and Stephen seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> but when Eugene summoned the English bishops to the Council of Rheims in April 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated: Chichester, Hereford and Norwich. Despite having been specifically refused permission Theobald sneaked away in a fishing boat, presumably accompanied by Gilbert Foliot, who attended the council with him. Theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king: chiefly his obedience to the pope's order commanding his attendance, but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected Archbishop of York, Henry Murdac, in the disputes between York and Canterbury. Murdac was known to be close to his fellow Cistercian Eugene.|$|E

The French team was mostly represented by English expatriates while the English team was represented by Devon & Somerset Wanderers Cricket Club, so was not nationally selected.

25|$|Indo-Ugandan {{relations}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> since Uganda's independence {{except during}} {{the regime of}} Idi Amin. Amin in 1972 expelled over 55,000 people of Indian origin and 5,000 Indians who had largely formed the commercial and economic backbone of the country accusing them of exploiting native Ugandans. Since the mid-1980s when President Yoweri Museveni came to power, relations have steadily improved. Today some 20,000 Indians and PIOs live or work in Uganda. Ethnic tensions between Indians and Ugandans have been a recurring issue in bilateral relations given the role of Indians in the Ugandan economy.|$|E

25|$|Derbyshire Phantoms {{needed to}} win {{to have a chance}} of {{qualifying}} for the quarter-finals – and did it, in a last-over finish. Nottinghamshire Outlaws batted first, and Will Smith and Chris Read made 51 and 44 not out respectively. The two where the only two Nottinghamshire batsmen to pass 20, and their contributions lifted the hosts to 147 for 8. Michael di Venuto and Luke Sutton took Derbyshire to 92 for 1 before Mark Ealham and Samit Patel chipped away at Derbyshire's batting. Four of Nottinghamshire's bowlers conceded less than 7 an over – which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> enough. However, Greg Smith conceded 40 runs, captain Sutton anchored the chase with 61 not out in 54 balls as Derbyshire won with two balls to spare.|$|E

25|$|Generally, however, {{relations}} between UNIFIL and local residents <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good.</b> UNIFIL forces have offered various {{services to the}} locals, and have introduced elements of their own culture. India's UNIFIL contingent has carried out small-scale development projects, operates medical and dental clinics, veterinary care for local animals, and also runs entertainment camps for children and yoga classes. The Indonesian UNIFIL contingent (INDOBATT) also gained good reputation among the South Lebanese people, and this is achieved through the Civil Military Coordination (CIMIC) program implemented by the contingent. This program includes many society-based activities, such as conducting computer course for local residents, medical assistance and also technical assistance in rebuilding social facilities. The French contingent has taught poetry courses to local Francophone residents as well as French vocabulary and grammar to primary school students in 15 schools, the Italian contingent has given cooking lessons, the South Korean contingent has taught Taekwondo, and the Chinese contingent has taught Tai chi.|$|E

25|$|He was {{probably}} the eldest child of Sancho VI and Sancha, daughter of Alfonso VII of León, born soon after their marriage, probably in Tudela, their usual residence. He was the elder brother of Berengaria, who was married to Richard the Lionheart, King of England in 1191 {{on the island of}} Cyprus {{on the way to the}} Holy Land for the Third Crusade. Sancho and Richard were reputed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> friends and close allies, even before the marriage brought them together. The French took advantage of Richard's captivity in Germany and captured certain key fortresses of the Angevin dominions including Loches. When Richard returned to his continental lands in 1194, the knights of Sancho were besieging the castle for him. As soon as Richard arrived though, Sancho was forced to return to Navarre at the news of the death of his father. He was crowned in Pamplona on 15 August.|$|E
25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers who would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> commanders {{had been killed in}} the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire began September {{by coming}} {{close to a}} Championship victory, but failed to push home, {{finishing}} {{with a total of}} 277 for 6 chasing 280 to win at Riverside Ground in Durham. Their National League run of four victories also came to an end, as Surrey Lions bowled them out for 88 and took an eight-wicket win, but they bounced back two days later to beat Leicestershire Foxes and to go fourth in the National League table. A Championship draw with Leicestershire followed, and then a League win and a Championship draw against Yorkshire – the former sent them briefly third in the League, before Warwickshire Bears recorded two successive wins to go four points ahead with a game to play. On 24 September, Derbyshire completed their first win in 22 Championship matches, after beating Somerset at The County Ground, Taunton, but the following day saw their five-match unbeaten streak broken with a 135-run loss to Somerset to see them to fifth place in the League. Even a win would probably not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> enough to promote, however, as Warwickshire Bears in third place had a much better net run rate.|$|E

25|$|In 1806 he {{negotiated}} the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794–95 {{because he felt}} it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> for business, Jefferson was unhappy {{that it did not}} end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812. Monroe was severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of Sassanid rule in 224 an orthodox Pars-oriented Zoroastrian tradition would play an important part in influencing and lending legitimization to the state until its collapse in the mid-7th century. After Ardashir I had deposed the last Parthian King, Artabanus V, he sought the aid of Tansar, a herbad (high priest) of the Iranian Zoroastrians to aid him in acquiring legitimization for the new dynasty. This Tansar did by writing to the nominal and vassal kings in different regions of Iran to accept Ardashir I as their new King, most notably in the Letter of Tansar, which was addressed to Gushnasp, the vassal king of Tabarestan. Gushnasp had accused Ardashir I of having forsaken tradition by usurping the throne, and that while his actions 'may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> for the World' they were 'bad for the faith'. Tansar refuted these charges in his letter to Gushnasp by proclaiming that not all of the old ways had been good, and that Ardashir was more virtuous than his predecessors. The Letter of Tansar included some attacks on the religious practices and orientation of the Parthians, who did not follow an orthodox Zoroastrian tradition but rather a heterodox one, and so attempted to justify Ardashir's rebellion against them by arguing that Zoroastrianism had 'decayed' after Alexander's invasion, a decay which had continued under the Parthians and so needed to be 'restored'.|$|E
