5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South {{by the tens of}} thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} Emperor, Domitian's {{role in the}} Flavian government was largely ceremonial. In June 71, Titus returned triumphant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Judaea. Ultimately, the rebellion had {{claimed the lives of}} over 1 million people, a majority of whom were Jewish. The city and temple of Jerusalem were completely destroyed, its most valuable treasures carried off by the Roman army, and nearly 100,000 people were captured and enslaved.|$|E
5|$|In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was {{succeeded by}} two {{legitimate}} sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, {{turned on his}} brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated {{a division of the}} country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display. The populares party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E
