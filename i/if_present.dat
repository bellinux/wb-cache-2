5|$|Cervical polyps, {{which are}} benign {{overgrowth}}s of endocervical tissue, <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth {{may be present}} in the cervical canal. Cervical ectropion refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores have no brain {{or central}} nervous system, but instead have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) that forms a ring round {{the mouth and}} is densest near {{structures}} such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (<b>if</b> <b>present)</b> and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation in DPB is {{also caused}} by the {{chemokine}} MIP-1alpha and its involvement with CD8+ T cells. Beta defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as P.aeruginosa is present. <b>If</b> <b>present</b> with DPB, the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I, a retrovirus, modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting T helper cells and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence of known or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.|$|E

5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications. Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or nausea. Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E

500|$|A common {{example of}} synesthesia is the {{association}} between graphemes and colors, usually referred to as grapheme-color synesthesia. Here, {{letters of the alphabet}} are associated with vivid experiences of color. Studies have indicated that the perceived color is context-dependent and is determined by the extracted meaning of a stimulus. For example, an ambiguous stimulus '5' that can be interpreted either as 'S' or '5' will have the color associated with 'S' or with '5', depending on the context in which it is <b>presented.</b> <b>If</b> <b>presented</b> among numbers, it will be interpreted as '5' and will associate the respective color. <b>If</b> <b>presented</b> among letters, it will be interpreted as 'S' and will associate the respective synesthetic color.|$|R

This has been suggested to occur due to contrast gain mechanisms that reduce the representation of the pedestal and therefore reduce its masking effects. We show here that the effect is due to the large transient in contrast that accompanies the onset of the pedestal. We find similar masking at pedestal offset, when the pedestal is continually flickered, or when pedestal and test have a high spatial frequency. These results were all predicted on the basis of sustained and transient channels...|$|R
5|$|A shield {{in front}} of a mantle or cloak may be found among bishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches. However, some Eastern ecclesiastical {{variations}} omit the mantle but retain the mitre, cross and staff. Maronite bishops traditionally display a pastoral staff behind the shield, topped with a globe and cross or a cross within a globe. Eastern Catholic bishops may follow the Roman style with a low crowned, wide brimmed ecclesiastical hat, although the shield itself is often rendered in a Byzantine artistic style, and a mitre <b>if</b> <b>present</b> would be in the appropriate liturgical style.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E

5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, <b>if</b> <b>present</b> for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E

Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area around the eyes and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (<b>if</b> <b>present).</b> Short neck. Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding.

5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, {{consisting of a}} host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in the}} tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|E

5|$|The edmontosaurs {{also showed}} enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be {{interpreted}} as a mixed diet of C3 plants (most plants) and C4 plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous <b>if</b> <b>present</b> at all. Thomas and Carlson put forward several factors that may have been operating, and found the most likely to include a diet heavy in gymnosperms, consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the Western Interior Seaway, and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be expected for mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake {{could have a}} transient atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto near its perihelion. Nitrogen, <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 11–16 by 8–11µm. Basidia are 20–40 by 8–16µm; {{they are usually}} four-spored but sometimes two-spored, and, more rarely, one-spored forms can occur. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in most collections; <b>if</b> <b>present</b> they are scarce and similar to the cheilocystidia. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 30–70 by 10–35µm, and are club-, spindle-, or flask-shaped, and usually each one has an apical outgrowth up to 40µm long. The cheilocystidia completely cover the gill edge. In the form acystidiatus (N.C.Pathak) Vizzini & Contu, both pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are completely absent. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix). The stipe cuticle (stipitipellis) is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap) are sometimes present; they measure 65–140 by 10–25µm, and are mostly cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, <b>if</b> <b>present.</b> For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Legend of Mana displays an angled top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the unnamed main character, and is assisted by up to two companions. One of these companions is an optional support character, which depends on what quest the player is performing, while another companion can be chosen by the player out of a roster of monsters, pets, and golems. Both companions are typically controlled by the game's AI, though a second player can {{take control of the}} support character, or load in their own character from a different save file, <b>if</b> <b>present.</b> The main character and companions each have their own set of numerical attributes including hit points and strength, which represent the amount of damage the player can take or cause. These stats grow whenever the player advances a level, after gaining enough experience points from battle with enemies.|$|E
5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) {{may be present}} or absent. <b>If</b> <b>present,</b> they {{are similar to the}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2–3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
