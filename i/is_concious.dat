40|$|The {{editor of}} this work <b>is</b> <b>concious</b> of opening up a new field of study with this {{collection}} of twelve articles by various authors. For this rather special reason it is defined in the title as an "introduction", {{but the reality is}} that it is an extremely interesting multi-authored survey with two points of entry. First there are contributions focused on particular ethnic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan. In a second group come essays on the "U. S. Latina and Latino" religious experience as related to specific themes: art, film, health care, literature, music and politics. A final theme, "women", is only explored in the "Latina" variant, as if men and women can be treated in isolation when the gender question is raised. It is quite impossible to review the individual essays here, but the overall concept is imaginative and the editor has done extremely well to bring the contributions together from various quarters. In both groups of essays there is a wonderful liveliness, produced by the excitement of opening up this field over a broad range, and inspired by the vitality of the currently observable religious phenomena themselves...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-AThis paper {{describes}} a study investigating attitudes to noise as an occupational hazard. The {{objectives of the}} study were to understand the individual and organizational factors which affect attitudes towards noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and to relate these to the standards of hearing conservation achieved in industry as demonstrated by compliance with the Noise at Work Regulations. The study comprised a survey of 48 organizations across Britain, and a more detailed examination of 10 of these as case studies. Methods used included desk research, audits of hearing conservation programmes, questionnaires and interviews. Whilst there is widespread acceptance that industrial noise is a hazard, it is one that is frequently taken for granted, and measures to deal with it are often inadequate. Most organizations place the onus on the workforce to protect their own hearing through the use of personal hearing protectors Workers reactions to noise tended however to be passive and much of the time neither managers nor the workforce <b>are</b> <b>concious</b> of the noise hazard. This is the case even where some managers are committed to good industrial housekeeping and accident prevention.

They {{had no money}} to pay for it with, except--except that dreadful cheque. For four days it had lain, burning a hole in Ernest's heart from its drawer by the window, and he had not dared to change it. Now he rose without saying a word, and opened the drawer in a solemn, hesitating fashion. He looked once more at Edie inquiringly; Edie nodded a faint approval. Ernest, pale as death, put on his hat, and went out totteringly with the doctor. He stopped on the way to change the cheque at the baker's where they usually dealt, and then went on to the goat's milk shop. How that {{sovereign}} he flung upon the counter seemed to ring the knell of his seif-respect! The man who changed it noticed the strangeness of Ernest's look, and knew at once he had not come by the money honestly. He rang it twice {{to make sure it was}} good, and then gave the change to Ernest. But Dot, at least, was saved; that was a great thing. The milk arrived duly every morning for some weeks, and, after a severe struggle, Dot grew gradually better. While the danger lasted, neither of them dared think much of the cheque; but when Dot had got quite well again, Ernest <b>was</b> <b>concious</b> of a certain unwonted awkwardness of manner in talking to Edie.

40|$|Abstract. In model based design model {{fragments}} {{are used}} in everyday work. Concurrent operations on separate parts of a model and communication between stakeholders are some examples. However, the use of model fragments <b>is</b> not always <b>concious,</b> partly because it is typically {{not covered by the}} design process. The concept of model fragment is practically undefined, which leads to adopting loose, ad hoc definitions. Thus, communication using model fragments is prone to misunderstandings and creating and using them is fuzzy. This prevents developing of systematic methods and tools. In this paper we clarify the concept and the problem area of model fragments, and discuss how to create and use them. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation for a model fragmentation mechanism and demonstrate it in a small example. ...|$|R

English has four skill such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing. But, there is another skill {{that seem to be}} neglected, namely translation. Translation is needed to comprehend information which is intended in foreign language. However, English students sometimes make errors in translating English into Indonesian. This thesis focuses on the errors in translating English idiom into Indonesian made by the seventh semester students. This study was conducted to know the errors made by the seventh semester students of English Department at Muhammadiyah University of Malang in translating English idiom into Indonesian and the possible causes of errors made by the students in translating English idiom into Indonesian. The population of this study was the seventh semester students of English Department who took translation class. They were grouped into two classes: A and B each class consisted of 41 and 36 students. This population is called population research because the population is less than 100 students. The writer collected the data by giving a test which consisted of 25 items. Then, the data was analyzed and classsified into their types. The result of the data analysis showed that the students made global and local errors in trasnalting English idiom into Indonesian.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{transistors}} on an integrated circuit keeps doubling every two years. This {{increasing number of}} transistors is used to integrate more processing cores on the same chip. However, due to power density and ILP diminishing returns, the single-thread performance of such processing cores does not double every two years, but doubles every three years and a half. Computer architecture research is mainly driven by simulation. In computer architecture simulators, {{the complexity of the}} simulated machine increases with the number of available transistors. The more transistors, the more cores, the more complex is the model. However, the performance of computer architecture simulators depends on the single-thread performance of the host machine and, as we mentioned before, this is not doubling every two years but every three years and a half. This increasing difference between the complexity of the simulated machine and simulation speed is what we call the simulation speed gap. Because of the simulation speed gap, computer architecture simulators are increasingly slow. The simulation of a reference benchmark may take several weeks or even months. Researchers <b>are</b> <b>concious</b> of this problem and have been proposing techniques to reduce simulation time. These techniques include the use of reduced application input sets, sampled simulation and parallelization. Another technique to reduce simulation time is raising the level of abstraction of the simulated model. In this thesis we advocate for this approach. First, we decide to use trace-driven simulation because it does not require to provide functional simulation, and thus, allows to raise the level of abstraction beyond the instruction-stream representation. However, trace-driven simulation has several limitations, the most important being the inability to reproduce the dynamic behavior of multithreaded applications. In this thesis we propose a simulation methodology that employs a trace-driven simulator together with a runtime sytem that allows the proper simulation of multithreaded applications by reproducing the timing-dependent dynamic behavior at simulation time. Having this methodology, we evaluate the use of multiple levels of abstraction to reduce simulation time, from a high-speed application-level simulation mode to a detailed instruction-level mode. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact in accuracy and simulation speed of these abstraction levels and also show their applicability and usefulness depending on the target evaluations. We also compare these levels of abstraction with the existing ones in popular computer architecture simulators. Also, we validate the highest abstraction level against a real machine. One of the interesting levels of abstraction for the simulation of multi-cores is the memory mode. This simulation mode is able to model the performanceof a superscalar out-of-order core using memory-access traces. At this level of abstraction, previous works have used filtered traces that do not include L 1 hits, and allow to simulate only L 2 misses for single-core simulations. However, simulating multithreaded applications using filtered traces as in previous works has inherent inaccuracies. We propose a technique to reduce such inaccuracies and evaluate the speed-up, applicability, and usefulness of memory-level simulation. All in all, this thesis contributes to knowledge with techniques for the simulation of chip multiprocessors with hundreds of cores using traces. It states and evaluates the trade-offs of using varying degress of abstraction in terms of accuracy and simulation speed. Postprint (published version...|$|R

In order to find evidence of this a field study was carried out focusing on the results of bilingal and monolingual students in National tests in English. The field study indicated that the monolingual students generally performed better {{in all parts of the}} test. The reason for this is mainly because of the fact that the bilingual students' greatest difficulty was spelling. The bilingual students did, however, outperform the monolingual students in a section where they had to explain words in a context by means of using other words. They also managed word ordering better and never used 'Swenglish' expressions in their written productions. It was therefore possible to draw the conclusion that bilingual students have a better metalinguistic awareness, that <b>is,</b> a deeper <b>concious</b> awareness about language and the use of language. No other significant differences between these students were found. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 MİMARLIKTA EKOSİSTEM DÜŞÜNCESİYLE TASARLAMAK ÖZET Doğa, insan ve diğer canlı türleri arasındaki etkileşim mimarlık bağlamında ele alındığında iki önemli sorunsalın varlığından söz edilebilir. Tezde amaçlanan, doğa deneyimi ve biyoçeşitliliğin azalması olarak tanımlanan bu iki soruna çözüm üretebilmek amacıyla bir tartışma ortamı yaratabilmektir. Bu anlamda, tez genel olarak insan ve doğa arasındaki ilişkiyi tekrar güçlendirmek adına ortaya çıkan doğa temelli tasarım yaklaşımlarını ve canlıların çevresiyle olan ilişkilerini inceleyen ekoloji bilimini konu alır. Çalışma kapsamında ele alınan kavramlar üzerinden ekosistem düşüncesi, tasarım sürecini yönlendiren önemli bir farkındalık, bilinç düzeyi olarak kabul eden ekosistem temelli öneri bir tasarım modeli ortaya koymaktadır. Tezin ilk bölümünde, ekolojinin alt dalları etki alanlarına göre ölçeklendirilmiş ve işleyiş fonksiyonlarına göre analiz edilmiştir. Ekoloji dallarının içerdiği kavramlar ekosistem süzgecinden geçirilerek yeniden değerlendirilmiş ve doğa temelli tasarım anlayışlarının daha iyi kavranmasını sağlayacak ekolojik bir rehber oluşturulmuştur. Tezin ikinci bölümünde ise, oluşturulan ekolojik rehber üzerinden mevcut doğa temelli tasarım yaklaşımlarının ekoloji dalları ile etkileşim seviyeleri araştırılmış, güçlü ve zayıf yönleri ortaya konulmaya çalışılmıştır. Ekosistem temelli yeni bir tasarım yaklaşımı için, ekosistem ve barındırdığı biyoçeşitliliğin tasarım kriteri olarak mekan biçimleme sürecinde ele alınması gerektiğini ve insanın doğanın ayrılmaz bir parçası olduğunu vurgulayan ekoloji dalları ile doğa temelli tasarım yaklaşımları temel alınarak içerik oluşturulmuştur. Son bölüm ekosistem temelli bir tasarım yaklaşımı için önerilen üç aşamalı bir modeli ortaya koymaktadır. Modelin ilk basamağı mekan hissi, kendi kendine yetebilme, mutualist yaşam ve devamlılık kavramlarından oluşan ekosistem gereksinimlerini ele almakta, ikinci basamağı gereksinimleri yerine getiren deneyim, denge, döngü ve organizasyon kriterlerini tanımlamaktadır. Üçüncü basamak ise modelin yaratıcı bir süreç olarak derinliğini arttırmak ve tasarımda, araştırmacı, yenilikçi, özgün düşünceler oluşmasını sağlamak üzere ekolojik değer, ekolojik süreç, ekolojik koşul ve ekolojik strateji kavramlarını içeren ekolojik değişkenleri tartışmaktadır. Örnek projeler üzerinden açıklanan kavramlar kendi başlarına yeni bir görüş içermeseler de model içerisinde ele alınış ve ilişkilendiriliş biçimleriyle mevcut yaklaşımlar arasında yeni bir perspektif ortaya koymaktadır. Tez bu anlamda ekosistem temelli tasarım anlayışının özüne dair öneri bir model sunmanın yanı sıra gelecekte mimarlığın ekosisteme nasıl dahil olabileceğine dair öngörüler barındırmaktadır. Böylelikle mimari çalışmaların içerisine ekosistemi temel alan ekolojik bir sorumluluk yerleştirmek hedeflenmiştir. DESIGNING WITH THE REFLECTION OF ECOSYSTEM IN ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY When the {{interaction}} between nature, humanbeings and the other living species is considered in an architectural context, two major problems can be seen. In this thesis, it is aimed to generate a discussion medium regarding to these two problems which {{can be defined as}} the loss of nature experience and the biodiversity. In this respect, this thesis is subjected on the nature based design approaches which are emerged as a basis to re-establish the relationship between nature and the humanbeings and the science of ecology that researches the relationships among living species and inbetween the nature as a basis to offer logical solutions to the loss of biodiversity. An ecosystem based design proposal which considers the idea of an ecosystem that is developed through the concepts which are undertaken in the scope of this study as an awareness and the degree of conciousness that influences the design process is put forth for consideration. In the first section of the thesis, the branches of ecology is scaled regarding to their effective domain and is analysed according to their operational functions. The concepts included in these branches of ecology is re-considered in respect to the ecosystems and in this way, an ecological guide is developed that would help to understand the nature based design approaches better. These ecological branches can be scaled as the city and human ecology, landscape ecology, industrial ecology and ecosystem ecology. In this section of the thesis {{it can be seen that}} by using the city and human ecology, landscape ecology and industrial ecology as components and restoration ecology as a tool, an ecological guide can be developed as all the major keywords that define each of these ecological branches can be comprehended by the ecosystem ecology and its keywords. This implies the fact that whether it is obvious or not, every action that takes place in each of these ecological branches will end up affecting ecosystem ecology and the ecological guide helps us to better understand these interactions. In the second section, the integration degree between the nature based design approaches and the branches of ecology is studied through the developed ecological guide, the strength and the weakness of each approach is aimed to be displayed. Ecological guide is used as a criteria to reveal the weakness of a nature based design approach and this weakness is then used as a requirement to develop a new and expansive analyses period through the existing nature based design approaches. Green design can be seen as an approach to minimize the harmful effects of an industrial process to the environment and human health and is supported by the existing assessment methods, but despite the fact that it contibutes positive insights about energy efficiency and resource management it has no potential rather than the minimization of the existing impact. Ecological design on the other hand <b>is</b> an environmentally <b>concious</b> design approach that handles the nature and the built environment together as a whole but the way it treats the requirements only from the human perspective, it does not contribute a meaningful ecosystem based approach. These two approaches both show concern for the physical and material based necessities while biophilic design considers the psychological affects of the nature experience but lacks an attitude towards ecosystems. Biomimicry is regarded as a design approach which analyses and is inspired by the natural processes and rather than the other approaches it respects nature and regards it as a mentor. It shows a good opportunity with its ecosystem level biomimicry field but has not fully revealed yet. Regenerative design on the other hand is based on the system theory and has its roots in process based regeneration of ecosystems but lacks the potential solutions for {{the interaction}} between humans and the other living organisms. It is seen that every approach has some potential to fulfill and some waknesses to overcome. While biomimicry offers an inspiring field of discovery and can be considered encouraging, the most satisfactory approach among them can be regarded as the discipline of regenerative design with respect to an ecosystem based design approach. As an outcome of these analyses, the content for a new ecosystem based design approach is developed regarding the nature based design approaches and the branches of ecology that emphasizes the need to treat the ecosystem and the biodiversity it contains as a design criteria and that the humans are an integral part of the ecosystem. The last section of the thesis reveals an ecosystem based design model that encourages solutions for the lack of nature experience and biodiversity. The model is based on three sublevels. The first level is composed of valuable concepts that are extracted from the ecological branches and the nature based design approaches. The first level of the model defines and discusses the ecosystem necessities which are consisting of sense of place, self sufficiency, mutual relationships and continuity while the second level illustrates the criterias that fulfill the necessities such as experience, stability, cycle and organisation that fulfill the necessities. Third level argues the ecological variables that would generate inquiring and original thoughts in design and deepen the model as a creative process as they influence the criterias to fulfill the necessities and includes the concepst such as ecological value, ecological process, ecological conditions and ecological strategy. Ecological values examines whether the design is driven by biospheric values, ecological process searches how well the design provides opportunities for the native ecosystem cycles, ecological conditions care for the attitude towards the habitats of other living organisms and ecological strategy investigates the success degree of integrations between the built environment and the local ecosystem structure. The proposed model demonstrates the ways of implementations through the analyses of comtemporary design examples which can be regarded as visionary projects that respect the native ecosystems. Each sublevel of the model is discussed through the appropriate design examples to better explain the way to treat these keywords defined in the model and how they can become a tool to put forth a manifestation in the domains of ecosystem ecology and architecture. The concepts that are defined through project examples may not seem to have unique meanings on their own but the way they are associated in the model reveals a new perspective. This thesis therefore not only proposes a new ecosystem based design model, but also provides foresights on how architecture can be integrated to the local ecosystems in the future. Thus it is aimed to establish an ecological responsibility in the architectural studies. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
