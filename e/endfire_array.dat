This paper presents an empirical investigation of spatial corre-lation in ultrawideband (UWB) indoor channels in the FCC-allocated 3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz band. The {{impact of a}} number of system parameters on spatial correlation at the receiver is evaluated. It is found that the coherence distance falls with channel bandwidth in <b>endfire</b> <b>arrays</b> but not in broadside arrays. The complex correlation decays less rapidly with distance in broadside <b>arrays</b> than in <b>endfire</b> <b>arrays,</b> especially under line-of-sight, but the envelope correlation is circularly symmetric in space. Strong dependence of spatial correlation and coherence distance on the channel center frequency is observed. Furthermore, horizontally polarized links are found to exhibit less correlation than vertically polarized links. A discussion of the implications of these results for multiple-antenna UWB systems is provided.

In this letter, we show that whenever a radiating structure with a planar geometry is preferable and only a moderate gain (< 6 dB) is required, a microstrip array composed of an active monopole and two parasitic elements is a very simple, yet effective design. The phases of the currents flowing through the active and passive elements determine the main lobe direction and can be adjusted during the design procedure by inserting planar meanders.

The acquired estimates of the PSDs for the wind noise as well as the speech signals are used to design a beamformer as well as a post filter for wind noise reduction.

40|$|The {{parametric}} array exploits two highly collimated ultrasound beams interacting {{in a given}} volume {{producing a}} single beam with very high directivity and almost no side lobes. The high directivity of the difference frequency signal of the parametric array {{is due to the}} interaction of the waves in the volume effectively producing a virtual <b>endfired</b> <b>array</b> boosting pressure levels along the interaction region which is limited by the absorption coefficient. This thesis focuses on experiments conducted in an anechoic room using AS- 18 -B Audio Spotlight system from HolosonicTM. Furthermore, nonlinear theory was modeled by a linear discrete array. The beam pattern of the parametric loudspeaker, range dependence of primary and secondary signals and total harmonic distortion (THD) were measured and then compared to theory. Experimental data for the beam pattern of the parametric loudspeaker agreed with the theory. It was all shown that the parametric array had a very narrow beam width and almost no side lobes as opposed to conventional loudspeakers. Both primary waves and difference wave frequency signals were examined for their range dependence. Due to the complicated interference of the primary waves, it was impossible to compare experimental results with theoretical predictions. For the difference wave signals, experimental data was verified by theory, which was modified in order to accommodate both wave generation and spreading region. Finally, THD of the parametric loudspeaker was measured for different amplitude modulation depths. Experimental results showed that preprocessing should be applied in order to decrease THD and achieve clean audio signal reproduction. Turkish Navy author...|$|R
30|$|Linear arrays for superdirectivity {{have been}} {{extensively}} investigated [11, 24, 32 – 36]. An <b>endfire</b> linear <b>array</b> {{has been proven}} to possess the highest superdirectivity for a given number of sensors, and its DI approaches 20 logN (dB) when the inter-sensor spacing becomes infinitely small [2, 23], where N {{is the number of}} sensors. For this particular array, a difference approximation (DA) model exists [35]. It provides promising calculation accuracy when the spacing and overall length of the array are small. However, this model is difficult to implement in practice because it is highly error sensitive, which is why only first-order (vector sensor) or second-order linear arrays (at most) exist thus far. The newly developed general model should be tested if it can significantly relax restrictions on the spacing and overall size (and thus the sensor number N).|$|R
40|$|Uniform {{linear array}} (ULA) {{geometry}} does not perform well for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation at directions {{close to the}} <b>array</b> <b>endfires.</b> Shirvani and Akbari solved this problem by displacing two elements from {{both ends of the}} ULA to the top and/or bottom of the array axis. Shirvani-Akbari array (SAA) presents a considerable improvement in the DOA estimation of narrowband sources arriving at endfire directions in terms of DOA estimation accuracy and angular resolution. In this paper, all new proposed SAA configurations are modelled and also examined, numerically. In this paper, two well-known DOA estimation algorithms, multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), are used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} proposed arrays using total root mean square error (RMSE) criterion. In addition, two new scenarios are proposed which divide angular search to two parts, directions close to <b>array</b> <b>endfires</b> as well as middle angles. For middle angles, which belong to (− 70 ∘≤≤ 70 ∘), ULA is considered, and for endfire angles, the angles which belong to (− 90 ∘≤≤− 70 ∘) and (70 ∘≤≤ 90 ∘), SAA is considered.

30|$|This work studies a {{wind noise}} {{reduction}} approach for communication applications {{in a car}} environment. An <b>endfire</b> <b>array</b> consisting of two microphones is considered {{as a substitute for}} an ordinary cardioid microphone capsule of the same size. Using the decomposition of the multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), a suitable beamformer and a single-channel post filter are derived. Due to the known array geometry and the location of the speech source, assumptions about the signal properties can be made to simplify the MWF beamformer and to estimate the speech and noise power spectral densities required for the post filter. Even for closely spaced microphones, the different signal properties at the microphones can be exploited to achieve a significant reduction of wind noise. The proposed beamformer approach results in an improved speech signal regarding the signal-to-noise-ratio and keeps the linear speech distortion low. The derived post filter shows equal performance compared to known approaches but reduces the effort for noise estimation.|$|E

In the literature, planar L-shape array has shown good accuracy [13] and the V-shape structure with specified design has demonstrated isotropic and uniform performance in all directions [27].|$|R
30|$|The {{conventional}} ULA is {{the most}} common array geometry for smart antenna systems and array signal processing. Beside great advantages, the ULA does not perform uniform for all angles in the spatial spectrum and cannot detect or resolve close sources located at endfires, accurately. In this article, new ULA-based array geometry is proposed and presented which can remove this drawback by keeping the simplicity in implementation and analysis. Spectral and numerical evaluation is done on the resolution of both ULA and PA geometries via two well-known AOA estimation algorithms, MUSIC as well as MVDR. Simulation results show that the proposed array resolves narrowband signal sources located at close angles to the <b>array</b> <b>endfire</b> accurately, while having a good resolution in other directions. In addition, to improve the performance of the conventional ULA, the PA presents better accuracy and resolution than the L-shape array in boresight directions. The PA also presents near accuracy to the V-shape array with equal element numbers while having less complexity, computational cost and array aperture size.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{acoustic}} source depth discrimination was introduced {{as a way}} to get basic information on source depth in configurations where accurate depth estimation is not feasible. It is a binary classification problem, aiming to evaluate whether the source is near the surface or submerged. Herein, the classification relies on a signal measured with a horizontal line array in shallow water. Knowing the source-array distance is not required but the source bearing has to be close to the <b>array</b> <b>endfire.</b> Signal processing relies on a normal-mode propagation model, and thus requires prior knowledge of the mode characteristics. The decision relies on an estimation of the trapped energy ratio in mode space. The performance is predicted with simulations and Monte Carlo methods, allowing one to compare several estimators based on different mode filters, and to choose an appropriate decision threshold. The impact on performance of frequency, noise level, horizontal aperture, and environmental mismatch is numerically studied. Finally, the approach is validated on experimental data acquired with a horizontal line array deployed off the coast of New Jersey, and the impact of errors in the environmental model is illustrated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a subband cardioid beamformer on an ultra low-power miniature DSP platform, using a 2 -microphone <b>endfire</b> <b>array.</b> The subband beamformer extends the classical time-domain, narrow-band algorithm to a frequency-domain, broadband implementation, so it is suitable for general speech and audio applications. An oversampled, weighted overlap-add filterbank is used to allow wide gain and phase adjustments for low power, low group delay requirements. A subband IIR filter is proposed to overcome the non-zero bandwidth of the frequency bands, and to introduce a nearly linear phase adjustment across the bands. The subband implementation allows the flexibility of integrating the beamformer with additional algorithms at different frequency ranges. The beamformer has been implemented in real-time on Dspfactory's Toccata platform, which has been specifically designed for ultra low-power, miniature, head-mounted audio devices. At 1. 25 Volts with a 5 MIPS DSP core, the Toccata consumes only about 800 micro Watts without microphones and receivers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the improvement in}} speech intelligibility in noise obtained with an assistive real-time fixed <b>endfire</b> <b>array</b> of bidirectional microphones in comparison with an omnidirectional hearing aid microphone in a realistic environment. DESIGN: The microphone array was evaluated physically in anechoic and reverberant conditions. Perceptual tests of speech intelligibility in noise were carried out in a reverberant room, with two types of noise and six different noise scenarios with single and multiple noise sources. Ten normal-hearing subjects and 10 hearing aid users participated. The speech reception threshold for sentences was measured in each test setting for the omnidirectional microphone of the hearing aid and for the hearing aid {{in combination with the}} array with one and three active microphones. In addition, the extra improvement of five active array microphones, relative to three, was determined in another group of 10 normal-hearing listeners. RESULTS: Improvements in speech intelligibility in noise obtained with the array relative to an omnidirectional microphone depend on noise scenario and subject group. Improvements up to 12 dB for normal-hearing and 9 dB for hearing-impaired listeners were obtained with three active array microphones relative to an omnidirectional microphone for one noise source at 90 degrees. For three uncorrelated noise sources at 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees, improvements of approximately 9 dB and 6 dB were obtained for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners, respectively. Even with a single noise source at 45 degrees, benefits of 4 dB were achieved in both subject groups. Five active microphones in the array can provide an additional improvement at 45 degrees of approximately 1 dB, relative to the three-microphone configuration for normal-hearing listeners. CONCLUSIONS: These improvements in signal-to-noise ratio can be of great benefit for hearing aid users, who have difficulties with speech understanding in noisy environments. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we look {{to address}} the problem of {{estimating}} the dynamic direction of arrival (DOA) of a narrowband signal impinging on a sensor array from the far field. The initial estimate is made using a Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) framework and then tracked using a Bayesian compressed sensing Kalman filter (BCSKF). The BCS framework splits the angular region into N potential DOAs and enforces a belief that only a few of the DOAs will have a non-zero valued signal present. A BCSKF can then be used to track the change in the DOA using the same framework. There can be an issue when the DOA approaches the <b>endfire</b> of the <b>array.</b> In this angular region current methods can struggle to accurately estimate and track changes in the DOAs. To tackle this problem, we propose changing the traditional sparse belief associated with BCS to a belief that the estimated signals will match the predicted signals given a known DOA change. This is done by modelling the difference between the expected sparse received signals and the estimated sparse received signals as a Gaussian distribution. Example test scenarios are provided and comparisons made with the traditional BCS based estimation method. They show that an improvement in estimation accuracy is possible without a significant increase in computational complexity. Comment: Fusion 2015 pape...|$|R
