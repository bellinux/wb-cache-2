50|$|In most cases, SSBNs {{generally}} resemble attack subs of {{the same}} generation, with extra length to accommodate SLBMs, such as the Russian R-29 (SS-N-23) or the NATO-fielded and American-manufactured Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident-II missiles. Some early models had to surface to launch their missiles, but modern vessels typically launch while submerged at keel depths of usually less than 50 meters (164 feet). Missiles are launched upwards with an initial velocity sufficient for them to pop above the surface, at which point their rocket motors fire, beginning the characteristic parabolic climb-from-launch of a ballistic missile. Compressed air ejection, later replaced by <b>gas-steam</b> ejection, was developed by Captain Harry Jackson of Rear Admiral Raborn's Special Project Office when a proposed missile elevator proved too complex. Jackson also derived the armament of 16 missiles used in many SSBNs for the George Washington class in 1957, based on a compromise between firepower and hull integrity.|$|E
50|$|More than 135 Soviet {{organizations}} (20 design bureaus, 35 research institutes, 80 works) {{participated in}} the design and construction of this completely new type of submarine in 1952-1958. The chief designer was V.N. Peregudov and the research supervisor was academician A.P. Alexandrov. The class was originally tasked with entering American naval bases and using the thermonuclear <b>gas-steam</b> powered T-15 torpedo to destroy them once in range (The T-15 torpedo had the following specifications: calibre 1,550 mm, length 23.5 m, range 40-50 km). However, after expert opinions of Soviet naval specialists were considered, the role of the class changed to torpedo attacks on enemy warships and transport ships during actions along the ocean and distant sea routes. Reflecting this change of mission, the final design of Project 627 was developed with eight 533 mm torpedo tubes instead of the initial plan for one 1,550 mm and two 533 mm torpedo tubes. Project 627/627A submarines could launch torpedoes from 100 m depth. By 1963 this class was still in service but had been overtaken by later technology.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{changes in the}} operating parameters of a combined <b>gas-steam</b> cycle with a CO 2 capture installation and flue gas recirculation. Parametric equations are solved in a purpose-built mathematical model of the system using the Ebsilon Professional code. Recirculated flue gases from the heat recovery boiler outlet, after being cooled and dried, are fed together with primary air into the mixer {{and then into the}} gas turbine compressor. This leads to an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the flue gases fed into the CO 2 capture installation from 7. 12 to 15. 7 %. As a consequence, there is a reduction in the demand for heat in the form of steam extracted from the turbine for the amine solution regeneration in the CO 2 capture reactor. In addition, the flue gas recirculation involves a rise in the flue gas temperature (by 18 K) at the heat recovery boiler inlet and makes it possible to produce more steam. These changes contribute to an increase in net electricity generation efficiency by 1 %.

40|$|Gas turbine {{inlet air}} cooling {{technologies}} (GTIAC), mainly including chilling with LiBr/water absorption chiller and fogging as well, {{are being used}} during hot seasons to augment the power output. To evaluate the general applicability of inlet air cooling for <b>gas-steam</b> {{combined cycle power plant}} (GTCCIAC), parameters such as efficiency ratio, profit ratio and relative payback period were defined and analyzed through off-design performances of both gas turbine and inlet air cooling systems. An analytical method for applicability evaluation of GTCCIAC with absorption chiller (inlet chilling) and saturated evaporative cooler (inlet fogging) was presented. The applicability study based on typical off-design performances of the components in GTCCIAC shows that, the applicability of GTCCIAC with chilling and fogging depends on the design economic efficiency of GTCC power plant. In addition, it relies heavily on the climatic data and the design capacity of inlet air cooling systems. Generally, GTCCIAC is preferable in the zones with high ambient air temperature and low humidity. Furthermore, it is more appropriate for those GTCC units with lower design economic efficiency. Comparison of the applicability between chilling and fogging shows that, inlet fogging is superior in power efficiency at taÂ =Â  15 - 20 Â Â°C though it gains smaller profit margin than inlet chilling.

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{has become}} an indispensable element of today’s society. Demand is growing continuously and the production is still based on limited sources of energy such as coal and petroleum derivate products. Environmental issues, such as global warming, and the uncertainty about the quantity of the conventional fossil fuels are forcing suppliers to find new solutions for the near future. In this assignment, concentrated solar thermal technologies for electricity generation could play a relevant role in the near future. Sun is the largest source of power in this planet, and in fact, the only one coming from outer space. All sources of energy are ultimately derived from the sun 1. It only seems logical to learn how profit from this vast income of power for sustainable human purposes, such as energy production. It is proven that concentrated solar power is feasible; however, it is hardly adjustable to the electricity demand when complete energy from sun is expected. Large storage tanks and backup systems are used to reach peak demand or in times of little or no sunlight. This thesis {{is based on a}} bibliographic study about the actual development of concentrated solar power. After the analysis, there is a proposal about a combined cycle powered for two different relevant solar technologies: central tower receiver and parabolic trough. The first is already being implemented and has proven its feasibility. However, the efficiencies reached are low compared with actual sources of power. On the other hand, recent developments in central tower receivers, ensures a high efficiency power conversion and the possibility of combination with actual <b>gas-steam</b> combined cycle.
