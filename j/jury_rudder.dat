6000|$|... “It won’t be easy. She {{has lost}} her {{propeller}} {{and carried her}} stern-frame away. The <b>jury</b> <b>rudder</b> they have rigged won’t steer her well, and I don’t think the plates they’ve bolted on to her torn bilge will keep out much water if she gets straining hard. However, I’ll try it {{if you can find}} me another tug. She’s too big for one boat to hold.” ...|$|E
60|$|But luckily {{the wine}} {{happened}} to be {{as old as the}} waiter. So, comparatively empty, but upon the whole fairly happy, we sat back and told our artless tales. We talked of the sea and all its works. The sea never changes, and its works for all the talk of men are wrapped in mystery. But we agreed that the times were changed. And we talked of old ships, of sea-accidents, of break-downs, dismastings; and of a man who brought his ship safe to Liverpool {{all the way from the}} River Platte under a <b>jury</b> <b>rudder.</b> We talked of wrecks, of short rations and of heroism--or at least of what the newspapers would have called heroism at sea--a manifestation of virtues quite different from the heroism of primitive times. And now and then falling silent all together we gazed at the sights of the river.|$|E
5000|$|Research {{was a full}} rigged ship {{built in}} Yarmouth, Nova Scotia which was famous for a {{determined}} and courageous crew who replaced her rudder eight times to survive a crippling North Atlantic storm in 1866. Research was built in 1861 for the fleet of Thomas Killam and was the largest vessel built to that date in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia. In the fall of 1866 on a voyage from Quebec to Glasgow, Scotland, her rudder was badly damaged in a sudden violent storm as the ship left the Gulf of Saint Lawrence {{at the beginning of}} her voyage. The rudder subsequently broke off entirely but was replaced by eight different <b>jury</b> rigged <b>rudders</b> which allowed the drifting and battered vessel to cross the ocean and reach her destination after 88 days. George Churchill, the captain of Research and Aaron Churchill, the first mate who carried out most of the repairs in the water, were celebrated for their courage, skill and determination. They both enjoyed the nickname [...] "Rudder Churchill" [...] {{for the rest of their}} careers. The ship was sold to owners in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1872 and then sold out of British registry a year later.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the ship}} passed Cape Adare, the {{direction}} of drift changed to north-westerly. On 10 August Stenhouse estimated that they were 45 nmi km north-east of the Cape, and that their daily drift was averaging just over 20 nmi km. A few days later Stenhouse recorded that the ship was [...] "backing and filling", meaning that it was drifting back and forth without making progress.

50|$|After {{a four-month}} stay in Havana, Willaumez {{departed}} for Chesapeake Bay to rejoin Patriote, Éole and Valeureuse, which had taken refuge there after the hurricane. Adverse weather prevented him, and Willaumez instead sailed back to France, arriving in Brest in February 1807. The division had returned dispersed and lost several ships: Impétueux {{had managed to}} build a <b>jury</b> <b>rudder,</b> but had been intercepted by a British squadron and forced to beach herself to avoid capture; Éole and Valeureuse had been sold for scrap in Annapolis; Vétéran had found an unlikely shelter in Concarneau, normally far too shallow to harbour a ship of the line, where she was blockaded; Patriote later reached Brest, and Cassard, Lorient. The damage to British shipping was evaluated to 12 to 15 million francs.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} trail rope was studied by the {{resistance}} and yawing experiments. A {{model of a}} tuna long liner of gross tonnage about 260 tons was used. Figures 1 and 2 show the plans of the experiments. When a boat makes head at a higher speed than 3 knots relative to the surface water, {{the effect on the}} course stability of the trail rope as a <b>Jury</b> <b>rudder</b> is very marked, while less so at a higher speed than 5 knots. In the case where the speed was 4. 4 knots, the boat without trail rope showed a critical yawing angle 12 °. The angle increased to 15 ° with rope of straight line type and to 24 ° with rope of U-line type. The boat with trail rope, especially of U-type, shows a faster damping period of yawing (Fig. 4 a and 4 b). This type of a <b>Jury</b> <b>rudder</b> seems to be very useful in the case of strong gale. ...|$|E
