5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme <b>fire</b> <b>exposure</b> the beams and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E

50|$|The aim {{for fire}} {{protection}} systems is typically demonstrated in fire testing the ability to maintain the item or the side to be protected at or below either 140 °C (for walls, floors and electrical circuits required to have a fire-resistance rating) or ca. 550 °C, which is considered the critical temperature for structural steel, above which it is in jeopardy of losing its strength, leading to collapse. This is based, in most countries, on the basic test standards for walls and floors, such as BS 476: Part 22: 1987, BS EN 1364-1: 1999 & BS EN 1364-2: 1999 or ASTM E119. Smaller components, such as fire dampers, fire doors, etc., follow suit in the main intentions of the basic standard for walls and floors. Fire testing involves live <b>fire</b> <b>exposures</b> upwards of 1100 °C, depending on the fire-resistance rating and duration one is after. More items than just <b>fire</b> <b>exposures</b> are typically required to be tested to ensure the survivability of the system under realistic conditions.|$|R
30|$|As {{noted by}} authors {{going back to}} (at least) 1970, the {{standard}} temperature-time curve is not representative of a real fire in a real building. In order to truly understand the response of real buildings in real fires, tests of structures and structural elements are required under credible worst case natural <b>fire</b> <b>exposures.</b> Depending on the type and geometry of structure and the occupancy under consideration, this may require experimental consideration of localized, compartmentalized, horizontally and/or vertically travelling, smouldering, or hydrocarbon fires, {{all of which have}} the potential to introduce structural actions or interactions which are not captured by standard fires. In particular, the true dynamics of travelling or spreading fires in large compartments has received only limited attention within the research literature (e.g. Stern-Gottfried and Rein 2012), and essentially zero attention in large scale structural fire tests. There appears to be no facility in the world which is capable of producing (or reproducing) truly natural <b>fire</b> <b>exposures</b> on structures of realistic scale and construction, although the new NIST facility (Section 4.3) will go some way towards making this a reality.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a “State of the Art ” review on current {{research into the}} effects of <b>fire</b> <b>exposures</b> upon concrete. The principal influences of high temperature in concrete are loss of compressive strength and spalling, the forcible ejection of material from a member. Though {{a lot of information}} has been gathered on both phenomena, there remains a need for a broader understanding of the response of concrete structures to different heating regimes and the performance of complete concrete structures subjected to realistic <b>fire</b> <b>exposures.</b> There is a lack of information derived from large-scale tests on concrete buildings in natural fires. Besides undertaking further fire tests, lessons can also be learnt from real fires and the University of Edinburgh has embarked upon detailed studies of the serious fire in the Windsor Tower, Madrid. In order to properly characterise the fire and the performance of the structure a data-gathering exercise has been undertaken and computer modelling tools are being applied in order to obtain better insights into the structural response. There remains some uncertainty about the precise mechanism of fire spread, but an external route is likely, facilitated to some degree by the glazed curtain walling construction; lack of fire protection on the steelwork was the major reason for the subsequent partial collapse of the upper floors and the localised failure of a concrete portal frame {{can be attributed to the}} same reason...|$|R

5000|$|The {{control of}} fire enabled {{important}} changes in human behavior, health, energy expenditure, and geographic expansion. As {{a result of}} “domesticating” fire as previously achieved with plants and animals, humans were able to modify their environments to their own benefit.

Evidence of more complex management to change biomes can be found {{as far back as}} 200,000 to 100,000 years ago at a minimum. Furthermore, activity was no longer restricted to daylight hours due to the use of <b>fire.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to artificial light during later hours of the day changed humans’ circadian rhythms, contributing to a longer waking day.

50|$|Large {{differences}} exist in opening directions {{to be tested}} (EN requires both sides to be tested, UL one side only), permitted wall types (EN lists 3 types of walls, whereas UL does not differ at all), surface temperatures permitted (UL measures the first 30 minutes only, whereas EN the full duration of the test) and sustained flaming allowances (EN no flaming, UL several types and durations allowed). Another major difference is {{the treatment of the}} exchangeability of components such as locks, hinges, and frame types. The EN standard basically requires each combination to be tested as a whole, where as UL is satisfied with the single component being tested independently from the door assembly. Further the EN standard differs in its treatment of the extension of dimensions from the UL standard. EN allows for only limited dimensional extensions, but requires in such cases a surplus of test time and better gap values. Whereas the UL Standard does not allow an increase of the dimension of the tested door, you can decrease the dimension without any restriction. Last but not least, UL requires {{at the end of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>exposure</b> a hose stream test, where water from a hose is directed to the tested assembly. No water shall penetrate and the door shall withstand the impact. The EN standard does not mention anything similar.|$|E

40|$|Nordtest and SP Swedish National Testing and Research Institute (SP) have financed a {{study to}} draft a common Nordic test method to {{classify}} wood adhesives for structural purposes according to strength properties after <b>fire</b> <b>exposure.</b> The study has been planned and carried out in cooperation between SP and Norwegian Institute of Wood Technology (NTI) with participation of Otto Graf Institute in Germany (FMPA). Glulam beams produced with six different adhesives {{have been exposed to}} fire. Temperature distribution during the <b>fire</b> <b>exposure</b> test, weight loss and charring rate have been determined. Shear strength of glulines and wood have been determined and delamination tests have been carried out on samples exposed to fire and samples not exposed to fire. Short term shear strength and creep rupture tests at elevated temperature have been carried out on samples with wood adhesives used in the test. Preliminary calculations of temperature distributions during fire in wooden members protected against direct <b>fire</b> <b>exposure</b> by gypsum board have been made. The results of the study on beams not protected by gypsum indicate that a wood adhesive that has shown favourable results in a creep rupture test at elevated temperature (80 °C) also will perform well during and after direct <b>fire</b> <b>exposure.</b> A static load test at elevated temperature can be used as an efficient and cheap method as an alternative to <b>fire</b> <b>exposure</b> tests of glued products for structural use.
