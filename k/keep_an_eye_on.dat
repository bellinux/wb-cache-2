5|$|Stephen Báthory {{was elected}} King of Poland on 15 December 1575. He adopted {{the title of}} Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode on 14 January 1576. An Ottoman {{delegation}} confirmed Christopher's appointment at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in July. The sultan's charter (or ahidnâme) sent to Christopher emphasized that he should keep the peace along the frontiers. Stephen set up a separate chancellery in Kraków to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the administration of Transylvania. The {{head of the new}} chancellery, Márton Berzeviczy, and Christopher cooperated closely.|$|E

Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that they were willing to accept his suzerainty. Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola.

The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
5|$|Knox began forcing Kelly to {{accompany}} him to ringside so he could <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> her, making her his de facto valet. As a result, she found herself involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, {{as part of a}} six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E

5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E
5|$|In 1328, Andronikos III finally overthrew his {{grandfather}} and {{established himself as}} sole emperor. Syrgiannes was freed, {{and was able to}} restore himself to Andronikos's favour, to the extent that in late 1329 he was entrusted with the important governorship of Thessalonica, the Empire's second-largest city, and of western Macedonia and Albania. There, he was again suspected of plotting against Kantakouzenos, this time with the emperor's mother, Empress Maria. She lived in Thessalonica, and was supposed to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Syrgiannes; instead, she became so infatuated with him that she had him adopted. Following the death of the Empress in late 1333, the plot was uncovered and Syrgiannes was arrested and brought to Constantinople to face charges of treason. Syrgiannes, however, managed to escape and flee to the court of the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan.|$|E

5|$|On 10 June, the Duke met for {{the first}} time the President of the Imperial War Council, Prince Eugene – {{accompanied}} by Count Wratislaw – at the village of Mundelsheim, halfway between the Danube and the Rhine. By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in Großheppach. The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for the march on the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|As-Salih Ayyub {{returned}} to Damascus to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> developments in northern Syria. Al-Ashraf Musa of Homs had ceded the important stronghold of Salamiyah to as-Salih Ayyub the previous winter, perhaps to underline their patron-client relationship. This troubled the Ayyubids of Aleppo who feared {{it would be}} used as a base for a military take-over of their city. An-Nasir Yusuf found this intolerable and decided to annex Homs in the winter of 1248. The city surrendered in August and an-Nasir Yusuf's terms forced al-Ashraf Musa to hand over Homs, but he was allowed to retain nearby Palmyra and Tell Bashir in the Syrian Desert. As-Salih Ayyub sent Fakhr ad-Din to recapture Homs, but Aleppo countered by sending an army to Kafr Tab, south of the city. An-Nasir Dawud left Karak for Aleppo to support an-Nasir Yusuf, but in his absence, his brothers al-Amjad Hasan and az-Zahir Shadhi detained his heir al-Mu'azzam Isa and then personally went to as-Salih Ayyub's camp at al-Mansourah in Egypt to offer him control of Karak in return for holdings in Egypt. As-Salih Ayyub agreed and sent the eunuch Badr al-Din Sawabi to act as his governor in Karak.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{withdrew the}} next day as well, {{carrying}} the wounded British sailors to Jamaica before putting into Port-au-Prince, to debark the many foreign refugees picked up at Cape Haiten. After consultations with the American Consul, Capt. Walker took De Soto back to Cap-Haïtien on 7 November. There, he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS Galatea {{in the hopes of}} averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town, particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti. These talks failed and on 9 November, the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President Geffrard's forces. With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces, the rebel leaders took refuge on De Soto. Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the Dominican Republic. De Soto returned to Cape Haiten to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> events until 13 December when she sailed for home, arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 December.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Drenović {{was awarded}} the Order of Karađorđe's Star by King Peter, based on a {{recommendation}} by Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović. Following the Italian capitulation, Drenović agreed to all the actions of his Chetniks being performed in close cooperation with local German units, and was informed {{at the end of}} the year that Ustaše units would again be stationed in Serb-inhabited areas. In October 1943, a team from the 1st Battalion of the 4th Brandenburg Division under Oberleutnant Hermann Kirchner began working alongside Drenović's Chetniks in northwest Bosnia, operating forward reconnaissance groups and developing contact with anti-communist farmers to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Partisan troop movements. There were about 950 Chetniks serving under Drenović that year, positioned around Manjača and Glamoč. Drenović had about 400 Chetniks under his command by the following year. His was the only Chetnik band that the Ustaše trusted fully during the war. According to BN Televizija, Drenović is considered a Chetnik vojvoda.|$|E
5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that she}} disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E

Gwen's mother (Sharon Morgan) and father (William Thomas) are excited at the prospect of a grandchild, but Rhys' parents suspect Gwen of being pregnant by another man. Torchwood agent Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) is sent to the wedding venue to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|The seat of Ayyubid {{government}} from Saladin's rule from the 1170s up to al-Adil's reign in 1218 had been Damascus. The city provided a strategic {{advantage in the}} constant war with the Crusaders and allowed the sultan to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> his relatively ambitious vassals in Syria and al-Jazira. Cairo was too remote {{to serve as a}} base of operations, but had always served as the economic foundation of the empire. This rendered the city a critical constituent in the repertoire of the Ayyubid possessions. When Saladin was proclaimed sultan in Cairo in 1171, he chose the Fatimid-built Lesser Western Palace (part of a larger palace complex in Cairo isolated from the urban sprawl) as the seat of government. Saladin himself resided in the former Fatimid vizier palace, Turan-Shah took up a former Fatimid prince's living quarter, and their father occupied the Pearl Pavilion which was situated outside of Cairo overlooking the city's canal. The successive Ayyubid sultans of Egypt would live in the Lesser Western Palace.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's army heavily outnumbered Edward's, {{although}} sources {{differ on}} exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 10,000–30,000 men, with 7,000–15,000 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried {{to meet the}} Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet in the evening, and without knowing the precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line. The Yorkist king deployed Hastings {{on the left and}} entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank. Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre, although this was not due to faith in his ability—it was easier for the Yorkists to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> their twice-defected prince there. A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear, ready to deploy at Edward's call. As night fell, Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion. Under a strict order of silence, the Yorkist army crept closer to the Lancastrians. During the night, neither commander spotted the opposing army, an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day.|$|E

Dylan comforts Avery when she is being followed by men working for Marcus Wheeler (Mark Pinter), {{as a result of}} a dangerous case she is working on. Later, Dylan gets into a fight at Jimmy's Bar and is arrested. Avery pays his bail, but he can't leave town for another month until his hearing date, angering Nick. Chelsea then decides to pass her child off as Dylan's, and the two begin a genuine relationship despite Adam's suspicions that the child is actually his. Dylan later moves Chelsea into his new loft and proposes to her, to which she accepts, and he then arranges an impromptu wedding. Following the ceremony, Chelsea goes into labor and Dylan delivers the child, whom they name Terrence Connor McAvoy, after Dylan's father. However, the marriage ends when Dylan learns that Connor is Adam's son, not his. He also gets another shock when he discovers that he was adopted, and that his birth mother is none other than Nick's mother, Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).|$|E
