5|$|The first Lupin {{video game}} was a stealth game {{released}} to arcades in Japan by Taito in 1980 as Lupin III. A Laserdisc video game entitled Cliff Hanger was released to arcades in North America in 1983 by Stern. While it used footage from The Mystery of Mamo and The Castle of Cagliostro {{to provide a}} gaming experience similar to Dragon's Lair, <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> characters' names and has an original plot. Since then Lupin video games have been released {{for a number of}} platforms including Family Computer, Super Famicom, Sony Playstation, Sony Playstation 2, Sega Saturn, Nintendo DS and Sega Naomi.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E

25|$|Change in the {{direction}} of the axis rotation (precession) should not be pronounced. In itself, precession need not affect habitability as <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> direction of the tilt, not its degree. However, precession tends to accentuate variations caused by other orbital deviations; see Milankovitch cycles. Precession on Earth occurs over a 26,000-year cycle.|$|E

That is, the input side of the two-port is a dependent current source controlled by the voltage at the top of resistor R2.|$|E
25|$|Pseudouridine is a {{modified}} nucleoside found within non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). It increases {{the function of}} tRNA and rRNA by stabilizing the structure. Though mRNAs are not known for containing pseudouridine, the artificial process of pseudouridylation {{has an effect on}} the function of mRNA: <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> genetic code by making non-canonical base pairing possible in the ribosome decoding center. Pseudouridine also provides more hydrogen bonding opportunity and makes the RNA backbone more rigid.|$|E

25|$|The {{pedagogy}} of post-structuralism {{is marked}} by an attempt to redefine rhetoric {{as it relates to}} composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing {{can be seen as a}} metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act. Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.|$|E

[...] "What I am concerned about is that <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> complexion of south Tulsa. It {{would no longer be}} a residential area," [...] said Tom Taylor, an area resident.

500|$|... {{consider}} another VLSI design problem: {{the question}} of whether or not to mirror-reverse each module in a circuit design. This mirror reversal leaves the module's operations unchanged, but <b>it</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> order of the points at which the input and output signals of the module connect to it, possibly changing how well the module fits into the rest of the design. Boros et al. consider a simplified version of the problem in which the modules have already been placed along a single linear channel, in which the wires between modules must be routed, and there is a fixed bound on the density of the channel (the maximum number of signals that must pass through any cross-section of the channel). They observe that this version of the problem may be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance, in which the constraints relate the orientations of pairs of modules that are directly across the channel from each other. As a consequence, the optimal density may also be calculated efficiently, by performing a binary search in which each step involves the solution of a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E
