40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between selected motor tests and competitive successfulness in tennis for different age categories. The sample was comprised of 615 tennis players of both genders in the age categories of under- 14 and under- 18 years. Several motor abilities were investigated: the neuromuscular power of the arms, the elastic power of the legs, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> endurance of the trunk, acceleration, agility, hand-eye coordination, dynamic balance and running endurance. Competitive successfulness of players of both genders was defined by the position on the national ranking list and represented a criterion variable. The results of regression analysis showed in all categories a moderate, statistically significant correlation between the system of predictor variables and the criterion variable. A group of eight motor variables described 34 % of the criterion variable variance in the category of 12 - to 14 -year old girls and 54 % in the same age category of boys, whereas for the 15 - to 18 - year-old players the predictor variables described 52 % of the criterion variable variance in girls and 34 % in boys. The running endurance test in girls and the hand-eye coordination test in boys partially described competitive successfulness in the category of 12 - to 14 -year-olds. In the category of 15 - to 18 -year-olds, the criterion variance was partially described by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> endurance of the trunk in girls and hand-eye coordination and acceleration in boys. The results of the study underline the importance of several motor abilities for competitive successfulness in particular age categories of young tennis players. Cilj ovog istraživanja bio je utvrditi povezanost izabranih testova za procjenu motoričkih sposobnosti i natjecateljske uspješnosti u tenisu za različite dobne kategorije. Uzorak ispitanika uključivao je 615 tenisača i tenisačica u kategorijama od U 14 do U 18. Testirano je nekoliko motoričkih sposobnosti: eksplozivna snaga ruku i ramenog pojasa, elastična snaga nogu, repetitivna snaga trupa, eksplozivna snaga tipa sprinta, agilnost, koordinacija ruka-oko, dinamična ravnoteža te izdržljivost.

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{association}} of objectively assessed physical activity (PA) with <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and fat free mass in adolescents, and to determine whether meeting the current PA recommendations is associated {{with higher levels of}} <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and fat free mass. Subjects/Methods: The present cross-sectional study comprised 363 Spanish adolescents (180 females) aged 12. 5 - 17. 5 years. PA was assessed by accelerometry and expressed as average PA (counts/min), and min/day of inactive, light, moderate, vigorous and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). MVPA was dichotomized into < 60 min/day and ≥ 60. Upper body <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> was measured with the handgrip strength test, and lower body <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> was measured with the standing broad jump, squat jump, counter movement jump and Abalakov tests. Fat free mass was measured by DXA.

BackgroundMuscular strength is inversely associated with mortality in healthy men, but this association has not been examined in men with hypertension. MethodsWe followed 1, 506 hypertensive men age 40 years and older enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study from 1980 to 2003. Participants received an extensive medical examination at baseline. <b>Muscular</b> <b>strength</b> was quantified by combining 1 repetition maximum (1 -RM) measures for leg and bench press and cardiorespiratory fitness assessed by maximum exercise test on a treadmill. ResultsDuring an average follow-up of 18. 3 years, 183 deaths occurred. Age-adjusted death rates per 10, 000 person-years across incremental thirds of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> were 81. 8, 65. 5, and 52. 0 (p < 0. 05 for linear trend). Multivariable Cox regression hazard ratios were 1. 0 (reference), 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 57 to 1. 14), and 0. 59 (95 % CI: 0. 40 to 0. 86) across incremental thirds of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength.</b> After further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness, those participants in the upper third of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> still had a lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 45 to 0. 98). In the <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and CRF combined analysis, men simultaneously in the upper third of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and high fitness group had the lowest mortality risk among all combination groups (HR: 0. 49; 95 % CI: 0. 30 to 0. 82), with men in the lower third of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and low fitness group as reference.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} previous {{literature that}} {{has examined the}} influence of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> on various factors associated with athletic performance {{and the benefits of}} achieving greater <b>muscular</b> <b>strength.</b> Greater <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> is strongly associated with improved force-time characteristics that contribute to an athlete’s overall performance. Much research supports the notion that greater <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> can enhance the ability to perform general sport skills such as jumping, sprinting, and change of direction tasks. Further research indicates that stronger athletes produce superior performances during sport specific tasks. Greater <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> allows an individual to potentiate earlier and to a greater extent, but also decreases the risk of injury. Sport scientists and practitioners may monitor an individual’s strength characteristics using isometric, dynamic, and reactive strength tests and variables. Relative strength may be classified into strength deficit, strength association, or strength reserve phases. The phase an individual falls into may directly affect their level of performance or training emphasis. Based on the extant literature, it appears that there may be no substitute for greater <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> when it comes to improving an individual’s performance across a wide range of both general and sport specific skills while simultaneously reducing their risk of injury when performing these skills. Therefore, sport scientists and practitioners should implement long-term training strategies that promote the greatest <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> within the required context of each sport/event. Future research should examine how force-time characteristics, general and specific sport skills, potentiation ability, and injury rates change as individuals transition from certain standards or the suggested phases of strength to another...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the decrease in the load lifted from 1 to 5, 10, and 20 repetitions to failure for the flat barbell bench press (chest press; CP) and plate-loaded leg press (LP). Furthermore, we developed prediction equations for 1 repetition maximum (RM) strength from the multiple RM tests, including anthropometric data, gender, age, and resistance training volume. Seventy subjects (34 men, 36 women), 18 - 69 years of age, completed 1, 5, 10, and 20 RM testing for each of the CPs and LPs. Regression analyses of mean data revealed a nonlinear decrease in load with increasing repetition number (CP: linear Sy. x = 2. 6 kg, nonlinear Sy. x = 0. 2 kg; LP: linear Sy. x = 11. 0 kg, nonlinear Sy. x = 2. 6 kg, respectively). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the 5 RM data produced the greatest prediction accuracy, with R 2 data for 5, 10, and 20 RM conditions being LP: 0. 974, 0. 933, 0. 915; CP: 0. 993, 0. 976, and 0. 955, respectively. The regression prediction equations for 1 RM strength from 5 RM data were LP: 1 RM = 1. 0970 × (5 RM weight [kg]) + 14. 2546, Sy. x = 16. 16 kg, R 2 = 0. 974; CP: 1 RM = 1. 1307 × (5 RM weight) + 0. 6999, Sy. x = 2. 98 kg, R 2 = 0. 993. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> (1 RM) can be accurately estimated from multiple repetition testing.

40|$|Background/Aim. Stroke is {{the most}} common single cause of severe and {{multiple}} physical disabilities, and rehabilitation that reduces functional deficits {{is the most}} effective treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of special education treatment as a supplement to occupational therapy on upper extremities motor skills in adult patients with post stroke hemiplegia. Methods. Standard education tests for motor function evaluation of the upper extremities: O`Connor, Ring and Hand grip test, were applied on a sample of 64 patients who were in the process of rehabilitation in the Clinic for Rehabilitation “Dr. Miroslav Zotović” in Belgrade. After the evaluation, all the participants were included in occupational therapy and divided in two intervention groups per 32 subjects each. The patients from the first experimental group received individually dosed special education treatment which was performed for at least 12 weeks as a supplement together with occupational therapy, while patients from the second experimental group were only in the process of occupational therapy without special education treatment. At the end of the study the same tests were used to re-evaluate the level of motor abilities of the patients in both groups. Results. The patients from the first experimental group with individually dosed special education treatment as a supplement showed significantly better scores after applying the treatment in all tested variables – explosive, static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> grip fist, as well as oculomotor skills at the level of the elbow and shoulder for both healthy and paretic hand. Conclusion. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that special education treatment added to occupational therapy lead to better performing of upper extremities motor skills and that it can be a good supplement to conventional occupational therapy methods and techniques...|$|E

This study examined interactions among these common, modifiable factors, to help inform more-effective preventive interventions. Methods: This national cohort study included all 1, 547, 478 military conscripts in Sweden during 1969 - 1997 (97 %- 98 % of all men aged 18 years each year). Aerobic fitness, <b>muscular</b> <b>strength,</b> and BMI measurements were examined in relation to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality through 2012 (maximum age, 62 years). Data were collected/analyzed in 2015 - 2016. Results: Low aerobic fitness, low <b>muscular</b> <b>strength,</b> and obesity at age 18 years were independently associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. The combination of low aerobic fitness and <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> (lowest versus highest tertiles) was associated with twofold all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio= 2. 01; 95 % CI= 1. 93, 2. 08;. p< 0. 001; mortality rates per 100, 000 person years, 247. 2 vs 73. 8), and 2. 6 -fold cardiovascular mortality (2. 63; 95 % CI= 2. 38, 2. 91;. p< 0. 001; 43. 9 vs 8. 3). These factors also had positive additive and multiplicative interactions in relation to all-cause mortality (their combined effect exceeded the sum or product of their separate effects;. p< 0. 001), and were associated with higher mortality even among men with normal BMI. Conclusions: Low aerobic fitness, low <b>muscular</b> <b>strength,</b> and obesity at age 18 years were associated with increased mortality in adulthood, with interactive effects between aerobic fitness and <b>muscular</b> <b>strength.</b> Preventive interventions should begin early in life and include both aerobic fitness and <b>muscular</b> <b>strength,</b> even among those with normal BMI...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a 12 -week Nautilus weight training program on the muscular strength of a C 4 -C 5 incomplete spinal cord injured (SCI) subject. The subject selected for the study was a 19 -year-old male who sustained an incomplete spinal cord injury at the C 4 -C 5 level secondary to a diving accident in June of 1983. Muscular strength was assessed by one-repetition maximum tests using both free weights and Nautilus equipment. Weight, height, body girth, and skinfold measures were also ascertained. Each assessment item was administered as a pretest following an orientation of two practice sessions. Subsequent testing, utilizing all of the same assessment items, was performed on the subject after each week of training throughout the 12 -week program. The training program consisted of eight different exercises on seven Nautilus machines. Sessions were conducted three times a week for approximately 60 min per session. Training principles/protocols utilized in this study were those suggested by Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and comparisons were made between each week's assessment scores. Results of the combined <b>dynamic</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> assessment items revealed a considerable improvement in muscular strength following participation in a 12 -week Nautilus weight training program.

Procedures: This study was conducted during the first (spring) semester of 1982 at Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. Eighty students volunteered to serve as subjects. Of the 80, forty were athletes majoring in Physical Education and the others were non-majors enrolled in general physical education classes. The pre and post-test control group research design was employed for this study. For the test period, the subjects were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (weight training plus motor psychophysics training) or the control group (weight training only). Prior to the experimental period all subjects participated in a two week pre-conditioning weight training program in order to be familiar with the training and testing procedures of the experimental period. After completing the pre-conditioning period, the subjects trained utilizing the bench press and squat exercises following dynamic strength program. Experimental training extended over ten weeks with training sessions of 90 minutes twice a week. In addition to the experimental weight training program, motor psychophysics training was added for the experimental group. The one repetition maximum in the bench press and squat was used as a base line for measuring changes in dynamic strength. Testing for possible changes in dynamic strength due to motor psycho-physics training was conducted prior to the start of the experimental period, at the start of the 4 th, 7 th, and at the conclusion of the 10 th week of the experimental period. Analysis of Data: The collected data were analyzed by means of analysis of variance, t-test, percent, and the Least Significance Difference test. A significant level of. 05 for rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis was selected: Conclusions: From the statistical evaluation of the results, the following conclusions may be made. 1.

After at least two-year follow-up, measurement of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> of abductors, flexors, and external and internal rotators of the operated and nonaffected shoulder, as well as determination of range of motion (ROM) and function (ASES) in the operated and nonaffected shoulder, was performed. Measurement of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> in the patient group did not reveal statistically significant differences between operated and nonaffected shoulder. The arthroscopic capsular release does not have significant impact on the decrease in the <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> of the operated shoulder...|$|R

30|$|It is {{suggested}} that isometric multi-joint tests (IMJT) provide a time efficient assessment of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> [14, 15] that allows less interruption to training compared to isoinertial repetition maximum testing. Given the potential practical merit, {{it is important to}} understand the overall validity of IMJTs. The predominance of research to date investigating IMJTs has assessed their specific correspondence to dynamic performance tasks, such as jump height [3], change of direction [16] and sprint performance [17]. However, this work does not enhance understanding of IMJTs validity as a measure of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength.</b> Therefore, research attention is required to evaluate the evidence directly investigating validity properties of IMJTs as an assessment tool to evaluate <b>muscular</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|R
50|$|The U-shaped {{development}} in physical skill {{comes from the}} development and recession of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength,</b> on the graph the Y-axis is <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and the X-axis is time. <b>Muscular</b> <b>strength</b> develops and recedes over time because of necessity; one {{example of this is}} a baby learning to walk. The baby will gain the strength in its legs to be able to support itself and walk (which is the left top of the “U”), but it then grows larger, and the strength in its legs becomes less than required to support itself (the bottom of the “U”), but then the baby’s leg strength increases again which gives it the ability to support itself again (the right top of the “U”).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{predictive}} {{relationship between}} <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and endurance and cardio-metabolic health, independent from aerobic fitness, {{is not clear}} in disadvantaged Hispanic children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the predictive relationship between <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and endurance and clustered cardio-metabolic risk, controlling for aerobic fitness, in Hispanic children from low-income schools. Participants were 320 Hispanic children (Mean age= 10. 1 ± 1. 1 years; 164 girls, 156 boys) recruited during the 2014 – 2015 and 2015 – 2016 academic years from five low-income schools from the state of Utah in the U. S. <b>Muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and endurance was assessed using the push-up and curl-up tests and estimated VO 2 Peak was calculated from the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run. A clustered metabolic syndrome composite score (MetS) was calculated from cardio-metabolic health measurements consisting of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, blood glucose, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Multi-level general linear mixed effects models were used to examine the predictive relationship between <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and endurance and MetS, controlling for the effect of aerobic fitness and the clustering of children within classrooms and schools. Children who were in the middle and upper tertiles for <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and endurance associated with a lower (more favorable) MetS score (middle tertile: β=− 2. 59, 95 % C. I. [− 4. 23, − 0. 95], p< 0. 05; upper tertile: β=− 1. 57, 95 % C. I. [− 3. 20, − 0. 16], p< 0. 05). The results suggest that higher levels of <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> and endurance relate to lower cardio-metabolic risk, independent of aerobic fitness, in Hispanic children from low-income schools...|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} limited meta-analytical {{evidence}} available {{due to the lack}} of available studies. However, a meta-analysis by Silva et al. [18] on adults over 55  years of age found no differences in strength when training 1, 2, or 3  days week−[*] 1. The authors suggest that different combinations of acute RT variables might be equally valid in the strength development of healthy sedentary older adults. The only training variable that displayed any significant effect size (ES) for strength was training duration. A recent meta-analysis by Grgic et al. [19] compared different RT weekly frequencies (1, 2, 3, and ≥[*] 4  days week−[*] 1) on <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> gains. The results of their analysis indicated a significant effect on <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> when weekly RT frequency was increased. However, when subgroup analysis was performed on volume-equated studies, no significant effect (p[*]=[*] 0.421) of RT training frequency on <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> gains was observed. Grgic et al. [19] concluded that higher frequency could be used as a method of increasing total weekly training volume to promote <b>muscular</b> <b>strength</b> gains.|$|R
