40|$|In this study, a {{traditional}} Chinese herbal medicine—PentaHerbs formula (PHF), usually {{used for the}} treatment of atopic dermatitis, was successfully coated onto cotton fabrics by means of dyeing methods, i. e., mordant dyeing and <b>direct</b> <b>dyeing</b> process. Alum, copper sulphate and calcium chloride were used as mordant agents, and the mordanting processes adopted were pre-mordanting and post-mordanting process. The coated cotton fabrics with herbal medicine were mainly analyzed in terms of colour strength (K/S value) and drug loading using spectrophotometric analysis. Besides, the change of weight of the coated fabrics was also measured via gravimetric method. It was found that the mordanting process could significantly improve the drug loading, especially for the pre-mordanting process, compared with the <b>direct</b> <b>dyeing</b> method. Among the three mordants, alum treated fabrics had the highest drug loading. The results indicate that mordant dyeing process might be a promising way to develop herbal medicine garments.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} manner by which the uptake of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> on cellulosic fibres is promoted by {{a reduction in the}} liquor ratio used for dyeing. According to the model, which invokes the concept of interstitial water in dyeing, reducing the liquor ratio promotes dye aggregation which reduces the solubility of the dye in the bulk dyebath phase, so that the inherent preference of the dye to favour the aqueous phase shifts towards the fibre phase. It is suggested that the same mechanism accounts for the promotion of <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> uptake imparted by the addition of inorganic electrolyte to <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> dyebaths. As such, reduced liquor ratio and added inorganic electrolyte exert a combinatorial promotional effect on <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> uptake...|$|R

40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{project was}} set up with Cotton Incorporated and Gaston County Environmental Systems Division. The purpose was to develop and demonstrate a system for nearly complete water and salt recycling for textile wet processing facilities. The concept is to decolorize and purify mill wastewater by chemical and physical means. Fenton's reagent is used to oxidize the waste. The treated wastewater is then run through a membrane system to produce two streams. A permeate stream consists of relatively pure water and should be reusable as the main water supply for dyeing and finishing. The second stream is smaller and consists of a concentrated (IO- 12 %) sodium sulfate brine' that can be reused for dyebath make-up for reactive or <b>direct</b> <b>dyeing</b> after a further polishing step.

40|$|Dyeing of {{polyamide}} fibers {{is normally}} made with acid dyes, however, {{it is somewhat}} difficult to achieve uniformity and control of pH and temperature must be carefully made. The possibility to dye polyamide 6. 6 in a larger gamut of colours with good properties may be achieved using other classes of dyes after plasmatic modifications in textile substrates. Polyamide 6. 6 fabrics were treated with Double Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma obtained at atmospheric conditions in a semi-industrial machine and very positive results were obtained when dyeing is made with direct dyes. Surface modifications were evaluated, namely, roughness in terms of Atomic Force Microscopy, changes in chemical composition by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and microstructural analysis by SEM. In order to optimize dyeing process, different dye concentrations, pH and temperatures were attempted on dyeing with DBD treated fabrics. Important parameters were studied such as exhaustion, colour strength (K/S) and washing fastness. Chemical and physical effects of plasmatic discharge contribute to excellent results obtained in yield, exhaustion and fastness of dyeing of polyamide with direct dyes demonstrating extensive improvement of dye exhaustion from baths, easily achieving 100 % in shorter dyeing times. These results mean less dyes in effluents and less time for dyeing processes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cationic}} modification of cotton fabrics, using cationic agent (Chromatech 9414) on <b>direct</b> <b>dyeing</b> characteristics was studied in this work. Cationization of cotton fabric at different conditions (pH, cationic agent concentration, temperature and time) was investigated and the optimum conditions were determined. Nitrogen content of cotton samples pretreated with cationic agent was indicated. The {{results showed that}} increasing cationic agent concentration lead to higher nitrogen content on cotton fabric. The cationized cotton fabrics were dyed with two direct dyes (C. I. Direct Yellow 142 - C. I. Direct red 224) {{and the results were}} compared to untreated cotton fabrics. The parameters which may affect the dyeing process such as dye concn., addition of salt, time and temperature of dyeing were studied. The dyeing results illustrate that cationization improves the fabric dyeability compared to the uncationized cotton and the magnitude of increase in colour depth depends on the nitrogen content of the cationized cotton fabric. The results also refer to possibility of dyeing cationized cotton fabric with direct dyes without addition of electrolytes to give colour strength higher than that achieved on uncationized cotton using conventional dyeing method. Another important advantage of cationic treatment is in the saving of dye concn., energy,dyeing time, rinse water and subsequently saving of waste water treatment, and finally minimizes the environmental pollution. The changes in surface morphology of fibres after cationization were identified by various methods such as wettability and scanning with the electron microscope.

40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{is obliged to}} adapt to ecological legislation because classical processes have a great environmental impact caused by operations included in preparation, dyeing and printing of textile materials, specially those containing cotton. Removal of hydrophobic impurities and starches, using surfactants, alkalis and oxidants at high temperatures is normally made with important consequences at ecological level, with problematic effluents and higher costs. CORONA is a non- pollutant technique based in physical means of production of plasma at ambience pressure, which {{can be applied to}} reduce ecological and economical cost factors in textile industry. The term plasma means an ionized gas, formed by a complex mixture of electrons, neutral particles, ions, photons and radicals produced by an electric discharge or by radiation in electromagnetic fields able to produce ionization. When the fabric runs betweenelectrodes and an electric discharge is made at ambience temperature and pressure, with a high voltage of more than 10 000 V and a frequency between 20 - 40 kHz, the treatment is known as CORONA. In the medium, free electrons lose energy when collide with neutral molecules. This energy transfer produces new very reactive particles and with capacity to be involved in other reactions, responsible for the formation of new compounds and changes of fibre’s superficial properties. CORONA technology is not industrially used in textiles yet, but it has a wide application in the case of other polymeric products like plastics in order to achieve a better degree of cohesion between printing inks and materials. Its application in textiles has been thought in order to take practical advantage of the possibility to work continuously at ambience conditions. CORONA effects in the structure of cotton’s surface were already studied and the creation of channels for water penetration was proved, together with the oxidation of fatty matters, which are the mechanisms responsible for the fast increase in hidrophility after CORONA treatment. This fact is decisive in what concerns all the chain of wet processes for cotton transformation. Studies were previously made about CORONA effects in textile printing. These studies led to very good results related to the reinforcement of links in the system fibre-pigment together with surface changes caused by the discharge which are responsible for an increase in the wet/dry rubbing fastness. It is possible to have a fastness improvement of one point, which means an optimal result for pigment printing quality. In the present work, the extension of these results to preparation and dyeing of cotton has been made. Shorter, cleaner and easier processes are possible, including <b>direct</b> <b>dyeing</b> of raw cotton materials. Depending on final use for textile dyed products, results for a completely “Green Process” are presented, where the presence of husks and seeds not removed by any chemical treatment {{can be seen as a}} kind of quality certification...|$|E

The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the coagulation features of polymeric aluminum coagulants in treatment of dye-polluted waters and the emphasis was placed on the roles of preformed Al species, particularly Al- 13. The performance of Al- 13 in coagulation of dyes was observed through jar tests by comparing traditional Al salt, polyaluminum chloride (PACI), and purified Al- 13. The results showed that under most cases All 3 had significantly higher efficiency in removal of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> than traditional Al salt and commercial PAC] with the exception of Direct Red 28 removal under high pH range. The coagulation of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> could be greatly affected by pH. Reducing pH was favorable for preformed Al species in a broad pH range. For traditional Al coagulant, efficient dye removal only occurred in a relatively narrow pH range of near 6. 0. The outstanding coagulation behavior of Al- 13 Could be ascribed to its high charge neutralization ability, relative stability and potential self-assembly tendency. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
