His final appearance for Chelsea came against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg, which went to penalties. Geremi came on as an extra-time substitute and went on to have his penalty saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT of The Flying Termite by L. L. Katona -/- In {{this book}} I {{would like to}} show the term “intelligence“ has a universal, non-anthropomorphic meaning. We can {{perceive}} intelligence in dogs, dolphins or gorillas without understanding of it, but intelligence can be also seen in many other things from insects and the Solar System to elementary particles or the rules of a triangle. But that doesn’t mean intelligence comes from Intelligent Design, yet alone a Designer, they {{seems to be the}} “state of things” in the Universe. One of the most known law of the triangle is “the measures of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space always add up to 180 degrees. ” The question is this law exists without any existing triangle, or not? If there is an encrypted program in DNA, what determines which living being will be a chameleon or a cat, where this program lies? Whether in the DNA itself? But DNA also programmed. Where is the program of a computer? You may say in the hard drive or in the head of the programmer. But the hard drive or the head of the programmer is just the vehicle of the program; when you dissect a computer or a programmer’s head you will not find the program, just the diodes or cells connected by pack of orders. And you won’t see the orders in them. In my book I want to show the works of this elusive intelligence with some interesting contradictions between causality, determinism, teleology, and dependent formation through biology, mathematics and logic. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> summarize my idea I can use the following parable.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Constructing Race and Sexuality track. A minimal criterion for scientists’ successful communication with lay publics is that it not be irrational for members of those publics to take scientists’ claims to be credible. The importance of scientific method lies in its promise that those who comply with it will arrive at identical, or compatible, results, usually expressed in terms of discovering the truth (or, at least, moving reliably in its direction). Scientific method has grounded the rationally sanctioned response to unavoidable epistemic dependency, namely trust in testimony, specifically the testimony of experts. One cornerstone to that trust has been the institutionalization of expertise—in the training, selection, and credentialing of experts and in the oversight of their practice. To most lay publics, however, those institutions are opaque, and—lamentably—to many they appear anything but trustworthy. The rational credibility of all the research and researchers in a university suffers from practices ranging from disrespectful interactions between researchers and the communities their research bears upon, to outsourcing and other anti-labor policies regarding non-academic staff, to the unaddressed alienation of students from non-dominant cultural backgrounds. No amount of good research practice on the part of academics can rationally ground trust when that research occurs within an institution whose public face makes trust in that institution irrational. I will argue that not only the rational credibility, but also the objectivity of research demands an institutional commitment to social justice. My aim is to make a case for the centrality to 21 st century epistemology of ethically and politically engaged social epistemology. We need, I want to suggest, a fundamental reorientation of these fields away from the epistemological problems that start inside the consciousness of an individual knower and were required to ground the epistemic authority of the modern bourgeois individual, and toward the problems that confront those who would, in today’s world of irreducible diversity and unprecedented epistemic dependency, be doxastically responsible. For Descartes and the other philosophers of epistemic modernity the trustworthiness of scientific practice rested on an appeal to generic human rationality: if your doxastic choices were deemed worthy of consideration, then you were essentially the same as those with the expertise and could trust that, if they were following the specified disciplined scientific method, the results they came up with would be the same as those you would come up with, were you to follow that same method. Those who were regarded as not essentially interchangeable with the experts (i. e., those who were not able-bodied and minded Christian heterosexual land-owning European men) were, tautologically, those whose doxastic behavior was taken to be fundamentally unreliable—precisely because of their essential difference. Thus, the progress of liberalism has been marked by more and more groups’ staking a claim to essential sameness. As unfinished as this liberal agenda remains, it has—since at least the mid- 1960 ’s—fallen into increasing disfavor—with post-colonial nationalisms, Black nationalism, queer theory and activism, many forms of feminism, and some disability rights theory and activism. From these perspectives, the political goal is not recognition in the ranks of the same, and diversity is not seen as either superficial or as a liability. While some post-modern theorists take the implication of such moves to be the demise of notions of objectivity, truth, and reality (or at least the irreducible pluralization of the latter two), there are good reasons for resisting such claims—reasons that are grounded in the dependency we all have on unverifiable expertise. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know if it’s safe to drink the water, a playful pluralism is not very helpful—I need the truth. Thus, there is a pressing need for practical, public, politically engaged epistemology, which starts with the recognition that what we take to be the founding work of the field in its modern incarnation—the work that gave us the conception of rational individual thought leading to universally justified belief and even knowledge—was just that: public, engaged epistemology, rather than the exercise of pure reason that we have been taught to regard it as. Modern epistemological theories were interventions into questions of enormous public moment—explicit attempts to craft both individual personhood and the (singular) public that could be its collective expression. Such discussions are once again urgently needed, since the past half-century has effectively undermined the work of our 17 th C predecessors, and we have not yet found anything to replace it. Unfortunately, current developments are moving us in precisely the wrong direction. The privatization of public universities, for example, exacerbates, on the education side, the widening wealth gap and increasing class stratification, placing public universities increasingly in the camp of social institutions associated with the contraction of democracy, rather than—as had historically been the case—with its expansion. On the research side privatization leads to the setting of research agendas in line with corporate profit rather than either human need or scientific curiosity, {{as well as to the}} explicit encouragement of marketable research, leading to well-documented conflicts of interest, and hence to the growing public distrust of scientific expertise. I want to suggest that the embrace of diversity and a politics of social justice is a route to the restoration of genuinely public goods and the responsibility for them—and that we can best understand objectivity and truth as public goods, often dependent on expert testimony held to public—ethical and political—standards. A commitment to objectivity—to the broad trustworthiness of knowledge claims—requires a commitment to social justice, to the conditions that would make it broadly rational to trust institutions that embody socially recognized authority and privilege. Equally important is a recognition of the epistemic value of diversity, of the contributions to knowledge-creation of diversely located observers and critical commentators, including those who, for various reasons, are not at home in the economic, social, and cultural mainstream...|$|E

40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 I know I could have her {{any time that}} I want and I know that she wants me even more. Don 2 ̆ 7 t mistake my {{certainty}} for over-confidence or a cocky sort of attitude 2 ̆ 7 cause I ain 2 ̆ 7 t about all that. Fact is, I can tell {{just by looking at}} a girl 2 ̆ 7 s eyes whether she want to bed me or not. Anyway, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> explain myself to you in the first place. You should be so lucky that I tell you anything at all. I mean, this is my life that you 2 ̆ 7 re reading about isn 2 ̆ 7 t it? I never really could figure out why people sit down with their pen and paper thinking that their words mean something. 2 ̆ 7 Cause as soon as idiot knuckle heads like you get a hold of the stuff it 2 ̆ 7 s as worthless as Christianity in Ethiopia everyone anticipates this great exchange, when all it ever amounts to is all take and no give. But like I was saying, this girl needs me real bad, right? And she 2 ̆ 7 s been sending the eye through this here crowded room all night long. You know, one of those sorry-ass stuffy inner-city houses that have 2 ̆ 2 College-Dormers-Living-Off-Campus-For-The-Semester 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 written all over them. And, as if the requisite dart board and too-cheesy-for-me portable bar with neon lights isn 2 ̆ 7 t bad enough they 2 ̆ 7 ve seen to it to invite every beer-suckin, titty-twistin, exam-flunking dork on campus. And so I 2 ̆ 7 m wondering (don 2 ̆ 7 t bother me, okay) : Self, would you bother moving off campus and endure extra commutes just so that you could not-quite-afford to drag everyone else off of campus to come to your house? But my self can 2 ̆ 7 t answer that question right now because the girl with the moist panties is staring me in the eye again. Well, like I said, she wants my sex something fierce. I almost never have to ask for it. Actually, I don 2 ̆ 7 t ever have to. Only sometimes I do it to humor the other person. Can you believe it? She 2 ̆ 7 s actually coming over here to me right now. I hate to say it, but I told you [...] . wait a minute, I don 2 ̆ 7 t have to say it because you 2 ̆ 7 ve probably read it somewhere before. Anyway I got to go right now to take care of business if you know what I mean, but I 2 ̆ 7 ll be back right away. 2 ̆...|$|R
5000|$|American {{film and}} {{television}} critic David Lavery's response {{to what he calls}} [...] "the strangest piece of program music ever composed" [...] was more visceral: [...] When I first listened to Stockhausen's [...] "Ylem", I was, at its close, nearly unable to move; the music seemed almost to have disintegrated my ordinary molecular structure, replacing it with its own aleatory form, and I waited a few moments before I attempted to move, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reassemble my body. [...] Explaining his personal reaction {{in the context of a}} recurring childhood nightmare of nothingness, Lavery invokes a similar idea underlying H. P. Lovecraft's short story [...] "The Music of Erich Zann" [...] and sensations described in passages from Georges Poulet, Rainer Maria Rilke, Herman Melville, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Paul Valéry, R. Murray Schafer, and the Śūraṅgama Sūtra. Finding that Ylem represents the Vedic [...] "unstruck sound of the celestial realm" [...] or anahata nad, Lavery concludes that it is representative of Stockhausen's moment form, [...] "music made out of nothing, one of Stockhausen's most effective attempts to create a 'sequence of silences'" [...]|$|R
5000|$|We {{wanted to}} win the Constructors' Championship and we have done it, not just by getting three points but by winning and by coming third. It was a very tight and tough race and DC was pushing me all the way, so it was tough {{physically}} and on the car. I did not know Mika had jumped the start as I was concentrating on the lights. I {{did not have a}} very good start and struggled to get off the line and so I was third as David out-braked me round the outside. He was pulling away and I was concerned, because I could not go any faster. At that point he was definitely quicker than me. I was hoping he would pit early. He did and our strategy did the rest. David put me under pressure at the end, but I had looked after the last set of tyres so that I could have defended myself <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fight him off. Then I just concentrated on not making a mistake. Michael Schumacher, speaking after the race. The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher said that he and his team were delighted at clinching the victory and securing the Constructors' Championship. He also added that he took victory with the use of team strategy after he realised Coulthard was quicker than him. Coulthard apologised to Michael Schumacher over the comments made by the McLaren driver about the German throughout the season. However, he also added he would not be retracting any comments made about his rival's driving style but {{the way in which they}} were expressed. Barrichello described his race as [...] "lonely" [...] because of the lack of on track action he experienced. He also said that the hot temperatures he experienced worrying him mentally due to his illness.|$|R
