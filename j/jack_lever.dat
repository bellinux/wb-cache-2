2500|$|The MCC {{drove to}} Launceston by the {{beautiful}} Great Lake of Tasmania {{for a game}} against a Tasmanian Combined XI. In this the Tasmanian team were stiffen {{by the presence of}} Arthur Morris, Graeme Hole, Jim de Courcy and Geoff Noblet from the mainland. <b>Jack</b> <b>Lever</b> won the toss and the Combined XI batted first, but Morris was [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] again as the big Surrey bowler took 5/54 in what some thought was his best bowling, the ball continually beating the bat, but bad luck denying him wickets. Only Graeme Hole (105) made any headway with some late-order hitting from Laver (59) bringing them up to a respectable 289. The MCC opened steadily, but the fireworks came from captain Denis Compton (142) and veteran Cyril Washbrook (112) who added 200 runs for the fourth wicket. Gilbert Parkhouse made 44 and Compton declared for 382/7 on their overnight score. Bedser (2/29) accounted for both the openers {{and the rest of the}} team fell to the leg-spin of Eric Hollies (4/7) and Chinamen of Compton himself (3/39) and they were out for 103 in the rain. The weather cleared up in time for the MCC to make the 10 runs for a clear ten wicket victory. After the match Compton remarked [...] "What a pity that they don't play Tests in Tasmania".|$|E

50|$|Once back on shore, Toni is distraught to find <b>Jack</b> <b>levering</b> a caged Andre onto a {{transport}} vehicle. Harry {{explains to}} her that Andre is {{going to live in}} the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe and cared for in ways they can't. Annie Potts, an aquarium worker, tells Toni they will take good care of him, that they will love having him there, and that she will get to visit him whenever she wants. She reluctantly accepts the notion, and tells Andre that she loves him and will visit him all the time.|$|R
50|$|The Mingun Bell {{was knocked}} off its {{supports}} {{as a result}} of a large earthquake on 23 March 1839. It was resuspended by the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company in March 1896 using screw <b>jacks</b> and <b>levers</b> using funds from public subscription. The party to celebrate was attended by many and an hourly boat was required to take visitors from nearby Mandalay. Felice Beato captured a photograph of the bell prior to its resuspension.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes a {{name is a}} devotion, a dream & love. With {{his vision}} and blessings of his Dadi Ma, Deepak Raj (Faraaz Khan), son of a London-based NRI Kuldeep Rai (Dilip Tahil) and Kashi (Beena), visits India with his friend little <b>jack</b> (Johnny <b>Lever),</b> a music composer, where he meets Radha (Deepti Bhatnagar), a simple flower girl. Love whispers into their ears and the {{fragrance}} of it is crushed by selfish motives of Minister Sukhdev (Pramod Moutho) and Rustogi (Arun Bakshi) bith friends of Kuldeep Rai. Love sees no barrier - a phrase commonly heard and read is so true to his life, is what portrays Dulhan Banoo Mein Teri.|$|R

The Man in the Planet appears to control the creature with his levers, eventually making it fall into a pool of water.|$|R
40|$|Motor-manual {{tree felling}} is {{commonly}} practiced {{in many regions}} of the world. Trees falling in unwanted directions cause severe accidents and extra work in motor-manual logging. Different kinds of manual tools can help force trees to fall in the desired direction, but their capacity are uncertain {{due to a lack}} of suitable evaluation methods. Reliable recommendations of felling tools’ limits could help reduce human injuries and damage to property. The objective of this study was, therefore, to develop and evaluate a realistic and convenient method for studying felling tools’ capacity in terms of the potential torque they can generate. A theoretical model of torque components was constructed and the mechanics of the falling tree and of the studied equipment were explained. The developed method uses real trees, which were cut at 1. 65 m above stump height to create trial stems. Trial stems were anchored to a neighboring tree and then cut as if they were to be felled. Standardized forces were applied to a forestry <b>jack,</b> felling <b>lever,</b> and wedge, and their effects on the trial stem were recorded by a load cell in the anchoring line. The method proved suitable for the evaluation of forestry jacks, while it needs improvements to evaluate felling levers and wedges thoroughly. Methodological improvements are suggested and practical applications are discussed and demonstrated in terms of the forestry jack’s capacity to deal with trees with unfavorable angles of inclination...|$|R
40|$|Examined {{predictors}} of children's ratings of postoperative pain intensity {{based on a}} model of children's expectations for surgery developed from the Children's Health Belief Model (Bush & lannotti, 1990) and McGroth's (1990) model of children s pain experiences. Prior to their inpatient surgeries, 28 children (ages 7 - 17 years) and their parents completed ratings of children's expected surgery pain, anticipatory anxiety, and expected helpfulness of pain medicine. Following surgery, children completed ratings of their postoperative pain intensity. Age, total analgesics administered, and anticipatory anxiety emerged as significant {{predictors of}} children's postoperative pain ratings. Methodological issues con-cerning the measurement of children's expectations for surgery are discussed. KEY WORDS: children; surgery; pain intensity; expectations; anxiety.

40|$|While some {{attempts}} have been made to model the behaviour of the grand piano action (the mechanism that translates a key press into a hammer striking a string), most researchers have reduced the system to a simple model with little relation to the components of a real action. While such models are useful for certain applications, they are not appropriate as design tools for piano makers, since the model parameters have little physical meaning and must be calibrated from the behaviour of a real action. A new model for a piano action is proposed in this thesis. The model treats each of the five main action components (key, whippen, <b>jack,</b> repetition <b>lever,</b> and hammer) as a rigid body. The action model also incorporates a contact model to determine the normal and friction forces at 13 locations between each of the contacting bodies. All parameters in the model are directly measured from the physical properties of individual action components, allowing the model to be used as a prototyping tool for actions that have not yet been built. To test whether the model can accurately predict the behaviour of a piano action, an experimental apparatus was built. Based around a keyboard from a Boston grand piano, the apparatus uses an electric motor to actuate the key, a load cell to measure applied force, and optical encoders and a high speed video camera to measure the positions of the bodies. The apparatus was found to produce highly repeatable, reliable measurements of the action. The behaviour of the action model was compared to the measurements from the experimental apparatus for several types of key blows from a pianist. A qualitative comparison showed that the model could very accurately reproduce the behaviour of a real action for high force blows. When the forces were lower, the behaviour of the action model was still reasonable, but some discrepancy from the experimental results could be seen. In order to reduce the discrepancy, it was recommended that certain improvements could be made to the action model. Rigid bodies, most importantly the key and hammer, should be replaced with flexible bodies. The normal contact model should be modified to account for the speed-independent behaviour of felt compression. Felt bushings that are modelled as perfect revolute joints should instead be modelled as flexible contact surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The piano {{action is}} the {{mechanism}} that transforms the finger force {{applied to a}} key into the motion of a hammer that strikes a piano string. This thesis focuses on improving the fidelity of the dynamic model of a grand piano action which has been already developed by Hirschkorn et al. at the University of Waterloo. This model is the state-of-the-art dynamic model of the piano in the literature {{and is based on}} the real components of the piano action mechanism (key, whippen, <b>jack,</b> repetition <b>lever,</b> and hammer). Two main areas for improving the fidelity of the dynamic model are the hammer shank and the connection point between the key and the ground. The hammer shank is a long narrow wooden rod and, by observation with a high-speed video camera, the flexibility of this part has been confirmed. In previous work, the piano hammer had been modelled as a rigid body. In this work, a Rayleigh beam model is used to model the flexible behaviour of the hammer shank. By comparing the experimental and analytical results, {{it turns out that the}} flexibility of the hammer shank does not significantly affect the rotation of the other parts of the piano mechanism, compared with the case that the hammer shank has been modelled as a rigid part. However, the flexibility of the hammer shank changes the impact velocity of the hammer head, and also causes a greater scuffing motion for the hammer head during the contact with the string. The connection of the piano key to the ground had been simply modelled with a revolute joint, but the physical form of the connection at that point suggests that a revoluteprismatic joint with a contact force underneath better represents this connection. By comparing the experimental and analytical results, it is concluded that incorporating this new model significantly increases the fidelity of the model for the blows. In order to test the accuracy of the dynamic model, an experimental setup, including a servo motor, a load cell, a strain gauge, and three optical encoders, is built. The servo motor is used to actuate the piano key. Since the purpose of the motor is to consistently mimic the finger force of the pianist, the output torque of the motor is controlled. To overcome the problem associated with the motor torque control method used in previous work, a new torque control method is implemented on a real-time PC and a better control of the motor torque output is established. Adding a more realistic model of the piano string to the current piano action model and finding a better contact model for the contacts that happen between the surfaces that are made of felt (or leather), are two main areas that can be worked on in the future research. These two areas will help to further increase the fidelity of the present piano action model...|$|R
