5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below <b>green</b> <b>growth</b> is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage <b>green</b> <b>growth</b> and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
5|$|Major {{threats to}} the {{cockatoo}} include clearance of their feeding and nesting habitat, destruction of nesting hollows (e.g. during firewood collection), competition with other species for nest sites, and poaching. Since European settlement, 56% of its habitat has been cleared, mainly for agriculture. Furthermore, 54% of its habitat on the Swan Coastal Plain—an important area outside the breeding season—has been lost. Much of this area lies within the Perth metropolitan area, and the city's population is predicted to increase 70% by 2050. The Western Australian State Government has produced a <b>Green</b> <b>Growth</b> Plan to manage this expansion; conservation groups are concerned the cockatoo (along with other species) could suffer further loss of habitat. In particular, the loss of pine plantations north of Perth could jeopardise the species' food supply. In February 2017, WWF-Australia and BirdLife Australia appealed to the Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg to intervene and halt the ongoing removal of pine trees. BirdLife International designated 13 sites (Important Bird Areas) as being important specifically for Carnaby's black cockatoo. These are the Northern Swan Coastal Plain, which supports between 4600 and 15000 birds outside the breeding season, the Stirling Range, and 11 other sites that support between 20 and 110 breeding pairs of Carnaby's black cockatoos.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new <b>green</b> <b>growth.</b> In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

30|$|We used {{to believe}} that {{developed}} countries would have generally entered an era of slowing economic growth for environmental protection, that is, {{the importance of the}} environment would have been overwhelmingly greater than that of the economic output. However, the ongoing financial crisis shows that, in fact, developed economies also view economic growth as the bottom line. If the long-term economic recession leads to financial difficulties, there would be lack of support for developing the green economy. But {{this does not mean that}} Europe and the USA and other developed countries can once again ignore the green economy. They play a leading role in the technical reserves for <b>green</b> economic <b>growth</b> so that their financial difficulties cannot fundamentally undermine the base of <b>green</b> economic <b>growth.</b> In particular, Europe's more advanced technologies and experience with <b>green</b> economic <b>growth,</b> especially experiences in the construction of institutions, are the strengths that China and other developing countries need. China and other developing countries have broad markets for the use of technologies and experiences of <b>green</b> economic <b>growth</b> and can become the sites for developing and implementing green technologies. Thus, the cooperation of Europe, the USA, and other developed countries with China can greatly promote <b>green</b> economic <b>growth.</b> This is not only conducive to solving problems linked to resources and the environment in China, but would also help European countries find a way out of their economic mess.|$|R

40|$|This paper adopts the slacks-based measure-directional {{distance}} function (SBM-DDF, 2009) {{method for}} deriving the “Green Innovation Growth” rates of 28 manufacturing industries in China. The {{results indicate that}} the overall level of <b>green</b> innovation <b>growth</b> in China’s manufacturing is relatively low, with a declining trend. The tradeoffs among energy, environment and economy are rather sharp, and the “Porter Effect (1995) ” (environmental regulation will promote green technology innovation) is not currently realized quickly in manufacturing. These evaluations imply an unsustainable development model in China, with significant differences among industries. By using a dynamic panel threshold model and employing an industry-level panel dataset for 2008 – 2014, we show that external knowledge sourcing has a significant negative impact on <b>green</b> innovation <b>growth</b> but with different constraints on R&D levels among industries. With the strengthening of R&D levels, gradually surpassing “critical mass”, the negative role of external knowledge sourcing in driving this mechanism becomes smaller and smaller; it has a non-linear relationship with the “threshold effect”. Consequently, we provide insights into the relationship among energy consumption, environmental pollution and technology innovation, and show how the heterogeneity of the R&D threshold affects differences in external knowledge sourcing and <b>green</b> innovation <b>growth.</b> These insights lead {{to a better understanding of}} the driving force, realizing path and policy design for <b>green</b> innovation <b>growth...</b>|$|R
