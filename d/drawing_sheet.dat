2500|$|In 1868, {{long before}} the advent of powered {{aircraft}} flight — and within a decade of the birth of both Orville and Wilbur Wright — Boulton patented the first aileron. [...] The aileron system he created was to be actuated by either a hand operated control (not illustrated on the patent's drawings) or by an automatic pendulum control device (depicted on the patent's <b>drawing</b> <b>sheet),</b> with the intended function of a single-axis autopilot. Boulton's inspiration for a lateral flight control device has been attributed to French Count Ferdinand Charles Honore Phillipe d'Esterno, whose detailed analysis of flapping and soaring bird flight, Du Vol des Oiseaux (On the flight of birds) was published as a pamphlet in 1864. Although Boulton's prescient aileron control system was fully functional, he, as did almost everyone of his era, lacked a detailed understanding of aerodynamics, and an airplane he designed never achieved flight.|$|E

50|$|A <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is a small}} {{bed sheet}} placed {{crosswise}} over {{the middle of the}} bottom sheet of a mattress to cover the area between the person's upper back and thighs, often used by medical professionals to move patients. It can be made of plastic, rubber, or cotton, and is about half the size of a regular sheet. It can be used in place of a mattress pad if a rubber mattress is used. The <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> {{may or may not be}} tucked into the sides of the bed. When a <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> is used to move patients, it is sometimes known as a lift sheet. Nursing manuals recommend that, when a plastic or rubber <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> is used, a cotton drawsheet is placed over it. If a folded sheet is used as a <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> the folded edge of the sheet is positioned at the person's upper body. <b>Draw</b> <b>sheets</b> used as lift sheets are generally not tucked in, though sometimes after the move, they are.|$|R
50|$|A {{fitted sheet}} {{goes over the}} mattress. Often a <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> also called lift sheet, is used, where it is placed over the fitted sheet {{and in the center}} where it will be under the patient’s midsection. By lifting the <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> it is used to help move the patient. The fitted <b>sheet</b> and <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> which are those that go under the patient, are firmly tucked in to prevent wrinkles, which can promote skin breakdown. A top sheet and blanket are often placed over the bed and the corners are mitered.|$|R

This paper presents the research work involved {{in the development of}} a knowledge based system for cost-{{estimation of}} deep <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> metal parts. The proposed system is structured in form of two modules viz., module COMPC for estimation of total manufacturing cost of deep drawn parts and module TOOLC for estimation of total tooling cost of deep drawing tool.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} of the Light Duty Utility Arm (LDUA) drawing walkdown. The purpose of this walkdown was to validate the essential configuration of the LDUA in preparation of deploying the equipment in a Hanford waste tank. The LDUA system has, over the course of its development, caused the generation of a considerable number of design drawings. The number of drawings is estimated to be well over 1, 000. A large number consist of vendor type drawings, furnished by both Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and SPAR Aerospace Limited (SPAR). A smaller number, approximately 200, are H- 6 type <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> in the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) document control system. A preliminary inspection of the drawings showed that the physical configuration of the LDUA did not match the documented configuration. As a result of these findings, a scoping walkdown of 20 critical <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> was performed to determine if a problem existed in configuration management of the LDUA system. The results of this activity showed that 18 of the 20 <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> were found to contain errors or omissions of varying concern. Given this, Characterization Engineering determined that a walkdown of the drawings necessary and sufficient to enable safe operation and maintenance of the LDUA should be performed. A review team was assembled to perform a review of all of the drawings and determine the set which would need to be verified through an engineering walkdown. The team determined that approximately 150 H- 6 type <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> would need to be verified, 12 SPAR/PNNL <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> would need to be verified and converted to H- 6 drawings, and three to six new drawings would be created (see Appendix A). This report documents the results of that walkdown...|$|R

5000|$|In 1992, the American National Standards Institute adopted ANSI/ASME Y14.1 Decimal Inch <b>Drawing</b> <b>Sheet</b> Size and Format which {{defined a}} regular series of paper sizes {{based upon the}} de facto {{standard}} [...] in × 11 in [...] "letter" [...] size which it assigned [...] "ANSI A".

This series is somewhat similar to the ISO 216 standard in that cutting a sheet in half would produce two sheets of the next smaller size. Unlike the ISO standard, however, the arbitrary aspect ratio forces this series to have two alternating aspect ratios. ANSI/ASME Y14.1 has been revised or updated in 1995, 2005 and 2012.
