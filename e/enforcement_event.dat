[...] Several unplanned pregnancies were documented on the 1996 study tour {{which resulted in}} more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly enforced curfews. The tour is overseen by {{a dozen or so}} counselors whose responsibilities include rule <b>enforcement,</b> <b>event</b> planning, herding the program participants around on outings and rousing them from their sleep in the mornings.

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of reintegrative shaming theory {{in the field of}} criminology, {{only a small number of}} studies purporting to test it have been published to date. The aim of the present study, therefore, is to provide an empirical test of Braithwaite 2 ̆ 7 s (1989; Braithwaite and Braithwaite 2001) theory of reintegrative shaming in the white-collar crime context. The data on which the study is based came from survey data collected from a group of 652 tax offenders. Consistent with predictions, it was found that feelings of reintegration/stigmatization experienced during an <b>enforcement</b> <b>event</b> were related to reoffending behaviour. Those taxpayers who felt that their enforcement experience had been reintegrative in nature were less likely to report having evaded their taxes two years later. Consistent with Braithwaite and Braithwaite 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) hypotheses, shame-related emotions were also found to partially mediate the effect of reintegration on subsequent offending behaviour. Implications for the effective regulation of white-collar offenders are discussed. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} connection between political donations, lobbying, levels of production, and state enforcement efforts in the coal industry. The authors draw on treadmill of production theory as developed by Schnaiberg to situate the analysis within green criminology. Specifically, based on treadmill of production theory the authors hypothesize that coal companies {{are more likely to}} increase political donations and lobbying efforts prior to the conclusion of any state enforcement effort (administrative, civil, or criminal violation). In addition, and consistent with treadmill of production theory, the authors hypothesize that the probability of environmental enforcement will be lower for coal companies that are more embedded in the treadmill of production and higher for companies less embedded in the treadmill. To test these hypotheses, a case-crossover design is used that allows for comparisons within companies by looking at treadmill-related characteristics {{at the time of the}} violation and at randomly chosen points in time before and after that violation. The authors discovered that while lobbying efforts and level of embeddedness in the treadmill were unrelated to state enforcement, political donations significantly increase for companies just prior to the conclusion of an <b>enforcement</b> <b>event</b> (odds ratio = 6. 36). It is also discovered that corporate restructuring is related to environmental enforcement. The article concludes by offering insights into alternative analysis and uses of treadmill of production theory as it relates to green criminology...|$|E

In a narrative style, the arti- cle tells a tale of an economic modernisation that went horribly wrong. In the foreground are State aid cases involving several important policy decisions of the Icelandic government during this twenty year period. We shall see that the implementation of the policy programs was fundamentally flawed. We shall also see that the State aid regime of the EEA Agree- ment consistently failed in pursuing aid issues that could to some extent have mitigated these flaws.

40|$|Cleaning STRIDE data to {{generate}} market prices We largely follow the methodology that Arkes et al. (2004) outline {{to prepare a}} series of meth prices. This report, which the authors prepare for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, examines the price trends for cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and meth in the US using prices from the Drug Enforcement Agency’s System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE). We acquired STRIDE through a Freedom of Information Act request. STRIDE observations come from law <b>enforcement</b> <b>events</b> such as lab seizures, undercover purchases, etc. Samples are sent to DEA labs to identify the drugs and purities. Cocaine, heroin, and meth, occur sufficiently frequently to construct a price series. On the other hand, law enforcement officers collect most cannabis observations from seizures rather than purchases, and therefore {{it is not possible}} to construct a marijuana price series. Following Arkes et al.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a test of}} the market valuation impact of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions for foreign firms. I examine the SEC enforcement policy towards foreign firms under its jurisdiction. In contrast to Siegel (2005) who examines earlier years, I find that the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s current (post- 2002) enforcement intensity is considerable and has increased dramatically by comparison. I construct a novel test using the burgeoning series SEC <b>enforcement</b> <b>events</b> as changes to the legal environment that circumvents the issues associated with firm-level exchange-listing events (e. g. self-selection and simultaneous changes to firm traits). The tests focus on stock returns of foreign firms not targeted by the SEC during event windows surrounding SEC announcements of enforcements against foreign firms. This isolates the effect of a changing enforcement environment. I find that when the SEC takes action against a foreign firm, non-target foreign firms experience positive stock returns. Returns are amplified for firms from weaker home legal environments, suggesting that the returns are due to a perceived increase in SEC scrutiny. Finally, consistent with the market adjusting to the new enforcement regime, the magnitude of non-target firm returns declines with each sequential SEC enforcement action. The overall results provide evidence that SEC oversight plays a significant role in increasing the value of foreign firms, which supports the legal bonding hypothesis discussed in prior literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Transactional {{dependencies}} play {{an important}} role in coordinating and executing the sub-transactions in advanced transaction processing models, such as, nested transactions and work-flow transactions. Researchers have formalized the notion of transactional dependencies and have shown how various advanced transaction models can be expressed using different kinds of dependencies. Incorrect specification of dependencies can result in unpredictable behavior of the advanced transaction, which, in turn, can lead to unavailability of resources and informa-tion integrity problems. In this work, we focus on how to correctly specify dependencies in an advanced transaction. We enumerate the different kinds of dependencies that may be present in an advanced transaction and classify them into two broad categories: event ordering and <b>event</b> <b>enforcement</b> dependencies. Different <b>event</b> ordering and <b>event</b> <b>enforcement</b> dependencies in an advanced transaction often interact in subtle ways resulting in conflicts and redundancies. We describe the different types of conflicts that can arise due to the presence of multiple de-pendencies and describe how one can detect such conflicts. An advanced transaction may also contain redundant dependencies – these are dependencies that can be logically derived from other dependencies. We show how such extraneous dependencies can be eliminated to get an equivalent set of dependencies that has the same effect as the original set. Our dependency analysis is done in the context of a generalized advanced transaction model that is capable of expressing different kinds of advanced transactions. 1...|$|R

Behavioral health readiness refers to a hospital’s capacity to effectively manage and respond to the psychological needs of patients, staff, and their families resulting from a large scale event or emergency. In many hospitals in Nebraska this capacity is not maintained internally and there is an informal reliance on local mental health resources to handle any psychological surge. The challenge associated with this mechanism is the lack of professional mental health resources in many areas of the State. The U. S.

During the second wave, genetic engineering becomes a major news item and its phase of evaluation separates from that of general science and technology. While general science improves its public profile, biotechnology becomes publicly controversial during the 1990 s. Public perceptions, as far as data is available, follows the changing trends of the press with some lag.
