25|$|Delp showcases, {{that while}} many {{graduates}} of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, <b>intelligent</b> <b>people,</b> {{there is a}} reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.|$|E
25|$|Next to {{predicting}} a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks {{as shown in}} the original experiments, the collective intelligence factor c was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months. Thereby, highly collectively intelligent groups earned significantly higher scores on their group assignments although their members did not do any better on other individually performed assignments. Moreover, highly collective intelligent teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better. This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> are found to acquire new material quicker.|$|E

25|$|Kelly {{has claimed}} {{that the effect of}} a {{successful}} reading is so powerful that even though she has revealed in advance to the customers that she is in fact not a real psychic, they refuse to believe that the information and personal details were obtained by mere cold reading techniques. On some occasions, Kelly has had to stop the reading as the client has become extremely emotional, with Kelly offering counselling instead, which she has been trained in. She has also said that <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> are easier to read as they have a larger pool of references to use to respond to her cues.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{recognition}} of psychiatry {{as a modern}} and legitimate profession occurred in 1808. In Europe, {{one of the major}} advocates for mental health nursing to help psychiatrists was Dr. William Ellis. He proposed giving the “keepers of the insane” better pay and training so more respectable, <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> would be attracted to the profession. In his 1836 publication of Treatise on Insanity, he openly stated that an established nursing practice calmed depressed patients and gave hope to the hopeless. However, psychiatric nursing was not formalized in the United States until 1882 when Linda Richards opened Boston City College. This was the first school specifically designed to train nurses in psychiatric care.|$|E
25|$|Lex Luthor is a wealthy, power-mad American {{business}} magnate, ingenious engineer, philanthropist to {{the city}} of Metropolis, {{and one of the most}} <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> in the world. A charismatic and well-known public figure, he is the owner of a corporation called LexCorp, with Mercy Graves as his personal assistant and bodyguard. He is intent on ridding the world of the alien Superman, whom Lex Luthor views as an obstacle to his megalomaniacal plans and as a threat to the very existence of humanity. Given his high status as a supervillain, he often comes into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe. The character was originally introduced as a diabolical recluse, but during the Modern Age, he was reimagined by writers as a devious, high-profile industrialist.|$|E
5000|$|Kinberg {{became known}} {{to the general public}} when she stated that [...] "people from Stockholm are more <b>intelligent</b> than <b>people</b> from rural areas" [...] in her {{election}} campaign 1998.

David {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, I'll get a chance to watch actual, <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> discuss and debate the issues addressed on 'Curb'. Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged 'Network' is, I might even watch it." ...|$|E

500|$|The APRF had {{a history}} of {{opposing}} mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, it had {{played a key role in}} stalling the passage of three mental health bills in the California Assembly. It was part of a wider network of far-right organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro-communist, anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-Jewish. The Keep America Committee, another Californian [...] "superpatriot" [...] group, summed up the anti-mental health mood on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955. Calling [...] "mental hygiene" [...] part of the [...] "unholy three" [...] of the [...] "Communistic World Government", it declared: [...] "Mental Hygiene is a subtle and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a free and <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> into a cringing horde of zombies".|$|E
500|$|Dr. Impossible {{is used as}} an {{archetype}} or stock character supervillain. He {{is characterized}} as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts {{to take control of}} the world's population. This is seen as a sub-type of the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: [...] "it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even if he knows he's going to lose. The superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause." [...] From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, [...] "they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero just has to come in and smash it up." [...] Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, [...] "On the one hand, you're supposed to be really smart, and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [...] in the eyes of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Anglin {{asserts that}} the purpose of The Daily Stormer is to provide [...] "a means to propagandize people … to get them to look at the world in a certain way". Headlines include [...] "All <b>Intelligent</b> <b>People</b> in History Disliked Jews", and [...] "Adolf Hitler: The Most Lied About Man of All Time". The site bills itself as [...] "America's #1 Most-Trusted Republican News Source". According to The Jewish Chronicle, The Daily Stormer [...] "posts {{hundreds}} of racist articles targeting black people, Arabs and Jews". The website offers pro-separatist coverage of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which Anglin considers [...] "the correct moral position". The SPLC described the site as [...] "the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web", which [...] "has {{in the last six months}} [...] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web, Stormfront, in terms of reach and page views, based on Alexa data". Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website's traffic had doubled over the last six months, peaking at 120,000 daily visitors. The website is part of the alt-right movement, and it calls itself [...] "The World’s Most Visited Alt-Right Website". As the movement made headlines in mid-2016, [...] "bolstered in part by the unexpected rise of Donald Trump and Britain's decision to leave the European Union", Anglin declared: [...] "We won the meme war; now we've taken over the GOP, and we did this very, very quickly." [...] Unlike other figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: [...] "The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated".|$|E

5000|$|The most {{difficult}} problems for computers to solve are informally known as [...] "AI-complete" [...] or [...] "AI-hard", {{implying that the}} difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as <b>intelligent</b> as <b>people,</b> or strong AI. [...] To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude {{that it would not}} be solved by a simple specific algorithm.|$|R
500|$|Observing {{similarities}} between the character and herself, Rashad described Clair as [...] "a warm, loving mother"; the actress is also similar in both appearance and personality to Camille. Rashad's acting had always been more straight-faced to counter Cosby's humor, typically playing straight woman to Cosby's comedic antics. In preparation for the second season, Cosby decided to provide Rashad with more comedic material upon learning that the actress is [...] "capable of handling comedy on her own–without Cliff." [...] Jets Robert E. Johnson observed that Rashad portrays her character using [...] "soft, sophisticated humor". The sixth season episode [...] "Off to See the Wretched", in which Clair scolds Vanessa for traveling to Baltimore to see a rock concert against her parents' orders, features Rashad's most [...] "uncontrolled" [...] performance as the character. Speaking fondly of his co-star, Cosby said [...] "There's nobody whom I can be more thankful about than Phylicia." [...] In {{the aftermath of a}} highly publicized article originally published in TV Guide before the series premiered that labeled Cosby [...] "one of the most arrogant celebrities", Rashad took over the majority of the show's promotional appearances herself. Rashad also defended Cosby against the accusations, calling him [...] "one of the most <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> I have ever known. In addition to being a few years younger than Clair was originally intended to be, Rashad is only 10 years older than actress Sabrina LeBeauf, who portrays eldest child Sondra. Meanwhile, actress Ethel Ayler, who portrays Clair's mother Carrie, is only 14 years her senior. Originally, actress Clarice Taylor auditioned for the role of Carrie, deliberately making herself over in attempt to look young enough to play Rashad's mother before Cosby ultimately cast her as his own character's.|$|E
2500|$|After some anxious {{talk and}} an anti-climatic story about Alan's college friend Cassius O'Shaugnessy, {{they watch the}} film, and too embarrassed {{to talk about it}} right away, they watch it again before {{discussing}} it: [...] "As <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> they must dominate it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The next {{question}} is: Why {{do so many}} brilliant, well-informed, <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> fool themselves for so long with such bad thinking and bad evidence?"

5000|$|One {{criticism}} of the Turing test {{is that it is}} explicitly anthropomorphic [...] If our ultimate goal is to create machines that are more <b>intelligent</b> than <b>people,</b> why should we insist that our machines must closely resemble people?

50|$|In 1936 the Left Book Club, {{started by}} the {{publisher}} Victor Gollancz, was very popular. Lewis quit his ministry in Ipswich {{to take on the}} task of building a national network of discussion groups. The groups brought together in a progressive movement <b>intelligent,</b> literate <b>people</b> who had not found rewarding political action in leftwing parties. Soon there were groups in every town. In effect, the Left Book Club and its groups had become a quasi-political party.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{an actual}} fact that several hundred <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> of Springfield and {{vicinity}} {{have been so}} excited over the noise as to go night after night to listen to it....

2500|$|Perhaps no city...in Illinois, {{outside of}} [...] the great city of Chicago, {{presents}} {{an instance of}} such rapid and substantial growth as the city of Streator.

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} {{substantial}} research indicating {{the utility of the}} measure for a few scores. Several scores correlate well with general intelligence. Interestingly, one such scale is R, the total number of responses; this reveals the questionable side-effect that more <b>intelligent</b> <b>people</b> tend to be elevated on many pathology scales, since many scales do not correct for high R: if a subject gives twice as many responses overall, {{it is more likely that}} some of these will seem [...] "pathological". Also correlated with intelligence are the scales for Organizational Activity, Complexity, Form Quality, and Human Figure responses.|$|E
2500|$|The AI effect: Machines {{are already}} intelligent, but {{observers}} {{have failed to}} recognize it. When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, the machine was acting intelligently. However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing {{that it is not}} [...] "real" [...] intelligence after all; thus [...] "real" [...] intelligence is whatever <b>intelligent</b> behavior <b>people</b> can do that machines still cannot. This is known as the AI Effect: [...] "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." ...|$|R
