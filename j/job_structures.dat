40|$|We {{study how}} {{employing}} organizations divide up the tasks they do, and therefore how they structure their employees’ jobs. Much {{research in the}} past three decades has shown that employing organizations’ <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> determine the social, economic, and psychological outcomes experienced by workers, and thus determine patterns of stratification and social mobility. Although much {{attention has been paid to}} the consequences of organizational <b>job</b> <b>structures,</b> little has been done to analyze their causes. Our analysis of <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> in U. S. wineries adds to the handful of causal studies on this topic. Building on sociological theory, we predict that technical factors – scale and scope of operations – increase the complexity of <b>job</b> <b>structures,</b> specifically the number of job titles, functions delineated by those titles, and people with multiple job titles. We further predict that cultural factors – organizational age, prevailing notions of what is “normal,” and organizational form – influence <b>job</b> <b>structures.</b> We find strong effects of both technical and cultural factors. We also find that these forces can conflict and complement each other, and that the identities embedded in organizational forms determine whether and how technical and cultural factors affect <b>job</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{functions}} that employees perform {{on the job}} are {{important aspects of the}} structure of any newly created firm, including wineries, because they affect both workers and employing firms. Decisions about <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> at founding have lasting effects because they are difficult to change: “the process of inventing new roles, and the determination of their mutual relations and of structuring the field of rewards and sanctions so as to get maximum performance, have high costs in time, worry, conflict and temporary inefficiency ” (Stinchcombe, 1965 : 148). Thus, initial <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> have cascading influences on what work will get done and thus which strategic actions any firm, including wineries, will take. Ideas about <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> in startups come from three lines of research. The first focuses on the ideas that govern how employees are hired, managed, and retained in startup firms. It shows that these ideas have lasting effects on firm actions and performance (e. g., Hannan, Burton, and Baron, 1996), but it does little to explain the sources of these ideas and structures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} due date assignment procedures in job shop environments where multi-level assembly jobs are processed and due dates are internally assigned. Most of the reported studies in the literature have focused on string type jobs. We propose a dynamic update approach (which makes use of Little's Law) to obtain the coefficients used in the traditional due date assignment procedures of constant allowance (CON), total work content (TWK) and critical path processing time (CPPT). The coefficient assigned to a given job reflects both {{the state of the}} shop at the time the job is processed and the characteristics of the job. The approach also provides the shop management with the ability to control the average job lateness. In the simulation experiments conducted in this study, we set the average lateness at zero. The analysis of simulation results shows that the proposed dynamic procedures provide overall better shop performance than their static counterparts, especially for less complex assembly <b>job</b> <b>structures.</b> A procedure for determining job due dates that extends the critical path concept of the CPPT procedure to critical path flow time (CPFT) is also proposed. Unlike the others, this procedure does not need the determination of any coefficients. The procedure uses estimates of waiting times at work centers that are determined dynamically based on shop work load information. In this paper, an adaptive adjustment approach is also suggested to bring average lateness for the CPFT procedure to a target value. Results of the simulation experiments show that the CPFT combined with the adaptive adjustment approach (CPFT-ADJ) provides overall improved performance compared to the dynamic and static versions of the CON, TWK, and CPPT procedures for less complex <b>job</b> <b>structures.</b> For more complex assembly <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> and string jobs the CPFT-ADJ procedure results in comparable performance to the dynamic versions of the CON, TWK, and CPPT procedures. The paper also provides an investigation of the interaction between the two priority rules: earliest job due date (JDD) and the earliest operation due date (OPNDD) and the four due date procedures: CON, TWK, CPPT, and CPFT-ADJ. In general, for multi-level assembly <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> JDD outperforms OPNDD in terms of average job lead time and tardiness...|$|E

40|$|New <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> and {{qualification}} requirements with {{computer aided design}} (CAD) systems are not only technologically induced but also {{a result of the}} type of work organization realized in firms. This book describes the trends in work organization in the case of CAD use by collecting representative information from 164 German enterprises. The major findings are the following: There is no spezialization of work places evident as a consequence of CAD use. On the contrary, the job profiles of design ingeneers and especially draughtsmen have become broader. The latter have additional tasks in the specification of designs and the compliation of bill of materials. Despite of these slight changes in work organization the analyses showed no fundamental new organizational concepts in CAD installing firms. Nearly all enterprises keep their old type of work organization. The degreee of division of labour persists whether it is high or low. The new options which the CAD technology offers are con current with an organizational conservatism. The survey shows that, more than the CAD technology, some aspects of the frame conditions in the enterprises are influencing the work organization. Wholistic <b>job</b> <b>structures</b> can be found especially in small firms, in firms with many CAD stations in relation to the design employees, infirms with "low-cost" CAD-systems, in firms without computer integrated manufacturing concepts and in those with elaborated training concepts for all employees. other aspects like branches, batch size etc. are not significantly interrelated with the type of work organization...|$|E
