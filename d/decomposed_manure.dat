The tubers of Sagittaria latifolia and Sagittaria cuneata have long been an important food source to indigenous peoples of the Americas. The tubers can be detached from the ground in various ways: with the feet, a pitchfork, or a stick, and after digging up, the tubers usually float to the surface. Ripe tubers can be collected in the fall, and are also often found then floating freely.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{growing demand}} for animal protein is {{directly}} related to the feedlot system of animals and their assumptions, such as the waste management. The characterization of the final products becomes an important factor in decision making by one or by other process. The objective was highlight characteristics that fertilizers present due to the used of stabilization process, by the principal component analysis. For the manure stabilization we realized three aerobic processes, composting, vermicomposting and natural decomposition, and one anaerobic, the anaerobic digestion. These processes produced the compost, the vermicompost, the <b>decomposed</b> <b>manure</b> and the biofertilizer. Fertilizers produced were analyzed by means of seventeen chemical and physic-chemical parameters. The main differences are related to stability and organic matter content. The compost is more stable fertilizer and <b>decomposed</b> <b>manure</b> is the worst. The vermicompost is presented as the best option to adsorb cadmium and lead. The biofertilizer has the lowest values of pH, CEC and adsorptive capacity of heavy metals (Cd and Pb). The <b>decomposed</b> <b>manure</b> in presence of precipitation, and the vermicompost, with significant irrigation, generates fertilizers with smaller source of potassium...|$|E

Reforestation with these species is hindered {{due to their}} recalcitrant seeds and a higher seed predation. This study tested the effects of Indole- 3 -butyric Acid (IBA) and Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) applied at a concentration of 0. 0, 0. 2 and 0. 4 % on juvenile leafy stem cuttings of P. africana and S. guineense using non-mist polypropagator. Two leaves with an area of 30 - 35 cm 2 were left on each cutting. The bases of cuttings were dipped in the hormones for 3 seconds and placed into the rooting medium. All the rooted cuttings of the S. guineense and P. africana were potted in polythene bags containing a mixture of sand, forest soil and well <b>decomposed</b> <b>manure.</b> Auxin treatment had no {{significant effect on the}} final rooting percentage of both species. The effect of auxin treatment on root number, root and shoot length of the rooted cuttings of P. africana and S. guineense was significant (p< 0. 01). The establishment test on the rooted cuttings indicated that mortality accounted for only 0 - 2 %. Prospects for vegetative propagation with the juvenile leafy stem cuttings of the above species are good as cuttings were easily rooted. The low technology non-mist polypropagator designed for tropical trees could serve as a tool for propagation of these species for conservation and capture of genetic variation.

30|$|Large-scale {{livestock}} production systems {{are the source}} of huge amount of agricultural residual biomass of manures and slurries that {{can be applied to the}} land for fertility improvement (Bernal et al. 2009). Pig slurries and poultry manures have remained a common source of composting ingredient (Pampuro et al. 2016). Co-composting of wastes from winery distilleries with animal and poultry manure under static pile composting system was assessed on different parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter, soluble carbon, polyphenolics content, humification characteristics, and plant germination index (Bustamante et al. 2008). Agricultural food wastes are also attractive composting materials for their conversion into <b>decomposed</b> <b>manures</b> to be used for producing high-value crops (Rubio et al. 2013). It was largely considered that composting processes that ensure nutrient-rich conditions, appropriate carbon rating, organic matter humification and adequate bulking for reducing N-losses are required to overcome production cost (Bernal et al. 2009). Results confirm that composting helped in detoxification and degradation of phytotoxic compounds in the residual matter and therefore, offers a favorable way to recycle wastes into value-added products (Pampuro et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Odor from a swine {{operation}} {{is caused by}} <b>decomposing</b> <b>manure,</b> rotting feed, incineration, dust emissions, and dead pigs. The control of odor is a significant issue for pork producers (Miner and Barth, 1988). The important aspects for neighbors are intensity, duration, and frequency of detection of the odor. To be considered a nuisance odor, it must be offensive to the senses and materially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of property within the area. It is impossible to eliminate all odors from hog production because the technology to completely remove it either does not exist or is prohibitively expensive to install and/or to operate. Certainly, good design and management and certain odor control technologies can minimize odor, but the best control for remaining odor is to allow outdoor air movement to dilute the odor with distance. Therefore, the most critical and effective means of reducing odor complaints occurs in initial site selection. Van Kleeck and Bulley (1990) conducted a survey of neighbors around seven, 100 - to 225 -sow, farrow-to-finish operations to assess {{the relationship between the}} perception of odor nuisance, separation distance, {{and the size of the}} facility.

The treatments consisted of factorial combination of two rates of cattle manure (200 and 300 g per zaï hole), three periods of manure application (before planting, at planting and 15 days later) and two rates of mineral fertilizer [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) 15 – 15 – 15] applied at 6 g per zaï hole and a control, without mineral fertilizer). Manure dry mass losses did not significantly differ among manure application periods in 2013. However, in 2014 the highest manure dry mass loss occurred when manure was applied before planting with 70 % of <b>manure</b> applied being <b>decomposed</b> at millet maturity stage (115 days after litterbag installation) followed by manure applied at planting with almost 50 % of dry mass losses. The quantities of N and P absorbed by millet at tillering stage represented, 61, 52 and 33 % of N released and 15, 12 and 15 % of P released {{at the same time}} when manure was applied before planting, at planting and 15 days after planting, respectively. Application of manure before planting increased on an average millet grain yield by 16 and 20 % and N utilization efficiency by 25 and 31 % compared to application of manure at planting and 15 days after planting respectively. Addition of mineral fertilizer induced a synergetic effect on millet grain yield (p = 0. 002). Millet grain yields increased on average by 5, 17 and 57 % when 6 g per zaï pit of NPK fertilizer were added to plots receiving manure application before planting, at planting and 15 days after planting, respectively.

Pollutants from unmanaged livestock wastes can degrade the environment, and methane emitted from <b>decomposing</b> <b>manure</b> may contribute to global climate change. One management system not only provides pollution prevention but also can convert a manure problem into a new profit center. Economic evaluations and case studies of operating systems indicate that the anaerobic digestion (AD) of livestock manures is a commercially available bioconversion technology with considerable potential for providing profitable coproducts, including a cost-effective renewable fuel for livestock production operations. This Casebook examines some of the current opportunities for the recovery of methane from the AD animal manures. U. S. livestock operations currently employ four types of anaerobic digester technology: slurry, plug-flow, complete-mix, and covered lagoon. An introduction to the engineering economies of these technologies is provided, and possible end-use applications for the methane gas generated by the digestion process are discussed. The economic evaluations are based on engineering studies of digesters that generate electricity from the recovered methane. Case studies of operating digesters, with project and maintenance histories and the operators ''lessons learned,'' are included as reality checks. Factors necessary for successful projects, {{as well as a}} list of reasons explaining why some AD projects fail, are provided. The role of farm management is key; not only must digesters be well engineered and built with high-quality components, they must also be sited at farms willing to incorporate the uncertainties of a new technology. More than two decades of research has provided much information about how manure can be converted to an energy source; however, the American farmer has not been motivated to adopt new practices. More cost-effective and easily managed manure management techniques are still needed to encourage farmers to use animal manure for conversion into energy and nutrients, especially for smaller farms. AD benefits farmers monetarily and mitigates possible manure pollution problems, thereby sustaining development while maintaining environmental quality. Moreover, rural economic development will benefit from the implicit multiplier effect resulting from jobs created by implementing digester systems. Promising future waste-to-profit activities may add to the economic performance of AD. New end-use applications, which provide added value to coproducts, are discussed...|$|R

Existing data on emissions of N 2 O is extracted from research generated in western Europe, north America and south-east Asia (Kroetze et al. 2003) {{despite the fact that the}} tropics and subtropics contribute greatly to the emissions (Billy et al. 2010), particularly since 51  % of world soils are in these climate zones (Mosier et al. 2003).

An understanding of the contribution of manure applications to global atmospheric N 2 O loading is needed to evaluate agriculture’s contribution to the global warming process (Mapanda et al. 2012).

To develop a national estimate of methane emissions from these operations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 1 includes two possible estimation methodologies. The more detailed, “Tier 2 ” approach requires specific animal waste characteristics, including a methane conversion factor (MCF) that defines the portion of methane-producing potential achieved for each type of manure management system. The guidance provides a default MCF range from 0 % to 100 % for animal waste lagoons, which reflects the wide range of performance these systems may achieve. There exist relatively few data points on which to determine country-specific MCFs for these systems. Therefore, a procedure was developed for the United States to calculate MCFs based on the limited set of measurement data available, the results of laboratory-scale tests on methane production from animal waste, and knowledge on the performance of lagoon systems. This procedure accounts for temperature variation throughout the year, retention of volatile solids in a system, and management and design practices that may reduce the volatile solids available for conversion to methane...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous {{losses of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) through ammonia (NH 3) volatilization and denitrification diminish the fertilizer value of animal and poultry manures and form atmospheric pollutants. Appropriate methods of composting {{can improve the}} fertilizer value by conserving manure N and minimise the risk of environmental pollution. Additionally, acids produced during composting and nitrification of conserved N in manure, provide a source of protons (H+) which {{have the potential to}} dissolve phosphate rock (PR) when composted with manure. The objective of this research was to examine the methods of composting poultry manure with different amendments in relation to N conservation and PR dissolution. Firstly, the methods for preserving and measuring N in manure samples were evaluated. The results suggested that freeze drying and inclusion of a strong oxidizing agent (KMnO 4) prior to routine Kjeldahl digestion were required to achieve complete recovery and accurate measurement of N in manure samples. Methods for reducing the loss of N through NH 3 volatilization and denitrification during aerobic and anaerobic composting of poultry manure with different amendments were investigated in controlled 'flow through' incubation experiments. The amendments included carbonaceous bedding materials (woodchip, paper waste, wheat straw and peat), acidifier (elemental sulphur-S°) and adsorbents (zeolite and soil). The loss of N through NH 3 volatilization from aerobic composting was about 17 % of the manure N which was reduced by 90 - 95 % under anaerobic composting. Under aerobic composting the addition of various amendments reduced the volatilization loss by 33 to 60 %. Although the rate of denitrification was negligible (< 1 µg kg- 1 day- 1) in fresh manure, it increased enormously (3. 7 mg kg- 1 day- 1) during composting. The presence of nitrate (NO 3 -) was found to be a rate determinant for denitrification in manure. Amongst the treatments, the addition of S° was very effective in reducing NH 3 volatilization and denitrification. The dissolution of PR during composting with poultry manure was examined using radioactively (32 P) labelled synthetic francolite and North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR). The use of 32 P labelled francolite indicated that PR dissolution in poultry manure/PR composts could be measured more accurately from the increases in NaOH extractable phosphorus (∆NaOH-P) than from the decreases in HCl extractable P (∆HCl-P). Low levels of francolite and NCPR dissolution (< 16 %) occurred when PR is mixed with poultry manure. This was attributed to the high concentrations (4. 8 * 10 - 2 mol L- 1) of calcium (Ca 2 +) in manure solution which inhibited the dissolution of PR through the Ca common-ion effect. Addition of S° to poultry manure/PR compost reduced the pH and thereby enhanced PR dissolution. A system for the dissolution of PR, using the acid (H+) produced during the nitrification of NH 3 released from poultry manure, was developed. The inhibitory effect of manure Ca on PR dissolution is avoided if the NH 3 released from <b>decomposing</b> <b>manure</b> is absorbed in bark and soil materials containing PR, which are kept either as manure covers or in separate columns. Although both methods were found effective in the absorption of NH 3, the result demonstrated that bark absorbs more NH 3 than does soil. Extensive PR dissolution occurred in the bark (82. 3 %) and the soil (33. 2 %) {{even in the absence of}} NH 3 absorption from poultry manure. Higher levels of PR dissolution in bark is attributed to its high exchangeable acidity (80. 5 cmol (+) kg- 1) and large Ca sink size (82. 7 cmol (+) kg- 1). However, when the bark and soil materials were kept as manure covers, accumulation of Ca in the covers due to the diffusion of manure Ca, reduced the PR dissolution. When the bark and soil materials were kept separately in columns, nitrification of absorbed NH 3 resulted in small increases in PR dissolution in bark (15 %) and soil (5 %). However, most of the protons (50 - 95 %) released during nitrification are involved in the buffering of the bark and soil materials. The laboratory studies showed that the addition of S° to poultry manure during aerobic composting not only reduced the loss of N, but also enhanced PR dissolution. Based on this observation, sulphocompost (a blend of poultry manure, woodchip with S° and PR) and phosphocompost (a blend of poultry manure, woodchip with PR) were prepared and their agronomic effectiveness were compared with fresh manure mixtures and urea using field grown winter cabbage and summer maize crops. The crop yield, N use efficiency and N recovery were greater for sulphocompost than for phosphocompost. The sulphocompost and phosphocompost were approximately 60 % and 12 %, respectively, as effective as urea treatments for winter cabbage. Both composts were equally effective as urea for the second season's maize crop. The study has shown that poultry manure enriched with PR and S° can be used as a source of N, P and S...|$|R

40|$|A {{productive}} {{method of}} farming tilapia {{has been widely}} adopted in the Masasi district in south west Tanzania. The fish can be eaten by the smallholders, sold, or used in exchange for other commodities or services. Each smallholder fish farmer gets advice and buys stock from a central fivepond demonstration site. This is the base for a Tanzanian fisheries office and a fisherman from Voluntary Service Overseas, who help with the planning, construction, stocking and management of each pond. The integration of the fish farm with current crops and livestock and water supply {{are the most important}} considerations. For a pond to be easy to manage it needs sloping grassed banks that reduce erosion and a screened inlet and outlet to prevent wild tilapia from entering. Because nets are expensive, it is preferable to harvest by hand, so it is necessary to be able to drain the pond completely. Hired workers are paid in fish. The fish are fed daily on waste products from the smallholding or'shamba': maize or rice bran, chopped pawpaw, cassava and banana leaves. The maize bran floats and, when the fish surface to feed, their size can be assessed. Tilapia breed so rapidly that overcrowding can occur. There are three ways of feeding fish in ponds: with agricultural waste, with duck droppings or pig manure. These waste products encourage the growth of phytoplankton, on which the fish feed as they <b>decompose.</b> Cow <b>manure</b> is put in the water in a woven basket to promote algae and plankton blooms, on which the young fish feed. Fed in this way, it is possible to harvest the tilapia after three to four months. However, harvest is usually a little later than this as many of the fish ponds are run as a sideline for the farmers who have other livestock to attend to. News that a pond is ready for harvest spreads quickly and villagers will collect at the pondside. Those fish farmers who have no other livestock will pay for manure with fish. One aspect of tilapia farming which the project hopes to develop is the integration of duck and chicken production. They would be housed above the water, hat their manure would fall into the pond and feed the algae and plankton. Using tilapia hybrids that produce all male offspring and sex reversal with testosterone to prevent breeding could produce large, uniform fish for the western market. But at present the more appropriate basic tilapia husbandry makes enough demands on the smallholders'time The one hundred ponds constructed by villagers with the help of Maliasili and VSO/ODA staff produced well over a tonne of fish per year, and more ponds are planned.

30|$|According to the {{observed}} nutrient dynamics (Table  3), nitrites increased {{during the first}} week before decreasing in the last weeks of the experimentation in all the treatments generally. Such a dynamic was noticeable particularly in T 1, T 2, and T 3. Mean NO 2 − values in the different treatments increased from 0.0  ±  0.0  mg/L (T 1) to 0.1  ±  0.0  mg/L (T 4) during 50  days. These variations {{can be explained by the}} microbial activity which influences the permanent availability of nitrites. The reductions of nitrates in the treatments were revealed from the 9 th days. These reductions were related to the ambient temperature. Indeed, when temperature became high, biochemical reactions were very important affecting nitrogen transformation or bacteria denitrification. The highest N-NO 3 − concentrations were obtained in T 2 (0.38  ±  0.1  mg/L) followed by T 4 (0.33  ±  0.0  mg/L). During the experiment, the average N-NH 3 content ranged from 0.43  ±  0.0  mg/L in T 1 to 1.62  ±  0.0  mg/L in T 4. However, significant decreases by 3.67, 1.9, and 1.26 times were noticed in ammonium concentrations in the manure from treatments T 1, T 2, and T 3, respectively, compared to T 4. This is related to the equilibrium constant which can be favourable to a massive loss of nitrogen as ammonia gas or favourable to storage in water as NH 4 +. In the rabbit manures, the volatilization process of ammonia consisted in the transfer of ammonia gas in the immediate atmosphere from ammonia in <b>manure</b> <b>decomposing</b> in water during experimentation. The concentration of orthophosphate, which was 10.83  ±  1.0  mg/L in the T 4 treatment, was 1.33, 1.30, and 1.2 times higher, respectively, than in treatments T 1, T 2, and T 3 (p <  0.05). Tendency similar trend was practically noticed with the other elements such as Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and K+. This result revealed the richness of T 4 compared to the others treatments. We also noticed a rapid increase of K+ concentrations in T 2 contrary to T 1; while T 3 and T 4 indicated during the first 12  days of experiment a rapidly mineralizable labile fraction of organic matter even from this time to the end of the experiment, a readily degradable fraction was found in rabbit manure.|$|R

Microfiche. xx, 170 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmSoil acidity {{is a major}} constraint {{to successful}} crop production in many highly weathered tropical soils. While liming of temperate soils causes immediate and favorable changes, tropical soils often react differently. Where lime is expensive, difficult to obtain, or ineffective at economic rates, alternatives or supplemental practices to liming must be sought. Recent {{research has shown that}} additions of organic wastes and green manures to acid soils could reduce AI phytotoxicity and increase crop yields. The "liming effect" of four organic manures (Ieucaena and cowpea green manure, chicken manure, sewage sludge) was quantified and compared with lime (CaCO 3) in a greenhouse experiment. Lime at four different rates (0, 1 / 2, 1, 2 X exchangeable AI of the unamended soil) and organic manures (20 g kg- 1 soil) were mixed with two acid soils (Kaneohe series, Humoxic Tropohumult; Paaloa series, Rhodic Kandiudult) and then incubated for 1, 6, and 12 months under greenhouse conditions. Aluminum sensitive legumes (Sesbania cochinchinensis and Desmodium intortum) were planted as test crops. Results showed that animal manures were more effective than their green manure counterparts as liming materials. In terms of detoxifying AI, increasing soil solution pH, and increasing plant root and shoot dry matter yield, animal manures were comparable to the highest rate of lime application. The liming effect of the organic amendments persisted up to one year after soil incorporation. To evaluate the persistence (residual) of the liming effect of the organic manures, the same soils were allowed to incubate for another 6 months without any additional amendments and then replanted. Chemical analysis showed that soil acidity effectively decreased while the supply of basic cations increased in the organically amended soils resulting in improved plant height and total dry matter yield of plants. The mechanisms that were responsible for the residual liming effect of the organic amendments were a) their ability to increase and maintain soil pH b) AI-organic matter complexation c) and ameliorative effect of Ca ions on AI toxicity. A 24 -week incubation and leaching study was also conducted to determine the rate of N mineralization and ease of release of Ca, Mg, and K from the organic manures as well as their ability to reduce P sorption. Nitrogen in the animal manures was mineralized faster than that in the green manures. The faster rate of N mineralization in the animal manures could have been due to their lower C:N ratio. On the other hand, the higher lignin and polyphenolic contents of the green manures could have slowed the mineralization of N. The cations were released steadily from the <b>decomposing</b> organic <b>manures</b> during the entire incubation period and followed approximately the order, K > Mg ≥Ca. Among the organic amendments, chicken manure was the most effective while leucaena green manure was least effective in reducing P sorption. Animal manures also increased soil P levels better than the green manures. In the last experiment, the effectiveness of surface-applied animal manures in ameliorating acidity and increasing Ca concentration in a Paaloa subsoil has been compared with lime (CaCO 3) and gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O). The animal manures were more effective than lime and gypsum in increasing Ca and decreasing soil solution AI and AI saturation in the subsoil, particularly below the 15 -cm depth. Organic anions were also produced during the decomposition of the animal manures as evidenced by an increase in the soluble C levels of the animal manure treated soils. The movement of Ca down to the subsoil may have been facilitated by the formation of Ca-organic anion chelates which could move easily down the soil profile...|$|R

Microalgae have great potential to replace current crop feedstocks for biofuel and animal feed production. However, the algal industry {{is still far}} from being economically applicable. The dissertation {{was inspired by the}} idea of integrating algal biomass production and wastewater treatment. The overall objective {{of the study was to}} develop an effective algal cultivation system in which inorganic nutrients and organic substances in swine manure could be utilized by robust microalgae strains for the production of algal biomass with high lipids or protein contents. The first step in the study was bioprospecting for mixotrophic microalgae strains that adapted well to diluted swine manure. Through the multi-step screening strategy, two locally isolated microalgae strains, UMN 271 and UMN 266, were found to be facultative heterotrophic, manure-tolerant, and obviously robust in the algae storage including 98 UTEX strains and 50 indigenous strains. The two strains were identified as Chlorella sp. and Hindakia sp., respectively, through morphological observation and genetic identification, and were utilized for further studies in the dissertation. Since algae growth on highly diluted swine manure was still relatively low, a second step in the study was to assess the limiting factors of using anaerobically <b>decomposed</b> swine <b>manure</b> as nutrient supplement for algae cultivation. In the study, Chlorella sp. (UMN 271) and Hindakia sp. (UMN 266) were used to investigate the effects of two potential factors, which were trace elements and carbon compounds in swine manure, on algal growth and waste nutrient recovery. The results indicated that the algal growth and nutrient removal rates were independent of trace metal content in diluted swine manure, but were significantly improved when the initial liquid COD content in swine manure was high. Moreover, it was demonstrated that Chlorella sp. (UMN 271) was able to utilize acetic, propionic and butyric acids, the main water-soluble organic carbon compounds in digested swine manure, for algal growth, lipid production, and waste nutrient removal. Therefore, it was considered that algal growth in highly diluted swine manure was limited by the deficiency of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The third step was to modify anaerobic digestion process for liquid swine manure (LSM) rich in VFAs, so that the liquid effluent could be more suitable than the conventionally decomposed LSM effluent as nutrient for the cultivation of Chlorella sp. (UMN 271). The results showed that the modified acidogenic digestion successfully promoted VFA concentrations in swine manure. The obtained acidogenically digested LSM supported the growth of Chlorella sp. (UMN 271) in a 5 -day batch experiment with higher algal growth rates and fatty acid contents in comparison with those on the conventionally decomposed LSM. High removal efficiencies on water-soluble nutrients, including COD, PO 4 -P, TN and NH 3 -N, were also observed for the raw, acidogenically digested manure sample (58. 02 %, 44. 74 %, 31. 58 %, and 44. 73 %, respectively). Finally, the fatty acid profile analysis showed that harvested algal biomass could be used as feedstock to produce high-quality biodiesel. In the fourth step, central composite design (CCD) was used to investigate the influences of two key parameters, namely wastewater dilution rate (DR) and hydraulic retention time (HRT), on algal biomass productivity and waste nutrient removal rates. According to the response surface analyses of the CCD results, statistically valid quadric models for the response variables, including algal biomass productivity and the liquid nutrient removal rates including COD, PO 4 -P, TN and NH 3 -N, were obtained. The regression analyses illustrated that both DR and HRT had significant influences on the five response variables. The optimal conditions estimated from the significant second-order quadratic models (p< 0. 05) were 8 -fold DR and 2. 26 -d HRT. The final step was the development of an effective algal cultivation system for the semicontinuous production of algal biomass and waste nutrient removal. In the study, the predicted optimal conditions were applied in a bench-scale multi-layer photobioreactor (PBR) for algae growth on acidogenically digested swine manure. The 17 -day semicontinuous cultivating experiment achieved high and stable algal productivity and nutrient removal rates, which fitted the predictive models well. Moreover, relatively high and stable protein and lipid contents (58. 78 % and 26. 09 % of the dry weight, respectively) were observed for the harvested algal sample, indicating the suitability of the algal biomass as ideal feedstock for both biofuel and animal feed production...|$|R
40|$|Biogas ? {{clean energy}} from cattle dung Cue: The burning of animal dung {{as a source}} of energy is often criticised for {{removing}} valuable nutrients from farming systems. However, there is a way that farmers can get energy from livestock manure and still use it {{as a source of}} fertility on their fields. When <b>manure</b> <b>decomposes</b> it releases a natural gas ? a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide ? which makes an excellent and clean fuel for cooking and lighting. In India and China this ?biogas? is used by millions of small farms, helping to improve farm sanitation as well as providing a low cost source of energy. In Africa, Uganda is leading the way in the adoption of biogas. Even here, however, it is still quite rare. Wambi Michael recently travelled to Mukono district to meet Ruth Musoke, one of Uganda?s biogas pioneers. IN:	?Madam Musoke, you are one ? OUT:	? delay the less fire you get. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ruth Musoke, one of Uganda?s biogas pioneers, talking to Wambi Michael. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Michael	Madam Musoke, {{you are one of the}} few farmers within Mukono who are using a biogas digester. How did you learn about the biogas digesters? Musoke	We have a friend called Pastor Kakembo, he came and visited our place, he suggested to us that we can install a biogas system at our place because we had cows and he had the same system at his place. So we went to his place and we admired the system. So he is the one who gave us the technical person who did the work for us. Michael	When did this begin? Musoke	That was almost 8 years back. Michael	And has it been working throughout 8 years now? Musoke	Yes, very successfully. We normally use it for cooking and lighting. We get light from biogas and then fire. Michael	So let?s go back to where the process begins. I can see this hole here, what is it for? Musoke	This one is for the collection of urine from the main building where the cows stay throughout the day, but it was not enough, the urine was a lot so we had to construct another pit where the urine collects up. And that one it is more comfortable because it is where we do the mixing. Michael	How do you mix the cow dung into the digester? Musoke	At that system, there are two bowls which are prepared for the mixture. So we get urine from the pit and then we collect cow dung from the place where we keep the animals, and then we mix it up, pour it in the main digester. That is how it is done. Michael	We have heard reports that you need 19 kgs of cow dung daily to feed a digester. Where do you get the 19 kgs of cow dung? Musoke	Me, I have almost 9 animals and I normally use 2 wheelbarrows of cow dung to get the biogas I need for my home consumption. Michael	Do you have some excess of cow dung which you don?t use because you have many animals? Musoke	Yes, I have a lot of it. Because what I have, I can?t mix it up on a daily basis. We collect cow dung in the morning and in the evening. So we have a reserve pit again, where we keep this cow dung, the one which is not used up for biogas system, and it is normally taken up by those farmers and other people who have the system and don?t have access to cow dung. Michael	Can we go to the fireplace and see how it works? Musoke	Yes. Michael	In most times when you come to a kitchen like this in rural areas in Uganda, you see a lot of soot, but I can see here it?s very clean. Musoke	Yes and it?s because I?m using fire from biogas. Michael	Because normally entering such a kitchen would mean that maybe we would see some tears coming out of you! Musoke	I don?t think it?s so clean, but that?s how it is. Michael	OK. I see very clean fire coming out of the gas plate. Where is the fire coming from? Musoke	It is coming through the other pipe and these are the switches. Michael	Which means you can cook two saucepans of food on this same gas plate? Musoke	Yes, according to your plates. It can go up to three or four, it depends on what you want. Michael	So can you switch it back on? So how long does it take to boil such water? Musoke	It depends on the amount which you want, because now it is at the maximum. You can reduce, depending on the type of fire you want and on what you are cooking. Michael	How clean is the biogas? Musoke	Whatever you prepare is so clean, even the saucepan, they don?t get stained. Blue flames only, which doesn?t stain. And the maintenance is so low, just to repair the other plate, because they get stained. That thing is done in Katwe. Michael	Does it rust? Musoke	Yes. For instance you are cooking something, what you are cooking pours on it and then that metal part of it rusts. That is the main problem with it. But I have changed it ever since it was there only two times. Michael	What about the digester, does it require some maintenance? Musoke	Ever since we installed it we have never done any maintenance, but what you need to do, you have to be committed in mixing this. You become so smelly on the day when you do the mixing. That?s why some people don?t want that business. But here it is done, we regularly do it. I do it, my children do it, everyone who is on duty does it. We don?t employ someone to mix for us. Michael	Many Ugandans have heard of the biogas but many fear the installation costs. How much did it cost you to install this system in this farm? Musoke	We used almost 2. 5 million to install the system. Michael	And you think you have reaped some money from the 2. 5 million shillings that you initially invested here? Musoke	A lot, I have saved a lot, because what gets out of the system? They come here, those ones who are doing the business of the gardens and what, they get that waste from me and they give me some money. What matters most is for someone who is using this biogas to be active in mixing. The more you mix the more fire you get, the more you delay the less fire you get.

The taller plants (232. 3, 231. 2 cm), more stem 			girth (13. 9, 13. 9 cm), maximum head diameter (27. 1 and 26. 5 cm), 			higher number of seeds head- 1 (801. 9 and 797. 9), heavier seed weight 			head- 1 (66. 6 and 65. 9 g) bolder seed index (83. 2 and 83. 0), superior 			seed yield (3681. 8 and 3643. 2 kg ha- 1) and higher dry matter at 			harvest (12859. 3 and 12845. 0 kg ha- 1), higher Nuptake (80. 7 and 82. 2 			kg ha- 1), P-uptake (24. 2 and 24. 5 kg ha- 1), K-uptake (114. 2 and 			 114. 0 kg ha- 1), Zn-uptake (531. 9 and 530. 4 g ha- 1) and B-uptake 			(320. 4 and 314. 9 g ha- 1), higher dry matter (2075. 0 and 2066. 7 g 			m- 2), maximum leaf area index (7. 2 and 7. 2), greater leaf area 			duration (67. 4 and 67. 3 days), more crop growth rate (10. 3 and 10. 2 			g m- 2 day- 1) and superior net assimilation rate (30. 7 and 30. 7 g 			m- 2 day- 1) were recorded under cattle manure 10 t ha- 1 + 90 - 45 - 45 NPK 			+ 15 - 1. 5 Zn-B kg ha- 1 and poultry manure 5 t ha- 1 + 90 - 45 - 45 NPK + 			 15 - 1. 5 Zn-B kg ha- 1, respectively, where N was applied as 			fertigation. Whereas, seed oil content showed inverse relationship 			under higher applications of inorganic fertilizers and manures. It 			was observed that application of poultry manure at 5 tha- 1 or cattle 			manure at 10 t ha- 1 with 90 - 45 - 45 NPK + 15 - 1. 5 Zn-B kg ha- 1 			significantly enhanced all these traits and beyond these treatments 			no significant differences were exhibited even at higher levels of 			manures and were economically optimum levels for achieving 			satisfactory crop parameters. The regression coefficient indicates 			that a unit increase in various traits resulted in corresponding 			increase of sunflower seed yield by head diameter (150. 0 kg ha- 1) 			seeds head- 1 (6. 5 kg ha- 1), seed weight head- 1 (53. 1 kg ha- 1), seed 			index (62. 8 kg ha- 1), dry matter (0. 4 kg ha- 1), leaf area index 			(1027. 5 kg ha- 1), leaf area duration (116. 0 kg ha- 1), crop growth 			rate (469. 9 kg ha- 1), net assimilation rate (218. 3 kg ha- 1), 			nitrogen uptake (36. 1 kg ha- 1), phosphorus uptake (172. 1 kg ha- 1), 			potassium uptake (40. 4 kg ha- 1), zinc uptake (5. 9 kg ha- 1) and boron 			(9. 5 kg ha- 1). However, a unit increase in oil content resulted 			corresponding decrease in seed yield by (1546. 3 kg ha- 1). 			The experiment- 3 entitled residual effect of organic manures and 			supplemental inorganic fertilizers on sunflower production revealed 			prolonged maturity (99. 3 and 99. 33 days), taller plants (258. 1 and 			 256. 9 cm), more stem girth (16. 2 and 16. 2 cm), maximum head diameter 			(31. 1 and 31. 0 cm), higher number of seeds head- 1 (888. 1 and 884. 2), 			heavier seed weight head- 1 (80. 1 and 79. 7 g) bolder seed index (90. 9 			and 92. 0 g), superior seed yield (4420. 2 and 4450. 4 kg ha- 1) and 			higher dry matter (14395. 9 and 14381. 2 kg ha- 1), higher N-uptake 			(100. 9 and 100. 3 kg ha- 1), P-uptake (33. 9 and 33. 7 kg ha- 1), 			K-uptake (159. 1 and 158. 8, kg ha- 1), Zn-uptake (603. 0 and 605. 1 g 			ha- 1), B-uptake (361. 0 and 364. 7 g ha- 1), maximum leaf area index 			(7. 9 and 7. 9), greater leaf area duration (76. 0 and 75. 8, days), 			higher dry matter (2808. 7 and 2740. 4 g m- 2), more crop growth rate 			(12. 1 and 12. 0 g m- 2 day- 1) and superior net assimilation rate (36. 9 			and 36. 0 g m- 2 day- 1) were recorded under residual cattle manure 10 t 			ha- 1 + 90 - 45 - 45 NPK + 15 - 1. 5 Zn-B kg ha- 1 and residual poultry 			manure 5 t ha- 1 + 90 - 45 - 45 NPK + 15 - 1. 5 Zn-B kg ha- 1 respectively 			where N applied as fertigation and beyond these treatments no 			significant increase in all the crop traits was noted. The 			regression coefficients indicate a unit increase in various traits 			resulted in corresponding increase of sunflower seed yield by head 			diameter (157. 2 kg ha- 1) seeds head- 1 (7. 3 kg ha- 1), seed weight 			head- 1 (53. 7 kg ha- 1), seed index (67. 9 kg ha- 1), dry matter (0. 4 kg 			ha- 1), leaf area index (1064. 0 kg ha- 1), leaf area duration (111. 2 			kg ha- 1), crop growth rate (456. 8 kg ha- 1), net assimilation rate 			(195. 3 kg ha- 1), nitrogen uptake (36. 0 kg ha- 1), phosphorus uptake 			(143. 0 kg ha- 1), potassium uptake (33. 3 kg ha- 1), zinc uptake (6. 5 			kg ha- 1) and boron (10. 3 kg ha- 1), however, a unit increase in oil 			content resulted in corresponding decrease in seed yield by 2037. 6 			kg ha- 1. 			It is concluded that the fertilizers and manures enhanced all the 			crop traits, nutrient uptake and improved soil fertility. The 			application of NPK (90 - 45 - 45 kg ha- 1, N applied as fertigation) + 			Zn+B (15 + 1. 5 kg ha- 1) with 10 t ha- 1 of cattle or 5 t ha- 1 poultry 			manure for their residual effect in the subsequent crop were 			superior and optimum fertilizer and manure doses for sunflower 			production without degrading fertility of soil. It is suggested that 			any source of well <b>decomposed</b> organic <b>manures</b> could be incorporated 			in the field to enrich the soil fertility on long term basis and 			higher sunflower production. Thus, it is recommended that sunflower 			crop should be fertilized with incorporation of NPK (90 - 45 - 45 kg 			ha- 1, N as fertigation) + Zn+B (15 + 1. 5 kg ha- 1) with 10 t ha- 1 			cattle or 5 t ha- 1 poultry manures for satisfactory yield and 			maintenance of soil fertility...|$|R
