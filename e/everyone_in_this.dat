Convinced and initially backed by Kelly, Nice resigned as assistant State's Attorney and cast his hat into the gubernatorial race. However, Harry Nice then made a costly mistake. In speeches during the campaign, Nice promised to clean up the dirty underworld politics of the Democrats and their political bosses and ensure elections were fair and open to <b>everyone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> time period ballot stuffing, voter fraud and outright voter intimidation were common place, especially in large cities like Baltimore.|$|E

Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> class.|$|E

Upon failing to contact Winfrey, Leslie said, [...] "I'm putting it out there, like The Secret, and hopefully she'll call me." [...] The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne that became a best-seller after it was featured on two episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show. At one point, Tom reveals he shops for clothes at Brooks Brothers Boys, the chain of Brooks Brothers that produces clothes specifically for young boys.

This {{was a result of}} her abortion and failed relationships with Jack and Ash Nader (Ben Geurens) along with her new relationship with Cameron [...] "Cam" [...] Reynolds (Ashley Lyons), who was leading her astray. The story line began playing out from the 2006 [...] "cliffhanger" [...] episode, when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life. Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into: [...] "I think she is so naive, she wants to believe that she's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances. She wants to make it work." [...] Martha fails to cope with the situation, as Gordon describes: [...] "It's this whole emotional roller-coaster that, if you don't deal with your life, can be terrible." [...] Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash's child, causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl. Gordon commented that [...] "I think <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> show begins as a scruffy bum and gradually they turn you into a glamour puss." ...|$|E

On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

Many victims were found with blisters on their skin. This {{is believed to have been}} caused by pressure ulcers, which are likely to have formed from the low levels of oxygen present in the blood of those asphyxiated by the carbon dioxide. Thousands of cattle and wild animals were also asphyxiated, but no official counts were made. On the other hand, vegetation nearby was mostly unaffected except for that which grew immediately adjacent to the lake. There the vegetation was damaged or destroyed by a 5-meter (16.4ft.) tsunami from the violent eruption.|$|E

We are still in the barbaric age, so far as our use of food and drugs is concerned. We stuff all sorts of substances into our unfortunate interiors and blunder upon the most various consequences. Few people of three score and ten but have spent in the aggregate the best part of a year in a state of indigestion, stupid, angry or painful indigestion as the case may be. No one would be so careless and ignorant about the fuel he burnt in his motor-car as most of us are about the fuel we burn in our bodies. And there are all sort of stimulating and exhilarating things, digesting things, fatigue-suppressing things, exercise economising things, we dare not use because we are afraid of our ignorance of their precise working. There seems no reason to suppose that human life, properly understood and controlled, could not be a constant succession of delightful {{and for the most part}} active bodily and mental phases. It is sheer ignorance and bad management that keep the majority of people in that disagreeable system of states which we indicate by saying we are [...] "a bit off colour" [...] or a little [...] "out of training."

60|$|Four days he went on, trying {{here and}} trying there, eating figs and melons and bread, {{drinking}} water, sleeping beneath archways {{or on the}} steps of churches, and he dreamed of the home of roast beef and ale which he had left behind him. Every day he became more disheartened. But at last he rose up against Fate; he cursed it Byronically. Every man's hand was against him; his hand should be against every man. He would be a brigand! He shook off his feet the dust of Cadiz, and boldly went into the country to find a band of free companions. He stopped herdsmen and pedlars and asked them where brigands were. They pointed to the mountains, and to the mountains he turned his face. He would join the band, provoke a quarrel with the chief, kill him and be made chief in his stead. Then he would scour the country in a velvet mask and a peaked hat with a feather in it, carrying fire and desolation everywhere. A price would be set on his head, but he would snap his fingers {{in the face of the}} Prime Minister. He would rule his followers with an iron hand. But now he was in the midst of the mountains, and there were not the smallest signs of lawless folk, not even a gibbet with a skeleton hanging in chains to show where lawless folk had been. He sought high and low, but he never saw a living soul besides a few shepherds clothed in skins. It was most disheartening! Once he saw two men crouching behind a rock, and approached them; but as soon as they saw him they ran away, and although he followed them, shouting that they were not to be afraid since he wanted to be a brigand too, they paid no attention, but only ran the faster, and at last he had to give up the chase for want of breath. One can't be a robber chief all by oneself, nor is it given to <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world to be a brigand. Amyntas found that even heroes have their limitations.|$|E
