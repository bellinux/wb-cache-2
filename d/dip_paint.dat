40|$|The current trend {{shows an}} {{increasing}} demand for novel technologies, that facilitate a functional integration of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) in metal based structures, especially in automotive industry. To {{comply with the}} requirements of large-scale production the use of fiber reinforced thermoplastics in form of hybrid metal/composite-laminates seems advantageous. By targeted exploitation of their high lightweight potential, combined with suitable capabilities for mass production and good damping properties, cost-effective and weight-optimized parts with high stiffness and load capacity can be provided for future applications. As there is little known about the processing and the mechanical properties of thermo-plastic based FRP/metal-laminates, the study focuses on the development of novel hybrid laminates with low residual stresses, made of metallic steel sheets and continuous glass or carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6. In this context, the influence of several pre-operations like sand blasting, cleaning or primer application on the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was examined in addition to their resistance to cathodic <b>dip</b> <b>paint</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Increasing mechanical, {{economic}} and environmental requirements lead to multi material designs, wherein different classes of materials and manufacturing processes are merged to realize lightweight components {{with a high level}} of functional integration. Particularly in automotive industry the use of corresponding technologies will rise in the near future, as they can provide a significant contribution to weight reduction, energy conservation and therefore to the protection of natural resources. Especially the use of continuous fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) with thermoplastic matrices offers advantages for automotive components, due to its good specific characteristics and its suitability for mass production. In conjunction with isotropic materials, such as steel or aluminum, optimized lightweight structures can be produced, whose properties can be easily adapted to the given component requirements. The present paper deals with the development of innovative hybrid laminates with low residual stresses, made of thin-walled steel sheets and glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic (GFRP) prepregs layers. Thereby the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was increased by an optimization of the FRP/metal-interfaces, carried out by examining the influence of several pre-operations like sanding, cleaning with organic solvents and applying primer systems. Based on these findings optimized compound samples were prepared and tested under realistic Cathodic <b>dip</b> <b>paint</b> conditions to determine the influence on the ILSS...|$|E

5000|$|Slipware is pottery {{decorated}} by slip placed onto a wet or leather-hard clay body surface by <b>dipping,</b> <b>painting</b> or splashing.

Decorative slips may be a different colour than the underlying clay body or offer other decorative qualities. Selectively applying layers of colored slips can create the effect of a painted ceramic, such as in the black-figure or red-figure pottery styles of Ancient Greek pottery.

50|$|Slipware {{is a type}} {{of pottery}} {{identified}} by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by <b>dipping,</b> <b>painting</b> or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. A coating of white or coloured slip, known as an engobe, {{can be applied to the}} article to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. Sgraffito involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state. One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} load-deflection curve {{characteristics}} and deformation/fracture modes and energy absorption capacity for polyurethane foam-filled magnesium alloy AZ 31 B rectangular thin-walled beams under dynamic three-point bending loads, and compares these characteristics with those for mild steel DC 04 beams. Different foam-filled AZ 31 B beams with {{a variation of}} foam density (0. 05 g/cm 3, 0. 20 g/cm 3 and 0. 30 g/cm 3) were fabricated through several manufacturing processes: cold bending, tungsten inert gas welding, cathodic <b>dip</b> <b>painting</b> and polyurethane foam injection. It was found that 0. 20 g/cm 3 and 0. 30 g/cm 3 foams stabilised the cross sections of the thin-walled AZ 31 B beams and no inward folds occurred during the bending process, which resulted in significantly higher load carrying capacity than the empty beam. A nonlinear non-monotonic relationship between the specific energy absorption and the foam density was found for the foam-filled AZ 31 B beams. The AZ 31 B beam filled with 0. 20 g/cm 3 foam reached the highest specific energy absorption; moreover, it absorbed nearly 33 % more energy and reached nearly 2. 9 times higher specific energy absorption than the foam-filled DC 04 beam filled with the same foam, although the former one was nearly 54 % lighter. This outperformance is associated to the high work hardening rate of AZ 31 B in compression, where more material is involved in plastic deformation. However, the foam-filled AZ 31 B beams tend to fracture at the compression and tension walls, because the foam exhibits brittle fracture behaviour in tension and AZ 31 B exhibits low ductility in compression and plane-strain conditions, which limits their energy absorption at a larger deflection...|$|R
