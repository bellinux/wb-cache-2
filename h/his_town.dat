5|$|The most {{striking}} sign {{of this was}} his mode of forming a board of trustees; for, {{instead of the usual}} effort to tie up the organization forever in some sect, party or clique, he had named the best men of <b>his</b> <b>town</b> — his political opponents as well as his friends; and had added to them the pastors of all the principal churches, Catholic and Protestant.|$|E

After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of <b>his</b> <b>town,</b> known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E

5|$|He {{remained}} in Maʿarra {{for the rest}} of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet. His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck <b>his</b> <b>town.</b> Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad.

5|$|While the {{movement}} had its greatest {{level of success}} in Sweden, {{there were a number}} of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellahøj district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main achievement was the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from Funen. Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for <b>his</b> <b>town</b> planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish town planning laboratory).|$|E
5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that <b>his</b> <b>town</b> accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E

In January 2007, his contract was extended further, lasting until summer 2009. He scored 13 goals in his first season at Shrewsbury, but was also given the first red card of his career in a game against Mansfield Town, as they missed out on promotion when they lost 3–1 to Bristol Rovers in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
