40|$|In {{this article}} {{which is a}} review of sociological ideas and studies of drug abusers in social situation, drug {{addiction}} steps (particularly alcohol, heroin and cocaine consumption) are revised and some explanations are made. Also, the role of some sociological ideas in drug addiction is considered in which Anomie Theory reads: "because of such duality, the individuals who are not satisfied with their role are in hurt. " According to this theory, drug users choose seclusion and neglecting usual social aims as well as competitive situations. Association of Differentiation Theory claims that drug use behavior is a learned behavior and the first learning occurs in a friendly small group (i. e. youngsters). Social Control theory believes that one can predict normal and abnormal behaviors through the rate of individuals' social commitments. Internal and external controls also determine commitment rate. Micro-cultural theory considers drug use as a compatibility with abnormal micro-culture rules. Symbolic Mutual Action Believes that the etiquettes which society attribute to individuals/behaviors determine their acquired social reactions rather than any <b>inherited</b> <b>acquisition...</b>|$|E

40|$|Lateral gene {{transfer}} {{is an important}} mechanism of natural variation among prokaryotes, but the significance of its quantitative contribution to genome evolution is debated. Here, we report networks that capture both vertical and lateral components of evolutionary history among 539, 723 genes distributed across 181 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Partitioning of these networks by an eigenspectrum analysis identifies community structure in prokaryotic gene-sharing networks, the modules of which do not correspond to a strictly hierarchical prokaryotic classification. Our results indicate that, on average, at least 81 ± 15 % of the genes in each genome studied were involved in lateral {{gene transfer}} {{at some point in}} their history, even though they can be vertically <b>inherited</b> after <b>acquisition,</b> uncovering a substantial cumulative effect of lateral gene transfer on longer evolutionary time scales...|$|R

The company required a €3.2billion state-backed bailout in 2003 – and as a result was required to sell several divisions including shipbuilding and electrical transmission to Nikhanj Power, in order to comply with EU rules on state aid.|$|R

Reno Air had made San Jose a hub in the mid-1990s after American had decided that the competition on the West Coast made the hub unprofitable and closed it.|$|R

Xstrata and its 24.9% stake in Lonmin was later acquired by Glencore on 2 May 2013.

50|$|A mark of such newly settled {{conditions}} in the Duchy of Rome is the Domusculta Capracorum, the central Roman villa that Adrian assembled from a nucleus of his <b>inherited</b> estates and <b>acquisitions</b> from neighbors in the countryside north of Veii. The villa is documented in Liber Pontificalis, but its site was not rediscovered until the 1960s, when excavations revealed the structures on a gently-rounded hill that was only marginally capable of self-defense, but fully self-sufficient for a mixed economy of grains and vineyards, olives, vegetable gardens and piggery with its own grain mill, smithies and tile-kilns. During the 10th century villages were carved out of Adrian's Capracorum estate: Campagnano, mentioned first in 1076; Formello, mentioned in 1027; Mazzano, mentioned in 945; and Stabia (modern Faleria), mentioned in 998.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the steps associated to re-construct a model {{based on a}} number of scans acquired with different sensor techniques. It discusses the concept of managing and operating scans with different origins, which may have different spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage. In order to cope with these varying sensor characteristics, the article introduces the concept of error-bound which describes a point-wise uncertainty <b>inherited</b> from the <b>acquisition</b> system. Further processing steps in a 3 D model reconstruction task need to consider this measure in order to manage varying point accuracies and correctly manage the final fusion step making a single model based on the best available information from all information. Furthermore, the paper discusses concepts to use normal weights and normal cut-offs in the ICP algorithm, foe which we show experimental results comparing these techniques. The registration and fusion technique proposed in the article is applied to a 16 scan project aimed at accurately reconstructing an office building and some utility constructions. JRC.

40|$|IT {{services}} {{companies are}} delivering similar or same solutions in different vertical industry segments {{again and again}} at no cost and with no schedule differentiation {{over a period of}} time!! The hyper competition in the market place, coupled with reduced capability or skill set differentiation between the services companies, is not only making sustainable growth a challenge for services companies but also making it difficult for customers to choose the right services partner. Many services companies have initiated programs under different themes such as innovation, reuse, etc., that lead either to partial or no success. Given this scenario, this paper discusses the obstacles within a services company for creating a decisive differentiation that would help augment further growth. Major Challenges For the last few decades, big services companies have themselves either developed small reusable components and huge products, perhaps accidentally, or they have <b>inherited</b> products via <b>acquisitions.</b> Some of these products are highly successful, {{and some of them are}} kept in cold storage. Revenue growth from these successful products from the past is fast declining for various reasons, such as the architecture being old (client-server based, for example), not havin...|$|R
40|$|Performance and {{achievements}} of athletes {{could be attributed}} to four major factors that consist of natural <b>inherited</b> ability, <b>acquisition</b> of skill, physical fitness level and socio-psychological elements such as personality and emotional strength. However, personality has always been a topic of interest for research in terms of its relationship with sport preferences and performance. Athletes in general are not aware of their own behavior and personality. Thus, it creates a barrier for them to perform at their level best. In relation to that, the absence of knowledge of recognizing the personalities of athlete may create a hurdle of communication flow between coaches and athletes. In order to have a good breed of athletes in the future, personality should be included as part of an assessment during talent identification process. Hence, this research was conducted with the aim to determine whether there is a relationship between types of personality and sport preferences. The objectives of this study were to compare the different types of personality to gender, types of event and types of sport. The study was conducted using three different sets of questionnaires from Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Global 5 / SLOAN Personality Test and Impulsive Sensation Seeking Scale (ImpSS). 229 subjects of this study were athletes from 29 different sports who represented in Malacca’s Malaysia Games 2010 team. The subjects consist of 154 males and 75 females aged from 13 to 21 years old. The questionnaires were then collected and analyzed using Independent Samples T-Test and ANOVA in SPSS. The results indicated that there is a significant difference for gender in terms of extroversion and neuroticism. Male are higher in extroversion whereas female are higher in neuroticism. Following that, {{a significant difference between the}} different types of sport tested was also on extroversion. The sports that are recognized to go well with extroverts are Acrovolley,Weightlifting, Canoe, Rugby, Softball and Fencing. Considering there was more participants from male to female, results may be skewed due to the lack of proportionality...|$|R
