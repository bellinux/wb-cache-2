40|$|This study {{compares the}} <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{approach}} and an accrual based valuation approach: the residual income model. Given the theoretical equivalence between the residual income and <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> approaches this, study examines {{whether it is}} possible to infer a valuation approach that is superior to the other from a user perspective. The two valuation approaches are compared on the basis of analytical attractiveness. This study demonstrates that if practitioners introduce simplifying assumptions in their firm valuation, they also introduce biases in their firm value estimates. In some cases the residual income approach yields more accurate firm value estimates, while in others the <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> approach <b>yields</b> more accurate estimates. Further, the impact of simplifying assumptions on firm value estimates can be significant. Thus, it is important that practitioners introducing simplifying assumptions are aware of the impact on firm value estimates. Finally, since the framework for forecasting is often based on accrual accounting and the budget control is generally based on accounting numbers rather than <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> numbers, it seems logical to estimate firm values based on concepts known from accrual accounting and financial statement analysis, i. e. the residual income approach. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for bamboo to be a feedstock {{for the production of}} lignocellulosic biofuels. This was assessed from the perspectives of technology, economics and policy, and discusses the main drivers that could help or hinder the viability of such a process at the commercial scale. Three pretreatment technologies (liquid hot water, soaking in aqueous ammonia and dilute acid) and various enzyme loadings were explored as potential processing routes for converting bamboo into bioethanol; these conditions were compared based on the criteria of maximising sugar release and thus total ethanol production. Aspen Plus modelling software was used to simulate the conversion process at a scaled up level of 2, 000 dry metric tonnes of bamboo per day. The generated mass and energy balances were used in a <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> analysis to <b>yield</b> the minimum production price for bamboo-derived bioethanol based on a reference year of 2011. Two case study scenarios (China and Colombia) were modelled as potential locations for establishing a bamboo to bioethanol process. Bioethanol from bamboo in China and Colombia was also compared with bioethanol derived from other lignocellulosic feedstocks (wheat straw and short-rotation coppice poplar) in various locations, and its competitiveness with fossil-based fuels at the pump was assessed. This research demonstrated that bioethanol from bamboo can be just as, if not more competitive than bioethanol from other lignocellulosic resources provided that certain criteria are fulfilled. The main determinants responsible for establishing a future in the alternative fuel market included maintaining a balance between the major factors relating to technology (achieving relatively high sugar yields with low enzyme usage), economics (obtaining low costs for feedstock and high credits for electricity generation), and policy (establishing these conditions in a location with strong policy support for bioethanol).

A {{discussion}} paper was {{issued by the}} IASB in April 2010 wherein it is proposed that <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> measurement disclosures should be made by entities that operate in extractive industries. These disclosures {{are similar to those}} made by oil and gas companies that report under US GAAP. A review of the South African code for the reporting of mineral asset valuation (SAMVAL) and fair value principles suggest that standardised <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> disclosures by entities in the extractive entities will not always be relevant to users of financial statements. This study includes an assessment of the value relevance of <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> measurements based on its correlation with share prices. The regression results of a price change study suggest that changes in the standardised <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> measurements are value relevant because they are significant in explaining changes in share prices.

40|$|ABSTRACTAmong {{the various}} {{business}} valuation methods, <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{continues to be}} the most widely used today, both in the academic and in the professional milieus. Although this methodology is considered by many authors as the most suitable for the evaluation of companies in the current context, its projective character refers to a component of uncertainty present in all models based on the future risk projection assumptions adopted, that do not materialize. One of the alternatives to measure the risk inherent in the valuation of businesses by the <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> method is to incorporate the Monte Carlo Simulation to the model of conventional deterministic valuation thereby providing a stochastic model which allows a statistical analysis of risk. The objective of this work was to evaluate the appropriateness of using the technique of Monte Carlo Simulation to measure the uncertainties inherent in the business valuation methodology by <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> identifying whether such simulation methodology improves the accuracy of the business valuations by <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> The results of this study prove the operational effectiveness of using the Monte Carlo Simulation in business valuations by <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> confirming that the quality of results obtained by means of adopting this methodology of simulation showed a relevant improvement in relation to the results obtained by using the deterministic model evaluation...|$|R
