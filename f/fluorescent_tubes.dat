25|$|Development of {{fluorescent}} lamps that could {{fit in the}} same volume as comparable incandescent lamps required the development of new, high-efficacy phosphors that could withstand more power per unit area than the phosphors used in older, larger <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> are long, low-luminance sources {{compared}} with high pressure arc lamps, incandescent lamps and LEDs. However, low luminous {{intensity of the}} emitting surface is useful because it reduces glare. Lamp fixture design must control light from a long tube instead of a compact globe.|$|E
25|$|Standard <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{the common}} light bars {{you find in}} {{commercial}} ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 lumens per watt. The downside to regular fluorescent lights {{is that they do}} not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums.|$|E

25|$|Trying {{it out for}} {{the first}} time on 21 February 1940, it {{immediately}} began producing 400W of 10cm (3GHz) microwaves. Within days they noticed that it was causing <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> to light up across the room. Quick calculations showed this meant the tube was creating about 500W, already beating the klystrons. They pushed this over 1,000W within weeks. The main Birmingham team gave up on the klystron and began work on this new cavity magnetron, and by the summer had examples producing 15kW. In April, GEC was told of their work and asked if they could further improve the design.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|E

25|$|The semi-resonant start circuit {{was invented}} by Thorn Lighting for use with T12 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes.</b> This method uses a double wound {{transformer}} and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.|$|E
25|$|A {{black light}} {{may also be}} formed by simply using a UV filter coating such as Wood's glass on the {{envelope}} of a common incandescent bulb. This was the method {{that was used to}} create the very first black light sources. Although incandescent black light bulbs are a cheaper alternative to <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes,</b> they are exceptionally inefficient at producing UV light since most of the light emitted by the filament is visible light which must be blocked. Due to its black body spectrum, an incandescent light radiates less than 0.1% of its energy as UV light. Incandescent UV bulbs, due to the necessary absorption of the visible light, become very hot during use. This heat is, in fact, encouraged in such bulbs, since a hotter filament increases the proportion of UVA in the black-body radiation emitted. This high running-temperature drastically reduces the life of the lamp, however, from a typical 1000 hours to around 100 hours.|$|E
25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes.</b> These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E
50|$|Often the {{pressure}} vessel is built {{from one or}} more used plastic soft drink bottles, but polycarbonate <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> covers, plastic pipes, and other light-weight pressure-resistant cylindrical vessels have also been used.|$|R
25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream. CFLs are available that work {{in conjunction with a}} suitable dimmer.|$|R
5000|$|... 2010 - Oakville, ON lamp plant closes. Remaining {{incandescent}} lamp operations are transferred to Mexico and China. A few products are outsourced from Sylvania's US plants. T8 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> operations go to Bucyrus, OH.|$|R
500|$|Both bridges {{are made}} of {{concrete}} and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated {{by a series of}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> on the handrails, a concept known as [...] "integral lighting". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.|$|E
500|$|Before McCoy {{is arrested}} by security, he {{attempts}} to charter a spaceflight to Genesis in a bar. The scene opens with two officers playing a World War I-era dogfight video game. The wireframe biplanes were created using black lines on clear paper printouts placed on an overlay cell. [...] "It was really just a gag shot", effects artist Charlie Mullen explained, [...] "the idea {{that people in the}} future would be playing an old war game." [...] To accommodate the effect, Correll had to use a large amount of exposure without making the bar appear overlit. Much of the lighting was provided by tables rigged with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> to provide an effect different {{from other parts of the}} film. Correll could not add smoke to the scene to enhance the bar [...] "feel", because the disturbed atmosphere would have made ILM's game hard to insert. The scene was intended to end in a barroom brawl when security tried to take McCoy into custody; Nimoy decided that [...] "it didn't feel right" [...] and there was not enough time or money to achieve the scene successfully.|$|E
500|$|Many of The Search for Spocks {{dialogue}} sequences feature tight close-up shots. During Kirk and Sarek's mind meld, Nimoy chose {{cuts that}} focused on accentuating the dialogue; [...] "Instead of watching people's faces, all you see is the mouth or the eyes {{and you have the}} tendency to hear better," [...] Correll explained. Correll was unhappy that every scene save one was filmed on a soundstage. Feeling that recreating everything on set resulted in a fake look, the cinematographer suggested that Genesis be filmed on Kauai in Hawaii, and that Red Rock Canyon stand in for Vulcan. The production did not have the money to shoot on location, meaning that Nimoy was preoccupied with making sure the various outdoor settings felt believable. While the various vessel exteriors were handled by ILM, Correll was responsible for the look of the interior sets. He preferred to treat these as actual locations inside the ships; although the sets' ceilings were designed to be removed so that lights could be rigged in the rafters, Correll used other lighting methods. In the Bird of Prey, he used <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> to pick up the walls' metallic paints, and kept the set smoky to convey a dirty atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Sprites are {{sometimes}} inaccurately called upper-atmospheric lightning. However, sprites are cold plasma phenomena that lack the hot channel temperatures of tropospheric lightning, {{so they are}} more akin to <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> discharges than to lightning discharges.|$|R
5000|$|... 1990s - Electric lamp {{operations}} in the Oakville, Ontario factory slowly begins to get transferred to Warren, OH and Winchester, VA (now closed) lamp plants. Most <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> operations are ceased by the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|A {{safelight}} usually {{consists of}} an ordinary light bulb in a housing closed off by a coloured filter, but sometimes a special light bulb or <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> with suitable filter material coated directly on the glass is used in an ordinary fixture.|$|R
2500|$|The pyramid roof {{lights up}} in the evenings and can be seen [...] away. [...] It is a {{permanent}} lighting of the One Canada Square pyramid using a thousand electronically controlled <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> capable of sequence programming for special occasions and festive seasons. [...] The 4000 lights are highly energy efficient, and have an annual running cost of £23,360, rather than £116,800 if traditional incandescent bulbs had been used.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, using a {{screensaver}} with a {{flat panel}} or LCD screen instead of powering down the screen can actually reduce the lifetime of the display, since the fluorescent backlight remains lit and ages faster than it would if the screen were turned off completely. As <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> age they grow progressively dimmer, {{and they can be}} expensive or difficult to replace. A typical LCD screen loses about 50% of its brightness during a normal product lifetime, if left on continuously. (In most cases, the tube {{is an integral part of}} the LCD and the entire assembly needs to be replaced.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Another type of tube {{does not}} have {{filaments}} to start it at all. [...] Instant start <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> simply use a high enough voltage {{to break down the}} gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin {{at each end of the}} tube. The lamp holders have a [...] "disconnect" [...] socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent electric shock. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life. This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.|$|E
