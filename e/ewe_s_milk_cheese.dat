Attacks by this fly on man have occurred more frequently where the sheep population is sparse and the human population relatively greater (James 1947 : 114 - 116). It also has been proposed that those persons who are closely associated with sheep and goats, or consume large quantities of goat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>cheese</b> {{are more likely to}} become victims of Oestrus ovis attacks (James and Harwood 1969 : 293 - 294; Harwood and James 1979 : 310 - 312) ...|$|R

Please {{look for}} {{up-to-date}} {{information in the}} OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] are approximately 6. 14 million sheep in the United States (NASS 2005); however, only approximately 11, 000 are dairy ewes (Thomas 2004). In 2003, the estimated U. <b>S.</b> sheep <b>milk</b> production was 1. 2 – 1. 8 million kg, most of which was used for cheese production (Thomas 2004). Cow and goat <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses</b> have been produced in Oregon for decades. No sheep <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> is currently produced in Oregon, although sheep <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses</b> are popular around the world.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} manufacture <b>cheese</b> from skim <b>milk</b> with 30, 40 and 50 g kg - 1 soybean oil and whole milk and to monitor the quality {{of different types of}} prepared cheese. It was observed that the flavour, taste, colour and appearance, body and texture, overall acceptability and final score were significantly higher in whole <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> than that of other types of vegetable oil based (30, 40 and 50 g kg - 1) skim <b>milk</b> <b>cheese.</b> Chemical analysis showed that there were significant differences (P< 0. 01) incase of protein and fat contents of different types of cheeses. On the other hand {{there were no significant differences}} in moisture, total solids, ash and acidity content of different types of cheese. Although some chemical parameters showed that the quality of soybean oil based (30, 40 and 50 g kg - 1) skim <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses</b> were better than the whole <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> but expert judges gave their opinion in favour of whole <b>milk</b> <b>cheese,</b> on the basis of organoleptic evaluation. It may be concluded that cheese could be manufactured successfully from skim milk with 30, 40 and 50 g kg - 1 soyabean oil and it will open a new door in business sector and experiment also could solve the protein deficiency of Bangladesh. According to panelists score 50 g vegetable oil based skim <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> was better than other types of skim <b>milk</b> <b>cheese...</b>|$|R

50|$|Cheese {{production}} at Fairview started in 1980, when Cyril Back purchased {{a herd of}} Saanen milking goats and {{brought them to the}} farm.

Cyril employed the assistance of Michele Agostinelli to begin the Fairview Vineyard Cheesery, producing a small range of goats' <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses</b> for sale from the farm. In 1992, Louis Lourens was employed as head cheese maker. In 1995 Jersey milk was introduced and subsequently the range of cheeses produced expanded to include cow's <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses</b> as well as a range of products combining cow and goats' milk.|$|R

40|$|Australia’s {{regulatory}} framework {{has resulted in}} the standardisation of cheese production based on pasteurisation. Up until early 2015, regulations effectively prohibited raw milk cheese-making in Australia and thus stifled artisanal on-farm production. Although the introduction of Food Standards Australia New Zealand Standard 4. 2. 4 has allowed the production of certain hard, low-moisture raw <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses,</b> the new standard is rigid and does not encourage new entrants into the emerging raw <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> consumer market. This article compares the Australian system with the French raw <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> regulation and production system, and argues that its approach in encouraging and supporting small farmhouse artisanal traditional raw <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> is beneficial to both producer and consumer, and has not resulted in any significant health risks. The Australian approach amounts to a missed opportunity to encourage the emergence of a value-added industry with local and export potential, and is at odds with important movements in food policy, such as recognition of the value of localism and terroir...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{migration}} of people towards cities, autochthonous cheeses in Bosnia and Herzegovina survived. Technologies of these cheeses are simple and adapted to humble mountain limitations. Geographical occasions and rich mountain pastures created a certain participation of ewe's <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Communicative isolation of hilly-mountain regions resulted in "closed" cheese production in small households. Autochthonous cheeses in Bosnia and Herzegovina have various origins. Different cheeses are produced {{in different parts of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are : Travnički cheese, Masni (fat cheese), Presukača, Sirac, Livanjski cheese, Posni (lean cheese), "Suvi" (dry cheese) or "Mješinski" full fat cheese matured in sheepskin bag, fresh sour <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> "Kiseli" and dried sour <b>milk</b> <b>cheese</b> "Kiseli", Zajednica, Basa, Kalenderovački <b>cheese</b> and goat's <b>milk</b> <b>cheeses</b> (Hard and White soft goat's <b>milk</b> <b>cheese),</b> "Zarica" and Urda. Besides above-mentioned types of cheese in Bosnia and Herzegovina some other autochthonous dairy products are produced: Kajmak (Cream), Maslo (Rendered butter) and Zimsko kiselo mlijeko (Winter sour milk). The specificity in Bosnia and Herzegovina is that autochthonous dairy products are still mainly both produced and consumed in small rural households. Exceptions are Travnički cheese and Kajmak that are significantly sold at market. Only Livanjski cheese is manufactured as industry dairy product...|$|R
