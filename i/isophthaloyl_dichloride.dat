The macrocyclisation {{relies on the}} semi-flexible imide hinge formed by reaction of the 2 -amino(pyridine) functional group with two acyl chloride functional groups. The determining factors in macrocycle synthesis are (a) imide formation using the heteroaromatic ortho-N functionality; (b) the inherent ability of the imide to twist by 85 - 115 degrees from planarity (as measured by the CO [...] . CO imide torsion angles and from computational calculations), thereby providing a hinge for macrocyclic ring closure or potentially (non) helical assembly in oligomer/polymer formation and (c) the conformational flexibility of the isophthaloyl group with meta-related carbonyl groups to twist and adopt either syn- or anti-conformations, although the syn-conformation is observed structurally for all isophthaloyl groups in both (EsIO) 3 and (EsIO) 4 macrocycles...|$|E

The poly(o-acyloxyamide) s synthesized have shown good permselectivities for He/N 2 and He/CH 4 separations and very good permeability-selectivity balance for He/CO 2 separation.

Intersegmental distances, d-spacing, were shown to decrease along this sequence, obtaining a nice correlation between permeability and d-spacing.

40|$|Polymer shells up to 2 mm in {{diameter}} were prepared using an interfacial polycondensation / cross-linking reaction occurring {{at the surface}} of an oil drop. The oil phase is comprised of a solution (20 wt% or less) of <b>isophthaloyl</b> <b>dichloride</b> (IPC) dissolved in an organic solvent. An interfacial reaction is initiated when the IPC-loaded oil drop is submerged in an aqueous solution of poly(p-vinylphenol) (PVP), a poly(electrolyte) at elevated pH. Composition, structure, and surface finish for fully-formed dry shells were assessed using a number of techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), pyrolysis-gas chromatography (GC) mass spectroscopy (MS), microhardness measurements, gas permeability, and solvent permeability measurements. From deposition rate data, a reaction mechanism and key reaction parameters were identified. The deposition rate of shell membrane material {{was found to be}} a diffusion limited reaction of IPC through the forming membrane to the exterior shell interface (which {{is believed to be the}} reaction front). The final thickness of the film deposited at the interface and the rate of deposition were found to be strong functions of the IPC concentration and oil phase solvent. Films made with diethyl phthalate (DEP) were thinner and harder than films made using 1, 6 -dichlorohexane (DCH) as a solvent. Differences in solubility of the forming membrane in DCH and DEP appear to be able to account for the differences in deposition rate and the hardness (related to cross-linking density). The deposition can be thought of as a phase separation which is affected by both the poly(electrolyte) / ionomer transition and the amount of cross-linking. Finally, it was found that the choice of oil phase solvent profoundly affects the evolution of the outer surface roughness...|$|E
