5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> a rout.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, hot {{chocolate}} remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate {{of this type}} is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon {{hot chocolate}} as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as pan dulce or churros.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E
30|$|As {{more of the}} analyte <b>dissolves</b> <b>into</b> the solvent phase, {{the natural}} {{logarithm}} of the quotient becomes positive and the Gibbs free energy for this reaction becomes negative, indicating that the reaction has proceeded more favorably {{in the direction of}} the analyte <b>dissolving</b> <b>into</b> the solvent. As the analyte fully <b>dissolves</b> <b>into</b> the solvent phase, the quotient approaches infinity and the equilibrium lies totally to the right, and the target analyte (i.e., lipid) is considered fully extracted into the solvent phase.|$|R

5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive. A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held {{a peace conference}} in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry would finally marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir. Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides at the conference and gave formal homage to Philip {{in front of the}} assembled nobles.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by {{vaporizing}} him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the background plate. A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} phaser blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E
5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} {{he had created}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian {{activity}} was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians which ended in disaster. A second invasion later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them. This sparked a second invasion of Dacia in 106 AD which ended {{the independence of the}} Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after a quarrel with the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|On 18July 1936, {{war broke}} out on the Iberian {{peninsula}} as Spain <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> a state of civil war. After {{the chaos of the}} initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the Popular front (the Republicans) and the Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on the 15 of October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 PanzerI's to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of PanzerI Ausf.B's, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.|$|E
5|$|The station {{served as}} the third station on the Montclair Branch, which was first {{electrified}} by technology created by Thomas Alva Edison in 1930. The overhead catenary wires were installed, making the line the first electrically run line on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western alignment. The station remained in service for the Lackawanna Railroad for three more decades, when the railroad merged with the Erie Railroad on October 17, 1960. Although the now Erie-Lackawanna Railway continued to run the Montclair Branch, it reduced service, reducing the once two-rail alignment to one lone track, and removed most of the tracks at Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair. On April 1, 1976, the station {{was transferred to the}} Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) as the Erie-Lackawanna Railway was <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> the Conrail program.|$|E
5|$|European attitudes {{began to}} change in the mid-1260s, from perceiving the Mongols as enemies to be feared, to {{potential}} allies against the Muslims. The Mongols sought to capitalize on this, promising a re-conquered Jerusalem to the Europeans in return for cooperation. Attempts to cement an alliance continued through negotiations with many leaders of the Mongol Ilkhanate in Persia, from its founder Hulagu through his descendants Abaqa, Arghun, Ghazan, and Öljaitü, but without success. The Mongols invaded Syria several times between 1281 and 1312, sometimes in attempts at joint operations with the Franks, but the considerable logistical difficulties involved meant that forces would arrive months apart, never able to coordinate activities in any effective way. The Mongol Empire eventually <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> civil war, and the Egyptian Mamluks successfully recaptured all of Palestine and Syria from the Crusaders. After the Fall of Acre in 1291, the remaining Crusaders retreated to the island of Cyprus. They made a final attempt to establish a bridgehead at the small island of Ruad off the coast of Tortosa, again in an attempt to coordinate military action with the Mongols, but the plan failed, and the Muslims responded by besieging the island. With the Fall of Ruad in 1302 or 1303, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land.|$|E

5|$|Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra {{together}} {{formed a}} single state in the sixteen-state RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These states were <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> the Republic over {{the first half of}} 1950. An abortive anti-Republic coup in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous Pasundan state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in Makassar during the Makassar Uprising in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia as a unitary state.|$|E
5|$|The Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1 {{was founded}} in 1902 by Frederick C. Messinger. He became the first chief of the department, founded February 10, 1903. In 1906, the Briarcliff Fire Company was established. The village's {{municipal}} building and first permanent firehouse was built in 1914 in downtown Briarcliff Manor. Seven years later, in 1921, the Scarborough Fire Company was established. From 1930 to 1971, the Archville Fire Department was <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> Scarborough's fire company, which expanded its fire protection to Archville. In 1936, the Briarcliff Manor Hook and Ladder Company was formed. For the department's 50th anniversary, the village hosted numerous events, including a parade with twelve fire departments present. In 1963, the Briarcliff Manor Village Hall was constructed, again housing the fire and police departments. In 1974, a replacement firehouse was built for the Scarborough Engine Company. The fire department's 75th anniversary in 1976 drew a parade of 650 firemen from fourteen companies. In 1982, {{one of the most}} notable fires took place, in Briarcliff's downtown. The fire lasted {{three and a half hours}} and took over a hundred firefighters to control. The department also participated in fighting the Briarcliff Lodge fire in 2003, which demolished the 1902 Walter Law-built hotel. In 2010, Scarborough's firehouse was again replaced, doubling its size.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks <b>dissolved</b> <b>into</b> confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
