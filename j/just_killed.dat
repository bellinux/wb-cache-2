5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife what he saw. His wife refused to believe him unless the rooster she had <b>just</b> <b>killed</b> {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, the rooster flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E

As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she <b>just</b> <b>killed</b> her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame.

25|$|Johnson {{decided on}} a {{systematic}} bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat; also, the Viet Cong had <b>just</b> <b>killed</b> eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at Pleiku Air Base. The eight-week bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear—there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded. Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent - that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given {{out to the public}} and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.|$|E
25|$|In a {{shocking}} twist however, the entire {{chain of events}} is revealed to have been engineered {{by none other than}} Argus Pytel himself: a top ranking intelligence officer and a Collaborationist, he engineered for both Resistance groups to embark on suicidal missions, confident of the Empire's chance to recover quickly from any damage via its control over the timeline. The rebel crew member aboard the Cobalt King was actually killed by Pytel and not the other way around, a fact he took advantage of to trick his father's faction into action. The plan however took yet another unexpected turn when, surprising the attacker of the Domus and shooting him down with a barrage of missiles, he was horrified to discover he had <b>just</b> <b>killed</b> his own father. Meanwhile, approximately a thousand years later, Akyta was herself met with a defeat as the Ophan, upon critically malfunctioning, activated the Project's self-destruct system, detonating the facility and killing the Enkie slaves, effectively eradicating the entire Enkie race.|$|E

When the warlord of Bing Province, Zhang Yang, vacillated on the predicament upon choosing Cao Cao or Yuan Shao as his ally, his subordinate Yang Chou (楊醜) murdered him and took his head to Cao Cao. However, Sui Gu (眭固), a former Heishan bandit, killed Yang Chou when {{he was on his way}} to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). In order to merge Zhang Yang's remnants, Yue Jin intercepted Sui Gu when the latter attempted to go back north, and successfully hunted down his prey and took control of the Bing Province troops.
