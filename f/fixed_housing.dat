5000|$|Van Dalem's composition, {{which was}} {{probably}} made in 1565, is dominated by a high, steep cliff which only leaves a small strip of heaven {{at the top of}} the painting. A large round hole in the rock allows a view onto a wide landscape in the distance. The top of the rock is covered with trees and shrubs that are painted very precisely and a flute-playing shepherd descends the cliff amidst his herd of goats. Below the cliff is a cave covered with reeds and people clad in rough clothes. It has been surmised that van Dalem intended to depict primitive man in his natural environment, as described in the De rerum natura. He shows in his composition several elements that were deemed at the time to play a role in the civilization process such as communication, <b>fixed</b> <b>housing,</b> domestication of animals and culture (music). [...] The old man in the middle of the painting steps out of a sort of primitive gate, which symbolizes the border between nature and civilization.|$|E
40|$|Flight 5 aft {{segments}} with nozzles {{were exposed}} to - 17 F temperatures while awaiting shipment to KSC in February, 1989. No records were found which show that any previous nozzles {{were exposed to}} air temperatures as low as those seen by the Flight 5 nozzles. Thermal analysis shows that {{the temperature of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>housing,</b> and forward and aft exit cone components dropped as low as - 10 F. Structural analysis of the nozzles at these low temperatures show the forward and aft exit cone adhesive bonds to have a positive margin of safety, based on a 2. 0 safety factor. These analyses show the normal and shear stresses in the <b>fixed</b> <b>housing</b> bond as low values. However, the hoop and meridinal stresses were predicted to be in the 4000 psi range; the failure stress allowable of EA 913 NA adhesive at - 7 F. If the bonds did break in directions perpendicular to the surfaces, called bond crazing, no normal bond strength would be lost. Testing was conducted in two phases, showing that no degradation to the adhesive bonds occurred while the Flight 5 nozzles were subjected to subzero temperatures. The results of these tests are documented. Phase 1 testing cooled a full-scale RSRM insulated <b>fixed</b> <b>housing</b> to - 13 F, with extensive bondline inspections. Phase 2 testing cooled the witness panel adhesive tensile buttions to - 13 F, with failure strengths recorded before, during, and after the cooldown...|$|E

This paper uses data from a large sample of German households to assess the effects of geographic, residence, and household characteristics on the adoption of solar thermal water and space heating technologies. In addition, the impact of solar thermal technology adoption on household energy expenditures is estimated after controlling for observed household heterogeneity in geographic, residential, and household characteristics. While evidence is found of moderate household energy expenditure savings from combined solar water and space heating systems, the findings generally confirm that low in-home energy cost savings and <b>fixed</b> <b>housing</b> stocks limit the diffusion of residential solar thermal technologies. Little evidence is found of differential adoption by distinct socio-economic groups. Household adoption Solar thermal Energy cost savings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new equipment}} for the compression testing of materials under high rates of loading. The equipment consists of an electromagnetic actuator, a <b>fixed</b> <b>housing</b> containing two flat compression platens, a translating cam and a follower.

The equipment was designed, fabricated and instrumented by the authors and, besides giving constructive details for those readers that may be interested in developing a low-cost equipment for compression testing at high rates of loading, the paper also puts emphasis on the flexibility and adequacy of its operative conditions for determining the mechanical behaviour of Aluminium AA 1050 -O under different testing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} Penn - Jersey {{housing market}} model proposed by Herbert and Stevens {{and many of}} its early modifications are deterministic in construct. It is therefore unreasonable to expect such models to account adequately for observed market behaviour. For more realistic and operationally useful models, a probabilistic approach is required. Several probabilistic versions of the short-run (<b>fixed</b> <b>housing</b> supply) Herbert - Stevens model have been published in the literature, the models being derived by employing either entropy-maximising methodology and/or random utility theory. Limited empirical testing of the models has been reported. The aim {{of this paper is to}} consolidate the existing models into a general model structure using probabilistic random utility theory. The major departure from existing versions will be the recognition of within-dwelling-type attribute variability and the extent to which this variability is perceived by locators. This additional source of variability introduces another parameter into the model. When applied to a published empirical example, the proposed model results in greatly improved empirical performance. ...|$|E
