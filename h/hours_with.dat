5|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{does not}} dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and possibly Cobb, but {{says that the}} Klan had toned down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled in {{hundreds of thousands of}} non-racist men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long <b>hours</b> <b>with</b> the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.|$|E
5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based {{on the amount of}} seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 <b>hours</b> <b>with</b> the union in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 <b>hours</b> <b>with</b> the union. C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for the first choice of jobs when the office opened.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of <b>hours)</b> <b>with</b> a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 <b>hours</b> <b>with</b> only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E

He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E

5|$|By {{early on}} 14 April, the eye became better defined after an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. The intensity fluctuated after outflow decreased to the north, although increasingly warm waters favored further intensification. Early on 15 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone, {{as the storm}} rapidly deepened. The outflow was enhanced by a large upper-level low well to the southeast, and shear had decreased to a minimum. After reaching an initial peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) at 12:00UTC that day, Fantala's intensity leveled off for the following 48 <b>hours,</b> <b>with</b> its 10-minute sustained winds fluctuating between 195km/h (120mph) and 215km/h (130mph).|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 <b>hours,</b> <b>with</b> an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

Del Potro dominated the first set, but could not keep his level up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Determined to {{complete}} the destruction of Minnesota, Catesby ap Roger Jones, acting as captain in Buchanan's absence, returned the ship to the fray the next morning, March 9. During the night, however, the ironclad Monitor had arrived and had taken a position to defend Minnesota. When Virginia approached, Monitor intercepted her. The two ironclads fought for about three <b>hours,</b> <b>with</b> neither being able to inflict significant damage on the other. The duel ended indecisively, Virginia returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening, and Monitor to her station defending Minnesota. The ships did not fight again, and the blockade remained in place.|$|E
5|$|During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 {{flights and}} about 4,100 flight <b>hours,</b> <b>with</b> a mission {{availability}} rate of over 90 percent. Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy surface-to-air missiles, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an attrition rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the F-117 Nighthawk and AH-64 Apache—that {{played a crucial}} role in the war. In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch. The AV-8Bs launched from amphibious assault ships in the Persian Gulf, and from forward operating bases such as Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait.|$|E
