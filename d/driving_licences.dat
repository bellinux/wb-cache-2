25|$|In 2006 the European Parliament {{adopted a}} {{directive}} 2006/126/EEC providing for a uniform driving licence in all Member States. New <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> are issued from 19 January 2013. In Poland, the new <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> are {{mandated by the}} law of 5 January 2011—the Motor Vehicle Drivers Act (Ustawa o Kierujących Pojazdami; Journal of Laws No. 30, item 151), that came into force on that day.|$|E
25|$|For Class 4, 5, bus and taxi <b>driving</b> <b>licences,</b> annual medical check-ups {{are done}} from 70 years old {{all the way}} to 80. The upper age limit is 81.|$|E
25|$|<b>Driving</b> <b>licences</b> only {{apply for}} use of {{vehicles}} on public roads. Any vehicle can be driven on one's own land (or another person's, with the owner's permission) without a licence.|$|E
50|$|Foreigners holding foreign <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> and {{intend to}} remain in Singapore for less than twelve months are not {{required}} to convert their foreign <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> to a Singapore <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b> They may drive in Singapore with a valid foreign <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b> However, if the licence is not in English, in addition to a valid foreign <b>driving</b> <b>licence,</b> they are required to have an International Driving Permit. If an International Driving Permit is not available, an official translation of the <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> in English is required.|$|R
25|$|A person {{holding a}} <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> from certain {{countries}} may exchange {{it for a}} Swedish licence {{without the need for}} a test. These countries are the EU/EEA nations, Switzerland and Japan. People holding a <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> from other countries must do the full test in order to obtain a Swedish <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
25|$|As long as Great Britain and Northern Ireland remains {{within the}} European Union, the <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> in the United Kingdom is a European <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
25|$|The DVLA has {{included}} Welsh on <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> issued in Wales for many years. But requests for Scots Gaelic (also an official {{language in the}} UK) to be included on licences issued to drivers resident in Scotland have so far been rejected.|$|E
25|$|Identity {{cards for}} UK {{nationals}} {{were introduced in}} 2009 on a voluntary basis, and the attempt to introduce a nationwide identity-card scheme in 2010 was reversed mid-course. Its in-progress database was halted and then destroyed. Only workers in certain high-security professions, such as airport workers, were required to have an identity card in 2009, and this remains the case today. Therefore, <b>driving</b> <b>licences,</b> particularly the photocard driving licence introduced in 1998, along with passports, are {{the most widely used}} ID documents in the United Kingdom. Most people do not carry their passports with them; this leaves <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> as the only valid form of ID to be presented. In day-to-day life, most authorities do not arbitrarily ask for identification from individuals, although this may become a concern in instances of stop and search.|$|E
25|$|Licence used by {{drivers who}} are {{residents}} of the associated countries of the European Union have a standard look and contain the information of the driver, common to all countries, developed in 1998. Exceptions to this general rule apply to small parts of this document. Polish <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> issued from the late 1990s comply with these standards.|$|E
50|$|A driver <b>licence</b> (or <b>driving</b> <b>licence)</b> is {{required}} in Singapore before a person is allowed to drive a motor vehicle of any description on a road in the country. Like many {{other countries in the}} world, an individual must possess a valid <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> before being permitted to drive on the road, and <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> holders are subject to all traffic rules.|$|R
2500|$|The Austrian firemen <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> is {{intended}} for use by fire departments. It allows firemen to drive fire-fighting vehicles up to [...] gross vehicle weight with the <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> class B.|$|R
40|$|The {{propensity}} {{of young people}} to take <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> was rather consistent up until 1990. Around 1990, the behaviour of young people changed in many respects. They continued living at home {{for a longer period}} of time, they became established later and with less favourable conditions of employment in working life, they studied to a greater extent and, above all, studied longer, they started families later. A sign of the times was that they also put off taking <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b> Searches of the literature have shown that hardly any models have been presented that describe the taking of <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b> A model produced earlier at VTI has functioned as a basis in this study. Separate models of the propensity to take <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> have been estimated for each age group between 18 and 24. Independent variables in the model are a <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> cost index and the proportion of 24 -year olds who have post upper-secondary school education. Official statistics published concerning the taking of <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> at various ages show, for example, the proportion of 18 -year olds who have taken a <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> during the calendar year in which they attain the age of 18. If one wants data regarding how many took a <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> before their 19 th birthday, special analyses are required. An estimation can be made based on the result of the model, but in the report a more ambitious attempt is also presented...|$|R
25|$|Even though Switzerland is a EFTA member state, {{it is not}} {{a member}} of the European Economic Area. Switzerland has, however, {{generally}} adopted much of the harmonised EU legislation with regard to <b>driving</b> <b>licences.</b> Swiss licences can be exchanged in most EEA countries. Switzerland has, since the 2000s, used the EU system of vehicle categories and issued EEA-style credit-card licences.|$|E
25|$|Until 1973, <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> (and tax discs) {{were issued}} by local {{authorities}} {{and had to be}} renewed every three years. In 1971, the decision was taken to computerise the licensing system to enable it to be linked to the Police National Computer and to extend the life of the licence up to the driver's 70th birthday, extendable at intervals thereafter provided the driver can prove fitness.|$|E
25|$|The {{exception}} {{is for those}} holding EEA <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> issued {{in exchange for a}} non‑EEA licence. When holding a converted licence, one should not assume the licence can be exchanged when moving to another EEA country. This only applies when permanently relocating to a different EEA country, as a tourist, an EEA-licence issued in exchange of a non-EEA licence is recognised throughout the EEA.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> {{issued in}} Ontario, Canada, for an {{equivalent}} of a UK class B or class B-auto <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> (in the case of Ontario, a class G licence), allows its holder to drive vehicles with: ...|$|R
50|$|Twelve {{points on}} the licence makes the driver liable to cancellation/suspension of <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> for one year; {{accumulation}} of twelve points {{for the second consecutive}} time would lead to suspension of <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> for five years.|$|R
25|$|The Belgian <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> can be {{obtained}} after finishing a driving school and passing a two-stage test, the theory test and road test. Beside Dutch, French and German, you can also apply for the <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> in English.|$|R
25|$|On 29 July 1991, the Council of Ministers {{adopted the}} Council of the European Union Directive 91/439/EEC on <b>driving</b> <b>licences.</b> The {{directive}} required EU Member States to adopt laws implementing the directive before 1 July 1994, which laws would take effect on 1 July 1996. Directive 80/1263/EEC would be repealed {{on the same}} date. Directive 91/439/EEC specified the European Union driving licence until its repeal 19 January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Fangio was {{inducted}} into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. He returned to the spotlight in 1994, when he publicly opposed a new Province of Buenos Aires law denying <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> to those over 80 (which included Fangio). Denied a renewal of his card, Fangio reportedly challenged Traffic Bureau personnel to a race between Buenos Aires and seaside Mar del Plata (a 400km (250mi) distance) in two hours or less, following which an exception was made for the five-time champion.|$|E
25|$|The Roads Act 1920 {{brought in}} the Road Fund, with the Government {{receiving}} revenue from excise duty on road vehicles and {{from the sale of}} licences for horse-drawn carriages and <b>driving</b> <b>licences.</b> As road traffic began to grow, the condition of the road network became an issue, with most of it in a poor state of repair. The new Ministry of Transport created a classification system for the important routes connecting large population centres or for through traffic, with the definitive list being published in 1922/3 and revised in 1926/7.|$|E
5|$|In {{domestic}} non-electronic identification the <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> {{has remained}} in a leading position, {{since most of}} the population have to have a licence anyway, and a <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> is valid for almost every situation where non-electronic personal identification is needed.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{succeeding}} {{the practical}} exam, a probationary <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> is issued for three. To obtain the full, unlimited, <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> after these three, the candidate must not commit a serious traffic offence and attend {{two days of}} further driving training.|$|R

25|$|The European {{driving licence}} is a driving licence {{replacing}} the many driving licence styles already {{in use in}} the member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) (all 28 EU member {{states as well as}} 3 EFTA member states; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). It has the credit card-style with a photograph and possibly a microchip. They were introduced to replace the 110 different plastic and paper <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> of the 300 million drivers in the EEA. The main objective of the licence is to decrease the risk of fraud.|$|E
25|$|A {{driving licence}} issued {{by a member}} state of the EEA, is {{recognised}} throughout the EEA {{and can be used}} {{as long as it is}} valid, the driver is old enough to drive a vehicle of the equivalent category and the licence is not suspended or restricted and has not been revoked in the issuing country. If the holder of an EEA driving licence moves to another EEA country, the licence can be exchanged for a driving licence from the new EEA country. However as all EEA <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> are recognised throughout the EEA, it is not necessary to exchange it.|$|E
25|$|Until 2013, the Croatian {{driving licence}} had a pink booklet format, which was common in Europe at the time. A {{separate}} booklet {{was required for}} each vehicle category endorsement. This was before the European Parliament adopted the Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Commission, which mandated {{the creation of a}} single European driving licence. Since 2013, Croatian <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> are issued in a EU-standard, credit-card-style format. Only one card is required per licence holder as it contains information on all vehicle categories that the holder is allowed to operate. Old (pre-2013) licences remain to be valid until their expiry, or until year 2033, whichever comes sooner.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{learning}} {{to drive a}} car, moped or motorcycle, a provisional <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> must be obtained. If a driver already holds a valid full <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> but wishes to drive larger vehicles, minibuses or buses, provisional entitlement for these categories of vehicle is required.|$|R

25|$|In some cases, {{when women}} {{have the right to}} work and are educated, women's job {{opportunities}} may in practice be unequal to those of men. In Egypt for example, women have limited opportunities to work in the private sector because women are still expected to put their role in the family first, which causes men to be seen as more reliable in the long term. In Saudi Arabia, it is illegal for Saudi women to drive, serve in military and other professions with men. It is becoming more common for Saudi Arabian women to procure <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> from other Gulf Cooperation Council states such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.|$|E
25|$|The Danish {{territories of}} the Faroe Islands and Greenland are neither {{part of the}} European Union nor the Schengen Area, and visas to Denmark are not {{automatically}} valid in these territories. However, both of these territories lack border controls on arrivals from the Schengen Area, and the air or sea carriers are responsible for carrying out document checks before boarding, as is common for travel inside the Schengen Area. Citizens of EU/EFTA countries can travel to the Faroes and Greenland using a passport or national ID card, while citizen of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway or Sweden can use any acceptable identification (such as <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> or bank ID cards).|$|E
25|$|The Council of the European Union Directive 91/439/EEC harmonises the {{categories}} of <b>driving</b> <b>licences</b> among the Member States and establishes two Community driving licence models, one paper version and one plastic card version. It furthermore establishes an obligatory test of knowledge (theory) and a test of skills and behaviour (practical) which has to be successfully passed before an individual is offered a driving licence. It also requires an applicant to meet the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness to drive. The directive specifies the minimum ages for driving different types of vehicles, and establishes progressive access in categories A, C, and D, from light vehicles to larger or more powerful vehicles. The directive stipulates that it is mandatory to have the normal residence in the Member State issuing the licence.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, a <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> is the {{official}} document which authorises its holder to operate motor vehicles on highways and other public roads.

A <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> is required in England, Scotland, and Wales for any person driving a vehicle on any highway or other [...] "road", as defined in s.192 Road Traffic Act 1988, irrespective of the ownership of the land over which the road passes. Similar requirements apply in Northern Ireland under the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981.As long as Great Britain and Northern Ireland remains within the European Union, the <b>driving</b> <b>licence</b> in the United Kingdom is a European <b>driving</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
