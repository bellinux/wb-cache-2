5|$|Carpenter {{wrote the}} film in the mid-1970s as a {{reaction}} to the Watergate scandal. After the success of Halloween, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying Michael Myers in Halloween.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention {{to be nominated}} as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{has a high}} strikeout rate of 11.2 per 9 innings {{through his}} first 251⅓ MLB innings. This {{corresponds}} with high swing-and-miss rates across all of his pitches, including 54% on his changeup—the highest whiff rate among all starting pitchers' changeups since PITCHf/x began tracking pitches. Through the 2012 season, Strasburg's career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.67 would rank second all-time if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> innings to qualify. Strasburg maintains that his high strikeout rate is not intentional, and in fact is a hindrance to maintaining low pitch counts.|$|E

5|$|In the final, Jastremski {{attacked}} {{from the}} outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win {{the gold medal in}} a new world record time of 2min 27.8s, a margin of 0.4s, with Jastremski a further 1.4s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village {{in what is now}} Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Ksenia Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian origin, and had a {{daughter}} two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> money.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was too busy trying cases {{to allow him to}} participate.|$|E

5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall. Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow slot machines at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> votes to pass the measure {{even if it were}} brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills to deal with the shortfall. The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused substance abusers to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over {{the next eight years}} and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that the}} Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster {{in level flight}} than the Japanese fighters they were up against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted to make sure that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Turvey's team {{asked him}} to reset his vehicle and a yellow flag was shown to warn drivers about his {{stranded}} car. After three laps, however, {{he was unable to}} restart his vehicle and retired, causing the safety car to be sent onto the track for the second time. With the field closed up, di Grassi and d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch into their second cars on the 18th lap. Although the switch would allow di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the race's conclusion. The race restarted when the safety car drove into the pit lane on the following lap with López remaining in first place, followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird and Buemi. López built a small lead over {{the rest of the field}} and attention switched to Heidfeld who came under pressure from Vergne, Bird, Buemi and Rosenqvist. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> electrical energy to do another lap, Vergne became the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop to switch into his second car at the end of lap 24 in an effort to drive in clean air and undercut the field. The rest of the field followed in response one lap later. Swift work from López's team allowed him to remain narrowly ahead of Vergne, who in turn, moved in front of Heidfeld. The Mahindra driver lost seven positions while Buemi moved from fifth to tenth, both as a result of slow pit stops. Prost led the field for one lap before making his stop on lap 26.|$|E

5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in years past, Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for more would grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season than he was in 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found a paying job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to tag along on surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E
