5|$|Cardiff, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered in March–April 1916 as part of the Repeat War Programme. The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Govan {{shipyard}} on 22 July 1916. She was launched on 12 April 1917 and completed on 25 June 1917. She became flagship of the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet the following month. Cardiff participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917. This was a successful attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships for most of the battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. Cardiff fired the most of any ship in her squadron, but did not hit any German ships. She was, however, hit <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> herself, killing seven crewmen and wounding thirteen, but was only lightly damaged. Based at Scapa Flow and Rosyth during 1918, the ship spent the remainder of the war escorting convoys and training in the northern portion of the North Sea. By 21 November 1918 the war was over, and Cardiff had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the Firth of Forth to be interned.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the era, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective and cheaper to feed than horses. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The late sixteenth century was an era of economic distress, probably exacerbated by increasing taxation and the devaluation of the currency. In 1582 a pound of silver produced 640 shillings, but in 1601 it was 960 and the exchange rate with England was £6 Scots to £1 sterling in 1565, but by 1601 it had fallen to £12. Wages rose rapidly, by between <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> between 1560 {{and the end of the}} century, but failed to keep pace with inflation. This situation was punctuated by frequent harvest failures, with almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century seeing local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584–88 and 1597–1609. There were {{the beginning}}s of industrial manufacture in this period, often using expertise from the continent, which included a failed attempt to use Flemings to teach new techniques in the developing cloth industry in the north-east, but more successful in bringing a Venetian to help develop a native glass blowing industry. George Bruce used German techniques to solve the drainage problems of his coal mine at Culross. In 1596 the Society of Brewers was established in Edinburgh and the importing of English hops allowed the brewing of Scottish beer.|$|E
