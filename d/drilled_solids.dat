40|$|AbstractDrilling {{solid waste}} {{is a typical}} {{industrial}} solid waste, {{and it is a}} major pollutant source to ecological environment around gas fields. A gas field in Southwest China is a self-contained marine gas field, presently with a large scale and great abundance. It also belongs to the five large gas fields of China with exploration above 2 × 1011 m 3. Spot investigation and experimental study showed that the <b>drilling</b> <b>solid</b> waste was made up of drilling mud and rock cuttings. After solidified disposal, the waste belonged to the second general industrial solid waste, and environmental impacts related to the waste water were characterized as pH, COD and SS. According to traffic distance to the local town, alternative control projects were brick production and cement solidification. <b>Drilling</b> <b>solid</b> waste from the central field was collected and piled up in a massive landfill, then gradually calcined to brick; while <b>drilling</b> <b>solid</b> waste from the ambient field was mainly on-the-spot solidified, later for activity site. The study is significant for waste pollution control and gas field management. However, further studies are in progress to solve the problems such as waste water pollution of the massive landfill and the solidified pools, secondary air pollution of the brick factory...|$|R

Tests were conducted to evaluate the plugging mechanisms of metallic screens after cleaning up the altercate developed on an unconsolidated core by two exiting drill-in fluids (DIF's). Two simulated <b>drill</b> <b>solids,</b> clay or 75 -[]m reservoir sand were added as <b>drill</b> <b>solids</b> to these DIF 's. Poroplus[] metallic screens developed by Purolator Products Company were used to simulate the sand control device. The DIF's tested included a sized-calcium carbonate (SCC) and a sized-salt (SS). <b>Drill</b> <b>solids</b> added to the tested DIF's simulate tiny formation particles. The presence of these <b>drill</b> <b>solids</b> was found to affect the particle size distribution as well as the mean size (D[]) of the particles of the bridging and weighting material (BWM) and loss control material (LCM) that make up a fundamental part of the DIF's. BWM solids containing calcium montmorillonite clay showed that the median size of the particles was substantially decreased and the ultrafine material content (particles smaller than 45 []m) was increased. BWM solids containing 75 -[]m sand as <b>drill</b> <b>solids</b> showed an increase of the median size of the particles with a decrease in the ultrafine material. After the filtercake clean-up treatment and subsequent backsaw, screen plugging evaluated in terms of regained-flow capacity was much more severe {{in the presence of the}} whole altercate (after 3 % KCl treatments) than in the presence of the degraded filtercake (after HCI acid treatments). On the basis of the previous observations, it can be concluded that when SCC filtercakes were backflowed, the smaller the particle size of the altercate, the higher the minimum dislodging pressure (MDP) and screen plugging, and consequently the lower the regained-flow capacity. Coarse particle size of the filtercakes tended to result in minimum MDP, leading to higher regained-flow capacity and lower plugging of the screen. In contrast, these effects in SS filtercakes were masked by the presence of a polymer, xanthin gum, in the filtercake. The polymers act as glue on the sized particles forming a strong, tough, and rigid filtercake. Therefore, these filtercakes required high pressure to be backfired, decreasing the regained-flow capacity highly and causing severe plugging of the screens. Also, the results indicated that the hydrochloric acid treatment was more effective in removing the filtercakes than the 3 % KCI treatment. Also, it was demonstrated that the use of HCI is much more effective in removing the filtercake formed by SS than in removing the one formed by SCC...|$|R

Empirical models for estimating the breakthrough time and regained permeability for selected nondamaging drill-in fluids (DIF's) give a clear indication of formation damage and proper cleanup treatments for reservoir conditions analyzed in this study. We determined values of breakthrough time and regained permeability for common polymer-carbonate and sized-salt/saturated brine DIF's for a range at reservoir properties including temperature, <b>drill</b> <b>solids</b> content, and percent of acid in the cleanup treatment. We chose these DIF's because they form tight, thin filtercakes that control fluid leakoff and afford more complete wellbore cleanup properties than standard drilling muds, and we chose reservoir properties that could be varied and measured. Beginning with a large database of 101 tests with 8 independent variables such as type of drill-in fluid, temperature, screen type, presence of gravel pack, formation type, type of <b>drill</b> <b>solids,</b> concentration of <b>drill</b> <b>solids,</b> and cleanup treatments, we analyzed the importance of each variable. After that, we identified the independent variables we were taking into account during this research. Those variables were temperature, <b>drill</b> <b>solids</b> content, and concentration of hydrochloric acid in the cleanup treatment. Then we generated a matrix for each set of experiments that allowed us to organize and measure the conditions we were looking for, regained permeability and breakthrough time. In measuring the regained permeability, we used a linear-flow cell apparatus. In measuring the breakthrough time that particular cleaning procedures take to flow across the filter cake, we used a ceramic disc cell apparatus. We used statistical software to select properties, formation, and diagnostics of the models and to develop relationships among the properties of the DIF's. We developed four new empirical models for estimating the breakthrough time and regained permeability in polymer carbonate and sized salt. High correlations resulted with R? values between 0. 851 and 0. 986 corroborated by close values of adjusted R-square and low P-values give validity to the correlations found. This technique gives a broad overview of the formation damage as well as the proper cleanup treatment for similar conditions presented in the field...|$|R
30|$|The gel {{strength}} Gel 0 / 10 (initial 0  s/ 10  min) is the shear stress of drilling mud that is measured at low shear rate after the drilling mud is static {{for a certain}} period of time.

30|$|Commercial clays such as {{bentonite}} {{or other}} chemically treated clays {{are added to}} the DF for controlling rheological and filtration properties. The combined mix of commercial clays and <b>drilled</b> <b>solids</b> is called the “low-gravity solids” (LGS). Weighting materials (e.g. barite, barium sulfate, hematite etc.) {{are added to the}} fluid to make up the required density. This additive is necessary to densify mud and keeps the desired the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the DF in the drillpipe column and annulus. The concentration of these weighting materials is known as “high-gravity solids” (HGS). It is important for effective control of the properties of the fluid to know the individual concentrations of all types of solids (i.e., LGS and HGS). These entities are either measured directly or calculated from the density and volume fraction of solids in the DF, both of which can be measured but this is laborious. Traditionally, the LGS–HGS volume ratio is measured using a retort, a technique that requires good operator skills, takes at least 45  min, and has an error margin of 15  %.|$|E
40|$|Invert-emulsion {{drilling}} fluids are stable water-in-oil emulsions containing viscosifiers, weighting agents and other additives. Solids-control equipment at the rig site removes {{the majority of}} the <b>drilled</b> <b>solids</b> entrained in the fluid during the drilling process. However, the buildup of fine material along with water ingress from the formation eventually affects the fluid’s chemical and physical properties {{to such an extent that}} dilution or disposal is necessary. Electrophoresis is the motion of charged species in a medium under the influence of an electric field and is well known in the treatment of aqueous or ionic fluids. Applying electrophoresis to invert {{drilling fluids}} cleanup has resulted in a novel technology to remove charged or polar species present in the oil-continuous medium. Electrophoretic separation of solids and brine droplets in the drilling fluid occurs because ions or micelles are attached to or adsorbed on the surface of the particles. The particles migrate and form a deposit at the collecting electrode. Drilling fluid composition affects the migration rate and direction and will ultimately affect process efficiency. Pilot scale and field scale studies have shown in addition, that treatment time, collection interval and voltage also affect treatment performance and rate. Removal of solids and brine from drilling fluids positively impacts its physical properties by decreasing the density and viscosity with an increase in the relative oil content. This reduces the excessive dilution that can be associated with reconditioning drilling fluids and effectively extends the drilling fluid’s useful life. The waste disposal volumes and associated costs are also reduced. Therefore this electrophoresis technology meets both operational and environmental goals...|$|E
40|$|Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) {{has grown}} {{significantly}} {{in recent years}} as a niche market for drilling jobs considered not good candidates for conventional rotary drilling due primarily to high cost associated with them. CTD is normally associated with high angle to horizontal and extended reach wells. It is, however, in these applications that hole problems, due to inefficient cuttings removal, become more troublesome. These problems are enhanced due to the non rotation of the inner string (the CT itself) as opposed to normal (or conventional) drilling where the inner pipe rotation imparts some motion and agitation of the <b>drilled</b> <b>solids</b> thus minimizing hole problems due to cuttings accumulation. Many parameters affect efficient cuttings transport in Coil Tubing Drilling in horizontal and deviated geometries. Among these are pump rates, well dimensions, fluid properties, solids sizes and solids loading. Drilling should be designed and carried out so that all cuttings are maintained in suspension and no cuttings bed is formed. Several {{attempts have been made to}} determine the optimum operating range of these parameters but complete and satisfactory models have yet to be developed. The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the state of the art of previous approaches to efficient cuttings transport during Coil Tubing Drilling, present the critical parameters involved and establish their range according to what is observed in practice through dimensional and similarity analysis. Finally the laboratory system that has already been set up is presented. Its primary purpose is to allow the gathering of good quality data, which are really missing from the literature, which could aid into better understanding the flow of solid – liquid mixtures in annuli...|$|E

30|$|Formation {{damage is}} {{attributed}} to many processes such as drilling, completion, acidizing, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

The laboratory experimental results suggest that damage from drilling particles to the well productivity can be as high as 10 % depending on the invasion depth. However, practically in the field, the situation may differ from the lab tests in terms of penetration of mud particles which may be due to very porous zones or “micro-fracturing’’ during drilling pressure surges.

30|$|The {{factors that}} affect the {{transmission}} rate of drilling fluid pulse can be summarized as follows: composition and properties of drilling fluid, drill string size and material properties, and environmental parameters. Drilling fluid pulse transmission method is the main method of wireless information transmission in the drilling guidance parameter transmission. The transmission speed of drilling fluid pulse signal is an important point in the transmission characteristics of drilling fluid pulse signal, which is of great significance {{to the design of}} drilling guidance parameter transmission system, drilling fluid pulse signal transmission speed and drilling fluid temperature, drilling fluid composition and pulse pressure, and <b>drilling</b> fluid <b>solid</b> content and gas content, drill string diameter, and other factors. In the actual mining conditions, the drilling fluid is a kind of solid, liquid, and gas multi-phase mixed fluid. <b>Drilling</b> fluid contains <b>solid</b> material such as cuttings and contains gaseous substances such as air bubbles. The theoretical formula of pulse transmission speed of drilling fluid pulse generator is proposed. Considering the influence of drilling fluid temperature, drilling fluid composition, pulse pressure, <b>drilling</b> fluid <b>solid</b> content, gas content, diameter of drill string and other factors, the unsteady flow theory is used to deduce the pulse transmission velocity of drilling fluid pulse generator The theoretical formula is in the mud pulse transmission system; the signal transmission speed is a basic parameter. However, <b>drilling</b> fluids contain <b>solids</b> such as clays, cuttings, barites, and the like, and the presence of free-standing gases tends to form bubbles, increasing the complexity of the signaling speed problems.|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} {{shows that}} DF properties (plastic viscosity (PV), yield point (YP), and gel strength (GS)) affect {{the rate of}} penetration (ROP) drastically because the presence of unremoved <b>drill</b> <b>solids</b> can cause a phenomenon known as the chip hold down effect, which increases both the equivalent circulation density (ECD) and the differential pressure causing {{a decrease in the}} ROP. For instance, it is an established fact that the PV is influenced by the amount of colloidal particles present in the DF. Colloids present in the drilling fluid increase the fluid viscosity, which reduces the mobility of the cuttings as these cuttings stick to the bottom, requiring a re-drilling operation which severely affects the bit life. However, it is inferred that although DF properties affect the ROP, their net effect may not be as significant as it is thought to be except for the annular pressure losses in the laminar flow regime.|$|R

Research was performed to study the degradation of filtercakes formed by water-based drill-in fluids (DIF), primarily sized-salt (SS) and sized-calcium carbonate (SCC) DIFs. The experiments to degrade DIF filtercakes varied temperature (43 ?C to 71 ?C), <b>drilling</b> <b>solids</b> concentration (2 % to 6 %), and acid concentration (1. 6 % to 7. 4 %). The objective of these tests was to predict with fundamental kinetic relationships the time necessary to degrade the filtercakes. Water-based DIF filtercakes have shown promising results in determining degradation and reaction rates when exposed to hydrochloric acid treatments. Using a ceramic disk apparatus, static experiments were performed to determine the time needed for acid breakthrough and to measure polymer degradation. Further polymer degradation testing involved a well-mixed reactor. Reaction rates were estimated by using a modified chromotropic acid assay (CTA) to measure biological polymer content in conjunction with first-order kinetic equations. Experiments showed that polymer content is critical for acid cleanup fluid to penetrate filtercakes. At least 75 % of polymer content in filtercakes must be degraded for breakthrough to occur. For faster acid breakthrough times, high temperature and acid concentration in combination with low <b>drilling</b> <b>solids</b> content are necessary. Comparing static systems and well-mixed systems demonstrate a considerable difference in reaction rates. The variance is caused by diffusional limitations inherent in the static system. Pulsing of acid fluid is recommended for treatment purposes so that diffusion is not a limiting factor in filtercake degradation. Using the calculated activation energy and preexponential factors, charts were created for prediction of polymer degradation in well-mixed systems. Acetone was studied as a solvent for synthetic oil-based DIFs. Concentrations of over 88 % acetone in water solubilize the organic phase of synthetic oil-based DIFs.
