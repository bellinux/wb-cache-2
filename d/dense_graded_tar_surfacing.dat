40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{illustrate}} how a proposed investment in upgrading a gravel road to a <b>tarred</b> <b>surface</b> should be evaluated. The project {{is located in the}} Limpopo Province of South Africa. It involves upgrading of two existing, mainly gravel, roads into a <b>tar</b> <b>surface</b> road connecting Sekhukhune and Capricorn districts. The whole route has several sections starting from Flag Boshielo to Mafefe, Sekororo, Ga Seleka and finally to Mmatladi. It has been estimated that more than 98 % of the sections of gravel road are considered in either poor or fair condition. The main users of the existing gravel road are mini-buses and private vehicles transporting people from local areas to Lebwakhomo and other towns. The predominant economic activity in the region is small-scale agriculture, carried out on a number of irrigation schemes. An lesson from this case is the importance of evaluating segments of a road separately if the traffic on the segments or the cost of upgrading are significantly different across segments.

40|$|A stable slow setting {{cationic}} emulsion has been developed, suitable to coat <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures high in fine aggregate content, in particular gap graded rolled asphalt type and <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> macadam mixtures. The slow setting emulsion, NH- 10, is {{the outcome of}} an investigation into five different formulations using two surfactants, two adhesive agents and a water shading compound. The rheological studies of the NH- 10 emulsion have shown that it possesses a thixotropic behaviour. The thixotropic behaviour has been justified by the "complex flow" coefficient, a technique proposed by Traxler for bitumens. The viscosity of the emulsion is greatly influenced {{by the amount of}} binder and level of temperature. The hardness of binder does not change appreciably the viscosity value of the emulsion. The highly stable mildly {{cationic emulsion}} has been used to prepare two types of dense bituminous mixtures containing limestone aggregate, river sand and limestone filler, blended in appropriate proportions. The study presents information regarding the properties of two <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> bituminous mixtures i. e. a gap graded "Cold Rolled Asphalt" (C. R. A.) and a continuously graded "Dense Emulsion Macadam" (D. E. Mc).

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{managing}} storm water with porous or <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> asphalt pavement {{has been done}} successfully in Minnesota since 2005, and nationally since the 1970 ’s to provide a solution to storm water runoff and groundwater table recharge.

The most common locations for use include parking lots and low volume roads, and in high activity recreational areas like basketball and tennis courts or playground lots. Pavement design is also available for heavier load facilities. As shown in Figure 1, a typical pavement section consists of either a porous or a <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> asphalt pavement layer on top of a choker course layer, a reservoir course (designed for runoff detention frost penetration, and structural capacity), and an non-woven geotextile over the existing soil or subgrade material...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of internal cracks in asphalt mixtures in the wheel tracking test at high temperature {{was investigated in}} <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> (13 F) and drainage asphalt mixtures prepared outside.

The resulting tar mixtures were in general conformity with Mixes 4 T {base) and 7 T (surface) of ASTM D 1753 - 67. Although the Marshall stability was 3000 pounds at I 00 °F, the <b>tar</b> <b>surface</b> course has thinned in the wheel tracks and thickened outside the wheel paths.
