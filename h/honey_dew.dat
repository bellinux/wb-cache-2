25|$|On July 13, 2009, Tim Hortons opened {{stores in}} New York City at former Dunkin' Donuts {{locations}} {{operated by the}} Riese Organization. One of the stores is located at Madison Square Garden, where Horton played {{as a member of}} the New York Rangers from 1969 to 1971. In 2009, Tim Hortons opened its first store in Albany, NY, with more stores on the way. Tim Hortons continued its southward expansion in the US by opening a restaurant at Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia, in mid-December 2009. In November 2010, Tim Hortons announced it was closing 36 stores in the northeastern United States due to high competition with New England-based Dunkin' Donuts and Au Bon Pain. The stores, which made less than half the average company per-store sales, were concentrated heavily in the Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, areas, the former of which also has a concentration of stores from the locally-competing <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew</b> Donuts chain, itself with some 150 outlets in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. In the announcement, the chain stated that it will concentrate its efforts on its core markets such as western Canada. In the same statement, the company announced the sale of its portion of distribution company Maidstone Bakeries to Tim Hortons' European partners. It will use the C$400million generated by the sale for a stock buyback.|$|E
2500|$|Adult green lacewings are a {{pale green}} colour with long, threadlike {{antennae}} and glossy, golden, compound eyes. They have a delicate appearance and are from twelve to twenty millimetres long with large, membranous, pale green wings which they fold tent-wise above their abdomens. They are weak fliers {{and have a}} fluttery form of flight. They are often seen during the evenings and at night when they are attracted by lights. The high green sensitivity of the superposition eyes allows the green lacewings to recognize fresh green leaves that they use to find <b>honey</b> <b>dew</b> produced by aphids, a site for egglaying and a resting place.|$|E

Supporting long, floating hair, a dagger-like mustache, over-size earrings, a colorful headgear, an amulet {{and a string}} of beads around his neck, he fits into Coleridge's description of a poet - an inspired being with [...] "flashing eyes and floating hair", who [...] "on <b>honey</b> - <b>dew</b> hath fed/ And drunk the milk of Paradise [...] ". Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi, his poet friend and former class fellow, recalled that the only time Meeraji trimmed his long hair, was when he joined All India Radio, New Delhi.|$|R

Long after the little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath <b>honey</b> before the <b>dew</b> was dried--when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I looked round me.|$|R

Eva watched them at their pretty play, as they flew about or lay fanning themselves and drinking from the red-brimmed cups on the rocks. Wild strawberries grew in the grass close by, and Eva threw some of the ripest to the fairy folk; for <b>honey</b> and <b>dew</b> seemed a poor sort of lunch to the child. Then the elves saw her, and nodded and smiled and called, but their soft voices could not reach her. So, after whispering among themselves, two of them flew to the brookside, and perching on a buttercup said close to Eva's ear,-- ...|$|R

60|$|The Honourable Hilary grunted, and {{continued}} to regard his son. Then he cut a piece of <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Honourable Hilary did {{not respond}} to his son's humour, but shifted the <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew</b> to the left cheek.|$|E
6000|$|Nearer and {{nearer the}} bright form came, [...] And fairer the {{blossoms}} grew; [...] Each welcomed him, in her sweetest tones; [...] Each offered her <b>honey</b> and <b>dew.</b> [...] But in vain did they beckon, and smile, and call, [...] And wider their leaves unclose; [...] The glittering form still floated on, [...] By Violet, Daisy, and Rose. [...] Lightly it {{flew to the}} pleasant home [...] Of the flower most truly fair, [...] On Clover's breast he softly lit, [...] And folded his bright wings there. [...] "Dear flower," [...] the butterfly whispered low, [...] "Long hast thou waited for me; [...] Now I am come, and my grateful love [...] Shall brighten thy home for thee; [...] Thou hast loved and cared for me, when alone, [...] Hast watched o'er me long and well; [...] And now will I strive to show the thanks [...] The poor worm could not tell. [...] Sunbeam and breeze shall come to thee, [...] And the coolest dews that fall; [...] Whate'er a flower can wish is thine, [...] For thou art worthy all. [...] And the home thou shared with the friendless worm [...] The butterfly's home shall be; [...] And thou shalt find, dear, faithful flower, [...] A loving friend in me." [...] Then, through the long, bright summer hours [...] Through sunshine and through shower, [...] Together in their happy home [...] Dwelt butterfly and flower.|$|R
6000|$|Then had {{the earth}} beneath me yawning given [...] Sign of convulsion; and tho' horrid rifts [...] Sent up the moaning of unhappy spirits [...] Imprison'd in her centre, {{with the heat}} [...] Of their infolding element; had the angels, [...] The watchers at heaven's gate, push'd them apart, [...] And from the golden {{threshold}} had down-roll'd [...] Their heaviest thunder, I had lain as still, [...] And blind and motionless as then I lay! [...] White as quench'd ashes, cold as were the hopes [...] Of my lorn love! What happy air shall woo [...] The wither'd leaf fall'n in the woods, or blasted [...] Upon this bough? a lightning stroke had come [...] Even from that Heaven in whose light I bloom'd [...] And taken away the greenness of my life, [...] The blossom and the fragrance. Who was cursed [...] But I? who miserable but I? even Misery [...] Forgot herself in that extreme distress, [...] And with the overdoing of her part [...] Did fall away into oblivion. [...] The night in pity took away my day [...] Because my grief as yet was newly born, [...] Of too weak eyes to look upon the light, [...] And with the hasty notice of the ear, [...] Frail life was startled from the tender love [...] Of him she brooded over. Would I had lain [...] Until the pleached ivy tress had wound [...] Round my worn limbs, and the wild briar had driven [...] Its knotted thorns thro' my unpaining brows [...] Leaning its roses on my faded eyes. [...] The wind had blown above me, and the rain [...] Had fall'n upon me, and the gilded snake [...] Had nestled in this bosomthrone of love, [...] But I had been at rest for evermore. [...] Long time entrancement held me: all too soon, [...] Life (like a wanton too-officious friend [...] Who will not hear denial, vain and rude [...] With proffer of unwished for services) [...] Entering all the avenues of sense, [...] Pass'd thro' into his citadel, the brain [...] With hated warmth of apprehensiveness: [...] And first the chillness of the mountain stream [...] Smote on my brow, and then I seem'd to hear [...] Its murmur, as the drowning seaman hears, [...] Who with his head below the surface dropt, [...] Listens the dreadful murmur indistinct [...] Of the confused seas, and knoweth not [...] Beyond the sound he lists: and then came in [...] O'erhead the white light of the weary moon, [...] Diffused and molten into flaky cloud. [...] Was my sight drunk, that it did shape to me [...] Him who should own that name? or had my fancy [...] So lethargised discernment in the sense, [...] That she did act the step-dame to mine eyes, [...] Warping their nature, till they minister'd [...] Unto her swift conceits? 'Twere better thus [...] If so be that {{the memory of that}} sound [...] With mighty evocation, had updrawn [...] The fashion and the phantasm of the form [...] It should attach to. There was no such thing.-- [...] It was the man she loved, even Lionel, [...] The lover Lionel, the happy Lionel, [...] All joy; who drew the happy atmosphere [...] Of my unhappy sighs, fed with my tears, [...] To him the <b>honey</b> <b>dews</b> of orient hope. [...] Oh! rather had some loathly ghastful brow, [...] Half-bursten from the shroud, in cere cloth bound, [...] The dead skin withering on the fretted bone, [...] The very spirit of Paleness made still paler [...] By the shuddering moonlight, fix'd his eyes on mine [...] Horrible with the anger and the heat [...] Of the remorseful soul alive within, [...] And damn'd unto his loathed tenement. [...] Methinks I could have sooner met that gaze! [...] Oh, how her choice did leap forth from his eyes! [...] Oh, how her love did clothe itself in smiles [...] About his lips! This was the very arch-mock [...] And insolence of uncontrolled Fate, [...] When the effect weigh'd seas upon my head [...] To twit me with the cause. [...] Why how was this? [...] Could he not walk what paths he chose, nor breathe [...] What airs he pleased! Was not the wide world free, [...] With all her interchange of hill and plain [...] To him as well as me? I know not, faith: [...] But Misery, like a fretful, wayward child, [...] Refused to look his author in the face, [...] Must he come my way too? Was not the South, [...] The East, the West, all open, if he had fall'n [...] In love in twilight? Why should he come my way, [...] Robed in those robes of light I must not wear, [...] With that great crown of beams about his brows? [...] Come like an angel to a damned soul? [...] To tell him of the bliss he had with God; [...] Come like a careless and a greedy heir, [...] That scarce can wait the reading of the will [...] Before he takes possession? Was mine a mood [...] To be invaded rudely, and not rather [...] A sacred, secret, unapproached woe [...] Unspeakable? I was shut up with grief; [...] She took the body of my past delight, [...] Narded, and swathed and balm'd it for herself, [...] And laid it in a new-hewn sepulchre, [...] Where man had never lain. I was led mute [...] Into her temple like a sacrifice; [...] I was the high-priest in her holiest place, [...] Not to be loudly broken in upon. [...] Oh! friend, thoughts deep and heavy as these well-nigh [...] O'erbore the limits of my brain; but he [...] Bent o'er me, and my neck his arm upstay'd [...] From earth. I thought it was an adder's fold, [...] And once I strove to disengage myself, [...] But fail'd, I was so feeble. She was there too: [...] She bent above me too: her cheek was pale, [...] Oh! very fair and pale: rare pity had stolen [...] The living bloom away, as tho' a red rose [...] Should change into a white one suddenly. [...] Her eyes, I saw, were full of tears in the morn, [...] And some few drops of that distressful rain [...] Being wafted on the wind, drove in my sight, [...] And being there they did break forth afresh [...] In a new birth, immingled with my own, [...] And still bewept my grief. Keeping unchanged [...] The purport of their coinage. Her long ringlets, [...] Drooping and beaten with the plaining wind, [...] Did brush my forehead in their to-and-fro: [...] For in the sudden anguish of her heart [...] Loosed from their simple thrall they had flowed abroad, [...] And onward floating in a full, dark wave, [...] Parted on either side her argent neck, [...] Mantling her form half way. She, when I woke, [...] After my refluent health made tender quest [...] Unanswer'd, for I spoke not: for the sound [...] Of that dear voice so musically low, [...] And now first heard with any sense of pain, [...] As it had taken life away before, [...] Choked all the syllables that in my throat [...] Strove to uprise, laden with mournful thanks, [...] From my full heart: and ever since that hour, [...] My voice hath somewhat falter'd--and what wonder [...] That when hope died, part of her eloquence [...] Died with her? He, the blissful lover, too, [...] From his great hoard of happiness distill'd [...] Some drops of solace; like a vain rich man, [...] That, having always prosper'd in the world, [...] Folding his hands deals comfortable words [...] To hearts wounded for ever; yet, in truth, [...] Fair speech was his and delicate of phrase, [...] Falling in whispers on the sense, address'd [...] More to the inward than the outward ear, [...] As rain of the midsummer midnight soft [...] Scarce-heard, recalling fragrance and the green [...] Of the dead spring--such as in other minds [...] Had film'd the margents of the recent wound. [...] And why was I to darken their pure love, [...] If, as I knew, they two did love each other, [...] Because my own was darken'd? Why was I [...] To stand within the level of their hopes, [...] Because my hope was widow'd, like the cur [...] In the child's adage? Did I love Camilla? [...] Ye know that I did love her: to this present [...] My full-orb'd love hath waned not. Did I love her, [...] And could I look upon her tearful eyes? [...] Tears wept for me; for me--weep at my grief? [...] What had she done to weep--let my heart [...] Break rather--whom the gentlest airs of heaven [...] Should kiss with an unwonted gentleness. [...] Her love did murder mine; what then? she deem'd [...] I wore a brother's mind: she call'd me brother: [...] She told me all her love: she shall not weep.|$|R

60|$|The Honourable Hilary {{looked at}} Mr. Flint, and sat down. He began {{to cut a}} piece of <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew,</b> but his hand shook. It was difficult, as we know, for him to give {{expression}} to his feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess Botcher and Bascom {{know their}} business," [...] said Mr. Vane. If Mr. Flint {{had been a}} less {{concentrated}} man, he might have observed that the Honourable Hilary had not cut a piece of <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew</b> this afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vane {{glanced at}} Mr. Flint, {{and his eyes}} twinkled. Victoria, who had long ago {{discovered}} {{the secret of the}} <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew,</b> knew that he was rolling it under his tongue and thinking her father a fool for his indulgence.|$|E

60|$|He ate his supper to-night {{with his}} usual appetite, which had always been sparing; {{and he would have}} eaten the same amount if the Northeastern Railroads had been going into the hands of a {{receiver}} the next day. Often he did not exchange a word with Euphrasia between home-coming and bed-going, and this was apparently to be one of these occasions. After supper he went, as usual, to sit on the steps of his porch, and to cut his piece of <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew,</b> which never varied a milligram.

60|$|It {{is perhaps}} {{gratuitous}} {{to add that}} the Honourable Hilary Vane {{was a man of}} convictions. In politics he would have told you--with some vehemence, if you seemed to doubt--that he was a Republican. Treason to party he regarded with a deep-seated abhorrence, as an act for which a man should be justly outlawed. If he were in a mellow mood, with the right quantity of <b>Honey</b> <b>Dew</b> tobacco under his tongue, he would perhaps tell you why he was a Republican, if he thought you worthy of his confidence. He believed in the gold standard, for one thing; in the tariff (left unimpaired in its glory) for another, and with a wave of his hand would indicate the prosperity of the nation which surrounded him,--a prosperity too sacred to tamper with.|$|E

[...] But there are no guerrillas now, no condottieri who can be hired: the empire has a paid and standing army, as an empire should.

And as the meteor's midnight flame Startles the dreamer, sun-like truth Flashed on his visionary youth, And filled him, not with love, but faith, [...] 620 And hope, and courage mute in death; For love {{and life in}} him were twins, Born at one birth: in every other First life then love its course begins, Though they be {{children}} of one mother; [...] 625 And so through this dark world they fleet Divided, till in death they meet; But he loved all things ever. Then He passed amid the strife of men, And stood at the throne of armed power [...] 630 Pleading for a world of woe: Secure as one on a rock-built tower O'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro, 'Mid the passions wild of human kind He stood, like a spirit calming them; [...] 635 For, it was said, his words could bind Like music the lulled crowd, and stem That torrent of unquiet dream Which mortals truth and reason deem, But is revenge and fear and pride. [...] 640 Joyous he was; and hope and peace On all who heard him did abide, Raining like dew from his sweet talk, As where the evening star may walk Along the brink of the gloomy seas, [...] 645 Liquid mists of splendour quiver. His very gestures touched to tears The unpersuaded tyrant, never So moved before: his presence stung The torturers with their victim's pain, [...] 650 And none knew how; and through their ears The subtle witchcraft of his tongue Unlocked the hearts of those who keep Gold, the world's bond of slavery. Men wondered, and some sneered to see [...] 655 One sow what he could never reap: For he is rich, they said, and young, And might drink {{from the depths of}} luxury. If he seeks Fame, Fame never crowned The champion of a trampled creed: [...] 660 If he seeks Power, Power is enthroned 'Mid ancient rights and wrongs, to feed Which hungry wolves with praise and spoil, Those who would sit near Power must toil; And such, there sitting, all may see. [...] 665 What seeks he? All that others seek He casts away, like a vile weed Which the sea casts unreturningly. That poor and hungry men should break The laws which wreak them toil and scorn, [...] 670 We understand; but Lionel We know, is rich and nobly born. So wondered they: yet all men loved Young Lionel, though few approved; All but the priests, whose hatred fell [...] 675 Like the unseen blight of a smiling day, The withering <b>honey</b> <b>dew,</b> which clings Under the bright green buds of May, Whilst they unfold their emerald wings: For he made verses wild and queer [...] 680 On the strange creeds priests hold so dear, Because they bring them land and gold. Of devils and saints and all such gear, He made tales which whoso heard or read Would laugh till he were almost dead. [...] 685 So this grew a proverb: 'Don't get old Till Lionel's [...] "Banquet in Hell" [...] you hear, And then you will laugh yourself young again.' So the priests hated him, and he Repaid their hate with cheerful glee. [...] 690 ...|$|E
