30|$|A common pitfall is the {{presence}} of a bulky <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> arising from the vaginal portion of the cervix. In this situation, disruption of the cervical stromal ring does not necessarily indicate parametrial invasion because the tumour may still be separated from the parametrium by the vaginal fornix (Fig.  12).|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} clinical factors {{predictive of}} visual outcomes in Group D retinoblastoma eyes. Methods Retrospective chart review {{of patients with}} Group D retinoblastoma from January 2000 to December 2009. All patients were treated with systemic chemoreduction and external beam radiation as salvage therapy when indicated. Primary outcome measure was visual acuity. Clinical factors evaluated include quadrants of subretinal fluid, extent of vitreous seeding, involvement of more/less than 50 % of the macula, endophytic/ <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> classification, and presence of tumour behind the lens at diagnosis. Results Fifty-two Group D eyes of 41 patients were included; 10 eyes with visual acuity better than 20 / 80, 3...|$|E
40|$|Dose-response curves {{have been}} {{computed}} for 5 tumour {{sites of the}} head and neck region, using 2 regression models. In agreement with clinical observation, a significant increase has been found from moderate to high control rates with modest dose increases for <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumours</b> (T 1 + T 2 retromolar trigone-anterior faucial pillar and T 2 + T 3 supraglottic larynx). Further significant increases in local control after modest dose increases are not obtained when the control rate is already high and the slope of the dose-response curve consequently diminished. Despite unsatisfactory (50 %) control rates for large heterogeneous tumours (T 3 + T 4 pharyngeal walls), further increases cannot be obtained without excessive doses because the curve flattens at the 50 % control rate level...|$|R
30|$|BPA {{expands the}} {{brainstem}} and is {{typically associated with}} an exophytic growth, usually from its dorsal surface [20, 31]. It is characterised by sharp margins with cyst-like areas. The dorsal extension {{is a result of}} the inability of the low-grade tumour to infiltrate caudally below the decussations of the corticospinal tracts and medial lemnisci at the craniocervical junction. Therefore, dorsally <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumours</b> should be considered focal BSTs. However, ventral exophytic PAs have also been observed. Diffusely infiltrative brainstem gliomas are usually fibrillary astrocytomas located in the ventral pons, which present with abducens palsy, often engulf the basilar artery, and are associated with a grim prognosis [32]. Symptoms and signs are usually related to increased intracranial pressure. Nausea, vomiting, and ataxia with evidence of torticollis, papilledema, and nystagmus palsies of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves are usually observed at physical examination.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePapillomatous pedunculated sebaceous naevus (PPSN) {{has been}} {{described}} as a subtype of sebaceous naevus (SN), typically affecting the scalp and face. In contrast with Schimmelpenning syndrome, no cerebral, ocular or skeletal anomalies have hitherto been reported. We report two unrelated fetuses with PPSN, one with large pink <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumours,</b> the other with minor features but similar microscopic findings. We performed whole-exome sequencing in affected skin tissue from fetus 1, which identified a postzygotic de novo FGFR 2 c. 1144 T>C (p. Cys 382 Arg) mutation in 34 [middle dot] 6 % of reads which was absent in the parents' blood. Targeted deep sequencing of FGFR 2 confirmed its mosaic status in additional affected skin from fetus 1, and identified the same substitution in 26 % of reads in affected skin from fetus 2. FGFR 2 p. Cys 382 Arg is a known somatic driver mutation in human cancer, previously reported to result in activation of RAS signalling. A similar paralogous missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of FGFR 3 (p. Gly 380 Arg) has been reported in keratinocytic epidermal naevi. Our findings define a distinct clinical and molecular subgroup of SN, beside HRAS or KRAS-related SN, and expand the spectrum of mosaic skin conditions associated with receptor tyrosine kinase mutations. ...|$|R
40|$|Extracorporeal ′work bench surgery′ with {{subsequent}} autotransplantation {{is a challenge}} from both anaesthetic and surgical point of view when performed bilaterally or in a solitary kidney. A 28 -year-old female with bilateral giant angiomyolipoma of kidneys was taken up for renal autotransplantation. Patient had a huge tumour, which was the largest reported <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> to be excised by this technique. Both kidneys were operated at an interval of 1 month, under combined general and epidural anaesthesia. Anaesthetic challenges faced during the procedure were maintenance of adequate perfusion of the grafted kidneys, containment of massive blood loss and coagulopathy during the perioperative period. Patient recovered in due course with functioning autotransplanted kidney. A careful pre-operative preparation with intraoperative maintenance of adequate blood volume and blood pressure is the key for graft survival...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 49 -year-old man who {{presented}} with an enlarging mass over his occipital scalp. The clinical impression was either a squamous cell carcinoma or an unusual adnexal tumour. A wide excision was performed with skin grafting. Gross examination revealed a large <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> mass measuring 10 cm. Histopathological examination showed a circumscribed, well-differentiated squamoproliferative lesion with a lobulated architecture. Clear cell features, pilar-type keratinisation, microcalcifications and the presence of mucinous degeneration were noted. A diagnosis of proliferating tricholemmal tumour was made. This entity incorporates a spectrum of lesions, ranging from the mostly benign proliferating tricholemmal cyst to tumours having more atypical cellular and invasive features, the latter features correlating with an increased capacity for aggressive behaviour. Management-wise, such tumours require complete excision with follow-up. As the tumours are often large in size at presentation, reconstruction is required...|$|E
40|$|Malignant eccrine spiradenomas are {{exceedingly}} rare tumours. They are aggressive tumours normally arising in long-standing benign eccrine spiradenomas. We {{present a}} case of malignant eccrine spiradenoma of {{the right side of}} the face with direct intracranial extension without distant metastasis. A 48 years old woman presented with a large <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> on the right side of her face. Radiological imaging of the head and neck region revealed extensive invasion of the facial tissues around right orbit, maxilla and extension into the middle cranial fossa involving the right temporal lobe. She underwent craniotomy and debulking of the right temporal lobe and biopsy of the facial tumour. Histopathological findings were consistent with malignant eccrine spiradenoma. This is a rare case of facial malignant eccrine spiradenoma with direct intracranial extension with no distant metastasis. A literature search revealed that it is first case to be reported of this kind...|$|E

Endosonography revealed an <b>exophytic</b> gastric <b>tumour.</b> Partial gastrectomy with enteroanastomosis (Billroth II) was performed. Histological and immunohistological examination revealed a malignant epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), which is a neoplasm rarely reported in the literature. Two years later the patient showed no signs of tumour recurrence or metastatic dissemination and his dyspeptic complaints disappeared. He was regarded as a potentially healed patient.

40|$|International audienceIn case of {{a single}} renal cell {{carcinoma}} strictly located in the kidney, the radical nephrectomy remains the treatment of choice. However, {{it has been estimated}} that nearly 30 to 40 % of renal cell carcinoma are about to recur after primitive surgery. In certain cases, conservative surgery can be discussed as an alternative to radical treatment, especially in case of <b>exophytic</b> renal <b>tumour</b> or less than 4 cm in diameter. New ablative techniques (radiofrequency and cryoablation) have shown promising results but the follow-up is still very limited. French national recommendation regarding kidney cancer have been updated in 2007 and following the development of clinical trials using antiangiogenic agents. Regarding the use of antiangiogenic agents, several points have to be taken into account: existence of renal cell carcinoma, presence of metastasis, number of metastasis, location and risk factor prognosis determination...|$|R
40|$|Brain tumours {{form the}} most common type of solid tumour in {{children}} and more that 50 % of these are infratentorial. Cerebellar astrocytomas and brain stem gliomas are the commonest posterior fossa glial tumours in children. Cerebellar astrocytomas represent up to 10 % of all primary brain tumours and up to 25 % of posterior fossa tumors in children, with Low grade gliomas forming the commonest of the cerebellar gliomas. They commonly present with symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure due to obstructive hydrocephalus. Radiologically they may be solid or cystic with or without a mural nodule. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment and forms the most consistent factor influencing progression free and long term survival. While majority of the tumours are pilocytic astrocytomas, they may also be fibrillary astrocytomas or even high grade tumours. Tumour histology does not appear to be an independent factor in the prognosis of these children, and therefore no palliative treatment after surgery is advocated. Brain stem gliomas account for approximately 10 % of all pediatric brain tumours. Cranial nerve signs, ataxia and cerebellar signs with or without symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure are classically described symptoms and signs. Radiographic findings and clinical correlates can be used to categorize brain stem tumours into four types: diffuse, focal, exophytic and cervicomedullary. Histologically most brain stem gliomas are fibrillary astrocytomas. Diffuse brain stem gliomas are {{the most common}}ly seen tumour in the brain stem. These lesions are malignant high grade fibrillary astrocytomas. Focal tumours of the brain stem are demarcated lesions generally less than 2 cms in size, without associated edema. Most commonly seen in the midbrain or medulla, they form a heterogeneous pathological group, showing indolent growth except when the lesion is a PNET. Dorsally <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumours</b> lie in the fourth ventricle, while cervicomedullary lesions are similar to spinal intramedullary tumours. Expanding lesions are the only lesions amenable for excision while infiltrative and ventral lesions are not...|$|R
40|$|Eyelid sebaceous {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} tumour {{with slow}} growth {{and it is one}} of the most aggressive malignancies of the eyelid. Death rate can reach 6 %. The diagnosis is often delayed because it is confused with other periocular lesions. The authors describe a case with atypical presentation, regarding rapid growth rate and exophytic aspect. Female, 78 &emsp 14;years, presenting lower eyelid tumour with 4 &emsp 14;months of evolution. Ophthalmological examination showed a tarsal <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> (22 mm), non-adherent to bulbar conjunctiva. She was medicated topically for 3 months, with the diagnosis of chalazio. Total excision was performed for histological diagnosis. After diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma with specific immunohistochemical markers, and without free tumour surgical limits, a second surgery was performed with a pentagon entire thickness excision. Being a rare tumour but with a considerable morbidity and mortality; early diagnosis and treatment is essential for a good prognosis and preservation of visual function...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lentigo {{malignant}} melanoma is a melanoma subtype of chronic sun-damaged skin in elderly Caucasians. Amelanotic variants of lentigo malignant are extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: This {{is a case}} report of an 80 -year-old male patient who presented with a non-pigmented <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> of his bald head. After complete surgical excision under the suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, three-dimensional histologic examination confirmed an amelanotic lentigo {{malignant melanoma}} with a tumour thickness of 1. 76 mm, resected R 0. Five years later he developed the first relapse, the other year a satellite metastasis was surgically removed. One year later, this patient had developed a large relapsing lentigo malignant melanoma with skull roof invasion. There {{was no evidence of}} distant metastatic spread. Amelanotic lentigo malignant melanoma is a very rare tumour. CONCLUSIONS: Serial excision or slow Mohs and Mohs micrographic surgery are the treatments of choice especially {{in the head and neck}} area. These tumours may be locally very aggressive as it is shown by skull invasion in the present case...|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours (GIST) are mesenchymal tumours with {{uncertain}} prognosis. Malignant variety {{represents about}} 2. 0 % of malignant gastroenteric tumours. The Authors report a clinical case of malignant gastric and duodenojejunal GIST, {{in which the}} only surgical treatment seems to be definitive. R. S., a 69 -year-old female, was admitted for asthenia and fever in January 1997. Endoscopic exploration, ultrasonography and CT-scan of the abdomen demonstrated an <b>exophytic</b> <b>tumour</b> in the greater gastric curvature and one tumour of 5. 5 cm of diameter in the Treitz's angle. We performed a resection of the gastric tumour and the duodenojejunal angle. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 14 postoperative hospital days. Histological analysis showed two spindle cells stromal tumours with mitotic rate > 20 / 10 HPF. The immunohistochemistry demonstrated the uncommitted origin of tumour cells. The patient refused the chemotherapy treatment. There was no local recurrence or metastasis at a follow up of 47 months, in spite the high malignancy degree. For this reason {{and because of the}} uncertain behaviour of benign GIST, the authors propose a lifelong follow up of the patients managed with potentially curative surgical resection...|$|E
40|$|Laser photodestruction of {{colorectal}} polyps {{and cancer}} applies {{almost exclusively to}} neoplastic lesions. The best results are obtained in <b>exophytic,</b> noninfiltrative, noncircumferential <b>tumours.</b> Neodymium YAG (Nd:YAG) laser is the usual source, and sessions may be repeated at intervals of three to four days during tumour reduction, and at intervals of four to 12 weeks during maintenance therapy. Hemorrhage is a frequent but not severe complication; perforation is the potentially more severe complication. With experience, laser treatment complications decrease to less than 1 %. The most common indication of laser phorodestruction concerns destruction of colorectal adenomas. Most indications in malignant adenomas are restricted to the rectum...|$|R
40|$|Primary signet-ring cell {{carcinoma}} is {{a variant of}} adenocarcinoma which is extremely rare, associated with poor prognosis and generally found to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We report a case of primary signet-ring {{cell carcinoma}} of the bladder which was successfully treated with partial cystectomy. A 71 -year-old female {{with a history of}} type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease presented with painless haematuria for 2 months’ duration. The abdominal ultrasonography showed a localised polypoidal vesical growth arising from the bladder dome. Cystoscopy revealed an <b>exophytic</b> solid <b>tumour</b> in the anterior fundal wall. A deep transurethral resection of bladder tumour was done and histology revealed an adenocarcinoma composed of mucinous and signet-ring cell components. Later, considering the patient’s age and the poor general condition, a partial cystectomy was done. Follow-up cystoscopy and ultrasonography were done at 12 months and {{there was no evidence of}} tumour recurrence and the patient is currently symptom-free. Partial cystectomy may be considered in patients with localised tumour without evidence of metastasis and poor general condition. Regular cystoscopies and ultrasound imaging are necessary for follow-up and early identification of recurrences...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is an {{uncommon}} and controversial skin lesion, sharing features of both {{basal cell carcinoma}} (BCC) and trichoepithelioma. In this article, we present a case of FeP and synthesise current concepts on the etiopathogenesis, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this uncommon tumour. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an 88 -year-old male patient presenting to the dermatology clinic for a sharply demarcated, pink, <b>exophytic</b> cutaneous <b>tumour</b> situated in the left inguinal region. The histopathological examination performed after complete surgical excision of the lesion revealed a diagnosis of FeP. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. The terms `fibroepithelioma` and `Pinkus` have been searched in bibliographical databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, without time limitation up to February 15 th, 2017. Seventy-nine articles that fulfilled all the required conditions were identified. Relevant citations and additional articles identified from references have been assessed. The systematic review included a total number of 452 cases of FeP. CONCLUSION: Even though FeP is considered a relatively rare tumour, its true incidence rate might be higher than previously believed.   The clinical aspects of the lesion described in this paper and its location in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen are classic features of FeP. Histopathologic examination revealed features of both BCC and trichoepithelioma. Further epidemiological studies are required to clarify whether patients with FEP should be screened for the occurrence of other malignancies...|$|R
