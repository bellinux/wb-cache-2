500|$|Out of parliament, on 26 April 1913 Lansbury {{addressed}} a WSPU rally at the Albert Hall, and openly defended violent methods: [...] "Let them burn and destroy property and <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> will, {{and for every}} leader that is taken away, let a dozen step forward in their place". For this, Lansbury was charged with incitement, convicted and, after the dismissal of an appeal, sentenced to three months' imprisonment. He immediately went on [...] hunger strike, and was released after four days; although liable to rearrest under [...] the so-called [...] "Cat and Mouse Act", he was thereafter left at liberty. In the autumn of 1913, {{at the invitation of}} [...] Fels, Lansbury and his wife travelled to America and Canada for an extended holiday. On his return, he devoted his main efforts to the recently founded newspaper, the Daily Herald.|$|E
500|$|The first [...] "all-star" [...] {{game was}} played as a benefit for Joss's family on July 24, 1911. The Naps invited players from the other seven American League teams to play against them. Visiting club players who were {{involved}} in the game included Home Run Baker, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Sam Crawford, Walter Johnson, Tris Speaker, Gabby Street, and Smokey Joe Wood. [...] "I'll <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> want for Addie Joss' family", Johnson said. Washington Senators manager Jimmy McAleer volunteered to manage the all-stars. [...] "The memory of Addie Joss is sacred to everyone with whom he ever came in contact. The man never wore a uniform who was a greater credit to the sport than he", McAleer said. The game was attended by approximately 15,270 fans and raised nearly $13,000 ($ today) to help Joss' family members pay remaining medical bills. The Naps lost 5–3.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's acting style {{consisted}} of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: [...] "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> feel not to be consonant with their own characters." [...] Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among [...] "the greatest actors" [...] because {{of his ability to}} deliver great performances [...] "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply [...] "playing himself".|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{was born}} on November 30, 1964 in Des Moines, Iowa. She is the {{youngest}} of five children of former race car driver Richard [...] "Lefty" [...] Robinson, an amateur diesel truck racer who worked on cars in his home garage and promoted races in the Midwestern United States, and his wife Lois who competed in auto racing before she flipped a car, and was asked by Lefty to stop racing. She {{grew up in a}} poor family. Lefty and Lois were also known for innovative ways of entertaining crowds at stock car races which garnered national recognition. Robinson was inspired by race car drivers A. J. Foyt, Sammy Swindell, and Steve Kinser in her teenage years, and found inspiration in woman driver Janet Guthrie by her early twenties, as she had more interest in NASCAR than open-wheel racing. She and her siblings were taught that they were allowed to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> wished and drove minibikes, motorcycles, and snowmobiles.|$|E
500|$|Project Chanology was {{formulated}} by {{users of the}} English-speaking imageboards 711chan.org and 4chan, the associated partyvan.info wiki, and several Internet Relay Chat channels, {{all part of a}} group collectively known as Anonymous, on January 16, 2008 after the Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube for hosting material from the Cruise video. The effort against Scientology has also been referred to by group members as [...] "Operation Chanology". A webpage called [...] "Project Chanology", part of a larger wiki, is maintained by Anonymous and chronicles planned, ongoing and completed actions by project participants. The website includes a list of suggested guerrilla tactics to use against the Church of Scientology. Members use other websites as well to coordinate action, including Encyclopedia Dramatica and the social networking site Facebook, where two groups associated with the movement had 3,500 members as of February 4, 2008. A member of Anonymous told the Los Angeles Times that, as of February 4, 2008, the group consisted of [...] "a loose confederation of about 9,000 people" [...] who post anonymously on the Internet. A security analyst told The Age that the number of people participating anonymously in Project Chanology could number in the thousands: [...] "You can't pin it on a person or a group of people. You've thousands of people engaged to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> can against Scientology." ...|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Monique Steele, Kim Possible is [...] "all {{about how}} girls kick butt"; Kim {{constantly}} rescues Ron, saving him from peril {{on numerous occasions}} throughout the series. Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to be making the world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's tired or sad or sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that you could be traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E

These people were turning their {{heads back to}} see what was happening and when they saw these men had guns in their hands they put their hands up. It looked like the man was protecting the girl because he stood in front of her, but there was no chance. I mean they went to the floor immediately, they dropped.' ...|$|E

We see only the oppressive side of authority. Maybe it comes out of our history and our background. What we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do. [...] You have free speech so I can be heard."

In October of the same year, during the 20-year anniversary party for Cathouse Club, in Hollywood, Phil Lewis joined Tracii Guns' L.A. Guns onstage, after being invited by singer Paul Black, for a duet of [...] "Rip and Tear." [...] Despite Black's hopes that this would [...] "relieve the tension between the two line-ups", Lewis would later state that [...] "Tracii [...] as good as he is, has had to pretty much lower himself to playing with these guys that {{if they were going to}} <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> would have done it in the past twenty years, but they have done nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 4, 1962, a Special Group on Operation Mongoose met {{to discuss}} proceedings. The Attorney General, Mr. Johnson, and General Lansdale were there amongst others. While they {{discussed}} some self-interests in acquiring Cuban waters for mining rights, planning military contingency plans, and attacking Guantanamo, these beliefs and ideas were {{not shared by}} all participants. By {{the end of the}} meeting they determined four main objectives. (1) They needed more intelligence on Cuba to determine how to proceed. This would likely involve further probes by the CIA into Cuba. (2) They needed {{to increase the amount of}} sabotage their agents were involved in. The line [...] "there should be considerably more sabotage" [...] is underlined. (3) That regulations and restrictions needed to be realized so that the CIA as an agency and their operation agents could take some shortcuts in training and preparations. (4) That the CIA would <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> could to dispose of Castro and stop the spread of communism into the Western Hemisphere. The 4th point reads: [...] "All efforts should be made to develop new and imaginative approaches to the possibility of getting rid of the Castro regime." ...|$|E
2500|$|Victor Entertainment {{contacted}} Shōnen Gahōsha about adapting Excel Saga into an anime, and the {{two companies}} approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was [...] "conveyed just as words", and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the [...] "swirling, talking cosmos". He also increased Pedro's role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that [...] "Pedro's situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan". The anime production staff was given the freedom to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> wanted {{as long as they}} kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga. The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto. Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen {{to play the role of}} Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi's rapid delivery of her lines, saying that [...] "she really pushed herself to the limit and beyond". He also says, [...] "at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match the lip-synch". In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib. At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting [...] "amazing" [...] and was pleased to hear his favourite voice actors read lines from his work.|$|E
