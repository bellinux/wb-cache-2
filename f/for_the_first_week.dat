5|$|Newly hatched chicks {{are covered}} with whitish down, and are blind and largely {{helpless}} (nidicolous). Their eyes begin to open on day 6 and are fully open by day 15. The juvenile feathers begin growing through the down from days 7 to 10, covering the baby owls by two weeks of age. Their mother broods them continuously <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week,</b> then in the day only until the third week. Her partner brings food to the nest, which she tears into pieces before feeding the nestlings. The young vomit up pellets and defecate in the nest, which becomes quite smelly. They leave the nest five to six weeks after hatching, by which time they are fully feathered, with downy head and underparts and short tails. The tail reaches its adult length by 65 to 70 days. Young boobooks lose the remainder of their downy feathers by around five months of age.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Sudal {{originally}} {{formed on}} April2, 2004, {{out of a}} persistent area of convection east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week</b> of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical storm status on April5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119km/h (74mph) and {{is the equivalent of}} a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April9, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240km/h (150mph). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an extratropical cyclone on April16 and dissipating two days later.|$|E

5|$|Task Group 38.2 {{remained}} off {{the eastern}} coast of Luzon <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week</b> of November providing continued support to U.S. Army forces at Leyte. On November 5–6, 1944, Air Group 18 flew sorties against airfields and shipping on southern Luzon. Fighters participated in strafing runs {{far more often}} than they engaged in aerial combat. Out {{of a total of}} 194 sorties flown by the air group over these two days, two airborne aircraft were destroyed compared with fifty-five on the ground. By this time Japan was reeling from the effects of Operation Cartwheel, which had deprived it of fuel needed to get planes off the ground; its air force was short on experienced and even freshly-trained pilots, who were lost in huge numbers in conflicts like the Battle of the Philippine Sea; and finally, it lacked an effective seagoing navy since the back of the IJN had been broken at the Battle of Leyte Gulf the previous month. These factors, in tandem with a week spent refueling, rearming and re-provisioning at Ulithi between November 7 and 14, limited opportunities for Harris to further run up his score.|$|E
