5|$|Savaric died at Civitavecchia or Siena on 8 August 1205 {{while visiting}} the papacy in Rome on {{business}} for Peter des Roches, Bishop-elect of Winchester. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> support Roches election {{which had been}} contested. Roches also supported Savaric in his struggles with Glastonbury, loaning the bishop money and being appointed to a papal commission to deal with Savaric's petitions, which went nowhere because Savaric died before the commission first met. He was buried at Bath.|$|E
5|$|Gay activists, newly {{alarmed at}} {{the threat to}} their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after the}} announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> address the subject pertaining to Latin America. When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E

Seizing the {{opportunity}} to kill Dexter, Saxon grabs the pen and slams it into Dexter's left shoulder. Dexter pulls the pen out and plunges it into Saxon's jugular vein, killing him. Dexter claims self-defense, which Batista and Quinn appear to accept, although {{it is suggested that}} they know what really happened.|$|R

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of Engine 819's {{new home in}} 1965, Mayor Austin Franks shared {{one of the two}} keys to the gate with long-time railfan James Norris. Norris' father had taken the locomotive out for her first run in 1943 and young James always remembered his late-father when he saw the engine. Despite being in his late 50s and in failing health, James Norris faithfully visited the locomotive every week to knock off the bird nests and occasionally replace some broken glass in the cab. He would open the gate on Sundays while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> let kids climb on the locomotive, ring the bell and answer their many questions.|$|E

Below, a chorus of backing performers joined in and many began to embrace Jackson upon his descent.|$|E
500|$|The {{people of}} Falmouth had mixed {{reactions}} {{to the presence of}} the British fleet. [...] Some recognized the Canceaux and believed there was no danger; but militia members remembering Thompson's War were more suspicious. [...] The next day was windless: Mowat kedged the ships into the inner harbor and anchored them near the town. [...] He sent one of his lieutenants ashore with a proclamation stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> [...] "execute a just punishment" [...] for the town's state of rebellion. He gave the townspeople two hours to evacuate.|$|E

After just one season at South Fork, Saban resigned in March 1989 {{to take a job}} as head coach at Georgetown High School in Georgetown, South Carolina.

It made no difference to him who pitched the ball, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> catch it, and always with big hands. [...] Who can remember Bennett dropping a pitched ball? Passed balls were a lost art when this man was behind the stick, {{and he was the}} ideal back stop. [...] Nichols always insisted on having him do his catching, saying that Bennett knew every batsman's weak points, and made easy work for the pitcher." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another of Basquiat's pieces, Irony of Negro Policeman (1981), is {{intended}} to illustrate how he believes African-Americans have been controlled by a predominantly Caucasian society. Basquiat sought to portray that African-Americans have become complicit with the [...] "institutionalized forms of whiteness and corrupt white regimes of power" [...] years after the Jim Crow era had ended. Basquiat found {{the concept of a}} [...] "Negro policeman" [...] utterly ironic. According to him the policeman should sympathize with his black friends, family, and ancestors, yet instead <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> enforce the rules designed by [...] "white society." [...] The Negro policeman had [...] "black skin but wore a white mask". In the painting, Basquiat depicted the policeman as large in order to suggest an [...] "excessive and totalizing power", but made the policeman's body fragmented and broken.|$|E
2500|$|At about 5:30p.m. that night, Casolaro {{happened}} to meet Mike Looney who rented {{the room next}} to Casolaro's Room 517. They chatted on two occasions—first at about 5:30p.m. and then again at about 8:00p.m. Looney later explained, [...] " [...] said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> meet an important source {{who was going to}} give him what he needed to solve the case." [...] According to Looney, Casolaro claimed that his source was scheduled to arrive by 9:00p.m. Around that time, Casolaro left Looney, explaining that he had to make a telephone call. He returned a few minutes later and said that his source might have [...] "blown him off." [...] Casolaro and Looney talked until about 9:30p.m. At about 10.00 p.m., Casolaro bought coffee at a nearby convenience store. That was the last time anyone reported seeing him alive.|$|E

2500|$|The Yongle Emperor {{attended}} an archery contest for the Midsummer Festival of 1413 (5th day, 5th month, 11th year). All the Chinese officials and [...] "barbarian" [...] envoys {{were invited to}} attend this event. Duyvendak (1938) states that these envoys were so numerous that they most-likely comprised many of those whom Admiral Zheng He would escort back to their countries during the fourth voyage rather than those from close neighbors. This expedition would lead the treasure fleet into Muslim countries, thus {{it must have been}} important for the Chinese to seek out reliable interpreters, such as Ma Huan (who would join the treasure voyages for the first time). A 1523 inscription at a Muslim mosque in Xi'an recorded that, on the 4th month of the 11th year, Admiral Zheng <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> seek reliable interpreters and found a man named Hasan.|$|E

2500|$|His speech {{surprised}} the liberal attendees like André Duran-Angliviel, his sister Eve Fichet, journalist using the nickname Eve Nohelle, the unionist Joachim Durel and the lawyer Mohamed Noomane. Durel criticized Bourguiba's thinking and wrote in Tunis socialiste that [...] "Everything worked well {{and there he}} was talking about Tunisian personality. As if there even were a Tunisian personality! But we are dealing with a mix of Arabs, Muslims, Jews, Maltese, French...". Bourguiba, in response, was opposed to Durel's thinking as he demonstrated by his articles in L'Étendard tunisien. The controversy that followed opposed, for nearly a month, Bourguiba and Durel, who was astonished that Bourguiba ended up with a French woman. Bourguiba then wrote that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> raise their son as a proper Tunisian, according to their country's culture and education. In 1973, Bourguiba testified on this controversy that had been his political start: ...|$|E

50|$|Following that selection, {{conflict}} between Takaya {{and other students}} comes to a head, when the second-best RX-7 pilot at the school publicly challenges her to a one-on-one fight. Planned for late at night, when none of the school authorities will be around to stop it, Ohta learns of the duel and comes to the battleground—but does nothing. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> observe, and perhaps to save Takaya's life, if the combat gets too intensive.|$|R
