During firing of the enamel at between 760 to 895 C, iron oxide scale first forms on the steel. The molten enamel dissolves the iron oxide and precipitates cobalt and nickel. The iron acts as the anode in an electrogalvanic reaction in which the iron is again oxidised, dissolved by the glass, and oxidised again with the available cobalt and nickel limiting the reaction. Finally, the surface becomes roughened with the glass anchored into the holes.|$|E

5000|$|Colour in enamel is {{obtained}} {{by the addition of}} various minerals, often metal oxides cobalt, praseodymium, iron, or neodymium. The latter creates delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm grey. Enamel can be transparent, opaque or opalescent (translucent). Different enamel colours can be mixed to make a new colour, in the manner of paint. [...] There are various types of frit, which may be applied in sequence. A <b>ground</b> <b>coat</b> is applied first; it usually contains smelted-in transition metal oxides such as cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and iron that facilitate adhesion to the metal. Next, clear and semi-opaque frits that contain material for producing colours are applied.|$|E

30|$|DCPD is of {{biological}} importance {{because it is}} often found in pathological calcifications (dental calculi, crystalluria, chondrocalcinosis and urinary stones) and some carious lesions (LeGeros 1991, 2001; O’Neill 2007). It was proposed as an intermediate in both bone mineralization and dissolution of enamel in acids (dental erosion) (LeGeros 1991, 2001; O’Neill 2007). In medicine, DCPD is used in self-setting CaPO 4 formulations (Dorozhkin 2013 b) and as an intermediate for tooth remineralization. DCPD is added to toothpaste both for caries protection (in this case, it is often coupled with F-containing compounds such as NaF and/or Na 2 PO 3 F) and as a gentle polishing agent (Dorozhkin 2013 c). Other applications include a flame retardant (Mostashari et al. 2006), a slow release fertilizer, using in glass production, as well as calcium supplement in food, feed and cereals. In food industry, {{it serves as a}} texturizer, bakery improver and water retention additive. In diary industry, DCPD is used as a mineral supplement. In addition, plate-like crystals of DCPD might be used as a non-toxic, anticorrosive and passivating pigment for some <b>ground</b> <b>coat</b> paints (Budavari et al. 1996).|$|E
40|$|The damage {{promoted}} on {{two different}} kinds of enamelled specimens was evaluated. One was coated with a single layer of pyrolytic electrostatic powder enamel (referred to as black enamel), {{and the other was}} coated with <b>ground</b> <b>coat</b> wet enamel (white enamel). Specimens were cyclically subjected to the action of an oven cleaner and temperatures of about 250 °C. After a few cycles the surfaces lost their smooth, shiny appearance, revealing that some damage was induced during the treatment. Roughness measurements and electrochemical tests showed that the degradation of the coating was rather superficial and that the metal substrate was still very well protected. Further tests showed different performances {{depending on the type of}} coating. While the black enamel revealed some pits with brown corrosion products across the surface, indicating the onset of attack of the base metal, the white enamel displayed a surface that was highly porous compared with the untreated specimens. Potentiodynamic polarisation curves showed the presence of a pitting potential together with a hysteresis loop for the black enamel, indicating the presence of small pores providing access for electrolyte (chloride) to corrode the metal base. Conversely, polarisation curves for the white enamel only displayed higher values of passive current density, suggesting a difference in the dielectric properties of the enamels. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

50|$|For <b>ground</b> <b>coats,</b> the {{composition}} of a frit for any given application is determined primarily by the metal used as the substrate: different varieties of steel, and different metals such as aluminium and copper, require different frit compositions to bond to them. For cover coats the frit is composed to both bind to the ground-coat and produce the desired external properties. Frit is normally prepared by mixing the ingredients and then milling the mixture into a powder. The ingredients, most often metal oxides and minerals such as quartz (or silica sand), soda ash, borax, and cobalt oxide, are acquired in particulate form; the precise chemical composition and amount of each ingredient must be carefully measured and regulated. Once prepared, this powdered frit is then smelted and stirred to promote even distribution of materials; most frits are smelted at temperatures between 1150 and 1300°C. After smelting, the frit is again milled into a powder, most often by ball mill grinding.|$|R
30|$|A {{white paint}} layer, 0.1 – 0.2  mm thick, is noticed {{right on the}} top of the thin blue layer. It is {{composed}} of whitish materials that created the embossed dragon and cloud patterns on golden-dragon Hexi painting. Therefore, the shape and embossed height of patterns determines the white paint layer’s thickness. Raman spectrum of the white color, as shown in Fig.  5 b, demonstrates three instantly noticeable Raman peaks at 284, 717, and 1091  cm− 1, all of which have been confirmed as characteristic of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) [26]. The source of calcium carbonate can be attributable to chalk, a very finely grained limestone deposit. Chalk has been used to paint white for quite a good long time (from Neolithic to modern China), and its application on Neolithic dwellings as well as on modern architecture have been widely reported within and beyond China. In traditional Chinese architecture painting and decoration, chalk is often referred to as baitu (literally translated as white clay, 白土) and used for the preparation of the <b>ground</b> <b>coat</b> layer or for decoration purpose [13]. Textual researches and analytical studies that aim to reconstruct architectural painting and decoration techniques in the Qing period have confirmed that chalk was usually not used alone, but mixed with China wood oil (桐油, a drying oil extracted from seeds of tung tree, Vernicia fordii) or sometimes with plant or animal glue instead. Such a practice is the core of lifen tiejin (沥粉贴金, embossed patterning and gilding), a technique during which chalk and drying oils are mixed in a certain ratio and filled into a container (such as pig’s bladder), and then squeezed out for embossing through a small opening [27, 28]. When wet and mixed with China wood oil, chalk is turned into soft paste that can be easily (re)shaped and (re)coated, which is very important for creating embossed patterns (such as the dragon and cloud patterns on golden-dragon Hexi painting). Therefore, while organic materials such as China wood oil awaits confirmation in future studies, the identification of chalk in the white paint layer suggests that lifen tiejin might have been used for embossing the dragon and cloud patterns on Hexi painting.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{vitreous}} coatings {{of the same}} basic composition, but with cobalt-oxide contents varying from 0 to 6. 4 percent by weight, was fired on ingot iron in atmospheres consisting of various oxygen-nitrogen mixtures. The effect of the oxygen content of the atmosphere on adher-ence was determined by subjecting each specimen to the American Society for Testing Materials adherence test, and the effect on interface rough-ness was estimated from examination of metallographic sections. Results of the investigation showed that {{a decrease in the}} amount of oxygen in the firing atmosphere necessitated an increase in the amount of cobalt oxide in the enamel if optimum adherence was to be secured. It was also found that <b>ground</b> <b>coats</b> containing 3. 2 weight percent or more of cobalt oxide developed a weak but definite bond in oxygen concentra-tions as low as 0. 02 mole percent but that, when lower amounts of cobalt oxide were present in the enamel, a greater oxygen concentration in the furnace atmosphere was necessary for appreciable bond development. When 2. 0 percent of manganese dioxide was added to an enamel con-taining 0. 4 weight percent cobalt oxide, the effect was small, but the trend was toward increased adherence. Metallographic examinations of the interfaces of the various speci-mens tested showed a qualitative correlation between adherence and sur-face roughness regardless of the oxygen content of the firing atmosphere. This roughening of the iron surface was attributed to galvanic corrosion...|$|R
