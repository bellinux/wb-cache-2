40|$|A {{slightly}} {{prompt critical}} nuclear reactor {{would increase the}} neutron flux exponentially at a high rate causing the reactor to become uncontrollable, however due to the delayed neutrons, {{it is possible to}} leave the reactor in a subcritical state as far as only prompt neutrons are concerned and to also sustain the chain reaction when it is going to die out. The delay neutron flux spectrum of the compact core of the Ghana’s miniature neutron source reactor (MNSR) was studied using the Monte Carlo method. 20, 484 energy groups combined for all three categories of the energy distribution, thermal, slowing down and fast regions were modeled to create small energy bins. The moderator, the inner irradiation channels, the annulus beryllium reflector and the outer irradiation channels were the regions monitored. The delay thermal neutrons recorded its highest flux in the inner <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> with an average flux of (4. 0127 0. 0076) × 1008 n/cm 2 ?s, followed by the outer <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> with an average flux of (2. 4524 0. 0049) × 1008 n/cm 2 ?s. The beryllium reflector recorded the lowest flux in the thermal region. These values of the thermal energy range occurred in the energy range (0 – 0. 625 × 10 – 07) MeV. The inner <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> again recorded the highest average flux of (1. 2050 ± 0. 0501) × 1007 n/cm 2 ?s at the slowing down region in the energy range (0. 821 – 6. 94) MeV. The outer <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> recorded the lowest flux in this region. In the fast energy region, (6. 96 – 20) MeV, the core, where the moderator is found, the same trend was observed with the inner <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> recording the highest flux at an average flux of (2. 0647 ± 0. 3260) × 1006 n/cm 2 ?s. The outer <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> recorded the second highest flux while the annulus beryllium reflector recorded very low flux in this region.

40|$|Abstract The neutron {{temperature}} is a characteristic parameter in <b>irradiation</b> <b>channels</b> of reactor. For nuclides which have resonances in the thermal neutron energy range, their Westcott g-factors {{are different from}} unity. The values of g-factors and cross-sections of (n, c) reaction of these nuclides are temperature dependence. The standard energy for tabulation of thermal neutron cross-section (r 0) is that of room temperature (293. 59 K or 20. 43 C), cor-responding to a neutron energy 0. 0253 eV or to a neutron velocity of 2200 m/s. However, in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>channels</b> of reactor, the temperature is not exact at 20. 43 C. Thus, the temperature at the irradiation position must be known to convert r 0 to r(T).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the breeding potential in <b>irradiation</b> <b>channels</b> of research reactors. These reactors differ considerably from commercial power reactors in characteristics, purpose and so non-proliferation aspects. Research reactors are easily accessible and allow rapid core configuration modification to achieve high neutron fluxes, because usually they are not sealed by IAEA. From the three possible proliferation path ways for research reactors: (1) diversion of fresh fuel for U 235 extraction; (2) diversion of spent fuel for plutonium extraction; (3) clandestine plutonium production via irradiation facilities, this paper addresses the last pathway. It is of particular interest because there is no way to determine exactly which kinds of experiments are taking place every moment in <b>irradiation</b> <b>channels.</b> Moreover, <b>irradiation</b> time can be optimized in order to breed high quality weapon grade plutonium. With regard to the safeguards measures currently adopted, IAEA concentrates its efforts on those reactors whose thermal power is greater than 25 MWth, because it was calculated that a 25 MWth LEU-fuelled reactor produces not more than one Significant Quantity of Pu (8 kg) per year in its spent fuel and a HEU-fuelled reactor of this power would require an annual reload of not more than one Significant Quantity of U 235 (25 kg). This paper investigates whether it would be possible to determine an analogous power level threshold in order to estimate the clandestine plutonium production capability of different research reactors. The Monte Carlo method was used to determine the neutron flux in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>channels</b> and to calculate the plutonium breeding potential for three different reactor types: (1) a Triga Mark II with 250 kWth, representative for a small size research reactor; (2) a Material Test Reactor (MTR) with 5 MWth, representative for a medium size research reactor; (3) a High Flux Reactor (HFR) with 45 MWth, representative for a large size research reactor. It was observed that the most important factors for plutonium breeding are the neutron flux (to which reaction rates are proportional) and the available space to place irradiation samples. The breeding capability scales fairly well with the reactor power level and from about 10 MWth onwards the proliferation concern raises with increasing power level and available sample space. JRC.

For this goal, an essential requirement to be met is the knowledge with sufficient precision of neutron and gamma-ray fluxes in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> where the components are put for the test. For this goal, an experimental measurement activity was started to validate also Monte Carlo simulation results, obtained with application of MCNP 5 code. As regards gamma-ray flux, we considered separately two gamma-ray contributions: the first one, at 60 keV energy, associated with the decay of the 241 Am, and the second one, at 2. 2 MeV, due to the radiative capture of neutrons in the biological shield (water) surrounding the neutron sources. Experimental measurements were realized with TLD 700 dosimeters in two different configurations: TLD “naked” to measure the dose of the total gamma irradiation field, and TLD put inside a lead shield to determine (for difference) 60 keV gamma-ray contribution. The dimensions of used dosimeters, very small, allowed an accurate dose behaviour determination. For the TLD calibration, we exposed them to well-know doses values at the 60 Co irradiator named IGS 3, situated in the Department of the University of Palermo. As regards {{the evaluation of the}} neutron radiation field, experimental measurements were realized both by neutron activation with gold foils (nude and cadmium covered) and with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD 600 and TLD 700). Results have been compared with the ones obtained by a Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulation performed adopting a model of the irradiator previously validated [2].

In sum, 43 samples of the terrestrial mosses (Hypnum cupressiforme, Pleurozium schreberi and Brachythecium rutabulum) were collected in autumn of 2015 in which the concentration of 38 elements were determined, including heavy metals. As a result, the factor analysis have been performed as well as maps analyzation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two {{experimental}} loops {{for operation}} in research reactor LVR- 15 in ÚJV Řež are recently under preparation: High Temperature Helium Loop (HTHL) and SuperCritical Water Loop (SCWL). Pure helium {{will be used}} as working medium in HTHL and its main physical parameters are: operating pressure 7 MPa, max. temperature in the test section 900 C and flow rate 36 kg/h. HTHL will include helium purification system, system for dosage of impurities (e. g. CO 2, H 2, H 2 O, O 2, N 2 etc.) and helium sampling. Helium purification experiments and testing of materials in simulated HTR conditions will take place in HTHL in the future. Main parameters of the SCWL are 25 MPa, max. temperature in the test section 600 °C, flow rate max. 200 kg/h. SCWL will be used for corrosion tests of candidate materials, studies of water radiolysis at supercritical conditions and for testing of water chemistry suitable for operation. Both loops possess an <b>irradiation</b> <b>channel</b> with quite complicated internals design, whose complexity is imposed by current constraints on constructional materials of nuclear experimental devices, which limit the choice and maximum surface temperature of material of construction to 500 °C for austenitic stainless steel. The working temperature will thus be attained only in a restricted volume of the test section. The channel internals will be briefly described. The mentioned loops will represent novel experimental devices, whose objective is to gain and extend knowledge on materials and environment performance under the influence of radiation...|$|E

We present results on sub-surface damage build up, as a function of fluence at different neon energies, which clearly indicate sensitivity to damage level and depth. Asymmetries observed in ion yields along crystallographically equivalent direction are discussed in terms of possible damage configurations...|$|R
40|$|By using {{nuclear power}} for energy {{generation}} the pressure vessel wall {{is exposed to}} neutron fluences of different levels depending on {{the distance to the}} core. Hence materials undergo a change in their microstructure in terms of embrittlement, to be measured as toughness reduction and shift of the Ductile-to-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT) to higher temperatures. Normally plant safety concerning this change in microstructure is assured by destructively testing surveillance samples. These are standard tensile and ISO V-specimen which consist of exactly the same material as the pressure vessel and its weld metal, being exposed to accelerated irradiation rates within special <b>irradiation</b> <b>channels</b> allowing a pronounced ageing. It is demonstrated that electromagnetic parameters allow to characterize the changes in the microstructure generated through neutron irradiation. After a defined calibration process a quantitative characterization of the embrittlement especially in terms of the shift of the DBTT is possible. This has been demonstrated for reactor pressure vessel steels used in nuclear power plants of eastern and western designs. As testing methods 3 MA (Micromagnetic, Multiparameter, Microstructure and stress Analysis) [1] and the dynamic magnetostriction using EMAT (Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers) have been applied in a nondestructive combination measurement system. Further experiments show the possibility to measure 3 MA and dynamic magnetostriction quantities through an 8 mm thick austenitic stainless steel cladding...|$|R
