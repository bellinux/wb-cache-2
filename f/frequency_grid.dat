50|$|When {{electrical}} generation {{supplying the}} grid and the consumption or {{load on the}} electrical grid are in balance, {{the frequency of the}} alternating current is at its normal rate (either 50 or 60 cycles per second). Hydro electric power plants can be utilized for making extra revenue in an electric grid with erratic <b>grid</b> <b>frequency.</b> When <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> is above normal (ex; Indian <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> is exceeding the rated 50 Hz for most of the duration in a month/day), the extra power available can be consumed by adding extra load (say agriculture water pumps) to the grid and this new energy draw is available at nominal price or no price. However, there may not be a guarantee of continued supply at that price when the <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> falls below normal, which would then call for a higher price.|$|R

40|$|Simple, {{reliable}} {{tools are}} needed by land managers to quantify establishment success when seeding or re-seeding pastures or rangeland. A <b>frequency</b> <b>grid</b> {{was designed to}} measure seedling or plant establishment success for a single species, mixtures of species, or single species of a mixture. The <b>frequency</b> <b>grid</b> is a metal frame containing 25 squares (5 x 5) or cells and {{can be made from}} concrete reinforcing sheets that have 15 x 15 cm squares. When used, the <b>frequency</b> <b>grid</b> is either randomly or systematically placed within a seeded area. The number of cells containing 1 or more seeded plants is counted. The grid is then flipped, end-over-end, and the counts are repeated. The process is repeated until a total of 100 cells have been counted per sampling location within a seeded area. Counts can be directly converted into frequency of occurrence or stand percentages by dividing the number of cells that contain a seeded plant by 100. The process can be repeated at several locations within a seeded area to characterize establishment success. Multiplying frequency of occurrence percentages by 0. 4 provides a conservative estimate of plant density (plants m- 2). A single measurement of 100 <b>frequency</b> <b>grid</b> cells can be taken in less than 5 minutes. The <b>frequency</b> <b>grid</b> is inexpensive to make, requires minimal training, permits rapid measurements, and provides a meaningful estimate of plant density. The <b>frequency</b> <b>grid</b> has been used to document herbicide efficacy and seeding rates for use in grassland establishment in the central Great Plains and should be easily adaptable for use in other geographic regions...|$|E

40|$|Repetitive and proportional-resonant {{controllers}} {{can effectively}} reject grid harmonics in grid-connected inverters {{because of their}} high gains at the fundamental frequency and the corresponding harmonics. However, the performances of these controllers can seriously deteriorate if the <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> deviates from its nominal value. Non-ideal proportional-resonant controllers provide better immunity to variations in <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> by widening resonant peaks {{at the expense of}} reducing the gains of the peaks, which reduces the effectiveness of the controller.

40|$|In the Nordic grid, a trend {{observed}} the recent {{years is the}} increase in <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> variations, which means the frequency is outside the normal range (49. 9 - 50. 1 Hz) more often. Variations in the <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> leads {{to changes in the}} speed of rotation of all the turbines connected to the grid, since the speed of rotation is closely related to the <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> for synchronous generators. When the speed of rotation changes, this implies that the net torque acting on the rotating masses are changed, and the material of the turbine runners must withstand these changes in torque. Frequency variations thus leads to torque oscillations in the turbine, which become dynamical loads that the runner must be able to withstand. Several new Francis runners have recently experienced cracks in the runner blades due to fatigue, obviously due to the runner design not taking into account the actual loads on the runner. In this paper, the torque oscillations and dynamic loads due to the variations in <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> are simulated in a 1 D MATLAB program, and measured <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> is used as input to the simulation program. The maximum increase and decrease in the <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> over a 440 seconds interval have been investigated, in addition to an extreme event where the frequency decreased far below the normal range within a few seconds. The dynamic loading originating from <b>grid</b> <b>frequency</b> variations is qualitatively found by a constructed variable Tstress, and for the simulations presented here the variations in Tstress are found to be around 3 % of the mean value, which is a relatively small dynamic load. The important thing to remember is that these dynamic loads come in addition to all other dynamic loads, like rotor-stator interaction and draft tube surges, and {{should be included in the}} design process, if not found to be negligible...|$|R

A RES is efficiently integrated to the grid via proper {{control of the}} Grid Side Converter (GSC) by accurately estimating the grid voltage phase angle. Moving Average Filter (MAF) based Phase Lock Loop (PLL) techniques provide reduced complexity, however, they present disadvantages under specific grid fault conditions.
