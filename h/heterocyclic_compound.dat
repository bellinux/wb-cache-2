The use of a central composite design and the response surface methodology to determine the best conditions allows the optimum combination of analytical variables (pH, NaCl and extraction time) to be identified. The validation was carried out using several types of wine as matrices. The method shows satisfactory repeatability (2. 7 %<RSD< 12 %), reproducibility (2. 8 %<RSD< 12 %), accuracy and specificity. The optimized method was applied to 29 French wines and significant concentrations of the different <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> were determined, mainly for red wines...|$|R
