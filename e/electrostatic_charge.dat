5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge</b> generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

These potentials contain free parameters such as atomic charge, van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of atomic radius, and equilibrium bond length, angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as elastic constants, lattice parameters and spectroscopic measurements.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge.</b> This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E
50|$|Charge is {{the measure}} of the {{electric}} current flowing through an object. A charge can be positive or negative — objects with a positive charge repel other positively charged objects, thereby causing them to push away from each other, while a positively charged object would attract to a negatively charged object, thereby causing the two to draw together. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>charges</b> are the charges associated with static electricity.

25|$|Alpha sheet (also {{known as}} alpha pleated sheet or polar pleated sheet) is an {{atypical}} secondary structure in proteins, first proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. The hydrogen bonding pattern in an alpha sheet {{is similar to}} that of a beta sheet, but the orientation of the carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide bond units is distinctive; in a single alpha strand, all of the carbonyl groups are oriented in the same direction on one side of the pleat, and all of the amino groups are oriented in the same direction on the opposite side of the sheet. Thus the alpha sheet accumulates an inherent separation of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge,</b> with one edge of the sheet exposing negatively charged carbonyl groups and the opposite edge exposing positively charged amino groups. Unlike the alpha helix and beta sheet, the alpha sheet configuration does not require all component amino acid residues to lie within a single region of dihedral angles; instead, the alpha sheet contains residues of alternating dihedrals in the traditional right-handed (αR) and left-handed (αL) helical regions of Ramachandran space. Although the alpha sheet is only rarely observed in natural protein structures, it has been speculated to play a role in amyloid disease and it was found to be a stable form for amyloidogenic proteins in one set of molecular dynamics simulations. Alpha sheets have also been observed in X-ray crystallography structures of designed peptides.|$|E
