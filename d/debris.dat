5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and <b>debris.</b> The falling <b>debris</b> was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling <b>debris</b> and one firefighter was struck by <b>debris</b> and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} pulse brought the lahar's {{duration}} to roughly two hours. By that point, 85percent of Armero was enveloped in mud. Survivors described people {{holding on to}} <b>debris</b> from their homes in attempts to stay above the mud. Buildings collapsed, crushing people and raining down <b>debris.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} coarse woody <b>debris.</b> In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey <b>debris,</b> fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E
5|$|Backhoes {{and dump}} trucks {{gradually}} removed the <b>debris</b> and sand from San Blas. Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked {{to clear the}} <b>debris</b> caused by the storm. The remaining stores, bars, and shops placed signs on their windows describing they were open in effort to attract the tourists still in the town. By about {{two months after the}} hurricane, most hotels, restaurants, and shops were reopened.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine <b>debris</b> such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded <b>debris,</b> and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of <b>debris</b> from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E

5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} {{a thick layer of}} regolith, loose <b>debris</b> that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, <b>debris</b> fragments are called ejecta blocks, several of which have been observed on the surface.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the <b>debris</b> field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the <b>debris</b> on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under <b>debris,</b> where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the <b>debris</b> field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling <b>debris.</b> The risk of <b>debris</b> from the station reaching land {{was estimated to be}} 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any <b>debris</b> fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit by falling <b>debris.</b> Chan Sek Keong, the attorney general of Singapore, called for greater regulation of space <b>debris.</b>|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or <b>debris</b> flows and <b>debris</b> avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|N.californiensis has a {{negative}} impact on oyster production, and as a result, the insecticide carbaryl (1-napthyl N-methyl carbamate) is sprayed in some areas (including Willapa Bay, Washington) to reduce the population of N.californiensis. The addition of shelly <b>debris</b> also reduces numbers of N.californiensis both by preventing the settlement of larvae, and through predation on the young N.californiensis by young Dungeness crabs in the shelly <b>debris.</b>|$|E
5|$|Omayra Sánchez Garzón (August 28, 1972November 16, 1985) was a Colombian girl {{killed in}} Armero, {{department}} of Tolima, by the 1985 eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano {{when she was}} 13 years old. Volcanic <b>debris</b> mixed with ice to form massive lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and <b>debris</b> flows) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{featuring}} Berry in {{a bikini}} were shot in Cádiz. The location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage {{has been released}} of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill. Berry was injured during filming when <b>debris</b> from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The <b>debris</b> was removed in a 30-minute operation.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling <b>debris</b> {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no <b>debris</b> can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of <b>debris</b> and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of <b>debris.</b> Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
5|$|Two {{bodies were}} {{recovered}} from the <b>debris</b> on Wednesday, June 27four days after the collapse.|$|E
5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran into a pile of stone <b>debris</b> and was derailed when it was three-quarters of the way into the tunnel. The <b>debris</b> was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E
5|$|A thick {{regolith}} {{layer on}} the lower slopes of the mountains and a thin cover of <b>debris</b> on the upper slopes are suggested by the relative absence of large boulders {{on the lower}} mountain flanks.|$|E
5|$|According to Izvestia, {{the divers}} had only ten {{encounters}} with passenger remains (tissues and body parts) in the <b>debris</b> area, including one partial torso.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Ike hit Texas in September 2008, Galveston County {{officials}} {{offered a}} <b>debris</b> removal program to residents in unincorporated areas, including Bacliff. Flooding from hurricane Ike was minimized {{due in part}} to Bacliff's relatively high elevation of 16 feet.|$|E
5|$|Although no new {{elements}} (apart from einsteinium and fermium) {{could be}} {{detected in the}} nuclear test <b>debris,</b> and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other <b>debris</b> deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the <b>debris</b> dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Upper Pine Bottom State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other <b>debris</b> deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia in Shippen Township in Tioga County, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the <b>debris</b> dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of <b>debris.</b> However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the <b>debris,</b> and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|Archaeocytes (or amoebocytes) are amoeba-like {{cells that}} are totipotent, in other words each is capable of {{transformation}} into {{any other type of}} cell. They also have important roles in feeding and in clearing <b>debris</b> that block the ostia.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid <b>debris</b> too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that <b>debris,</b> there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} <b>debris</b> disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris <b>debris</b> disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn's car {{and body}} were found {{four days after}} the eruption. His camera, buried under the <b>debris</b> of the eruption, was found roughly one week later.|$|E
5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn <b>debris</b> from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear <b>debris</b> and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{can also}} be used more broadly to identify species present in a body of water, <b>debris</b> filtered from the air, or sample of dirt. This can establish the range of invasive species and endangered species, and track seasonal populations.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a {{biomedical}} engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is {{aboard the}} NASA Space Shuttle Explorer {{for her first}} space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of <b>debris</b> in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the <b>debris</b> is speeding towards the Shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>debris</b> {{and waste}} being carried into {{waterways}} by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to shellfishing {{for four days}} from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel {{to the mouth of}} the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary homes. By five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored. Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected, requiring 2–3days to restore all areas. By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from <b>debris.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the post-launch news conference, NASA {{managers}} {{said the}} initial early {{review of the}} launch video showed no obvious <b>debris</b> events, but a thorough analysis would be performed to ensure the orbiter sustained no significant damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Hood sank with 1418 men aboard. Only three survived: Ordinary Signalman Ted Briggs, Able Seaman Robert Tilburn, and Midshipman William John Dundas. The {{three were}} rescued {{about two hours}} after the sinking by the {{destroyer}} , which spotted substantial <b>debris</b> but no bodies.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic <b>debris</b> containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the <b>debris</b> is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E
5|$|In Lee County, {{crews were}} {{deployed}} to collect plant <b>debris.</b> Due to storm damage, officials in Hernando County provided curbside <b>debris</b> removal, and two parks were closed. The post office in Cedar Key was damaged severely enough to remain closed for repairs until February, while the city hall {{has yet to}} reopen. In the meantime, city business has been conducted in a double-wide trailer near the city hall. In Franklin County, the St. George Island Bridge was reopened just 15hours after its closure to allow access to cleanup crews.|$|E
5|$|In May 1968, another firm, Swinnerton & Miller, {{completed}} the main demolition {{work with the}} help of explosives, but clearing of the <b>debris</b> took another two years.|$|E
