However, the risk of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual <b>dysfunction.</b> A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual <b>dysfunction.</b> According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual <b>dysfunction,</b> although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} social <b>dysfunctioning</b> and its {{relationship}} to psychological disorders among Dutch primary care patients was examined. Social <b>dysfunctioning</b> in these patients was rather limited, but was more pronounced in patients with a psychological disorder than in those without. Disabilities were largely restricted to the occupational and social roles, with family role functioning and self-care relatively intact. Social <b>dysfunctioning</b> was moderately related to psychopathology, with higher levels of <b>dysfunctioning</b> in more severe and depressed cases. The extent of social <b>dysfunctioning</b> among patients with both anxiety and depression was similar to that of patients with a single diagnosis of depression. Depressed patients had a similar level of <b>dysfunctioning</b> to non-psychotic psychiatric out-patients. Analyses regarding the effects of diagnosis and severity on social <b>dysfunctioning</b> revealed considerable overlap between these two aspects of psychopathology. This study supports the need for a simultaneous but separate assessment of psychopathology and social <b>dysfunctioning.</b> However, future research should incorporate additional predictors of social <b>dysfunctioning</b> (e. g. personality, life events, long-term difficulties, physical disorders), and prospective studies should be conducted to clarify the temporal sequences of symptom severity, diagnosis, and comorbidity on the one hand, and social <b>dysfunctioning</b> on the other...|$|R

40|$|Objective:The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{identify}} and describe various types and sources of organizational <b>dysfunctions.</b> Research Design & Methods: The findings are based on literature review and an ongoing empirical research project conducted in private sector organisations. The empirical study can be situated within interpretative approach. In this qualitative project open interviews and observations were used to collect data. Findings: The study indicates that various types and sources of organizational <b>dysfunctions</b> can be identified in organizations operating in Poland. The sources of <b>dysfunctions</b> may be found both within the organization and its environment. Regardless of its specific features, most of the <b>dysfunctions</b> may be interpreted as an undesirable goal displacement. Very often areas of these <b>dysfunctions</b> are strongly interconnected and create a system that hinders organizational performance. Yet, it is difficult to study these phenomena as respondents are unwilling, for various reasons, to disclose the problems faced by their organizations. Implications & Recommendations: The results imply that the issue of organisational <b>dysfunctions</b> requires open, long-lasting and comparative studies. Recommendations for further studies are formulated in the last section of the paper. Contribution & Value Added: The paper provides insight into "the dark side of organising" by identifying sources and areas of <b>dysfunctions.</b> It also reveals difficulties connected with conducting research on <b>dysfunctions</b> in the Polish context...|$|R

MethodsFive hundred and eighty-nine primary schoolchildren, 8 – 13 years old, were each given a thorough eye examination, including binocular-vision testing, near point of convergence, horizontal phoria measurement by von Graefe, and negative and positive vergence amplitudes with prism bar, to determine any form of accommodative or vergence <b>dysfunctions.</b> ResultsOf the 589 participants examined, 168 (28. 5 %) primary schoolchildren presented some form of nonstrabismic accommodative or vergence <b>dysfunctions.</b> The prevalence of accommodative <b>dysfunctions</b> and vergence <b>dysfunctions</b> was 13. 2 % and 9 %, respectively.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{research}} aimed to develop and test a systematic framework to describe and analyse <b>dysfunctions</b> in underperforming schools in South Africa, the Explanatory Model of School <b>Dysfunctions.</b> The theoretical foundation of the model was created by synthesising the literature from various disciplines and conceptualising <b>dysfunctions</b> {{in relation to their}} antecedents, motivations, and consequences. The model was then applied and refined on three different data sets. The three data sets included data from principals, teachers, and learners. The principal data consisted of 80 essays written by principals or their representatives, the teacher data of 40 essays from teachers in the Gauteng area, and the learner data of 1, 500 open-ended responses from recent high school graduates in South Africa. Content Configuration Analysis explored how school <b>dysfunctions</b> varied in degree, kind, and interconnectedness. Four groups of <b>dysfunctions</b> were identified: <b>dysfunctions</b> relating to rules and rule breaking, issues of competence, resources, and issues extrinsic to the school context. After application and refinement, the Explanatory Model of School <b>Dysfunctions</b> was found to be a suitable model to account for the problem sets experienced by these three actor groups. The goal of this model is to provide a theory-based approach to analyse <b>dysfunctions</b> within schools and to invite researchers to explore these and other problems within this framework.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{presence}} of cervical motor <b>dysfunctions</b> in acute whiplash-associated disorders, evaluate their course and assess their predictive value for long-term recovery. DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were used to select studies of {{the presence of}} cervical motor <b>dysfunctions</b> within the acute stage (<[*] 6 weeks) after whiplash trauma and/or their predictive value for the development of chronic whiplash-associated disorders. RESULTS: The presence of cervical motor <b>dysfunctions</b> in the acute stage after whiplash trauma was investigated in 4 cohorts. The course of cervical motor <b>dysfunctions</b> in whiplash-associated disorders was examined in 4 cohorts, and the predictive value on outcome 1 year post-whiplash trauma was assessed in 3 cohorts. Reduced cervical mobility, disturbed kinaesthesia, and altered muscle activity were found in the acute stage, and these persisted over time in the moderate/severe group. The predictive value of examining the presence of cervical motor <b>dysfunctions</b> was doubtful. The course and predictive value of initial reduced cervical mobility was inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Cervical motor <b>dysfunctions</b> are present soon after whiplash trauma persisting in those with moderate/severe symptoms. However, these <b>dysfunctions</b> have limited predictive value, and hence may not explain the complex clinical picture of whiplash-associated disorders.
