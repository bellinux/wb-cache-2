While regular dwarves {{will be happy}} with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation.

A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture.

Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for the automatic determination of synchronization and aliasing properties of a functional language extended with concurrency constructs (a subset of Concurrent ML). Synchronization properties state which processes, and at what process <b>histories,</b> <b>may</b> be simultaneously active during evaluation. Aliasing properties state which data, on what processes and at what process <b>histories,</b> <b>may</b> be shared. First, we develop a semantics in which the usual arbitrary set of channel identifiers is rendered unnecessary by a semantic notion of aliasing, and in which the usual arbitrary set of process identifiers is rendered unnecessary by a semantic notion of process history as control path. The result is a semantics in which synchronization properties and aliasing properties are mutually dependent, and this provides a rich framework for reasoning about t [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} falafel is unknown and controversial. A common {{theory is that}} the dish {{originated}} in Egypt, possibly eaten by Copts as a replacement for meat during Lent. As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East. The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans. It has been speculated that its <b>history</b> <b>may</b> go back to Pharaonic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of oral <b>history</b> <b>may</b> {{be achieved through}} musical performance in Madagascar. Among the Betsileo, for instance, oral histories are retold through a form of musical performance called the rija, which {{in its current form}} may represent a combination of the original, single-verse rija and an epic poem called the isa. The Betsileo rija is performed by two men who each play a jejy while singing very loudly with a strained pitch in the soprano range. The structure of the song is complex and, unlike other Malagasy musical styles, parallel thirds are not predominant in the harmony. Other Southern ethnic groups also perform simplified variations of the rija featuring for example a solo musician who strums rather than fiddles his accompanying instrument and sings at a lower, more natural pitch. While the Betsileo rija can address diverse themes, those performed by other southern groups are almost always praise songs recalling a favorably memorable event.|$|E
