25|$|The Central Bandstand {{with its}} 1932 {{frontage}} {{has been described}} as an art deco landmark, {{and one of the first}} reinforced concrete structures in the UK. It straddles the beach and Central Parade just east of the Clock Tower. The back or seaward half, built in 1924, was originally supported above the beach on concrete pillars sheathed in cast iron, so that the stage was level with the main thoroughfare. The tide used to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> under the building until at least the 1950s. During World War II when the Pier was out of bounds, anglers were permitted to fish from the rooftop balcony. As of 2013 the beach has risen so that the piers are no longer visible and the sea has receded away from the Bandstand.|$|E
25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 2012 the {{evacuation}} {{orders for the}} villages Kawauchi and Tamura were lifted, on 15 April the people of Minamisoma were {{able to return to}} their homes. A ceremony was held for police and volunteers, who were to patrol the borders of the no-go areas. The checkpoints 20 kilometers from the reactors were moved to about 10 kilometers. Three new evacuation zones were planned by the government in areas within 11 villages and towns according to radiation levels. The small city of Minamisoma was divided into 3 zones, in the first people were free to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> in the second access is limited, the third area all visiting is forbidden. Still scattered with ruins, and with no electricity and running water, the city was a rather uninhabitable place for a population formed by mostly elderly people. Schools and hospitals remained closed.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{independence}} of Indonesia, Jakarta trams was still operated by the private company BVM. In the early 1950s, Jakarta tramways stretched across Jakarta from Pasar Ikan in the north to Jatinegara in the south. Trams (or Trem in Indonesian) were very popular because of its low cost. Many native passengers felt that as an independent nation, {{they are no longer}} required to pay fares, so many decided to skip paying their fares. Trams are always overflow with people so the conductors could not check the passengers on board. Many people decided to hold onto the tram instead of getting in. Very often people <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> through the windows instead. There was also a rise in labor unrest as increasingly confident workers sought better conditions. Greater competition from buses was also an issue. All of these caused huge impact on \BVM's finances.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians are {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.″Those who still live on Shuhada Street can’t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use the rooftops to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or {{up a flight of}} stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B’Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)—some 1,014 families—have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.″ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 have gone out of business since 1994.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{the field}} {{continued}} to evolve, although in large measure, {{on a local}} level. In the broader scheme of things the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the job title, and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable with, what {{it was felt that}} the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set {{was in a state of}} constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments would <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development seemed almost faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review, saying the film [...] "serves up all the requisite elements with enough self-deprecating humor to suggest it doesn't take itself too seriously".

2500|$|In 1950 {{the pier}} tram was sold for £12 10s {{because it could}} not pass the Bailey bridges, and {{replaced}} by a narrow-gauge steam railway which was gone by 1959. On 1 March 1949 the pier entrance suffered sea-storm damage, and again between 31 January and 1 February in the North Sea flood of 1953, when a twenty-foot storm surge swept past the old pier-master's house, Richmond Villa, {{and as far as}} the High Street. As a result, in 1953 the stone balustrade from London Bridge, set at the entrance in 1833, was taken down and replaced with railings. The present whereabouts of the balustrade is unknown. In January 1963 the surface of the sea froze for weeks in the curved shapes of sea spray as far as a mile offshore. [...] The tide continued to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> under its white crust, leaving the pier surrounded by ice. Rapid thaw then caused stress to the piles, exacerbated by previous storm damage and neglect. The summer of that year saw the last visit by PS Medway Queen. By 1968 the seaward end of the pier had been closed and abandoned. In September the same year insurance was withdrawn for the deep sea part of the pier beyond the pavilion, and the public excluded. The Grand Pier Pavilion was refurbished at a cost of £158,000 but was destroyed by fire possibly caused by a spark from a welding torch during pier entrance reconstruction in June 1970. The building burned down within hours, to the distress of Herne Bay. As replacement, the Pier Pavilion was designed in 1971 by John C. Clague, opened by Edward Heath on 5 September 1976, and called The Cowshed by the public. Meanwhile, ownership of the pier was transferred to Canterbury City Council on 1 April 1974 merger.|$|E
