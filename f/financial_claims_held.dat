40|$|Short-term <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> <b>held</b> by uninformed outside investors {{impose a}} tax on insider opportunism by {{diluting}} the ownership stake of opportunistic owner-managers. By thus limiting managerial opportunism, short-term financing increases firm value and social welfare. When given a choice, owner-managers will prefer socially beneficial short-term external financing over internal financing. We show that these results are equilibrium outcomes of a model where firms can act opportunistically in product markets. Moreover, we document the same beneficial effect of short-term external finance in a laboratory experiment implementing this game...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between optimal venture capital contracts and the supply and demand for venture capital. Both the composition and type of <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> <b>held</b> by the venture capitalist and entrepreneur depend on the market structure. Beside, different market structures involve different optimal forms of transferring utility: sometimes it is optimal to transfer utility via equity stakes, sometimes it is optimal to use debt. Transferring utility via equity stakes affects incentives. Consequently, the net value created, the success probability, the market value, {{and the performance of}} venture-capital backed investments depend on the supply and demand for capital. Similarly, venture capitalists face different incentives to screen projects if the capital supply is low or high. We then endogenize the capital supply and study {{the relation between}} venture capital contracts and entry costs, public policy, investment profitability and market transparency. Finally, we show that entry by inexperienced investors creates a negative externality for the value creation in ventures financed by (regular) venture capitalists. ...|$|E
40|$|We embed {{venture capital}} {{contracting}} {{in a search}} market environment where venture capitalists and entrepreneurs meet and bargain over optimal contracts. We find that both the composition and type of <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> <b>held</b> by the venture capitalist and entrepreneur depend critically on the underlying market structure. In some cases both parties hold a mix of debt and equity while in others only one party holds a mix and the other holds straigth equity. The link between optimal contracting and market structure yields several implications. For instance, {{we find that the}} total value created in ventures is a hump-shaped function of competition, and that both the success probability and the market (or IPO) value of ventures are either increasing (if efforts are perfect substitutes) or hump-shaped (if efforts are complements) functions of competition. Finally, we show that the entry by inexperienced portfolio investors may have a negative externality on the value created by venture capitalists. Business angels, i. e., advisors with limited wealth, may even be driven out of the market. ∗We are indebted to Per Strömberg for his insightful comments and advice. Moreover, we wis...|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{managers}} generally owe a {{fiduciary duty}} exclusively to shareholders [...] a duty interpreted as requiring the managers to maximize shareholder value. When {{the firm is}} solvent, the duty to maximize shareholder value tends to give managers an incentive to act efficiently that is, {{in a way that}} increases total value. But when the firm is insolvent, this duty might give managers an incentive to run the firm in a way that reduces the value of debt more than it increases the value of equity and, therefore, is inefficient. The leading view among corporate law scholars is that an insolvent firm's managers should therefore maximize the sum of the values of all <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> both those <b>held</b> by shareholders and those held by creditors against the firm. This Article points out a previously unrecognized problem with this "financial value maximization" ("FVM") approach. What FVM proponents have overlooked is that an insolvent firm is likely to have two types of creditors: (1) "'payment creditors" parties owed cash, who hold <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> against the firm; and (2) "performance creditors" parties owed contractual performance, who hold claims for performance against the firm. The FVM approach requires managers {{to take into account the}} effect of their actions on one type of creditor payment creditors but not on the other performance creditors. We show that FVM's failure to account for performance creditors might cause an insolvent firm's managers to act in a way that harms performance creditors more than it benefits those with <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> against the firm and, therefore, is inefficient. Our analysis indicates that an insolvent firm's managers should be obligated to maximize the sum of the values of all claims against the firm, both claims for cash and claims for performance. This approach, we show, would eliminate the distortions associated with the FVM approach and actually make shareholders better off ex ante...|$|R

40|$|We {{establish}} rigorously {{the existence}} and properties of the stationary probability distribution which characterizes the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> by a risk averse individual who confronts random wage fluctuations and incomplete insurance markets. We show that there exists a unique, almost-everywhere continuous stationary cumulative distribution function which characterizes the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> in a stochastic steady-state. This distribution is shown to possess a single mass point coinciding with the non-negative, finite borrowing limit faced by the individual. We establish that the stationary distribution which characterizes the asset accumulation of low time preference individuals {{is at least as}} large, in the sense of first-degree stochastic dominance, as that of individuals with higher rates of time preference. We prove that, so long as individuals are allowed to borrow in amounts which can be repayed with probability one, additive differences in the probability distribution governing random wage earnings imply inversely proportional additive differences in the stationary probability distributions which govern the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims.</b> ...|$|R
