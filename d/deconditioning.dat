25|$|Most hip {{fractures}} {{are treated}} surgically by implanting an orthosis. Surgical treatment outweighs {{the risks of}} nonsurgical treatment which requires extensive bedrest. Prolonged immobilization increases risk of thromboembolism, pneumonia, <b>deconditioning,</b> and decubitus ulcers. Regardless, the surgery is a major stress, particularly in the elderly. Pain is also significant, and can also result in immobilization, so patients are encouraged to become mobile as soon as possible, often {{with the assistance of}} physical therapy. Skeletal traction pending surgery is not supported by the evidence. Regional nerve blocks are useful for pain management in hip fractures.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{methods of}} {{treating}} fractures {{have their own}} risks and benefits, but usually surgery is performed only if conservative treatment has failed, is very likely to fail, or {{likely to result in}} a poor functional outcome. With some fractures such as hip fractures (usually caused by osteoporosis), surgery is offered routinely because non-operative treatment results in prolonged immobilisation, which commonly results in complications including chest infections, pressure sores, <b>deconditioning,</b> deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism, which are more dangerous than surgery. When a joint surface is damaged by a fracture, surgery is also commonly recommended to make an accurate anatomical reduction and restore the smoothness of the joint.|$|E
40|$|This {{comparative}} study investigated differences in functional capacity and functional gains of patients admitted for hospital rehabilitation between 2005 and 2011. Patients were grouped according to broad diagnostic categories: neurological, orthopedic, and <b>deconditioned.</b> Functional capacity (Functional Independence Measure (FIM), gait speed) and functional gains were compared between two 1 -year patient cohorts (2005 and 2011) for diagnostic groups. In 2011, more patients were admitted (n = 626 vs. n = 474) with a shorter {{length of stay}} (mean difference 9. 72 days, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5. 26 to 14. 18) compared to 2005. Functional capacity of patients at admission was worse in 2011 for all measures (P 0. 497) except for discharge gait speed; in 2011, patients walked faster (mean difference 0. 58 m/s, 95 % CI 0. 05 to 0. 11). Higher FIM gain and FIM efficiency was demonstrated in 2011, but differences between diagnostic groups were evident. <b>Deconditioned</b> patients overall demonstrated less gain and efficiency (F > 3. 623, P < 0. 028). In summary, improved service efficiencies were demonstrated with improved throughput of patients without compromising functional capacity at hospital rehabilitation discharge.

25|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health problems, {{one of the}} most significant being loss of bone and muscle mass. Over time these <b>deconditioning</b> effects can impair astronauts' performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their aerobic capacity, and slow down their cardiovascular system. As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and our bodies have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body. This is the cause of the round-faced 'puffiness' seen in astronauts. Redistributing fluids around the body itself causes balance disorders, distorted vision, and a loss of taste and smell.|$|E
500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life.

This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will.

[...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via <b>deconditioning.</b> [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual.

40|$|The present {{pilot study}} {{investigated}} the feasibility of applying a single bout stochastic resonance whole-body vibration in <b>deconditioned</b> elderly individuals and the effects on static and dynamic balance and reaction time. We report {{the results of a}} non-blinded randomized control trial with a pre-test/post-test design. Twenty elderly individuals were randomized into either single bout stochastic resonance whole-body vibration (SR-WBV) (n= 10, frequency 5 Hz, Noise 4) or control (n= 10). SR-WBV received 5 sets of 1 min stochastic whole-body vibration (5 Hz, Noise 4 : vibration with a randomly varying frequency, 1 =low, 4 =high) with 1 min rest in between. The control group rested for 10 min without any intervention. Functional reach test (FRT), semi-tandem stand (STS), Expanded Timed Get Up-and-Go Test (ETGUG), single task- (ST) and dual task walking time (DT), chair rising (CR), and foot (RTF) and hand reaction time (RTH) were measured before and after the intervention. Within- and between group differences were analyzed using repeated measures. In order to assess the meaningfulness of pre-training to post-training changes, the effect size (ES) was calculated according to Cohenâ€™s d. All participants in the study accepted and adhered to the WBV session and performed scheduled follow-up measurements. There were no adverse events. Change values for dynamic balance showed a strong trend towards improvement for FRT of about 4. 5 % (ES= 0. 52, P= 0. 161). Change values for RTF (5. 9 %; ES= 0. 55; P = 0. 169) showed a trend towards improvement in the SR-WBV only. The results suggest that stochastic resonance WBV is both safe and well accepted by elderly individuals in assisted living institutions, and might have beneficial effects on balance in these adults. Further research is warranted to determine whether this device might be of use in the skilling-up phase of an exercise program when training is initiated in strongly <b>deconditioned</b> and/or frail elderly. The new training protocol is expected to allow for safe skilling-up training of <b>deconditioned</b> older adults in assisted living institutions...|$|R

2500|$|In 1969, P-Orridge {{dropped out}} of {{university}} and moved to London, and joined the Transmedia Explorations commune, who were then living in a large run-down house in Islington Park Street. The group, initiated by the artist David Medalla and initially named the Exploding Galaxy, {{had been at the}} forefront of the London hippy scene since 1967, but had partially disbanded after a series of police raids and a damaging court case. Moving into their commune, P-Orridge was particularly influenced by one of the founding members of the group, Gerald Fitzgerald, a kinetic artist, and would recognise Fitzgerald's formative influence in P-Orridge's later work. The commune members adhered to a strict regime with the intention of <b>deconditioning</b> its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day. P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969, when they decided to leave; they were angered that the commune's leaders were given more rights than the other members, and believed that the group ignored the counter-cultural use of music, something P-Orridge took a great interest in. Julie Wilson later stated that although P-Orridge's time at the Transmedia Explorations commune had been brief, [...] "the experiences he had there proved to be seminal" [...] to his artistic development.|$|E

For some, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is the primary cause and for a small minority {{there may be an}} alternative organic pathology. However for many, the cause will be simply reaching their physiological limit or be due to a functional form of dysfunctional breathing, neither of which require drug therapy.; The physiological limit category includes <b>deconditioned</b> individuals, such as those who have been through intensive care and require rehabilitation, as well as the unfit and the fit competitive athlete who has reached their limit with both of these latter groups requiring explanation and advice.; Dysfunctional breathing is an umbrella term for an alteration in the normal biomechanical patterns of breathing that result in intermittent or chronic symptoms, which may be respiratory and/or nonrespiratory. This alteration may be due to structural causes or, much more commonly, be functional as exemplified by thoracic pattern disordered breathing (PDB) and extrathoracic paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder (pVFMD).; Careful history and examination together with spirometry may identify those likely to have PDB and/or pVFMD. Where there is doubt about aetiology, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be required to identify the <b>deconditioned,</b> unfit or fit individual reaching their physiological limit and PDB, while continuous laryngoscopy during exercise is increasingly becoming the benchmark for assessing extrathoracic causes.; Accurate assessment and diagnosis can prevent excessive use of drug therapy and result in effective management of the cause of the individualâ€™s complaint through cost-effective approaches such as reassurance, advice, breathing retraining and vocal exercises.; This review provides an overview of the spectrum of conditions that can present as exercise-Â­induced breathlessness experienced by young subjects participating in sport and aims to promote understanding of the need for accurate assessment of an individualâ€™s symptoms.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Hubble repair mission (STS- 125) {{is unique}} in that a rescue mission (STS- 400) has {{to be ready to}} launch before STS- 125 life support runs out should the vehicle become stranded. The shuttle uses {{electrical}} power derived from fuel cells that use cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen (CRYO) to run all subsystems including the Environmental Control System. If the STS- 125 crew cannot return to Earth due to failure of a critical subsystem, they must power down all nonessential systems and wait to be rescued by STS- 400. This power down will cause the cabin temperature to be 60 F or less and freeze the rest of the vehicle, preventing it from attempting a reentry. After an emergency has been declared, STS- 125 must wait at least 7 days to power down since that is the earliest that STS- 400 can be launched. Problem The delayed power down of STS- 125 causes CYRO to be consumed at high rates and limits the survival time after STS- 400 launches to 10 days or less. CRYO will run out sooner every day that the STS- 400 launch is delayed (weather at launch, technical issues etc.). To preserve CRYO and lithium hydroxide (LiOH - carbon dioxide removal) the crew will perform no exercise to reduce their metabolic rates, yet each <b>deconditioned</b> STS- 125 crewmember must perform an EVA to rescue himself.
