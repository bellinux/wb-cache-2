25|$|Vehicles {{with two}} {{continuously}} variable transmissions, {{such as the}} DAF Daffodil. The Daffodil, and other similar vehicles which were made until the 1970s by the Dutch company DAF, had a type of transmission that used an arrangement of belts and pulleys to provide {{an infinite number of}} gear ratios. The engine drove two separate transmissions which ran the two driving wheels. When the vehicle turned, the two wheels could rotate at different speeds, making the two transmissions shift to different gear ratios, thus functionally substituting for a differential. The slower moving wheel received more <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> than the faster one, so the system had limited-slip characteristics. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{constraint}} of {{the differential}} is passive—it is actuated by the friction kinematics chain through the ground. The difference in torque on the roadwheels and tires (caused by turns or bumpy ground) drives the second degree of freedom, (overcoming the torque of inner friction) to equalise the <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> on the tires. The {{sensitivity of the}} differential depends on the inner friction through the second degree of freedom. All of the differentials (so called [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive") use clutches and brakes for restricting the second degree of freedom, so all suffer from the same disadvantage—decreased sensitivity to a dynamically changing environment. The sensitivity of the ECU controlled differential is also limited by the time delay caused by sensors and the response time of the actuators.|$|E

This is commonly written in terms of the unit moment defined by :where [...] is the unitless damping parameter, [...] and [...] are <b>driving</b> <b>torques,</b> and [...] is the unit vector along the polarization of the current.|$|R

The filament, straight and tilted {{with respect to}} its rotation axis for small <b>driving</b> <b>torques,</b> undergoes at a critical torque a strongly discontinuous shape bifurcation to a helical state. It induces a substantial forward propulsion whatever the sense of rotation: a nanomechanical force-rectification device is established.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for optimum dynamic balancing of planar parallel manipulators typified with a variable speed 2 DOF parallel manipulator articulated with revolute joints. The dynamic balancing is formulated as an optimisation problem such that a sum-squared values of bearing forces, <b>driving</b> <b>torques,</b> shaking moment, and the deviation of the angular momentum from its mean value are minimized throughout an operation {{range of the}} manipulator, provided that a set of balancing constraints consisting of the shaking force balancing conditions, the sizes of some inertial and geometric parameters are satisfied. Sets of optimisation results corresponding to various combinations {{of the elements of}} the objective function are evaluated in order to quantify their influence on the resulting bearing forces, the <b>driving</b> <b>torques,</b> shaking moment and force. The results prove that the proposed optimisation approach can be used to minimize any desired combination of the forces, moments, and torques involved in any parallel mechanism by choosing a suitable set of weighting factors. The method is systematic, versatile and easy to implement for the optimum balancing of the parallel manipulator and more general parallel manipulators...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{complementarity}} {{model for a}} general three-dimensional manipulation system with rolling and sliding contacts to solve the forward dynamics problem. The key idea is to derive complementary constraints for a rolling contact by decomposing the tangential properties. We also discuss the existence and uniqueness of {{a solution to the}} model, and algorithms for solving the problem. We show examples of computer simulation for dynamics of multifingered hand manipulation and discuss how the transition of contact modes varies for applied joint <b>driving</b> <b>torques...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{contribution}} {{presents the}} dynamic {{model of a}} differential two-wheeled mobile robot in the joint frame, i. e. in the plane of angular position of both the right-hand side wheel and the left-hand side one. The aim {{is to create an}} appropriate MIMO plant model for the purpose of the mobile robot motion control synthesis. Based on the Lagrangian formalism, the complete description of the second order matrix differential equation (the dynamic model of the mobile robot) is provided, including the influence of inertial coupling forces. A pair of wheel <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> represents the input of given model. Additionally, a decoupled dynamic model for the robust motion control implementation is presented...|$|R
50|$|In {{other types}} of {{suspension}} systems, the axles serve only to transmit <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> to the wheels; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system. This {{is typical of the}} independent suspensions found on most newer cars and SUVs, and on the front of many light trucks. These systems still have differentials, but will not have attached axle housing tubes. They may be attached to the vehicle frame or body, or integral in a transaxle. The axle shafts (usually constant-velocity type) then transmit <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> to the wheels. Like a full floating axle system, the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to three}} and four {{cylinder}} designs, a major advantage in 4-stroke format is the overlap in power stroke, where the combustion at every 144° of crank rotation ensures a continuous <b>driving</b> <b>torque,</b> which, while not as much noticeable at high rpm, translates to a much smoother idle.|$|E
50|$|The Rim-driven {{thruster}} is {{a marine}} propeller {{which does not}} need a hub for transmission of the <b>driving</b> <b>torque.</b> Conventional propellers need a shaft line which is driven by a turbine, a diesel engine or an electric motor. The more recent podded drives consist of a conventional propeller which is arranged together with a conventional electric motor into an azimuthable gondola under water.|$|E
40|$|Using {{omni-directional}} wheels for vehicles {{operating on}} flat ground enables high variability of the vehicle’s motion. The vehicle can perform longitudinal, lateral or diagonal movement {{or it can}} yaw i. e. rotate about its vertical axis. Any simultaneous combination of these base movements is possible as well. By virtue of the omni-directional wheels the prescribed motion of the vehicle is accomplished solely by applying different <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> {{on each of the}} wheels - hence no wheel steering is necessary. In the paper an object-oriented approach for modelling of the complete vehicle will be presented. With this approach, different variants of the vehicle within various scenarios can be conveniently handled and investigated in simulations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide a {{systematic}} method to perform dynamic analysis in the task space for a system composed of multiple arms holding a rigid object. The dynamic manipulability ellipsoid is introduced to obtain quantitative indices of the system's capability, in each configuration, of performing object accelerations along given task space directions. The ellipsoid is derived on the basis of the mapping of object accelerations onto joint <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> via the proper kineto-static and dynamic equations of the system. The maximum joint torque limits are taken into account, and the effects of gravitational loads onto the ellipsoid are evidenced. Analysis of multiarm system configurations is carried out in a number of case studies...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} and algorithm are presented that generate motion imitating the way humans complete a lifting task under various loading conditions. The path taken depends on'natural'parameters: the figure geometry, the given load, the final destination, and especially, the strength {{model of the}} agent. Additional user controllable parameters of the motion are {{the comfort of the}} action and the perceived exertion of the agent. The algorithm uses this information to incrementally compute a motion path of the end-effector moving the load. It is therefore instantaneously adaptable to changing force, loading, and strength conditions. Various strategies are used to model human behaviour that compute the <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> as the situation changes. The algorithm runs in near-real time and offers an agent-dependent toolkit for fast path prediction. Example are presented for various task...|$|R
50|$|Rear {{wheel torque}} rises {{smoothly}} {{from zero to}} the optimum setting in proportion to vehicle acceleration (both forward and reverse). At higher speeds, the front wheels are capable of providing the desired thrust with excellent handling so torque delivered to the rear wheels automatically diminishes with speed. While cruising, all <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> is delivered by the front wheels {{in the interests of}} smoothness, quietness, and fuel efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The rack {{carries the}} full load of the {{actuator}} directly {{and so the}} driving pinion is usually small, so that the gear ratio reduces the torque required. This force, thus torque, may still be substantial {{and so it is}} common for there to be a reduction gear immediately before this by either a gear or worm gear reduction. Rack gears have a higher ratio, thus require a greater <b>driving</b> <b>torque,</b> than screw actuators.|$|E
50|$|Acceleration {{torque control}} (ATC) mode {{is unique to}} the VTM-4 system. It works even on dry {{pavement}} to actively distribute <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> to all four wheels as the vehicle accelerates from a stop to cruising speed. One notable benefit of this mode is that traction is immediately available to move the vehicle from rest through a slippery intersection before slippage occurs (Once a wheel slips, the traction available for forward propulsion and lateral restraint is significantly diminished).|$|E
40|$|Walking pattern {{synthesis}} {{is carried}} out using a spline-based parametric optimization technique. Generalized coordinates are approximated by spline functions of class C 3 fitted at knots uniformly distributed along the motion time. This high-order differentiability eliminates jerky variations of actuating torques. Through connecting conditions, spline polynomial coefficients are determined as a linear function of the joint coordinates at knots. These values are then dealt with as optimization parameters. An optimal control problem is formulated {{on the basis of}} a performance criterion to be minimized, representing an integral quadratic amount of <b>driving</b> <b>torques.</b> Using the above spline approximations, this primary problem is recast into a constrained non-linear optimization problem of mathematical programming, which is solved using a computing code implementing an SQP algorithm.

40|$|A life-sized {{masticatory}} robot, {{which is}} intended to chew foods in a human way while the food properties are evaluated, of a 6 RSS parallel mechanism is discussed in this paper. A robotic mechanism is proposed, and its kinematic parameters are defined according to the biomechanical findings and measurements of the human masticatory system. For a given mandibular trajectory to be tracked, the closed-form solution to inverse kinematics of the robot is found for joint actuations, whereas differential kinematics is derived in Jacobian matrices. Major features of the robot, including the motion control system, are presented. Experimental results for free chewing, soft-food chewing, and hard-food chewing are given where the foods are simulated by foam and hard objects, and crank actuations and <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> (an indication of muscular activities) required are compared for the chewing of different foods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bush {{chains and}} roller chains are {{frequently}} used in valve train systems of combus-tion engines. Their complex dynamical behaviour {{is dominated by}} the effects of high velocities and transient <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> as well as by polygonal action and rotatory impacts. These phenomena may be studied efciently by the methods of multibody dynamics. However, the high-frequency characteristics and the comparatively large number of degrees of freedom cause challenging numerical problems. There are two basic strategies to keep the numerical effort in time integration within reasonable bounds: On the one hand it may be reduced by adapted modelling, on the other hand specic time integration schemes may be used to solve the equations of motion. The paper introduces methods in both elds and presents simulation examples to show their effect on efciency and to validate their implementation. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{a series}} {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicle, the pump/motor directly {{connects to the}} driveshaft, or the in-wheel motors provide <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> directly to the wheel. The internal combustion engine is only connected to a pump, and is set to operate in its most efficient power range to maintain the optimal hydraulic pressure in the accumulator. The traction motor must supply all the torque required to propel the vehicle, meaning maximum acceleration performance is available with the engine running or stopped. Its main disadvantage is in steady-state cruising, where the double conversion of energy introduces additional losses.|$|E
50|$|In a {{synchronous}} grid all the generators must {{run at the}} same frequency, and must stay very nearly in phase {{with each other and}} the grid. For rotating generators, a local governor regulates the <b>driving</b> <b>torque,</b> maintaining constant speed as loading changes. Droop speed control ensures that multiple parallel generators share load changes in proportion to their rating. Generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid, because energy is consumed as it is produced. Energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators.|$|E

Haydon wanted to produce a novel type of counter specifically designed to overcome the difficulties encountered in a pinion mechanism. in 1959 Haydon designed a [...] "Transfer Counter" [...] U.S. Patent No. 3,069,083. [...] It incorporated an Epicyclic gearing mechanism for advancing the digits so the <b>driving</b> <b>torque</b> is extremely low and uniform.

40|$|A fully counter-balanced 6 -DOF robot for {{ultrasound}} {{carotid artery}} diagnosis {{has been developed}} in the Ro- botics and Control Laboratory at UBC [1]. This paper presents the controller design. The controller is basically a velocity controller capable of incorporating position control, force control, and image based control, in terms of shared control principle. Safety issue is deeply concerned in design of the control system. The fully counter-balanced mechanical design allows to use extremely small motor <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> which result in 1 ON maximum force at the probe, and allows the probe to remain in its position in case of power failure.

A dynamics of two link model of the human arm has been studied with the goal of synthesizing the torques which accomplish the desired transfer. For that purpose a set of parameters which describes the desired transition (initial position, final position, peak velocity, etc.) is chosen randomly according to a certain distribution. The parameters of the desired trajectory as well as the system variables (angles and angular velocities) are encoded using populations of di#erent number of neurons, usually 100 150. The underlying mathematics including integration, di#erentiation and other algebraic relationships, has been done at the level of neuronal activity. Finally, the <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> are generated from the corresponding activities using an optimal decoding rule...|$|R
40|$|In last decades hybrid and {{electric}} vehicles {{have been one}} of the main object of study for automotive industry. Among the different layout of the electric power-train, four in-wheel motors appear to be one of the most attractive. This configuration in fact has several advantages in terms of inner room increase and mass distribution. Furthermore the possibility of independently distribute braking and <b>driving</b> <b>torques</b> on the wheels allows to generate a yaw moment able to improve vehicle handling (torque vectoring). In this paper a torque vectoring control strategy for an electric vehicle with four in-wheel motors is presented. The control strategy is constituted of a steady-state contribution to enhance vehicle handling performances and a transient contribution to increase vehicle lateral stability during limit manoeuvres. Performances of the control logic are evaluated by means of numerical simulations of open and closed loop manoeuvres. Robustness to friction coefficient changes is analysed...|$|R
