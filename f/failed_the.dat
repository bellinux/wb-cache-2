5|$|A {{government}} {{motion to}} reopen the same-sex marriage debate <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> 38th Canadian Parliament, led by the Liberals, had legalized same-sex marriage a year earlier. Several provinces had legalized same-sex marriage before that. During his campaign, Harper promised a parliamentary vote on reopening the issue. The motion failed 175–123 leaving the same-sex marriage legal in Canada and the legal debate about it closed.|$|E
5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E

5|$|After a heavy, {{concentrated}} artillery barrage, the White Guards began advancing {{from house}} to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the late evening of 3 April the Whites reached the eastern river banks of Tammerkoski. The Reds' major attempts to break the siege of Tampere from outside, along the Helsinki-Tampere railway, <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The Tampere City Hall was among the last strongholds of the Red troops. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the Pyynikki and Pispala sections of Tampere.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car <b>failed</b> <b>the</b> obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Pachycephalosaurus {{and other}} pachycephalosaurid genera may {{have engaged in}} flank-butting during {{intraspecific}} combat. In this scenario, an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly, using intimidation displays to cow its rival. If intimidation <b>failed,</b> <b>the</b> Pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to the side, striking the rival pachycephalosaur on its flank. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs, which would have protected vital organs from trauma. The flank-butting theory was first proposed by Sues in 1978, and expanded upon by Ken Carpenter in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea <b>failed,</b> <b>the</b> State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas' second-in-command, {{the invasion of}} Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas' arrival {{in the spring of}} 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but {{the western part of the}} region did not become part of the queen's authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.|$|E
5|$|And {{there were}} already {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, wide-area Gravel mines that were to alert the acoustic sensors. Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E

UFC president Dana White stated that Angle was in talks to appear as a heavyweight contestant on the 10th season of The Ultimate Fighter, but <b>failed</b> <b>the</b> medical requirements. Angle signed with Bellator MMA on October 28, 2015. He attended a fan convention on November 6, the eve of Bellator 145, then joined the commentary booth the next night, during the Bobby Lashley vs. James Thompson match, where he teased possibly fighting for the promotion himself.|$|E

In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he <b>failed</b> <b>the</b> entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E

In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination. However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness. He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. to qualify for admission to George Washington University. He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September.|$|E

5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, {{and dozens of other}} places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately <b>failed.</b> <b>The</b> success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E
