5|$|On Hill 301, further west, the First Rifle Regiment under Col. Hermann Balck {{had helped}} take the {{position}} by nightfall.

Several Panzers were knocked out. The First Rifle Regiment, 1st Panzer, had crossed the boundary into the 2nd Panzer's territory.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{combustion}} <b>knock</b> characteristics of diesel engines running on natural gas using pilot injection as means of initiating combus-tion. The diesel engines <b>knock</b> under normal operating conditions but the <b>knock</b> {{referred to in}} this paper is an objectionable one. In the dual-fuel combustion pro-cess we have the ignition stage followed by the combustion stage. There are three types of knock: diesel <b>knock,</b> spark <b>knock</b> and <b>knock</b> due to secondary ignition delay of the primary fuel (erratic <b>knock).</b> Several factors have been noted to feature in defining <b>knock</b> characteristics of dual-fuel engines that include ignition delay, pilot quantity, engine load and speed, turbulence and gas flow rate...|$|R

After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by <b>knocking</b> the truck over with a wrecking ball.

40|$|In spark {{ignition}} engines, <b>knock</b> onset limits the maximum spark advance. An inaccurate identification of this limit penalises the fuel conversion efficiency. Thus <b>knock</b> feature extraction {{is the key}} of closed-loop control of ignition in {{spark ignition}} engine. This paper reports an investigation of <b>knock</b> detection in spark ignition (SI) engines using CEEMD-Hilbert transform based on the engine cylinder pressure signals and engine cylinder block vibration signals. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) was used to decompose the signal and detect <b>knock</b> characteristic. Hilbert transform was {{used to analyze the}} frequency information of <b>knock</b> characteristic. The result shows that, for both of cylinder pressure signals and vibration signals, the CEEMD algorithm could extract the <b>knock</b> characteristic, and the Hilbert transform result shows that the energy of <b>knock</b> impact areas has the phenomenon of frequency concentration in both cylinder pressure signal and cylinder block vibration signal. At last, the <b>knock</b> window is then determined, based on which a new <b>knock</b> intensity evaluation factor K is propose, and it can accurately distinguish between heavy <b>knock,</b> light <b>knock,</b> and normal combustion three states...|$|R

5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that <b>knocking</b> out ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than <b>knocking</b> out VLDLR.|$|E
