I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> piano.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Lundgren played gladiator Brixos in the Italian-made historical/biblical drama, The Inquiry (L'inchiesta), {{also known}} as The Final Inquiry, {{alongside}} Daniele Liotti, Mónica Cruz, Max von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham and Ornella Muti. It is the remake of the 1986 Italian film directed by Damiano Damiani and starring Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel. Set in AD35 in the Roman Empire, the story follows a fictional Roman general named Titus Valerius Taurus, a veteran of campaigns in Germania, who is sent to Judea by the emperor Tiberius to investigate {{the possibility of the}} divinity of the recently crucified Jesus. The film, shot on location in Tunisia and Bulgaria, featured a score from Andrea Morricone, the son of the acclaimed film score composer Ennio Morricone. It premiered at the Capri-Hollywood and the Los Angeles-Italia Film Festival. One reviewer on a website catering for historical movies said of the film, [...] "The Final Inquiry is one of those movies you are glad you ran into.... I had such low expectations for this movie, but was glad to have been proven wrong. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> negative reviews this movie has gotten and some of the criticism is well deserved while some of it is a bit unfair." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E

He always had his way... I would have loved to play on. But then Hazare called quits and Mankad became captain. I made myself unavailable for the tour to Pakistan in 1954/55. It is unlikely that I would have been chosen".|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{showed an}} {{interest}} in Jesus as a universal figure, saying, [...] "I'm very fond of Jesus Christ. He {{may be the most}} beautiful guy who walked the face of this earth. Any guy who says 'Blessed are the poor. Blessed are the meek' {{has got to be a}} figure of unparalleled generosity and insight and madness...A man who declared himself to stand among the thieves, the prostitutes and the homeless. His position cannot be comprehended. It is an inhuman generosity. A generosity that would overthrow the world if it was embraced because nothing would weather that compassion. I'm not trying to alter the Jewish view of Jesus Christ. But to me, in spite of what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> history of legal Christianity, the figure of the man has touched me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tintin in the Congo {{reflected}} the dominant colonialist ideology at that time. As put by Hergé {{in a later}} interview, [...] "This was in 1930.
