5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
25|$|The hero plundered Oechalia and overthrew {{its walls}} while Iole threw <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> {{from the high}} city wall to escape. It {{turned out that the}} garment she was wearing, opened up and acted like a {{parachute}} which ensured her soft and safe descent. Heracles captured and took Iole unwillingly as captive. His wife, Deianira did not like Iole to become Heracles' concubine but she forebore to object and tolerated it temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Ivins was born, {{and spent}} his youth, in Lebanon, Ohio, {{a small town}} 30 miles {{northeast}} of Cincinnati. His parents were Thomas Randall Ivins and Mary Johnson (nee Knight) Ivins, {{and he was the}} youngest of three brothers. His father, a pharmacist, owned a drugstore and was active in the local Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce. The family went regularly to Lebanon Presbyterian Church, although Ivins was later a Catholic parishioner. According to C.W. Ivins, one of Ivins' older brothers, their mother Mary was violent and physically abusive to all three children. When she discovered she was pregnant with Bruce, a pregnancy that was unplanned and unwanted, she repeatedly tried to abort the child by throwing <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> a set of stairs. Ivins would eventually hear the story of his mother's attempt to abort him.|$|E

In the semifinals, Clijsters was leading 2–1 when her opponent, Ana Ivanovic, had to retire due to a foot injury. In the final, Clijsters faced 10th seed Maria Sharapova and after losing the first set, Clijsters found <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> 3–5 in the second set. She managed to save three match points on her own serve, before rain interrupted play.

This win propelled her ranking to world no. 4 with her 38th singles title of her career.|$|E
25|$|Sharon {{encourages}} Michelle to {{make amends}} with Martin and Ian, but neither of them are interested; Michelle talks to Bex, who says Michelle let <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> and the old Michelle that Bex used {{to look up to}} would hate this Michelle, and that she ruined everything she worked for; Michelle cries in Sharon's arms, saying she no longer knows herself. Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to.

500|$|We {{did three}} or four songs in {{three or four}} days. The way we was doing it, I had [...] down there along with me. We had the whole room set up with candles, some nice wine a very good vibe. It was {{completely}} stripped down, like 'Mariah Carey Unplugged'. She stripped <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> to her talent. She was really trusting of me and my vision, and I was trusting of who she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'll stop out!" [...] she replied, and sat <b>herself</b> doggedly <b>down,</b> {{with the}} air of one who had {{resolved}} never more to go away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said she, {{stopping}} {{to put the}} little girl, who {{had managed to get}} <b>herself</b> upside <b>down,</b> right end up again, [...] "because I do." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Ms. Connelly, too, whittled <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> {{to a new}} weight class, and it's her {{performance}} that gives the movie weight, since her fall is the most precipitous. By the end, when she curls into a happy fetal ball with a furtive smile on her face, {{she has come to}} love her debasement.... Her dank realization is more disturbing than anything in the novel, and Ms. Connelly has never before done anything to prepare us for how good she is here." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} serious rifts {{occurred}} when Zelda told Scott that their sex life had declined because he was [...] "a fairy" [...] and was likely having a homosexual affair with Hemingway. There is no evidence that either was homosexual, but Scott nonetheless decided to have sex with a prostitute to prove his heterosexuality. Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any encounter occurred, and a bitter fight ensued, resulting in lingering jealousy. She later threw <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> a flight of marble stairs at a party because Scott, engrossed in talking to Isadora Duncan, was ignoring her.|$|E
500|$|On October 28, 2011, Dunderdale's new cabinet {{was sworn}} in at Government House. Through the {{elimination}} and restructuring of government departments she reduced her cabinet to 16 members, including <b>herself,</b> <b>down</b> from 19. [...] Dunderdale created the Department of Advanced Education and Skills, which takes on {{the majority of the}} responsibilities of the now defunct Department of Human Resources, Labour and Employment. She eliminated the Department of Business and merged it with the Department of Innovation, Trade and Rural Development to create the Department of Innovation, Business and Rural Development. She also restructured the former departments of Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs and Intergovernmental Affairs to create the Department of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs.|$|E

60|$|The hermit had a {{great deal}} to say, and the day was very hot, so the nun, tired of sitting by <b>herself,</b> lay <b>down</b> right across the threshold, and fell sound asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "She flung <b>'erself</b> <b>down</b> in {{the chair}} agin with 'er back to me, and for nearly three-quarters of an hour we sat there without a word. Then, to our joy, we 'eard {{footsteps}} turn in at the gate. Quick footsteps they was. Somebody turned {{the handle of the}} door, and then a face looked in at the window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise. A face that was as white as chalk with temper, and a bonnet cocked over one eye with walking fast. She shook 'er fist at me, and then she shook it at Miss Lamb.|$|R
500|$|... "The Hungry Earth" [...] and {{the second}} part, [...] "Cold Blood" [...] made up the fourth {{production}} block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. In an interview, Syal stated that they did the location filming first. The drill itself was automatic and done by computer. For the scene in which Amy is dragged underneath the ground, Gillan stood on boxes and lowered herself into a stone compartment. Two pieces of rubber were {{at the opening of}} the compartment which expanded as she lowered <b>herself</b> <b>down.</b> A layer of soil was spread across the rubber; Gillan's ears were taped over to make sure the soil did not enter her ears. Gillan, initially scared at performing the stunt, put some of her fear and claustrophobia into the scene as she expected Amy felt the same way.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was {{initially}} dismissive of the version {{performed at the}} iTunes Festival due to its [...] "bland" [...] arrangement and [...] "elementary" [...] melody, but reacted well to the new version on Artpop, saying: [...] "Gaga has been very public about her supposed battle with addiction, {{and whether or not}} it's just another costume for the singer to wear, she's nonetheless composed a convincing anthem of remorse." [...] Idolator reviewer Christina Lee believed that with [...] "Dope", Gaga had found another novel way of stripping <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> in the song, and complimented the singer's vocals in the song. Michael Cragg from The Guardian, who was granted an early listen to Artpop, felt that the song was an emotional highlight of the album, denoting it as the record's [...] "one real moment of calm" [...] and [...] "the album's most tender moment". However, Cragg was skeptical about the line [...] "I need you more than dope", feeling it to be a less impressive comparison. Jon Pareles from The New York Times found [...] "Dope" [...] to be similar to piano ballads by singer Elton John.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} their destination, the crew assists Timicin in modifying photon torpedos to launch into the proxy sun with the {{expectation}} that it will repair the damaged star and prove that the technique can be safely applied to the Kaelon sun. [...] The torpedos are fired and, although the experiment seems initially to work, the effect is short-lived and the star explodes. [...] The Enterprise returns to Kaelon II. [...] Timicin is crushed, and after some questioning by Lwaxana, he [...] reveals that there are other things troubling him. Timicin tells Lwaxana [...] that he is about to turn 60, and on Kaelon II, everyone who reaches that age performs the [...] "Resolution", [...] a ritual act of voluntary euthanasia. Lwaxana is outraged to learn of this and brings it to the attention of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). [...] Picard makes it clear to Lwaxana that due to the Prime Directive, he will not interfere in the planet's local affairs. Lwaxana tries to beam <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> to the planet to halt the process herself but she is thwarted by Deanna who comforts her.|$|E

2500|$|Fitz Hugh's {{father had}} obvious and {{enormous}} influence on him, {{with his mother}} playing a more marginal role in his life. Abigail Woolsey Wells died {{a few months after}} Ludlow’s twelfth birthday. At her funeral, the presiding minister said that “or many years she has scarcely known what physical ease and comfort were. She labored with a body prostrated and suffering; and laid <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> to sleep in pain.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At Fry's funeral, Leela blames {{herself for}} his death. After taking some space honey to calm <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> {{and help her}} sleep, Leela {{experiences}} a series of dreams in which Fry is alive, all of them ending with Fry telling her to [...] "wake up" [...] and Leela finding a souvenir from the dream in the waking world. Leela's insistence that Fry is alive leads the others to conclude that she is going insane.|$|E
2500|$|That night, {{a warrior}} crawled up {{and set the}} {{blockhouse}} on fire. [...] When the sentries opened fire on the arsonist, the 600-strong Indian war party attacked {{the west side of}} the fort. [...] Taylor ordered the fort's surgeon and a handful of defenders to control the fire. [...] The blockhouse, which was attached to the barracks, had a store of whiskey, which soon ignited, and the fire raged out of control. [...] Taylor admitted in his report that the situation looked hopeless, and two of his healthy men fled the fort. [...] Warning the fort that [...] "Taylor never surrenders!", the captain organized a bucket brigade to fight the fire before it destroyed the fort's picket walls. [...] One woman, Julia Lambert, even lowered <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> into the fort's well to fill buckets more quickly.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent to the underworld, {{represented}} in parallel Sumerian and Akkadian tablets, Inanna (Ishtar in the Akkadian texts) set off for the netherworld, or Kur, which was ruled by her sister Ereshkigal. Ereshkigal is in mourning at {{the death of her}} consort, Gugalanna (The Wild Bull of Heaven Sumerian Gu = Bull, Gal = Great, An = Heaven). [...] She passed through seven gates and at each one was required to leave a garment or an ornament so that when she had passed through the seventh gate she was a simple woman, entirely naked. Despite warnings about her presumption, she did not turn back but dared to sit <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> on Ereshkigal's throne. Immediately the Anunnaki of the underworld judged her, gazed at her with the eyes of death, and she became a corpse, hung up on a meathook.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot on August 23, 2014 and was {{directed}} by Hype Williams. During an interview at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Jennifer Lopez stated about the video, [...] "It's a lot of booty." [...] On September 4, 2014, Lopez teased the music video, giving a 30-second preview, where Lopez and Azalea were dressed in [...] "barely-there bikinis that highlighting and their glorious derrieres," [...] according to Marc Inocencio of Ryan Seacrest.com. He continued, [...] "The preview also includes shots of the singer writhing on the floor, spanking her assets, flirtatiously dancing with Iggy, and covering herself in {{what appears to be}} lubricant." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News went on to comment that, [...] "The teaser has Lopez tossing aside all inhibitions as she proudly shows off her famous backside in a skin-tight, black bikini complete with fishnet stockings. J.Lo continues to flaunt her assets as she rubs <b>herself</b> <b>down</b> with water (or oil, we can’t determine), smokes a cigarette and shows everybody how she twerks. J. Lo and director Hype Williams turn up the sexiness by bringing in Iggy Iggs into the mix as the two ladies dance together in black-and-white bathing suits with slicked back wet hair, as Jennifer playfully touches her fellow big-booty collaborator." [...] The full video premiered on September 18, 2014.|$|E
