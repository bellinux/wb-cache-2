50|$|Bioprecipitation is {{the concept}} of rain-making {{bacteria}} and was proposed by David Sands from Montana State University before 1983. The formation of ice in clouds is required for snow and most rainfall. Dust and soot particles can serve as ice nuclei, but biological ice nuclei are capable of catalyzing freezing at much warmer temperatures. The <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> currently known are mostly plant pathogens. Recent research suggests that bacteria may be present in clouds as part of an evolved process of dispersal.|$|E
5000|$|Kozloff's {{research}} in virology concentrated on bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria; {{he was part}} of the network of scientists studying similar problems known at the time as the [...] "phage group". Kozloff was particularly interested in the biochemistry of viral replication and was among the early users of radiolabeling to trace this process. While at Chicago, Kozloff and Frank Putnam reported the then-surprising discovery that a fraction of the phosphorus found in the DNA of a bacteriophage virus would be incorporated into the phage's progeny; this observation was important evidence in establishing the genetic role of DNA. While in Colorado, Kozloff developed a new {{research in}}terest in <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|E
40|$|Ice {{nucleation}} is a {{means by}} which the deposition of an airborne microorganism can be accelerated under favourable meteorological conditions. Analysis of 56 snow samples collected at the high-altitude observatory Jungfraujoch (3580  m a. s. l.) revealed an order-of-magnitude-larger dynamic range of ice-nucleating particles active at − 8  °C (INPs − 8) compared to the total number of bacterial cells (of which on average 60  % was alive). This indicates a shorter atmospheric residence time for INPs − 8. Furthermore, concentrations of INPs − 8 decreased much faster, with an increasing fraction of water precipitated from the air mass prior to sampling, than the number of total bacterial cells. Nevertheless, at high wind speeds (>  50  km h − 1) the ratio of INPs − 8 to total bacterial cells largely remained in a range between 10 − 2 and 10 − 3, independent of prior precipitation, likely because of recent injections of particles in regions upwind. Based on our field observations, we conclude that ice nucleators travel shorter legs of distance with the atmospheric water cycle than the majority of bacterial cells. A prominent <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Pseudomonas syringae, has been previously supposed to benefit from this behaviour as a means to spread via the atmosphere and to colonise new host plants. Therefore, we targeted this bacterium with a selective cultivation approach. P. syringae was successfully isolated {{for the first time at}} such an altitude in 3 of 13 samples analysed. Colony-forming units of this species constituted a minor fraction (10 − 4) of the numbers of INPs − 8 in these samples. Overall, our findings expand the geographic range of habitats where this bacterium has been found and corroborate theories on its robustness in the atmosphere and its propensity to spread to colonise new habitats...|$|R
40|$|Rainfall {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of climate, but the extent to which atmospheric ice nuclei (IN) influence its formation, quantity, frequency, and location is not clear. Microorganisms and other biological particles are released following rainfall and have been shown to serve as efficient IN, in turn impacting cloud and precipitation formation. Here we investigated potential long-term effects of IN on rainfall frequency and quantity. Differences in IN concentrations and rainfall after and before days of large rainfall accumulation (i. e., key days) were calculated for measurements made over the past century in southeastern and southwestern Australia. Cumulative differences in IN concentrations and daily rainfall quantity and frequency as a function of days from a key day demonstrated statistically significant increasing logarithmic trends (R 2 > 0. 97). Based on observations that cumulative effects of rainfall persisted for about 20 days, we calculated cumulative differences for the entire sequence of key days at each site to create a historical record of how the differences changed with time. Comparison of pre- 1960 and post- 1960 sequences most commonly showed smaller rainfall totals in the post- 1960 sequences, particularly in regions downwind from coal-fired power stations. This led us to explore the hypothesis that the increased leaf surface populations of IN-active bacteria due to rain led to a sustained but slowly diminishing increase in atmospheric concentrations of IN that could potentially initiate or augment rainfall. This hypothesis is supported by previous research showing that leaf surface populations of the <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacterium</b> Pseudomonas syringae increased by orders of magnitude after heavy rain and that microorganisms become airborne during and after rain in a forest ecosystem. At the sites studied in this work, aerosols that could have initiated rain from sources unrelated to previous rainfall events (such as power stations) would automatically have reduced the influences on rainfall of those whose concentrations were related to previous rain, thereby leading to inhibition of feedback. The analytical methods described here provide means to map and delimit regions where rainfall feedback mediated by microorganisms is suspected to occur or has occurred historically, thereby providing rational means to establish experimental set-ups for verification...|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} the culturable heterotrophic bacteria from oligotrophic high mountain lake habitats and tested their capability to induce ice formation. Direct plating {{was carried out}} using low-nutrient medium at a temperature of between 3 and 4 °C. As many as 84 isolates were recovered from glacial ice and natural biofilm growing on granite rocks surface. Six out of 84 isolates were capable of expressing the ice-nucleation phenotype. After autoclaving the cell suspension at 121 °C for 15 min, isolate J 78 {{was still able to}} retain the ability for ice formation. Heat-stable ice nuclei produced by <b>ice-nucleating</b> active <b>bacteria</b> have potential applications in biotechnology. Characterization of INA bacteria was performed employing live-dead Gram staining and molecular methods. Universal primers for Bacteria (S-D-Bact- 0008 -b-S- 20 and S-D-Bact- 1524 -a-A- 18) were used for PCR to amplify almost the full length of the 16 S rRNA genes of selected INA isolates. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis resulted in 2 unique patterns, as represented by J 43 and J 83, respectively. Based on DNA sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene, isolate J 43 (GeneBank accession no. AJ 864852) was closely related to Pseudomonas mephitica (99. 2 % sequence similarity) and Janthinobacterium lividum (99 % similarity), whereas isolate J 83 (GeneBank accession no. AJ 864859) showed 100 % sequence identity to Pseudomonas fluorescens...|$|R
50|$|Most known <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> are plant {{pathogens}}. These pathogens {{can cause}} freezing injury in plants. In the United States alone, {{it has been}} estimated that frost accounts for approximately $1 billion in crop damage each year. The ice-minus variant of P. syringae is a mutant, lacking the gene responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation. Both strains of P. syringae occur naturally, but recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes, enabling the creation of the ice-minus strain. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains. Should the ice-minus strain win out, the ice nucleate provided by P. syringae would no longer be present, lowering the level of frost development on plant surfaces at normal water freezing temperature (0°C).|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1983 in central Alberta, changes in the {{bacterial}} population inhabiting the leaves of field beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and canola (Brassica napus L. Altex) were studied to determine if <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> were present on these plants. Three colony types (white, yellow, and peach-colored) were found on field beans and canola leaves. Approximately 25 % of the isolates from the white colony group, which dominated the population, were <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria.</b> No <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> were present on canola leaves. Out {{of a total of}} 76 <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> isolated, 5 representative cultures were characterized in detail and identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens. The fatty acid composition of these cultures was essentially identical to that of typical P. fluorescens cultures and was altered by varying the growth temperature from 10 to 30 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of freeze-tolerant vertebrates requires that ice nucleation in tissues be initiated at relatively high temperatures. Three current hypotheses for {{the initiation of}} freezing in these animals are: a) inoculation by contact with ice crystals in the external environment; b) nucleation by <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> associated with the animal; and c) nucleation by ice-nucleating proteins in the blood. The available evidence indicates that ice inoculation {{is the most important}} mechanism under natural conditions, although <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> harbored in the gut or skin during winter may function as an auxiliary system to promote crystallization, albeit at slightly lower temperatures. Despite the intriguing similarities between the blood ice-nucleating agents of some vertebrates and those of certain freeze-tolerant invertebrates, these agents seem unlikely to play an analogous, adaptive role in freeze tolerance. KEY WORDS: Ice nucleation, inoculation, <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria,</b> ice-nucleating proteins, vertebrate freeze tolerance It is generally believed that the {{survival of}} freeze-tolerant animals is promoted by mechanisms that initiate tissue freezing at relatively high body temperatures. Theoretically, the amount of ice forming during nucleation is proportional to the degree of supercooling prio...|$|E
30|$|In this study, an A. johnsonii MB 44 strain was {{isolated}} from a frost-plant-tissue sample {{in the process}} of screening for <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Li et al. 2012). Bioassay reveals the significant virulence of this strain against the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. To date, the human-pathogen A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis have been reported for their pathogenicity against C. elegans (Vila-Farres et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2004). Therefore, to identify the potential virulence factors and better understand the molecular mechanism of its ability to infect nematodes, we performed genome sequencing of A. johnsonii MB 44. The genomic features and the potential nematode-virulent genes were reported herein.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria,</b> {{which are}} known to occur {{naturally}} on many crops and {{have been associated with}} frost damage, may be subject to control with genetically engineered bacteria, dubbed "ice-minus" bacteria. Ice-minus technology is designed to depress the critical temperature at which frost damage begins by displacing the natural population of ice-nucleating organisms. A trial product has been tested in the field with strawberries. Although tests with bacteriacidal compounds have suggested other mechanisms for controlling the critical temperature in deciduous fruit crops, ice-minus may prove to be effective. This analysis examines the possibility of ice-minus being adopted by New York tree-fruit growers and the likelihood of it causing a major economic impact on the state's fruit industry. Based on the climatology, phenology of fruit trees, and the record of actual frost damage in New York, the need for ice-minus is apparently not great enough to conclude that its adoption would cause a significant impact on New York fruit production.

40|$|Consistent {{temporal}} {{differences between}} ice nucleus concentrations after and before a heavy fall of rain {{have been found}} in four areas of Australia. Closely similar differences were found between rainfall quantity or frequency at 106 sites in south-eastern and 61 sites in south-western Australia that had > 92 years of daily rainfall records. The differences suggest an impulsive increase in ice nuclei or in rain on the day following heavy rain that decreased exponentially with time and was often still detectable after 20 days. The similarity of ice nucleus concentrations, bacterial populations, bioaerosols and rainfall responses to heavy rain strongly corroborate the involvement of biological ice nuclei in a rainfall feedback process. Cumulative differences of after-before rainfall amount or frequency for each rainfall event were next combined to form a historical record of the feedback process for each site. Comparison of cumulative totals pre- 1960 and post- 1960 showed differences bearing apparent relations to upwind coal-fired power stations, growth of metropolitan areas and increased areas of cultivation of wheat. These observations suggested that fungal spores or other bioaerosols as well as <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> were involved in the feedback. The overall conclusion is that interactions between micro-organisms, bioaerosols and rainfall have impacts over longer time spans and are stronger than have been previously described...|$|E
40|$|The site of ice {{nucleation}} in the freeze-tolerant, sub-Antarctic beetleHydromedion sparsutumhas been investigated. Ice+bacteria, {{active at}} above − 2. 0 °C, were {{isolated from the}} guts of beetles and identified as a fluorescentPseudomonasspecies. Other possible sites of nucleation, including the hemolymph, were examined but had a lower activity. Ice+bacteria were isolated from mixed populations, isolated from the guts of adult beetles, and grown on nutrient agar plates and in nutrient broth. Nucleation activity of the broth culture peaked after only 2 days {{although the number of}} live cells continued to increase until day 6. These cultures were used to determine the maximum nucleation activity of a bacterial suspension in sterile distilled water (− 3. 4 °C) and the dilution factor required to cause a 50 % reduction in activity (104). The original bacterial suspension had an absorbance of 0. 5 measured at 660 nm and contained 6 × 1011 bacteria per milliliter. From this it is estimated that only 1 in 106 bacteria possessed the highest levels of ice-nucleating activity. Other insect species, including Perimylops antarcticus,which are found in habitats similar to that ofH. sparsutum,were examined for the presence of ice+bacteria. All contained <b>ice-nucleating</b> <b>bacteria</b> in their guts but with a lower level of activity than in H. sparsutum...|$|E
