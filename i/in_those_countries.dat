Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty.

5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>countries</b> that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E

According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E

5|$|During {{and shortly}} after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were {{inserted}} into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11thand 12thcenturies, settlement <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>countries</b> was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked {{with the creation of}} a castle.|$|E

5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as survey vessels, training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>countries.</b> Starting in 1872, the members of the class began to be withdrawn from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken up {{or in the case of}} Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a naval mine storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In January 1952 Sihanouk re-appointed Penn Nouth {{as prime}} {{minister}} before leaving for France. Once there, Sihanouk wrote to French president Vincent Auriol requesting that he grant Cambodia full independence, citing widespread anti-French sentiment among the Cambodian populace. Auriol deferred Sihanouk's request to the French commissioner for overseas territories, Jean Letourneau, who promptly rejected it. Subsequently, Sihanouk traveled to Canada and the United States, where he gave radio interviews to present his case. He {{took advantage of the}} prevailing anti-communist sentiment <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>countries,</b> arguing that Cambodia faced a Communist threat {{similar to that of the}} Viet Minh in Vietnam, and that the solution was to grant full independence to Cambodia. Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in June 1953, taking up residence in Siem Reap. He organised public rallies calling for Cambodians to fight for independence, and formed a citizenry militia which attracted about 130,000 recruits.|$|E
