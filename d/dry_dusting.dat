40|$|A {{new system}} for {{sanitizing}} floors in hospital patient rooms has been developed. The method consists of <b>dry</b> <b>dusting</b> with a cotton-blend, chemically treated (10 % by dry mop weight) dust mop. This method was {{compared with a}} conventional cleaning protocol consisting of an initial predusting with the same nongermicidal chemical (3 % by dry mop weight) followed by wet mopping with a fresh solution of a quaternary ammonium disinfectant-detergent. Each of six rooms was sampled by using RODAC plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, Calif.) on 10 consecutive days {{for each of the}} two methods. The study was initially performed during the summer and then repeated during the winter. Results imply that there is {{no significant difference between the}} new dry method (81. 9 % CFU reduction) and the conventional method (83. 1 % CFU reduction). Furthermore, the initial <b>dry</b> <b>dusting</b> step in the conventional method accounted for virtually all of the reduction by that method. Thus, wet mopping with a germicidal chemical produced no additional significant reduction of natural microbial populations on environmental surfaces beyond that achieved by <b>dry</b> <b>dusting</b> with dust-suppressant chemicals...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has {{the objectives of}} finding out the concrete properties, which are, workability, unit weight, compressive strength, flexural strength and finding out an optimum composition of <b>dry</b> <b>dust</b> collector waste in the concrete mixture. In this research, 3 different kinds of concrete mixture were created based {{on the amount of}} waste substitution in the concrete. The examined concrete mixture compositions were the concrete with water cement ratio = 0. 68, with the waste substitution as much as 0 %, 10 %, and 20 % of sand weight. The mechanical behavior of the concrete was tested at the age of 28 days. The research results show that, an addition of <b>dry</b> <b>dust</b> collector waste in the concrete influence concrete workability, unit weight of concrete with 10 % waste as much as 2497, 44 kg/m 3. The concrete with 10 % waste had the higher unit weight compare with the normal concrete without waste. The <b>dry</b> <b>dust</b> collector waste substitution as much as 10 % in the concrete can improve compressive strength and flexural strength concrete. The compressive strength of the concrete increases as much as 21. 21 %, flexural strength of the concrete increases as much as 3. 48 %.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{designed}} to explore the hypothesis that settled dust in a domestic environment can contain significant levels of allergens and that common cleaning methods employed to remove dust can result in sufficient airborne exposure to potentially trigger an allergic reaction. Qualitative feedback from respondents in studies of furniture dusting habits indicated that household furniture dusting could elicit an allergic response. A consumer questionnaire was fielded to confirm the problem and it's magnitude. This indicated that it affected approximately 20 % of allergy sufferers (or approximately 5 % of the total UK population). Further work was performed to estimate the level of allergen exposure during dusting. Additional consumer research was fielded to ascertain the surface area being dusted, (approximately 54000 cm 2 for frequently dusted areas and 10000 cm 2 for frequently dusted areas). Domestic dusting habits were probed for the relative frequency of dusting method, which split evenly between <b>dry</b> <b>dusting,</b> wet dusting with water and wet dusting with a furniture polish. Surface sampling techniques were adapted to make in-home measurements of the rate of dust settling which {{was found to be}} approximately 3. 19 x 10 - 7 g. cm- 2,day- 1. In-home sampling was also undertaken to measure the mean allergen content of surface dust for major allergens, yielding 24667 ng. g- 1 combined dust mite, 47696 ng. g- 1 Fel d 1 and approximately 126 8 08 ng. g- 1 Can f 1. Laboratory-based studies determined the relative amount of dust rendered airborne during dusting of different furniture surface types and comparing different cleaning methods. This was found to be between 2. 3 - 43. 0 %. From these experiments, a model "average" home was constructed and used to estimate the exposure towards dust allergens during a typical dusting task. Exposure was estimated to be as much as 16500 ng total dust mite, 124000 mug (31000 mU) cat allergen and 275000 ng (IU) dog allergen per dusting method. These results indicated that allergen exposure, under certain circumstances, could exceed the threshold levels that have been proposed for the onset of sensitisation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{increased}} risk of asthma symptoms has previously been shown in 772 pine sawmill workers. The aim {{of the current study}} was to assess the association between dust exposure, lung function and atopy. Subjects with (n 559) and without (n 5167) asthma symptoms were randomly selected from the previous survey. Lung function and atopy were determined using spirometry and skin-prick tests, respectively. Inhalable dust levels were measured on the same day. The geometric mean dust concentration was 0. 52 mg?m- 3. Exposure to dry but not to green dust was associated with asthma symptoms. Green dust was associated with atopic sensitisation, particularly against outdoor allergens; no association was found for <b>dry</b> <b>dust.</b> Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow were significantly lower in workers exposed to high levels of green dust (- 350 mL,- 260 mL and- 860 mL?s- 1, respectively) and <b>dry</b> <b>dust</b> (- 230 mL,- 190 mL and- 850 mL?s- 1, respectively). These associations were observed both in subjects with and without asthma symptoms. No associations with cross-shift changes in lung function were found.

40|$|Since guanine is {{not only}} an {{essential}} constituent of vital nucleic acids, but also the main end product of nitrogenous waste excretion in arachnids, it is a potential candidate for a hygienic index for mite activity in house dust. The public health significance of these mites is based on their production of allergen in the home environment. In 101 mattress-dust samples, total number of mites and guanine content were positively correlated. The hygienic standard of 10 mites per 0. 1 g dust (as derived from Danish investigations) was met in all samples with less than 0. 06 % guanine in the <b>dry</b> <b>dust.</b> Where the guanine content was more than or equal to 0. 25 % in the <b>dry</b> <b>dust,</b> mite numbers were higher than 10 mites per 0. 1 g dust in 43 of the 44 samples.
