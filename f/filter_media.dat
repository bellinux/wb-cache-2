In all applications, the morphology of the <b>filtering</b> <b>media</b> influences its performance in one way or anothe.

Understanding the flow, transport and reaction/adsorption processes at the pore scale is important for explaining and interpreting the overall performance of such <b>filtering</b> <b>media.</b> In certain cases an effective media approach, which accounts for the filter media/membrane morphology in an average way (e. g., via porosity) can provide useful information.

Reactive flows in porous media are an important process in many filtration areas, e. g. • In water management, including functionalized membranes for water purifications; • Air treatment, e. g., active carbon air filters; • Antibacterial barriers for medical purposes; • Catalytic filters, etc. Understanding these processes and their dependence on chemical and morphological parameters poses a number of research and development challenges. Since, these processes are usually truly multiscale, developing algorithms for simulating them poses problems that have be addressed. An important component of these algorithms is the pore scale simulation on images coming from 3 D-μCT.

25|$|Bioretention basins provide similar {{flow control}} {{and water quality}} {{treatment}} functions to bioretention swales but {{do not have a}} conveyance function. In addition to the filtration and biological uptake functions of bioretention systems, basins also provide extended detention of stormwater to maximise runoff treatment during small to medium flow events. The term raingarden is also used to describe such systems but usually refers to smaller, individual lot-scale bioretention basins. Bioretention basins have the advantage of being applicable at a range of scales and shapes and therefore have ﬂexibility in their location within developments. Like other bioretention systems, they are often located along streets at regular intervals to treat runoff prior to entry into the drainage system. Alternatively, larger basins can provide treatment for larger areas, such as at the outfalls of a drainage system. A wide range of vegetation can be used within a bioretention basin, allowing them to be well integrated into the surrounding landscape design. Vegetation species that tolerate periodic inundation should be selected. Bioretention basins are however, sensitive to any materials that may clog the <b>ﬁlter</b> <b>media.</b> Basins are often used in conjunction with gross pollutant traps (GPTs or litter traps, include widely used trash racks), and coarser sediment basins, which capture litter and other gross solids to reduce the potential for damage to the vegetation or <b>ﬁlter</b> <b>media</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{bacterial}} {{populations are}} found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time.|$|E
25|$|To {{clean the}} filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, {{opposite}} the normal direction (called backflushing or backwashing) to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown {{up through the}} bottom of the filter to break up the compacted <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> to aid the backwashing process; this is known as air scouring. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.|$|E
40|$|Granular <b>media</b> <b>filters</b> are {{commonly}} used to remove suspended solids and prevent emitter clogging in microirrigation systems. Silica sand is the standard <b>filtering</b> <b>media</b> but other granular materials {{can be used for}} this purpose. The characterization of the pressure drop produced by the clean <b>filtering</b> <b>media</b> is of practical interest for designing and managing these filters. Different models such as Ergun or Kozeny-Carman equations are usually used to predict pressure drop produced by the <b>filtering</b> <b>media.</b> However, as parameters of the media such as equivalent diameter and sphericity, that are difficult to determine, appear in these equations, the objective {{of this study was to}} construct a new model to estimate the pressure drop of different filtering materials of interest in granular filters with limited data of the physical parameters that characterize the <b>filtering</b> <b>media.</b> This paper, taking as starting point the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), develops a new algorithm hybridizing it with the artificial bee colony (ABC) method, to estimate the pressure drop in granular filters broadly used in microirrigation systems for the first time with a data-driven model. Laboratory experiments were used to measure pressure drop across silica sand, crushed glass, modified glass and glass microspheres in a scaled filter at surface velocities ranging from 0. 004 to 0. 025 m s − 1. The ABC method allows the tuning of the MARS parameters during the training phase improving significantly the regression accuracy. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and M 5 model tree were fitted to the experimental data for comparison purposes. The results have shown that ABC-MARS-based model was the best estimation of the pressure drop with a coefficient of determination of 0. 78. Therefore, ABC-MARS-based model could be easily implemented to predict pressure drop with minimal input parameters for other filtering materials used in microirrigation media filtersAuthors wish to acknowledge the computational support provided by the Department of Mathematics at University of Oviedo as well as financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grant AGL 2015 - 63750 -...|$|R

40|$|Pleated {{filters are}} broadly used for various applications. In certain cases, {{especially}} in solid-liquid separation case, the <b>filtering</b> <b>media</b> may get deflected {{and that may}} change the overall performance characteristics of the filter. From the modeling point of view, this is a challenging multiphysics problem, namely {{the interaction of the}} fluid with a so-called poroelastic structure. This work focuses on the development of an algorithm for the simulation of the Fluid Porous Structure Interaction (FPSI) problem in the case of pleated <b>filtering</b> <b>media.</b> The first part of the work is concerned with the development of a robust and accurate numerical method for solving the Stokes-Brinkman system of equations on quadrilateral grids. The mathematical model describes a free fluid flow coupled with a flow in porous media in a domain that contains the <b>filtering</b> <b>media.</b> To discretize the complex computational domain we use quadrilateral boundary fitted grids which resolve porous-fluid interfaces. The Stokes-Brinkman system of equations is discretized here using a sophisticated finite volume method, namely multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) O-method. MPFA is widely used, e. g., in solving scalar elliptic equations with full tensor and highly varying coefficients and/or solving on heterogeneous non-orthogonalgrids. Up to the authors’ knowledge, there was no investigation of MPFA discretization for Stokes-Brinkman problems, and this study aims to fill this gap. Some numerical experiments are presented in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed numerical algorithm[1]. The second part of this study focuses on the coupling of the flow model with the deflection of the <b>filtering</b> <b>media.</b> For the consideration of the FPSI problem in 3 D, the classical Biot system describes coupled flow and deformations in a porous body due to difference in the upstream and downstream pressures. Solving the Biot system of equations is complicated and requires a significant amount of computational time. In many pleated industrial filters, the thickness of the <b>filtering</b> <b>media</b> is small compared to the longitudinal dimensions and therefore the porous structure can be modeled as poroelastic plate [2] or poroelastic shell. We use a poroelastic shell model for linear elasticity to resolve the U-shaped pleated filters. Our numerical studies show that in many cases this approach gives accurate results. The so-called weak coupling approach is used to simulate the interaction between the flow and the elasticity problem...|$|R

25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and <b>filter</b> <b>media,</b> thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable loadings, trickling filter beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content. The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> and ponding on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E
