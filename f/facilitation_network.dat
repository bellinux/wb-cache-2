40|$|Ponencia presentada en el 12 th European Ecological Federation Congress celebrado en Ávila del 25 al 29 de septiembre de 2011 Complex {{network theory}} {{recently}} has been expanded {{to the analysis}} of multi-species plant communities in which more than 90 % of the species recruit succesfully only through facilitation beneath the canopies of perennial plants. In networks established among plant species, many of these facilitative interactions occurring between a benefactor (nurse) and a beneficiary (facilitated species) turn into competition over time are mainly restricted to closely related taxa. In this study we show how the overall (i. e. nestedness and connectance) and the phylogenetic structure of <b>facilitation</b> <b>networks</b> in semi-arid communities change when facilitation turns into competition and some of the early species associations established by facilitation disappear. We show that the initial <b>facilitation</b> <b>networks</b> retain the overall, but not the phylogenetic, structure. Phylogenetic analyses show that as seedlings, facilitated species tend to associate with the same subset of nurses while, on the contrary, nurses are indifferent to the identity of their facilitated seedlings. However, when competition becomes important, closely related nurse species appear associated only with a subset of facilitated species in the community. These temporal rearrangements in the phylogenetic structure of the <b>facilitation</b> <b>networks</b> provide evidence that ecological communities are assembled by highly species-specific networks in which the phylogenetic history has a pervasive influence not only on recruitment but also on adult community composition. The use of phylogenetic methods combined with complex network approaches opens the possibility to understand the complexity of ecological interactions occurring in nature as a way to predict coextinction cascades following species removal from ecosystems.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis poses the question, What {{is the nature}} of the relationships between social embeddedness, structural efficiency, and organizational behavior within dark networks? The objectives of this thesis are twofold. The primary objective is to illuminate the interaction between embeddedness, structure, and activity within dark networks, the aim being to study if changes in embeddedness manifest in observable fluctuations in a network’s topography or behavior. The secondary objective is to evaluate the results of a novel, permutation-based methodology. Throughout, this thesis combines qualitative elements of social movement theory and social network analysis with quantitative statistical techniques to provide a mixed-method examination of three empirical dark network case studies (the Provisional Irish Republican Army, the Noordin Top Terrorist Network, and a Southeast Asian Foreign Fighter <b>Facilitation</b> <b>network).</b> The results of both the qualitative and quantitative methods are synthesized to highlight the strengths and limitations associated with each approach. This thesis reveals that, although embeddedness may contribute to rapid mobilization or organizational security, exogenous factors such as network shocks and endogenous variations in core membership may preclude such advantages from influencing internal network structure. Finally, this thesis recommends potential intelligence applications and areas for future social network research. Captain, United States ArmyMajor, United States Arm...|$|E

40|$|Ponencia presentada en la 24 th Annual Conference of the Plant Population Biology celebrada en Oxford del 2 al 4 de junio de 2011 Plant {{facilitation}} is {{a positive}} ecological interaction that has been important in preserving biodiversity over evolutionary time, with recent lineages conserving the regeneration niches of older, distant lineages. The outcome of this interaction occurring between distantly related species is that communities assembled by facilitation are characterized by high values of phylogenetic diversity. Interestingly, although facilitation turns into competition with increasing taxa relatedness, many facilitative interactions remain between adult plants indicating that facilitation can be considered an ecological assembly rule. Thus, through the study of phylogenetic signatures left by facilitation and competition we can distinguish b etween different community dynamics like directional succession and cyclical replacement sequence. However, to fully understand how plant facilitation preserves biodiversity in complex ecological communities, {{it is necessary to}} move from the study of pairwise interactions to the <b>network</b> approach. <b>Facilitation</b> <b>networks</b> have similar structure as mutualistic networks and contain different phylogenetic signals depending on the relative importance of facilitation and competition. Experimental work supports that the phylogenetic relationships among co-occurring species in multispecific assemblages can predict both individual performance and species coexistence.

40|$|Interest in how {{industrial}} production could {{be adapted to}} promote sustainable development has increased in recent decades worldwide. Industrial symbiosis (where one company’s unwanted materials become the input for another company) is one approach to reducing {{the environmental impact of}} production, which itself has attracted widespread policy interest. The UK’s National Industrial Symbiosis Programme has become known internationally {{as an example of a}} successful industrial symbiosis initiative, attracting both academic interest and policy imitation. However, the suitability of industrial symbiosis development initiatives to be transferred between geographic contexts is a largely neglected issue in industrial symbiosis literature. Practice replication can be viewed as a knowledge transfer process. In order to address that issue, this study adopts a theoretical framework drawn from the knowledge transfer literature, which suggests that language skills, technical assistance and expertise are among the factors influencing the success of international attempts at practice replication. The knowledge transfer literature, however, has focussed on commercial activity, i. e., firms’ primary activities, not environmental initiatives such as industrial symbiosis. Theoretical framework on knowledge transfer is therefore adopted to study the topic. The research aims to provide a deeper understanding of factors affecting the process of replicating one country’s industrial symbiosis development practice to another. A European Commission funded project replicating the UK’s industrial symbiosis <b>network</b> <b>facilitation</b> approach to the Tianjin Binhai New Area of China has been selected to conduct an in-depth case study. This case study can be viewed as a transnational knowledge transfer practice. In addition, this research used a knowledge transfer perspective to inform an in-depth analysis of the organisation of National Industrial Symbiosis Programme. Also, it conducted the analysis of policy context affecting industrial symbiosis activities in the UK and China to provide a background of industrial symbiosis development in the two countries. Qualitative research methods such as semi-structured interviews and participant observation have been used to collect data. This research contributes to knowledge transfer theory through proposing a knowledge-based model illustrating the process of knowledge development within an organisation and the process of transnational knowledge transfer from the knowledge source to another. Also, factors affecting the process of transnational knowledge transfer have been summarised. In addition, the research provides a deeper understanding of a industrial symbiosis <b>network</b> <b>facilitation</b> approach which has been widely cited as an industrial symbiosis development exemplar.

The orientation of the signal line was either parallel (iso-) or orthogonal (ortho-) to its motion direction and it was identical in all respects to the noise (orientation, length and speed) except for its motion direction, rendering the signal line indistinguishable from the noise on a frame-to-frame basis. We found that discrimination of ortho-trajectories was generally better than iso-trajectories. Discrimination of ortho-trajectories was largely immune to the effects of spatial jitter in the trajectory, and to variations in step size and line-length. Discrimination of iso-trajectories was reliable provided that step-size was not too short and did not exceed line length, and that the trajectory was straight. The new result that trajectory discrimination in moving line elements is modulated by line orientation suggests that ortho- and iso-trajectory discrimination rely upon two distinct mechanisms: iso-motion discrimination involves a ‘motion-streak’ process that combines motion information with information about orientation parallel to the motion trajectory, while ortho-motion discrimination involves extended trajectory <b>facilitation</b> in a <b>network</b> of receptive fields with orthogonal orientation tuning...|$|R
