5|$|Allardyce {{has been}} criticised for alleged {{corruption}} and has twice {{been the subject}} of undercover investigations. In September 2006, he and his son, Craig, were implicated in a BBC Panorama documentary for taking bribes, allegations which they denied. In September 2016, undercover Daily Telegraph reporters posing as businessmen recorded him offering to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get around FA third party ownership rules and provisionally agreeing a £400,000 contract. Following the Daily Telegraph investigation, Allardyce resigned as England manager in a mutual agreement with the Football Association on 27 September.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E

5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees.

5|$|The league {{was unusually}} competitive; {{a mistake in}} early April caused Benfica to lose much of their lead. Qualifying for the Portuguese Cup final did not <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> gather momentum. In early May, Benfica {{suffered}} a major blow, losing away to Penafiel and dropping to second. A crucial win against Sporting brought back thei title hope, and a week later Benfica won their first league title in ten seasons. The season ended with a loss against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal Final, preventing Benfica from winning their first double since 1987.|$|E

5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders {{defeated}} the Sharks 36-8 in the qualifier round. For the semi-final the Crusaders {{had to cross}} the Indian Ocean to Cape Town to play the Stormers. Despite travelling 11,000km the Crusaders {{defeated the}} Stormers 29-10 in a convincing display. The Crusaders faced the Reds in the Final and yet more travel. The Crusaders and Reds were matched evenly at 13-13 after exchanging a try apiece and two penalty's. However, Will Genia scored a crucial try for the Reds in the 68th minute to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> an 18–13 win. The Crusaders lost the final to the Queensland Reds at the Suncorp Stadium. Despite not winning the title in 2011, the trials the Crusaders overcame to even make the final, made this season one of the Crusaders finest.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to transmute {{the whole}} country, Father {{transports}} the Elrics to his base {{to use them}} as {{two of the five}} sacrifices required to achieve his goal. At the same moment, Alphonse finds his original body, but refuses to recover it because its weakened state would not <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fight the homunculi. In the final fight against Father, Alphonse requests help from the alchemist May Chang to return Edward's right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. As Edward, with his restored arm, fights Father, Alphonse's soul disappears from the armor. Following Father's defeat, Edward sacrifices his ability to use alchemy to restore Alphonse's soul and original body. The two return to Resembool, where they live until they decide to separate to study alchemy. Alphonse joins with two chimera comrades and they travel to the country of Xing to learn more alchemy with May's help.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs {{must be able to}} move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
