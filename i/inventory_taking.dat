50|$|On 4 July 2011 the seven-member expert team {{tasked with}} taking {{stock of the}} temple assets decided to {{postpone}} opening of Chamber 'B'. This chamber is sealed with an iron door {{with the image of}} a cobra on it and it has not been opened, due to the belief opening it would result in much misfortune. The royal family said that many legends were attached to the temple and that chamber B has a model of a snake on the main door and opening it could be a bad omen. The seven-member team will consult with some more experts on 8 July 2011 and then they may take the final decision on opening of chamber 'B'. An Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in the Temple to discern the will of the Lord revealed that any attempts to open Chamber 'B' would cause Divine displeasure and that the holy articles in the other chambers were defiled in the inventorying process. The original petitioner whose court action led to the <b>inventory</b> <b>taking,</b> T.P. Sundarajan, died in July 2011, adding credence to those who believe in the folklore around the temple. Prior to this now-famous incident in July 2011, one of the several vaults in the Temple which was not any of the Vaults B (untouched after the 1880s) or G or H (both rediscovered supposedly by the Amicus Curie only in mid-2014), was opened in 1931. This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewelry encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds. Besides these, were four more chests of old coins (not of gold), and they were carried back to the Palace and State Treasuries for counting. from.|$|E

40|$|Following the Communication of Vice-President de Palacio to the Commission, dated 30 April 2004 on the {{implementation}} of nuclear inspection and safeguards tasks within the European Union, {{there have been a}} number of discussions with the Member States on this subject. These discussions have been related to and concentrated on, among other aspects, the improvement of future nuclear safeguards effectiveness and efficiency within the Community. This debate resulted in a 'non-paper' issued by the Council¿s Working Party on Atomic Questions (WPAQ) entitled ¿A New Framework for Euratom Safeguards¿. The WPAQ non-paper describes audits as a tool that can play a role in problem resolution and to check that the relevant standards are in place and being implemented effectively. Since the publication of the WPAQ non-paper, the Commission has undertaken the necessary steps to organise trial audits in a number of nuclear facilities in order to evaluate this new tool for the verification of the performance of the operator's nuclear material accounting and control (NMAC) systems. This paper is a report on the initial planning, preparation, and organisation of the first audit trials to be carried out as part of the proposed new framework related to the nuclear safeguards approach of the Commission for nuclear installations in the European Union. It details the overall methodology used and the work associated with the audit of the specific safeguards related site procedures for Physical <b>Inventory</b> <b>Taking</b> and of the control of monitoring and measurement devices in place for the control of the nuclear material within the plants.

40|$|In {{the area}} of {{production}} the primary goal is to produce a product that meets (or exceeds) customer expectations. This requires that one first obtains statistical control of the process at some desired level of operation. Once this is accomplished, one looks for ways to reduce variations around that level. The authors take corrective actions only when statistical control charts indicate that some undesirable change has occurred. They do not, for example, concern themselves {{with the possibility of}} relatively small changes that routine control chart tests do not detect. Relatively small biases are of no great concern. However, significant deviations from the desired level of operation are of great concern. In {{the area of}} materials accountability the situation is somewhat different. Here the primary goal is to maintain the best possible records of material <b>inventories</b> <b>taking</b> into account the measuring uncertainties that are associated with such inventories. In addition to the variations of individual values around averages (precision), the authors must also concern themselves with those deviations in averages from their true values (biases). The authors are faced with the problem of knowing true values with exactness, and they are faced with the problem of needing to identify those relatively small biases that behave as random variables while exhibiting little or no statistical significance...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance and}} modernise the Nuclear Material Accountancy and Control (NMAC) at Mayak RT- 1 {{reprocessing}} plant {{the concept of}} near real time accountancy (NRTA) is applied. A defence in depth concept is proposed with the superposition of the following barriers: (i) 	continuous survey of the functional status, (ii) 	the follow-up of the nuclear material (NM) flow and inventory, (iii) 	Near real time control of declared NM in processed solutions, (iv) 	Periodical Physical <b>Inventory</b> <b>Takings</b> and Verifications. The combination of an operational network architecture, allowing automatic data acquisition and an efficient plant-specific data analysis and interpretation software enables to follow in near real-time the NM flow and inventory through the plant. The JRC data analysis and interpretation kernel DAI integrated with the commercial data historian Wizcon is proposed to establish the RT- 1 specific NM monitoring software tool. The data analysis focuses firstly {{on a combination of}} the pressure signals (for level and density) and the temperature signal, determining the total volume. This is then combined with the volume concentration measurement performed by the hybrid K-edge to derive the total mass of nuclear material. Once the complete system is validated, it can be applied also to other Russian reprocessing plants at Seversk and Zheleznogorsk. JRC. G. 8 -Nuclear safeguard...|$|R

Having applied the uncertainties, the network system adjusts itself to contain more inventories and, hence, requires the production level to increase, to match the extra <b>inventory.</b> <b>Taking</b> the new production levels of the plants from the second iteration from the analytical model, the simulation-based optimization model is then run again to obtain a new solution of the TSLs of the warehouses, distribution centers, and retailers under uncertainties (Step 4).|$|E
