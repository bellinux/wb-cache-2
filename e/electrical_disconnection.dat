50|$|Micro-blinds—currently under {{development}} at the National Research Council (Canada)—control the amount of light passing through in response to applied voltage. Micro-blinds are composed of rolled thin metal blinds on glass. They are very small and thus practically invisible to the eye. The metal layer is deposited by magnetron sputtering and patterned by laser or lithography process. The glass substrate includes {{a thin layer of}} a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. A thin insulator is deposited between the rolled metal layer and the TCO layer for <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection.</b> With no applied voltage, the micro-blinds are rolled and let light pass through. When there is a potential difference between the rolled metal layer and the transparent conductive layer, the electric field formed between the two electrodes causes the rolled micro-blinds to stretch out and thus block light. The micro-blinds have several advantages, including switching speed (milliseconds), UV durability, customized appearance and transmission. Theoretically, the blinds are simple and cost-effective to fabricate.A video available on YouTube describes briefly the micro-blinds.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter Left Atrial <b>Electrical</b> <b>Disconnection.</b> An effective, catheter-based {{treatment}} for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) remains elusive. This study assessed {{the feasibility of}} transcatheter left atrial (LA) <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> {{and its effect on}} AF inducibility. METHOD AND RESULTS: Thirteen anesthetized swine underwent noncontact mapping of the right atrium (RA) during coronary sinus (CS) pacing. Sites of earliest RA activation were identified using isopotential maps. An ablation catheter was navigated to these sites and a cluster of radiofrequency (RF) lesions applied until earliest activation shifted to a new site. The procedure was repeated until the atria were electrically disconnected. AF induction was attempted before and after ablation. Earliest RA activation was the CS os during proximal CS pacing and Bachmann's bundle during distal CS pacing. These two sites were successfully ablated in all 13 animals. Earliest activation then shifted to the fossa ovalis. RF energy was applied at a median of 2. 5 sites (range 1 to 5) around the fossa, then at sites in the triangle of Koch, septum, cavotricuspid isthmus, and posterior wall. Atrial <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> was achieved in 10 of 13 animals (5 LA <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection,</b> 3 RA <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection,</b> 2 biatrial <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> with complete heart block). After atrial <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection,</b> the LA became electrically silent. Before ablation, AF was inducible in every animal. After atrial <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection,</b> AF was inducible in 3 of 10 animals. CONCLUSION: Atrial <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> is feasible using noncontact mapping and RF ablation. Successful <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> of the atria reduces AF inducibility.

40|$|Capturing, {{separation}} and removal of thin, evasive, and often transparent membranes {{attached to the}} underlying tissue is typically a very difficult task in vitreoretinal surgery. The most challenging part of such procedures is in initial separation of the membrane, which then allows for a strong grip of the micro-tweezers holding it from two sides. Attempts of performing this procedure often lead to piercing and otherwise damaging the underlying tissue. Accordingly, {{there is a need}} for devices that could attach to tissue in a minimally-traumatic manner approaching it from only one side. It is desirable that such a device would attach to a tissue on a push of a button and release it on demand. We developed a technique that allows for strong attachment of an electrode to tissue with a single <b>electrical</b> pulse, and <b>disconnection</b> of it from the tissue with a different pulse. Adhesion does not require any electrical support after the pulse, and the adhesive forces generated on a wire electrode of 50 µm in diameter are sufficient for manipulation of all types of cellular and non-cellular intraocular tissues. To reduce electroporation-related tissue damage the bipolar train of pulses is applied with burst duration 50 – 200 µs. At optimal pulse parameters the tissue damage is limited to a single layer of cells adjacent to the surface of electrode. Electrically-induced adhesion is very convenient for lifting and manipulation of vitreoretinal membranes. It can also be used for attachment of a needle to a membrane for injection of liquid into the sub-membrane space, thus separating the membrane from the underlying tissue without peeling. Similarly, injection of medication into small retinal blood vessels can be performed without insertion of the needle into it...|$|R

Mapping showed sharp potentials (SVC potentials) inside the SVC. Activation spread from the earliest SVC potential (breakthrough) {{to the rest of the}} SVC. SVC potentials were found over a large amount of the circumference, suggesting widespread muscle coverage of the SVC. Breakthroughs from the RA to SVC were located anteriorly, laterally, posteriorly, and septally in 3, 4, 10, and 6 patients, respectively. The number of breakthroughs was 1. 40. 5 per patient.

MethodsEighty highly symptomatic patients (age, 58. 6 ± 8. 9 years) with persistent (n = 43) and permanent AF (n = 37), refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs, were randomized to two different ablation approaches guided by electroanatomical mapping. A procedure including circumferential pulmonary vein, mitral isthmus, and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was performed in 41 cases (left atrial ablation group). In the remaining 39 patients (biatrial ablation group), the aforementioned approach was integrated by the following lesions in the right atrium: intercaval posterior line, intercaval septal line, and <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> of the superior vena cava.

In 7 patients with AF, these parameters were compared before and after the catheter ablation. The FPD was significantly longer and the RMS 20 was smaller in the patients with AF than those without AF. Because RMS 30 was widely distributed between 2 and 10 µV, the AF group was sub-divided into two groups; Group 1 was comprised of the patients with an RMS 30 ≧ 5. 0 µV, and group 2, < 5. 0 µV.

After step 2 ablation, only 1 PV in 4 patients (8 %) could be electrically isolated. Charring on the ablation catheter tip was seen in 15 (33 %) of the cases. In 23 patients, all PVs were isolated with the conventional thermocool catheter, and in 22 patients only the right PVs were isolated with the conventional catheter.

A series of ohmically heated L-mode plasma discharges is investigated with line-averaged plasma density ranging from n_e/n_G = 0. 15 to 0. 42, where n_G is the Greenwald density. All ion saturation current time series that are sampled in the far scrape-off layer are characterized by large-amplitude burst events. Coefficients of skewness and excess kurtosis of the time series obey a quadratic relationship and their histograms coincide partially upon proper normalization. Histograms of the ion saturation current time series are found to agree well with a prediction of a stochastic model for the particle density fluctuations in scrape-off layer plasmas. The distribution of the waiting times between successive large-amplitude burst events and of the burst amplitudes are approximately described by exponential distributions. The average waiting time and burst amplitude are found to vary weakly with the line-averaged plasma density. Conditional averaging reveals that the radial blob velocity, estimated from floating potential measurements, increases with the normalized burst amplitude in the outboard mid-plane scrape-off layer. For low density discharges, the conditionally averaged waveform of the floating potential associated with large amplitude bursts at the divertor probes has a dipolar shape.

Seven-day Holter monitor recordings were performed off antiarrhythmic drugs at 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -month follow-up, and patients were requested to visit the hospital in the event of ongoing palpitations. All follow-up patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 with a follow-up of less than 1 year and group 2 patients completing a 1 -year follow-up. Results: Overall, 338 of 339 targeted PVs (99 %) were isolated with the PVAC with a mean of 24 ± 9 RF applications per patient, a mean total procedure time of 125 ± 28 minutes, and a mean fluoroscopy time of 21 ± 13 minutes. Freedom from AF off antiarrhythmic drugs was found in 82 and 79 % of group 1 and group 2 patients, respectively. No procedure-related complications were observed. Conclusion: PV isolation by duty-cycled unipolar/bipolar RF ablation can be effectively and safely performed with a circular, decapolar catheter. Twelve-month follow-up data compare favorably with early postablation results, indicating stable effects over time. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 21, pp. 399 – 405, April 2010...|$|E
40|$|Background Patients late after open-heart surgery {{may develop}} dual-loop {{reentrant}} atrial arrhythmias, and mapping and catheter ablation remain challenging despite computer-assisted mapping techniques. Objectives The {{purpose of the}} study was to demonstrate the prevalence and characteristics of dual-loop reentrant arrhythmias, and to define the optimal mapping and ablation strategy. Methods Fourty consecutive patients (mean age 52 +/- 12 years) with intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) after open-heart surgery (with an incision of the right atrial free wall) were studied. Dual-loop IART was defined as the presence of two simultaneous atrial circuits. Following an abrupt tachycardia change during radiofrequency (RF) ablation, <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> of the targeted reentry isthmus from the remaining circuit was demonstrated by entrainment mapping. Furthermore, the second circuit loop was localized using electroanatomic mapping and/or entrainment mapping. Results Dual-loop IART was demonstrated in 8 patients (20 %, 5 patients with congenital heart disease, 3 with acquired heart disease). Dual-loop IART included an isthmus-dependant atrial flutter combined with a reentry related to the atriotomy scar. The diagnosis of dual-loop IART required the comparison of entrainment mapping before and after tachycardiamodification. Overall, 35 patients had successful RF ablation (88 %). Success rates were lower in patients with dual-loop IART than in patient without dual-loop IART. Ablation failures in 3 patients with dual-loop IART were related to the inability to properly transect the second tachycardia isthmus in the right atrial free wall. Conclusions Dual-loop IART is relatively common after heart surgery involving a right atriotomy. Abrupt tachycardia change and specific entrainment mapping maneuvers demonstrate these circuits. Electroanatomic mapping appears to be important to assist catheter ablation of periatriotomy circuits...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Electrophysiological {{studies in}} {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation demonstrated the presence of etectrical conduction between superior and inferior left pulmonary veins (PVs) that makes <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> of individual PVs difficult. Anatomically, the prevalence, sizes, and locations of the interpulmonary connections have not been investigated systematically. METHODS We retrieved 112 PVs from 28 patients who died from noncardiac causes (43 +/- 13 years, 17 mates). Dissections of subepicardial myocardial strands at the venoatrial junctions were made in 10 hearts, and histological sections {{were made in the}} remaining 18 hearts. RESULTS We found histological variations in the muscular width of the interpulmonary isthmus between ipsilateral left and right PVs (2. 7 +/- 0. 5 mm vs 1. 7 +/- 0. 5 mm; P <. 05). Histologic sections of 15 hearts revealed myocardial strands 0. 2 - 3. 5 mm thick crossing obliquely at the Left isthmus in 53 %, at the right isthmus in 33 %, and at both isthmuses in 14 % of hearts to connect with the myocardial sleeves of adjacent veins. In 40 % of hearts there were additional direct bridges connecting the anterior or posterior watts of the veins. The crossing myocardial strands were at the epicardial (27 % of hearts), subendocardial (53 % of hearts), and both (20 %) aspects of the PV wall. The mean distance between the endocardium of the interpulmonary isthmus to the muscular connections was 2. 5 +/- 0. 5 mm in the Left-sided PVs and 1. 5 +/- 0. 5 mm in the right-sided PVs. CONCLUSIONS Crossing myocardial strands and bridges at the interpulmonary isthmus may be the anatomical substrate for electrical connection between superior and inferior PVs and may have implications for local PV isolation {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation. 4. 559 JCR (2009) Q 1, 12 / 95 Cardiac & cardiovascular system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication, micro-machining, and characterization of novel multifunctional nanocomposite polymers for flexible microsystems. Various elastomers, primarily polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone based elastomer, are chosen as substrate materials {{to create new}} flexible microsystems because of numerous benefits of PDMS including flexibility, biocompatibility, low cost, low toxicity, high oxidative and thermal stability, optical transparency, low permeability to water, low electrical conductivity, and ease of micropatterning. However, most devices to date based on PDMS are passive, as making active devices out of PDMS is extremely challenging. When PDMS is bonded to substrates with conventionally-realized active components like electrodes, heaters, sensors, actuators, etc., it is rendered inflexible – defeating one of its key benefits. For example, the common method of bonding PDMS with glass renders the resulting devices completely inflexible. If metals or alloys are deposited on PDMS, the weak adhesion between them and PDMS leads to microcracks when the substrates are flexed,bent,or twisted. This leads to <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> and device failure. The focus of this thesis {{is the development of}} novel approaches to the realization of active-component based highly flexible microsystems employing PDMS and/or other elastomer materials. To overcome problems with incorporating active devices while maintaining system flexibility, various new materials and methods of microfabricating them are developed. These newly developed electrically conductive and magnetic nanocomposite polymers deliver flexibility similar to undoped and insulating PDMS, yet provide functionality for active device development similar to the inclusion of inflexible metals and other functional materials. These new polymers can also be easily micromicromolded using conventional PDMS processing, such as soft lithography techniques. A new hybrid microfabrication process for combining micromolded nanocomposite with undoped PDMS polymer is also developed to demonstrate the potential of the new polymers to be incorporated into fully flexible systems containing active components. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is also explored as a new molding substrate for small and large area microfabrication. Applications of these multifunctional nanocomposites include shape-conformable microelectrodes, hard magnetic microactuators, signal routing for Lab on a Chip (LOC) and many other devices requiring flexible microsystems and electronics...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comTreatment options for atrial fibrillation (AF) have evolved from simple, fluoroscopy-guided pulmonary vein isolation for those patients with paroxysmal AF to complex, multi-modality procedures targeting not only anatomic structures but also electrophysiologic phenomena including complex fractionated electrograms, sites of dominant frequency and local non-venous drivers in patients with persistent and permanent AF. The stepwise ablation approach is a novel technique whereby structures contributing to initiation and maintenance of AF are sequentially targeted by radiofrequency ablation. Broadly divided into pulmonary veins, left atrial (LA) roof, left atrium (incorporating all anatomic regions of the chamber), mitral isthmus and non-LA structures, each region is targeted in sequence {{and the impact of}} ablation upon the global fibrillatory process assessed by measurement of AF cycle length (AFCL) at a site remote from the ablation target. In addition to pulmonary vein <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> and demonstrable complete conduction block across the roof and mitral isthmus lines (when performed), ablation is performed at those sites displaying continuous electrical and complex fractionated activity, with the endpoint of local organization, as well as at sites displaying electrograms consistent with focal sources driving AF. Ablation is accompanied by a cumulative increase in the AFCL prior to termination of AF by conversion either directly to sinus rhythm or to an atrial tachycardia which is then mapped conventionally and ablated. There is a ceiling of ablation within the LA beyond which further ablation is unlikely to result in a clinical benefit and should prompt evaluation of the contribution of the right atrium to maintenance of AF. The stepwise approach benefits from the integration of anatomic and electrophysiologic information to achieve a high level of success in termination of chronic AF by catheter ablation.

40|$|Department of Energy Engineering(Battery Science and Technology) In {{order to}} keep pace with the {{increasing}} energy demands for advanced electronic devices and to achieve commercialization of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs), improvements in high energy battery technology are required. In this regard, Si anodes have been studied as one of the most promising alternative electrode materials for next-generation high energy LIBs systems. Pristine Si exhibits high reversible capacities of 3579 mAh g- 1 which is 10 times higher than conventional graphite anode at room temperature. However, even though Si has high gravimetric and volumetric capacities, it undergoes intrinsic drawbacks such as low initial Coulombic efficiency, <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnection</b> and fracture as well as continuous formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) caused by huge volume changes during cycling, leading to rapid capacity fading and increase in internal impedance. Although intensive researches with variously engineered Si have provided some enhanced electrochemical performances, they could not be a comprehensive solution, which prevent practical applications in high energy LIB anodes. In this study, to overcome this barrier, novel structure characterization methods and fundamental understanding are proposed in this dissertation. 1) 	Amorphous (a) silicon nanoparticles backboned-graphene nanocomposite (a-SBG) for high-power lithium-ion battery anodes allows improved electrical conductivity and stable electrode deformation with sustaining interconnectivity between electrode components. The a-SBG provides ideal electrode structures-a uniform distribution of amorphous silicon nanoparticle islands (particle size < 10 nm) anchored on both sides of graphene sheets-which address the improved kinetics and cycling stability issues of the silicon anodes. Especially, a-Si in the composite shows elastic behavior during lithium alloying and dealloying reactions: the pristine particle size is restored after cycling, and the electrode thickness decreases during the cycles as a result of self-compacting. This noble architecture facilitates superior electrochemical performance in Li-ion cells, with a specific energy of 468 Wh kg- 1 and 288 Wh kg- 1 under a specific power of 7 kW kg- 1 and 11 kW kg- 1, respectively. 2) 	With developing an industrial-relevant equipment using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, Si nanolayer-embedded graphite/carbon hybrid (SGC) has succeeded in achieving high energy density (1043 mAh l- 1), and unprecedented Coulombic efficiency (92...|$|E
