40|$|One aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the state of development of multipurpose <b>cadastre</b> <b>systems</b> (MPCs) internationally, and, based on the findings to design a multipurpose cadastre data model enhancing the current <b>cadastre</b> <b>system</b> in Malaysia. A second aim was to determine the organizational and legal requirements for implementing a multipurpose <b>cadastre</b> <b>system,</b> within the current Malaysian context. As a final aim, the service oriented architecture (SOA) concept was examined to investigate how it might support the storage, maintenance and delivery of the different layers of data found in an MPC. The data model and service oriented architecture were developed using Oracle Spatial technologies and the SQL language. Sample data from the national digital cadastre database, utility data and topographic mapping data from Malaysia were used in the case study. The investigation enabled data from various agencies to be integrated into a single multipurpose cadastre database in the Oracle Spatial database environment, and a case study of an easement as a legal land object was executed. It was discovered that it was beneficial to show the complete legal situation of a parcel compared to the previous system where the user had to manually search for legal documents and deal with the ambiguous locations of legal land objects. The results of the SOA investigation showed that the application of the SOA concept to the construction of an MPC database will require extensive IT investment, especially a high specification server, but it is expected to reduce redundancy in data collection and processing and reduce the costs. The study also showed that existing legislation in the National Land Code 1965 should be amended. The principal conclusion is that an open source system should be adopted before any further investment in IT software and hardware is made. Another conclusion is that a multipurpose <b>cadastre</b> <b>system</b> has to be managed by personnel highly trained in spatial, programming and IT competencies. An open source system combined with the SOA concept seems the best option if a multipurpose <b>cadastre</b> <b>system</b> is to contribute to the sustainable management of land resources within a rapidly developing Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{computer}} software, the old saying “you {{get what you pay}} for ” may no longer apply. After years of skepticism towards open source software, many of today’s open source solutions are as good, if not better than proprietary software solutions. The question is-why is it then that there are so few land administration systems making use of open source software technology? Lack of knowledge about the possibilities might be one of the reasons. After all, marketing has never been a priority for developers of open source software. Doubts about the security and available software support could further shy away cadastre agencies from making the switch.

40|$|Following public {{demand to}} improve the {{efficiency}} and transparency of government administrations, together with the existence of mature technologies and modern urban planning necessities, it is now essential to establish more advanced and comprehensive land management (<b>cadastre)</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Cadastre</b> <b>systems</b> available today are mostly based on twodimensional registration procedures only, limited {{in their ability to}} manage modern urban and complex areas. This requires the ability to handle various types of data in a uniform way - both spatially (horizontal position and altitude) and temporary, with emphasis on infrastructure development that must be addressed and registered with respect to the third dimension – above-terrain and below-terrain. That is, establishing a series of conditions and functionalities, which will enable utilization of land/space for various complex projects, individually owned, above and below the surface. The Survey Of Israel (SOI) is advocating towards a solution related to 3 D cadastre, establishing the idea of a unified spatial 3 D volumetric parcel, such that the volume of such new 3 D spatial parcel can be a part of (subtracted from) a number of 2 D parcels. The required 3 D <b>Cadastre</b> <b>system</b> should be capable to combine different types of data that are relevant to <b>cadastre</b> <b>systems,</b> and to constitute a unified model from different government databases: among others, the Survey Of Israel, the Land Registry, and the Israel Land Authority. The system should enable archiving, visualization, queries and analysis of three-dimensional characteristics and structures on different temporal time-stamps. So far, three-dimensional systems are currently having their focus on 3 D topography (modelling physical real-world objects), and are limited in supporting the multi-dimensional cadastre implementation needs. This study aims at investigating and presenting a set of spatial functionality requirements from such a system that would enable good governance in accordance with the definitions and guidelines of the SOI, derived mainly from technical specification required to support the third dimension (depth/ height) in existing platforms or systems. A systematic analysis of the processes and functionalities needed by such a system is made, each is a workflow of specific geometric and topologic functionalities integrated in the system (such as: intersection, extraction, merging, deletion – to name a few).

Following a successful public bid, the project contractor carried out the following work: collection of all the existing cadastral information about the project area (scanned block maps and mutation plans, data concerning international boundary monuments, measurements of boundary-defining topographic features, coordinates of geodetic control points, surveying notes, and other documents), measurement of existing authentic parcel boundary corner points, adjustment of input data and calculation of precise coordinates for boundary corners. At the same time, SOI started intensive activity on preparing the integration of the newl...|$|R

The mission is to enhance quality in surveying and mapping services along with managing the geospatial data. On the other hand, Land Office {{is responsible}} for the cadastral attribute information i. e. legal rights that attached to the cadastral objects or plots. The current system only involves with 2 D maps and no effort towards 3 D registration yet. This paper discusses 3 D cadastre in the aspect of property registration i. e. complex building and overlapping properties on different land use. We also discuss the interoperability of the two systems between the two different agencies. This 3 D cadastre registration will serve as a first attempt to develop a more complete Integrated Malaysian 3 D <b>Cadastre</b> <b>System.</b> A complex system needs a clear and concise method to show the representation of data, and here we utilize Unified Modeling Language (UML) for the data modeling task as it has been considered better technique for such real world data modeling like cadastre data compared to the traditional entity relationship approach. Besides 3 D registration...|$|R
40|$|The Survey of Israel (SOI) has {{embarked}} upon an ambitious project to modernize its <b>cadastre</b> <b>system</b> and calculate precise coordinates for every parcel corner. Like {{in many other}} countries, cadastre data in Israel are archived in various formats (e. g., paper and digital), diverse forms (e. g., digitized boundaries, subdivision plans, survey notes) dissimilar methods of computation (chain distances or polar measurements) and even different coordinates systems. The new coordinate based cadastre will create uniformity and eliminate the time and labor consuming process of data integration and adjustment of dimensions and measurements. Technologically, advanced GIS tools {{will be used to}} store, manage and analyze these cadastral data system along with GPS technology which will be used to identify the coordinate based corners in the field. From the juridical point of view, the coordinates will not be, yet, part of the chain of evidence but will aid the surveyor in quick and efficient boundary tracking. Nevertheless, work is being carried out to advance this land reform in the conservative legal system. A few steps were set for this project including: area demarcation, assimilation of all th...|$|R
40|$|The Survey of Israel is a {{national}} agency for geodesy, cadastre and geographic information. The Survey is responsible for cadastral mapping, {{as a part of}} an inter-ministry procedure of documentation and registration of rights to land, according to a British mandatory law (Survey Ordnance, 1929). Private licensed surveyors are deeply involved in the cadastral activity. The <b>cadastre</b> <b>system</b> in Israel is based on Torrens registration principles. The responsibility for the inspection and the approval of block maps and mutation plans is shared by five district surveyors and three senior civil servants acting at SOI central office. This historical, geographic distribution led to heterogeneity of various local standards of working and managing methods and procedures, data formats, hardware and software facilities, etc. In the era of worldwide standardization, the Israeli cadastre practice remained anachronistically particular and essentially not standardized. At the end of 2003, a comprehensive project was initiated aiming at the establishment of a better, highly standardized and homogeneously regularized cadastral practice. The existing working procedures will be critically studied and analyzed, and practical steps for their improvement will be proposed. Furthermore, a software application will be specified fo...|$|R
