The adiabatic burning velocity of the laminar premixed flame was measured at different equivalence ratios while exhibiting cellular instabilities. Direct photographs have been captured to qualitatively asses the effect of burner plate temperature on the cellular structure of the flame.

5|$|Bartholdi was {{inspired}} by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war <b>instability</b> <b>in</b> France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal.

40|$|The stringy {{description}} for the <b>instabilities</b> <b>in</b> the RR charged D_p-D̅_p pairs is {{now well}} {{understood in terms}} of the open string tachyon condensation. The quantum interpretation presumably via the stringy description for the <b>instabilities</b> <b>in</b> the NSNS-charged F 1 -F̅ 1 ̅ and NS 5 -N̅S̅ 5 ̅ pairs in IIA/IIB theories, however, has not been established yet. This would be partly because of the absence (for the F 1 -F̅ 1 ̅ case) or our relatively poor understanding (for the NS 5 -N̅S̅ 5 ̅ case) of their worldvolume (gauge theory) dynamics. In the present work, using the well-known quantum description for <b>instabilities</b> <b>in</b> the RR-charged D_p-D̅_p systems and in the M-theory brane-antibrane systems and invoking appropriate string dualities, the stringy nature of the <b>instabilities</b> <b>in</b> the NSNS-charged F 1 -F̅ 1 ̅ and NS 5 -N̅S̅ 5 ̅ systems has been uncovered.
