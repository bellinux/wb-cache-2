25|$|The {{principles}} {{contained in}} good Samaritan laws more typically operate in {{countries in which}} {{the foundation of the}} legal system is English Common Law, such as Australia.

25|$|The {{omissions}} {{of individuals}} {{are generally not}} criminalised in English criminal law, subject to situations of special duty, contractual duty, {{and the creation of}} dangerous situations. Whilst other jurisdictions have adopted general statutory <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue,</b> it is not recognised in English law that an individual has any <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> assist strangers in situations of peril. Proponents of the current legal position regard it as wrong for the criminal law to punish individuals for committing no physical act, which it is argued would be an infringement on human autonomy. Academics arguing for reform argue that a social responsibility to assist others should exist, particularly where there would be no danger to the rescuer.|$|R

25|$|Good Samaritan laws offer legal {{protection}} {{to people who}} give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, {{for fear of being}} sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue</b> law requires people to offer assistance, and holds those who fail to do so liable.|$|E
500|$|The goal {{of these}} {{principles}} {{is to achieve}} spiritual peace, better rebirth, or, ultimately, liberation. According to Chakravarthi, these teachings help elevate a person's quality of life. In contrast, states Dundas, the emphasis of Mahavira on non-violence and restraint has been interpreted by some Jain scholars to [...] "not be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue</b> all creatures", but resulting from [...] "continual self discipline", a cleansing of the soul that leads to one's own spiritual development and ultimately brings about spiritual release.|$|E
2500|$|Good Samaritan laws may be {{confused}} with the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue,</b> as described above. U.S. and Canadian approaches to this issue differ. [...] Under the common law, good Samaritan laws provide a defence against torts arising from the attempted rescue. Such laws do not constitute a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue,</b> such as exists in some civil law countries, and in the common law under certain circumstances. However, the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue</b> where it exists may itself imply a shield from liability; for example, under the German law of unterlassene Hilfeleistung (an offense not to provide first aid when necessary), a citizen is obliged to provide first aid when necessary and is immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith turns out to be harmful. In Canada, all provinces with the exception of Quebec operate on the basis of English Common Law. [...] Quebec operates a civil law system, based in part on the Napoleonic Code, and the principle of <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue</b> does apply. Similarly, in France anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.|$|E

40|$|Although in Anglo-American torts law {{there is}} no {{universal}} positive <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> require <b>rescue,</b> {{it is now a}} facet of many continental jurisdictions and increasingly in Canada and the USA to enact a "Good Samaritan" statute which gives an underpinning for rescue efforts. However, the corollary is that many of these statutes give immunity from suit to rescuers. Some of these statutes stipulate that rescuers must act with reasonable care, which is a codification of the Common Law structure. It follows that both that legislation and the Common Law exclude conduct by the rescuer which is "foolhardy", "wanton", "grossly negligent" or "reckless". What therefore is the test of a "negligent rescue" which might give rise to liability? What are the current parameters? Should rescuers be granted immunity in the United Kingdom? What might be the consequences of enacting a Good Samaritan statute here?
