50|$|Prior to the 1950s, {{teacher and}} other {{education}} unions played little role {{in international trade}} union federations. In 1912, the International Committee of National Federations of Teachers in Public Secondary Schools was established in Belgium. Internationally, it was known as FIPESO, an acronym derived from its French name: The Federation Internationale des Professeurs de l'Enseignement Secondaire Officiel. In 1923, the National Education Association (NEA) founded the World Federation of Education Associations (WFEA) in San Francisco. Then in 1926, the International Federation of Teachers' Associations (IFTA) was formed. The same year, the <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of Teachers (ITST), a grouping of teachers' unions affiliated with the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), was established. But few of these organizations obtained membership of any size, joined the International Labour Organization (ILO), or proved influential. Many were international in name only, with membership usually coming from a few European nations. Except for the WFEA (which was dominated by the NEA), most ceased to function during World War II.|$|E

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of the world}} economy has created new opportunities for cross-border labor organizing. In this paper I examine two case studies of cross -border labor organizing. One case involves Phillips Van-Hernen (PVH) workers in Guatemala City, and the other Ford automobile workers in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The PVH case illustrates the potential for cross-border labor organizing in the highly mobile garment industry. The PVH workers' union and their cross-border allies adopted a "strategic cross-border organizing model" that included consumer and trade pressure, an active <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>secretariat,</b> and several other strategies, to achieve an amazing victory. However, the Ford Cuautitlan case demonstrates that corporatist state-labor relations and internal union conflicts have limited cross-border organizing in the automobile industry. These two case studies and their different outcomes have many important lessons for academics and activists interested in cross-border labor organizing...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Today, huge {{companies}} {{spanning the}} face of the earth are mounting a global challenge to the living standards and dignity of working people. While it may be expensive and difficult to build a genuine international labor movement, particularly one that is democratic and accords women full participation, this era requires exactly that. The <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>secretariats</b> (ITSs) are excellent vehicles for the labor movement to do this work. It is important that more unionists and activists know about the ITSs, and that international action be better integrated strategically into domestic organizing and bargaining. This will help ITSs realize even more of their potential for linking unions around the world in common struggles, and this also helps national unions achieve their immediate goals. This article describes one of the most active ITSs in North America — the International Union of Food and Allied Workers 2 ̆ 7 Associations (IUF) — paying particular attention to the IUF 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on the problems of women workers...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Achieving real {{solidarity}} {{across national}} borders {{and around the}} globe is a difficult undertaking, one which little in our experience has prepared us for. Language barriers, differences in cultures and political traditions, very different styles of unionism — all these make simple communication, let alone real understanding of foreign workers 2 ̆ 7 interests and concerns, difficult. Unfortunately, the AFL-CIO 2 ̆ 7 s official agency for helping us sort through these difficulties — the Department of International Affairs (DIA) — is not much help in doing so. In fact, as I argue here, the DIA is often an obstacle to building real solidarity. After making this case, I will make some suggestions for how U. S. unions can move toward solidarity by avoiding the DIA structure — through direct participation in the <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Secretariats</b> (ITSs), like the Metalworkers Federation mentioned above, and through forming 2 ̆ 2 sister union 2 ̆ 2 relationships with relevant unionists in other countries. But, eventually, the DIA must be opened up to reflect the broad and diverse interests of labor 2 ̆ 7 s rank-and-file rather than the narrow sectarian face it has shown {{the world for the}} past several decades...|$|R

Focussing initially on organized labour, the programme seeks to identify approaches and strategies to enhance the profile of labour as a major actor in civil society, and as a contributor to dynamic and equitable growth. Specifically, the programme will review the changing environment of labour and unions; document trade union responses to these changes; highlight promising approaches for trade unions in civil society and the global economy in future; and outline the type of policy and institutional environment required for the growth of free and effective trade unions. This work is undertaken in close collaboration with <b>international</b> and national <b>trade</b> union organizations and <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>secretariats,</b> and will be implemented through networks consisting of trade union practitioners, academics, research institutes and other policymakers.

In 1973 SOMO was founded to provide different organisations with knowledge on the structure and organisation of Transnational Corporations (TNCs) by conducting independent research.
