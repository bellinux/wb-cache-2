500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted. In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the studio and I have no idea what I'm going to do and I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E

Harold Hobson of The Sunday Times called Osborne [...] "a writer of outstanding promise".

The visual and auditory perception of violence constitutes the nucleus of this drama, which is usually perceived in a diffuse way by readers at first sight. But, in fact, it harbours a unitary and precise sense. We are trying to study this subject in depth on the following pages.

Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity--THEY have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon {{is going to be a}} minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else with a name like that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. He's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays." ...|$|E

40|$|The deep {{learning}} techniques have made neural networks the leading option for solving some computational problems {{and it has}} been shown the production of the state-of-the-art results in many fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and audio recognition. In fact, we may be tempted to make use of neural networks directly, as we know them nowadays, in order to make predictions and solve many problems, but if the decision that has to be taken is of high risk. For instance, we could have a problem regarding the control of a nuclear power plant or the prediction of the shares evolution in the market; in this case, it would be important to look for methods that allowed us to add more information concerning the certainty of those predictions. This Master’s thesis is divided into three parts: Firstly, we will analyse the state-of-the-art regarding Mixture Density Network models to predict an entire probability distribution for the output and we will develop an implementation to give solutions for many of the numerical stability problems that characterise this type of models. Secondly, in order to propose an initial solution for the uncertainty problems introduced above, we will focus on the extraction of a confidence factor by using neural network outputs of a problem for which we are only interested in the prediction of something if we have a minimum certainty about the prediction we made. In order to do it, we will compile the current literature methods to measure uncertainty through Mixture Density Networks and we will implement all of these works. Consequently, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> detail about the concept of uncertainty and we will see to what extent we are able to propose a solution by using neural network models for the different aspects that include such concept. Finally, the third part will refer to several proposals to measure the confidence factor obtained with the use of Mixture Density Network concerning the problem proposed. After all the work, our goals will be achieved: we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a stable implementation for all the problems that we have proposed for Mixture Density Networks and we will publish it publicly in our GitHub repository[9]. We will be able to implement the state-of-theart methods {{that will allow us to}} obtain a confidence factor and finally we will be able to propose a method that obtains the expected results regarding the parameters that represent the confidence factor...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{there has been a}} wide {{development}} in the research on textual information systems. The goal is to improve these systems in order to allow an easy localization, treatment and access to the information stored in digital format (Digital Databases, Documental Databases, and so on). There are lots of applications focused on information access (for example, Web-search systems like Google or Altavista). However, these applications have problems when they must access to cross-language information, or when they need to show information in a language different from the one of the query.
