5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because {{of the importance of}} silver compounds, particularly halides, in <b>gravimetric</b> <b>analysis.</b> Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for <b>gravimetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E

40|$|Body {{composition}} {{is a measure}} of an animal's energetic state that can inform many research fields, yet the analysis traditionally requires individuals to be killed, and chemical analysis is labor intensive. Quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) measures body composition noninvasively in live and nonanesthetized animals. Our aim was to validate QMR analysis for snakes by comparing it with <b>gravimetric</b> chemical <b>analysis.</b> We collected Northern Watersnakes (Nerodia sipedon sipedon) and Eastern Massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) that were found dead on roads, analyzed their body composition using the QMR scanner, and then by <b>gravimetric</b> chemical <b>analysis.</b> We compared fat mass, wet lean mass, and total water mass between the two methods, and then calculated bias, absolute error (g), and relative error (%) of the QMR analysis. Body composition values from the QMR analyses were highly correlated with the values obtained by <b>gravimetric</b> chemical <b>analysis.</b> Bias and errors were reasonable for wet lean and total water mass values, but the raw QMR data overestimated fat mass. When we calibrated the QMR using the chemical extraction data, it nearly eliminated bias and greatly reduced absolute and relative error. Therefore, following calibration, QMR analysis is an effective method to measure body composition of snakes. QMR very accurately measures wet lean and total water masses and can be used to detect changes in fat mass particularly in longitudinal studies of individuals across seasons. 6 page(s...|$|R

Also, methods often do not require expensive equipment. <b>Gravimetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> due to its high degree of accuracy, when performed correctly, {{can also be used to}} calibrate other instruments in lieu of reference standards.|$|E
