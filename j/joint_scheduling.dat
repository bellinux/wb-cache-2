40|$|Abstract—In current {{cellular}} networks {{base stations}} (BSs) usually perform independent scheduling without coordinating the resource allocation among different cells. This, however, {{often leads to}} high interference levels in cellular networks operating with universal frequency reuse, such as the 3 GPP UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE). Coordinated scheduling between different BSs may mitigate this problem by taking interference from and to nearby BSs into account {{in order to avoid}} high interference situations, especially for user equipments (UEs) located near the cell-edge. For that purpose, we propose in this paper a novel interference-aware <b>joint</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme based on proportional fairness for the uplink of a 3 GPP UTRAN LTE system, where different BSs cooperate with each other via a fast backhaul network in order to jointly allocate frequency resources to the various UEs, taking the caused inter-cell interference into account. Furthermore, we propose an efficient method for dynamic interference coordination based on the standardized high interference indicator and we compare the achievable performance with this approach to a system with interference-aware <b>joint</b> <b>scheduling.</b> It is shown that our <b>joint</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme outperforms a dynamic interference coordination scheme and that it yields significant gains over a conventional LTE Release 8 system without any interference coordination.

Thereby, {{we focus on}} a <b>joint</b> generation of <b>schedules</b> and deployment for mixed-criticality multicore architectures using shared memory. The presented approach computes task and message schedules that are optimized {{with respect to a}} global discrete time base. As part of the solution, our approach generates an optimized assignment of tasks to computation resources (cores) concerning local memory constraints of cores and criticality constraints of tasks. This approach is integrated into the AUTOFOCUS 3 tool-chain, using a formally defined model of computation with explicit data-flow and discrete-time semantics to develop multi-criticality embedded systems. Our approach relies on a symbolic encoding scheme, based on a system model that is derived from the system architecture. This paper provides a formalization describing the scheduling problem as a satisfiability problem using boolean formulas and linear arithmetic constraints. A state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver is used to compute the <b>joint</b> <b>schedule</b> and deployment for such architectures. This paper demonstrates that state-of-the art satisfiability modulo theory solvers can be used to efficiently compute (safety-oriented) deployments including real-time task and communication schedules for mixed-criticality applications.

We design simple and efficient admission control, resource allocation, and scheduling algorithms for guaranteeing requested QoS. Our scheduling algorithms consists of two sets, namely, (what we call) <b>joint</b> K&H/RR <b>scheduling</b> and Reference Channel (RC) <b>scheduling.</b> The <b>joint</b> K&H/RR <b>scheduling,</b> composed of K&H scheduling and Round Robin (RR) scheduling, utilizes both multiuser diversity and frequency diversity to achieve capacity gain, and the RC scheduling minimizes the channel usage while satisfying users' QoS constraints. The relation between the <b>joint</b> K&H/RR <b>scheduling</b> and the RC scheduling is that 1) if the admission control allocates channel resources to the RR scheduling due to tight delay requirements, then the RC scheduler {{can be used to}} minimize channel usage; 2) if the admission control allocates channel resources to the K&H scheduling only, due to loose delay requirements, then {{there is no need to}} use the RC scheduler. In designing the RC scheduler, we propose a reference channel approach and formulate the scheduler as a linear program, dispensing with complex dynamic programming approaches, by the use of a resource allocation scheme.
