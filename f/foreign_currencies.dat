40|$|IntroductionThis {{publication}} presents {{results in}} respect of 31 March 2013, from an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey of Australian resident enterprises with exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The survey covers all enterprises with significant <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> denominated balance sheet items and/or significant expected <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> denominated receipts or payments from trade. The information collected included foreign equity assets, <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> denominated debt assets and liabilities, expected future <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> receipts and payments from trade, the principal value of outstanding currency derivative contracts and policies on hedging <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> exposure. The survey was conducted by the ABS at the request of, and with the financial support of, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The survey provides additional information to that available in the International Investment Position, on the mitigating impact of hedging activities on <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> exposures...|$|R
40|$|The {{previous}} currency law of Nov. 22, 1983 imposed many {{restrictions on}} currency transactions, {{making it impossible}} to implement market mechanisms into that sphere of economic activity. Basic assumptions of a new <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Act of Feb. 15, 1989 is the principle according to which the duty to obtain a permit to enter into a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transaction is required only in matters expressly stated in the Act. It means that the Act introduces freedom of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transactions in relations indifferent {{from the point of view}} of economic and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> interests of the State. Besides, the new law provides for statutory guaranties of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> property rights. However, it also imposes on economic units the duty to resell to the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> banks part of those units' revenues in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The Act introduces also <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> auctions, open for all economic units. The auction price of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> is to be shaped by supply/demand rules. The Act, in an attempt to protect Polish currency, introduces the duty to obtain <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> permit for payments for goods, services and labour if these payments are to be effected in Poland between so-called domestic persons. The permit is necessary also in case of taking Polish currency and Polish securities abroad. A new solution is the provision allowing the retired persons who receive their pensions from foreign insurance companies to collect part of their allowances in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The new Law, although not free from defects, is a step in the right direction. Future amendment, justified by the requirements of social and economic praxis, are nonetheless indispensable. They should be aimed at furthering the liberalization of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> law...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} effect on firm value of {{different}} <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (FC) financial hedging strategies identified by type of exposure (short or long term) and type of instrument (forwards, options, swaps and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt). We find that hedging instruments depend {{on the type of}} exposure. Short term instruments such as FC forwards and/or options are used to hedge short term exposure generated from export activity while FC debt and FC swaps into <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (but not into domestic currency) are used to hedge long term exposure arising from assets located in foreign locations. Our results relating to the value effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> hedging indicate that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives use increases firm value but there is no hedging premium associated with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt hedging, except when combined with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives.

40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing by small firms, using {{information on the}} most recent loan extended to 3101 firms in 25 transition countries between 2002 and 2005. Our results suggest that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing is much stronger related to firm-level <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> revenues {{than it is to}} country-level interest rate differentials. Supporting the conclusion that carry-trade behavior is not the key driver of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing in our sample we find no evidence that firm-level indicators of distress costs or financial transparency affect loan currency denomination. Overall, our findings suggest that retail clients which do take <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans are better equipped to bear the corresponding currency risks than is commonly thought.

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies,</b> the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies,</b> debt payment {{is going to be more}} costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies.</b> Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} {{of the currency}} denomination of small business loans. We first model the choice of loan currency in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt {{and the risk of}} firm-level distress costs, and also examines the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms. When <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds come at a lower interest rate, all <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans. When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firms revenues, even more local earners switch to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans, as they do not bear the full cost of the corresponding credit risk. We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> income and assets are more likely to borrow in a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the currency denomination only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing. <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the exposure of}} Austrian banks to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and the CIS and elaborates on its risks to banking sector stability.

Our findings confirm the key importance of funding risks and do not contradict the assumption of a nonlinear relationship with regard to credit risk. However, a simple comparison of risk indicators does not unambiguously indicate an overall higher credit risk in the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loan portfolio. Most recent data suggest that Austrian banks’ <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loan exposure is declining.

5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies.</b> He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies</b> rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Belarus {{has been in}} a state of flux since Lukashenko's {{election}} in 1994. His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24million. The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011. One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies,</b> such as the euro, US dollar and the Russian ruble {{in order to maintain the}} stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of devaluation. A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank. Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources, and while it has received loans from China, receiving loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according to standards set by the IMF and other agencies.|$|E

Unlike previous empirical studies, which have attempted to explain the use of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt using arguments stemming exclusively from hedging theory, we have complemented the analysis with hypotheses from capital structure theory.
