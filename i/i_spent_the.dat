[...] She also has expressed her ties to Australia, declaring: [...] "I {{consider myself}} very connected to Australia, in fact when people say where is home, I say Australia, because those are my most powerful memories." ...|$|E
500|$|Post-production {{facility}} EFILM {{carried out}} the digital intermediate (DI), with Libatique overseeing the process and working with colorists Steve Bowen and Steve Scott: [...] "It’s difficult to match all of your shots meticulously when you have three cameras and one lighting setup, so <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> majority of the DI just adhering to the original vision of the disparity in color temperature, which I can accentuate, versus the unified color temperature." [...] A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a Northlight film scanner, while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved [...] "too dense for the Northlight to perform the task." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{whole process}} in a wheelchair, so {{physically}} I was really frustrated. I think my vocal performance on it is pretty poor. It sounds tired and strained. The saving grace of the album was [...] "Candy Store Rock" [...] and [...] "Achilles Last Stand". The rhythm section on {{that it was so}} inspired ... I was furious with Page and [...] Peter Grant. I was just furious that I couldn't get back to the woman and the children that I loved. And I was thinking, is all this rock'n'roll worth anything at all? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" [...] debuted {{at number}} one on the UK Singles Chart, selling 58,840 {{downloads}} in its first week. [...] Lott described her reaction upon learning the song reached number one: [...] "I was in bed at my mum and dad's, where I still live, in Brentwood, Essex. I was on the laptop, and I {{got a phone call from}} my A man. He really dragged it out. I said, 'Please put me out of my misery.' And he said, 'I'm really, really sorry but... you're No 1!' <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of the day running around the house, screaming." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Guardian {{published}} on 30 March 2007 a story detailing inconsistencies between an account Blair gave of {{his involvement in}} the Balcombe Street Siege on the night of 6 December 1975, and the recollections of others involved at the time. In a 2006 interview, Blair had stated: [...] "We turned the corner, and there is the car ... It was a very defining moment. I think <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> next half an hour pretending to be a bush. They {{got out of the car}} and started firing at us. It is an interesting experience being fired at when you have absolutely nothing to fire back with ... I loved it. I loved the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 1932, Grands Prix had to {{be between}} five and ten hours long. It was the only season in which Nuvolari {{regularly}} drove {{one of the fastest}} cars, the Alfa Romeo P3, and he took two wins and a second place from the three European Championship Grands Prix, plus victory in the championship by four points from Borzacchini. He achieved four other race wins that year, including the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and a second Targa Florio. Of the latter, his mechanic Mabelli said: [...] "Before the start, Nuvolari told me to go down {{on the floor of the}} car every time he shouts, which was a signal that he went to a curve too fast and that we need to lower the car´s center of mass. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole race on the floor. Nuvolari started to shout in the first curve and wouldn't stop until the last one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with New York radio station Hot 97, Schoolboy Q {{talked about the}} album's delay and how Kendrick Lamar's rise has affected him: [...] "It's finally done. He's [...] the reason why I took so long on my album. If {{it was up to}} Interscope, mine would've been out last summer; 2013... But I wanted to perfect my stuff, because I didn't think it was wrapped. I always felt like it was missing three records. Even when I was done with the album, like a lot of these songs that I have on this album was made in 2012. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole 2013 trying to find four to three records that fit the album, that took my album to that level." [...] During the same interview, Schoolboy Q compared the album to Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle; he also admitted he analyzed Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album as he crafted his own work: [...] "Yes, I studied Kendrick, because {{he is one of the}} heavy hitters in the game." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marilyn Manson has {{supported}} various charitable causes throughout his career. In 2002, {{he worked with}} the Make-A-Wish Foundation to collaborate with a fan who {{had been diagnosed with}} a life-threatening illness. 16-year-old Andrew Baines from Tennessee was invited into the band's recording studio to record backing vocals for their then-upcoming album, The Golden Age of Grotesque. Manson said on his website, [...] "Yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> afternoon with Andrew, who reminded me the things I create are only made complete by those who enjoy them. I just want to simply say, thank you to Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me." [...] He contributed to Oxfam's 2013 [...] "Rumble in the Jumble" [...] event, which raised money to aid victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He {{has supported}} various organizations – such as Music for Life and Little Kids Rock – which enable access to musical instruments and education to children of low-income families. He has also worked with Project Nightlight, a group that encourages children and teenagers to speak out against physical and sexual abuse.|$|E
2500|$|The term 'Objectivist' {{developed}} because Harriet Monroe {{insisted on}} a group name for the February 1931 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, which Monroe had allowed Zukofsky to guest edit, at Pound's urging. [...] Zukofsky recounts the occasion with Monroe in Prepositions: [...] "Harriet Monroe at the time insisted, we'd better have a title for it, call it something. I said, I don't want to. She insisted; so, I said, alright, if I can define it in an essay, and I used two words, sincerity and objectification, and I was sorry immediately. But it's gone down into the history books; they forgot the founder, thank heavens, and kept the terms, and, of course, I said objectivist, and they said objectivism and that makes all the difference. Well, that was pretty bad, so then <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> next thirty years {{trying to make it}} simple." [...] It also seems that the core group did not see themselves as a coherent movement but rather as a group of individual poets with some shared approach to their art. As well as the matters covered in Zukofsky's essays, the elements of this approach included: a respect for Imagist achievement in the areas of vers libre and highly concentrated language and imagery; a rejection of the Imagists' interest in classicism and mythology; for Reznikoff, Zukofsky, Rakosi and Oppen, a shared Jewish heritage (which, for all but Oppen included an early childhood in which English was not their first language); generally left-wing, and, in the cases of Zukofsky, Rakosi, and Oppen at least, Marxist politics.|$|E
