5|$|Stamata Revithi {{was born}} in Syros in 1866. Records of her life from 1896 show that {{she was living in}} poverty in Piraeus in 1896. At that point she had given birth to two children, a son who died in 1895, aged seven, and another child who was {{seventeen}} months old {{by the time of the}} 1896 Olympics. According to Olympic historian Athanasios Tarasouleas, Revithi, who was blonde and thin with large <b>eyes,</b> <b>looked</b> much older than her age.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Nemegtomaia was deep, narrow, and short (compared {{to the rest}} of the body), and reached 179mm (7in) in length. It had a {{well-developed}} crest, formed by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the crest formed an almost 90degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other oviraptorids, the nasal processes (projections) of the premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above (where they connected with the nasal bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the orbit (eye opening) was 52mm (2in); the <b>eyes</b> <b>looked</b> large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two fenestrae (openings); a large antorbital fenestra at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. Nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the frontal bone on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull.|$|E

40|$|An {{electromyography}} (EMG) -based {{human-machine interface}} (HMI) is a communication pathway between a human and {{a machine that}} operates {{by means of the}} acquisition and processing of EMG signals. This article explores the use of EMGbased HMIs in the steering of farm tractors. An EPOC, a low-cost human-computer interface (HCI) from the Emotiv Company, was employed. This device, by means of 14 saline sensors, measures and processes EMG and electro encephalographic (EEG) signals from the scalp of the driver. In our tests, the HMI took into account only the detection of four trained muscular events on the driver’s scalp: <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the right and jaw opened, <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the right and jaw closed, <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the left and jaw opened, and <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the left and jaw closed.

500|$|Even {{while the}} women were marching, {{suspicious}} <b>eyes</b> <b>looked</b> upon Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, already behind the July uprisings, as being somehow responsible for the event. The Duke, a cousin of Louis XVI, was an energetic proponent of constitutional monarchy, {{and it was an}} open secret that he felt himself to be uniquely qualified to be king under such a system. Though allegations of his specific actions concerning the October march remain largely unproven, he has long been considered a significant instigator of the events. The Duke was certainly present as a deputy to the Assembly, and he was described by contemporaries as smiling warmly as he walked among the protesters {{at the height of the}} siege; many of them are said to have hailed him with greetings like [...] "Here is our king! Long live King Orléans!" [...] Many scholars believe that the Duke paid agents provocateurs to fan the discontent in the marketplaces and to conflate the women's march for bread with the drive to bring the king back to Paris. Others suggest he coordinated in some way with Mirabeau, the Assembly's most powerful statesman at the time, to use the marchers to advance the constitutionalist agenda. Still others go so far as to assert that the crowd was guided by such important Orléanist allies as Antoine Barnave, Choderlos de Laclos, and the duc d'Aiguillon, all dressed as poissardes in women's clothes. Yet most of the Revolution's foremost histories describe any involvement of the Duke as ancillary to the action, efforts of opportunism that neither created nor defined the October march. The Duke was investigated by the crown for complicity and none was proven. Still, the pall of suspicion helped convince him to take on Louis XVI's offer of a diplomatic mission conveniently outside the country. He returned to France the following summer and resumed his place in the Assembly where both he and Mirabeau were officially exonerated of any misdeeds regarding the march. As the Revolution moved forward into the Terror, the Duke's royal lineage and alleged avarice convicted him in the minds of radical leaders and he was sent to his execution in November 1793.|$|E

40|$|In three {{patients}} with Graves' disease of recent onset, length-tension diagrams were made during surgery for squint under eyedrop anesthesia, {{while the other}} <b>eye</b> <b>looked</b> ahead, into the field of action, {{or out of the}} field of action of the muscle that was measured. The affected muscles were found to be very stiff when the other <b>eye</b> <b>looked</b> straight ahead. Unexpectedly, the affected muscle did not shorten any further (one case) or only 6 - 7 mm (two cases) when the other <b>eye</b> <b>looked</b> into the field of action of the muscle, whereas it lengthened 9 - 10 mm when the other <b>eye</b> <b>looked</b> out of the field of action of the muscle. This means that the raised muscle tension and reduced elasticity of affected muscles in these cases of Graves' disease of recent onset are caused by active muscle contraction. It has been found previously that hyperthyroidism, induced in rats, casues transitions from slower to faster myosin-heavy chain (MHC) types. The findings seem compatible with a transition of slow into fast muscle fiber types in Graves' disease...|$|R
