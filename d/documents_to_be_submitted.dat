50|$|In another case, The Sowetan {{reports that}} as South African citizen has unsuccessfully tried to attain an {{identity}} document for four years.There {{have also been}} reports of the incompetency of the officers themselves. For instance {{some of them do}} not even know the relevant documents that need to be submitted for a particular visa application. In some scenarios, 2 identical applicants submitting the exact documents for the exact visa might not get the same response. One might be refused while the other one might be approved. Some applicants might have their applications rejected several times, either because they are only being informed of the relevant <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>submitted</b> each time their applications get rejected or the Home Affairs officials processing the documents are themselves not aware of the immigration rules of the country and thus a well completed application that deserved to be approved might still be rejected. It is not surprising that a straightforward application might take up to 2 years to be processed, while ideally in an effective system, they would be processed {{in a couple of months}} at worst. The consequences of such inefficiency can be worrying. Many foreigners thus often find themselves working illegally or even losing their bread winning job, simply because the system takes too long to process their visas.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is the {{discussion}} about regulatory aspects of "compassionate use" of drugs {{and in particular the}} relative Italian regulations and necessary procedures to apply them correctly (for example, important <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>submitted</b> to the Ethics Committee). At last two drugs were considered and they are: 1) "Sofosbuvir", today on the market, and for which, when it wasn't on the market yet, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) had started up the programme for compassionate use that has allowed to provide drugs free of charge to all patients who needed this therapy. But when Sofosbuvir went on the market, problems began, because of its high cost. 2) "Nivolumab" is still in phase III of clinical trial in Europe, but it is already on the market in USA. For this drug the AIFA has started up the programme for compassionate use, but expanding the access to all patients who have the same disease (in particular, the NSCLC - non small cell lung cancer), because of interesting results of Nivolumab...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Greece is {{currently}} developing the Hellenic Cadastre {{and in that}} process all properties have to be declared by those with relevant rights. The declaration process is extremely complex and hence imposes significant administrative burdens on citizens and businesses. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an e-government solution for reducing the administrative burdens related to the informative stage of the specific public service. By informative stage we refer to all these actions that one needs to undertake to obtain all essential information in order to be capable of executing a specific service. The analysis of this service suggest that its complexity is mainly related to the different supporting documents that need to be submitted along with the declaration form, which depend on a number of factors. Consequently, an online dialogue was suggested that enables automatic identification of the input <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>submitted.</b> The dialogue was modelled using BPMN and developed in an open source environment. This approach is expected to significantly reduce administrative burdens in this service. Most importantly, the followed approach can be also applied in other complex public services. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{procurement}} system, either paper-based or electronic, {{the seller}} should submit documents to the buyer. The documents are usually restricted and confidential, containing information that {{should only be}} read by purchasing committee, never be read by any other parties, especially the competitors. Therefore special treatment to hide the confidentialily should {{be applied to the}} documents envelope, so that the system can meet the required information security principles such as authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation. In this paper a method to create electronic secure envelope containing e-procurement submission document is proposed. Assymmetric Cryptosystem using RSA algorithm is used to develop a document submission system. Before the submission process, the seller should authenticate himself using his private key. <b>Documents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>submitted</b> will be compressed with a random session/envelope key. The session key will be sealed with both private key of the selles and the public key of purchasing committee so that anyone else can not decrypt the compressed envelope.

40|$|Abstract. An {{alternative}} approach to service description and composition is presented. It {{is based on}} agent technology, and {{on the idea of}} separating description and composition language from binding, i. e., from specification of data format (exchanged by applications) and transport protocol. Usually, the binding {{is an integral part of}} description language, e. g., WSDL, and DAML-S. Starting with this idea, recomendations for construction of a simple service description language as well as for a composition protocol are presented.

The tests show that Aluminized Mylar film is a viable solution fulfilling all SciFi requirements.
