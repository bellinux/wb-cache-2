25|$|A {{bimetallic}} strip {{is used to}} convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually steel and copper, {{or in some cases}} steel and brass. The strips are joined together throughout their length by riveting, brazing or welding. The different expansions force the <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher coefficient of thermal expansion is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.|$|E
25|$|In Bargello quilting, long {{strips of}} fabric are sewn {{together}} along their long sides. Then {{the first and}} last strip are sewn together, forming a loop. The loop is laid flat on a table, and then cut vertically (in the opposite direction from how the strips were sewn together) to make many narrow loops. The quilter then opens the loops by pulling out the stitching between two pieces of fabric, making a long, <b>flat</b> <b>strip.</b> Finally, all the strips are sewn together. By opening the loops in between different pieces of fabric (for instance, {{between the first and second}} piece on one loop, then the second and third piece on the next loop), the artist can make the colors of the quilt appear to shift and wave. Slicing the loops very narrowly makes the waving and movement appear sharp and fast; cutting wide loops creates more gentle movement in the quilt.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was made for}} the purpose of ascertaining the notch sensitivity of <b>flat</b> <b>strips</b> of light alloy with cylindrical holes under initial tension stress, with special attention to the change in notch-effect factors with the number of load cycles. Then the studies were extended to similar <b>flat</b> <b>strips</b> with pin-loaded holes (tension lugs). This report deals with fatigue tests under initial tension load on flat test specimens of 3116. 5 duralumin and AZM 3510. 1 electron with plain unloaded and pin-loaded holes (tension lugs) of different forms...|$|R
50|$|In an {{extension}} of the same general principle, the M-138-A strip cipher machine used by the US Navy and US State Department through World War II featured 100 <b>flat</b> <b>strips.</b> Each strip had a scrambled alphabet, repeated twice, printed on a metal strip that could be slid back and forth in a frame; with 30 being selected for each cipher session.|$|R

60|$|At a spot {{about a mile}} {{above the}} gorge of the Montmorenci a <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> of ground, some two hundred yards wide, lay between {{the river and the}} foot of the precipices, and, at low tide, the river left a flat of mud, nearly half a mile wide, beyond the dry ground.|$|E
60|$|There {{is a great}} {{crowd of}} peasants at the little station. And almost every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> of coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with purchases. These are almost the only {{carrying}} bags. The men sling them over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one behind.|$|E
60|$|His new {{horse had}} not had time to get warm before Duane reached a high sandy bluff below which lay the willow brakes. As {{far as he could}} see {{extended}} an immense <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> of red-tinged willow. How welcome it was to his eye! He felt like a hunted wolf that, weary and lame, had reached his hole in the rocks. Zigzagging down the soft slope, he put the bay to the dense wall of leaf and branch. But the horse balked.|$|E

50|$|The {{dough is}} made from flour (sometimes egg is added for more flavor). Traditionally, the dough is hand-kneaded and torn into smaller pieces of dough (about 2 inches).

50|$|The {{strength}} {{required of}} the mounting posts means they are invariably not merely <b>flat</b> <b>strips</b> but actually a wider folded strip arranged {{around the corner}} of the rack. The posts are usually made of steel of around 2 mm thickness (the official standard recommends a minimum of 1.9 mm), or of slightly thicker aluminum.|$|R
60|$|On {{the second}} morning out we reached Alacranes lighthouse; and when I saw the <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> of sand, without {{a tree or}} bush to lend it grace and color, the bleak lighthouse, and the long, lonely reaches of barren reefs from which there came incessant moaning, I did not wonder that two former lighthouse-keepers had gone insane. The present keeper {{received}} me with the welcome always accorded a visitor to out-of-the-world places. He corroborated all that my Indian sailors had claimed for the rabihorcado, and added the interesting information that lighthouse-keepers desired the extinction of the birds because the guano, deposited by them on the roofs of the keepers' houses, poisoned the rain water--all they had to drink.|$|E

Like its counterpart below, the southernmost window on the east is doubled. This treatment is also accorded the third bay, above the secondary entrance, and the northernmost bay. The east facade has the single windows in all ten bays.|$|R
50|$|Inside a {{switchboard}} {{there will}} be one or more busbars. These are <b>flat</b> <b>strips</b> of copper or aluminum, to which the switchgear is connected. Busbars carry large currents through the switchboard, and are supported by insulators. Bare busbars are common, but many types are now manufactured with an insulating cover on the bars, leaving only connection points exposed.|$|R

50|$|Erkuai (饵块) is {{a locally}} {{produced}} rice product bought as a brick {{and served as}} either <b>flat</b> <b>strips</b> or noodles.

50|$|Eucalyptus umbra, {{known as}} the Broad-leaved white mahogany, is a common {{eucalyptus}} tree of the high rainfall coastal areas of New South Wales and adjacent areas in south eastern Queensland. The bark is rough, resembling a stringybark, though not as coarse, and in <b>flat</b> <b>strips.</b> Thick, fibrous bark, greyish brown in colour. A small or medium-sized tree, up to 25 metres tall. Sometimes a shrub in the poorer skeletal soils.|$|R
50|$|A {{stripline}} circuit uses a <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> {{of metal}} which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric.

50|$|Single or {{multiple}} (2 to 5) electrode wire {{variations of the}} process exist. SAW strip-cladding utilizes a <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> electrode (e.g. 60 mm wide x 0.5 mm thick). DC or AC power can be used, and combinations of DC and AC are common on multiple electrode systems. Constant voltage welding power supplies are most commonly used; however, constant current systems in combination with a voltage sensing wire-feeder are available.|$|E

50|$|The {{landscape}} was flat and hilly {{for the most}} part. In the north, there was a <b>flat</b> <b>strip</b> of land called Volhynian Polesie, which extended some 200 kilometres from the Southern Bug river to the Polish-Soviet border.

The province's main rivers were the Styr, the Horyń, and the Słucz.|$|E
