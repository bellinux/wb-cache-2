He returned to Paris and rented a small room on the Boulevard Saint-Michel near the Luxembourg Garden. Here, {{he was able to}} immerse himself <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> books.

25|$|Walker {{credited}} a photo {{taken in}} winter 1982 as a pivotal {{point in his}} photographic career. One stormy day he was hiking in the rain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> park. The sky was completely covered with dark rain clouds above a pastoral landscape of sensual green hills, with Mt. Diablo in the distance. Seeing the Sun beginning {{to break through the}} clouds, he quickly rushed {{to the top of the}} ridge and captured the image, Winter Storm over Marsh Creek. He later noted that it was the first time he envisioned a photo before it had been created.|$|E

25|$|At eleven o'clock, on {{the morning}} of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> chair {{drinking}} whiskey and malt liquor, {{working on a book about}} his father's print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts. He suddenly felt nauseated and walked to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an abdominal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding esophageal varices) caused by cirrhosis, the result of longtime alcohol abuse. A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier. He is buried at Edson Cemetery, Lowell, Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{focused on}} the book's style and oversimplified conceptualizations. Displeased with Gladwell's generalizations drawn from small amounts of data, Roger Gathman wrote in The Austin American-Statesman that this was uncharacteristic of him, and {{believed}} that the approach points to a [...] "certain exhaustion <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> method". He remarked that in Outliers, the experiments, analyses, and conclusions drawn are too mechanically applied to historical or cultural phenomena to [...] "create a cognitive 'gotcha' moment", that Gladwell's analytical method was no longer working, and that [...] "it's high time for Gladwell to produce something more challenging than his beautifully executed tomb robberies of old sociology papers." [...] Boyd Tonkin in The Independent held a similar opinion, and wondered why Gladwell [...] "does not yet hold a tenured professorship at the University of the Bleedin' Obvious".|$|E

500|$|Steins;Gate: Hen'i Kuukan no Octet is a non-canon {{extension}} of the True End of the original game. Unlike the modern visual novel format of the original game, this retro game mimics the style of graphical text adventure games from the 8-bit PC era (e.g. PC-88), with the player typing short commands to interact with and explore the game world. It features all backgrounds and characters drawn in a low-color pixelated style with emulated scanlines, and chiptune music played through an emulated FM chip with no voice acting. The premise of the game features Rintarō Okabe receiving a D-Mail from himself in 2025 that states that he must save the future by reclaiming an IBN 5100 from a person under of the alias [...] "Neidhardt". This person is Takumi Nishijō of Chaos;Head, as he runs under the same player name <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> MMORPG, and the D-Mail stating that [...] "Neidhardt" [...] lives in Shibuya and has [...] "inherent, supernatural abilities", a reference to his power as a gigalomaniac. Although non-canon, the game contains many easter eggs and references that connect Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate together. The game was released on October 28, 2011 as a PC exclusive. A game demo is currently available. An official manga adaptation of the game's story has also been released.|$|E

2500|$|Two special editions {{were offered}} to {{celebrate}} Corvette's 25th year. Before he retired, Bill Mitchell had suggested a Silver Anniversary model <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> color-silver, appropriately enough-and it appeared as the $399 B2Z option package. The first two-tone paint option offered since 1961, it presented silver over a gray lower {{body with a}} separating pinstripe, plus aluminum wheels and dual [...] "sport" [...] outside mirrors as mandatory options, which added another $380 to the cost. 6502 Indy-500 Pace car replica editions were produced featuring Black/silver two-tone paint, front and rear spoilers, mirror-tint roof panels and contoured sport seats. Reviewers praised the car's classic strengths including its impressive straight-line numbers, especially an L48/automatic's 7.8second 0-60 time and top speed of , and noted its more refined, less rattling ride. On the other hand, they continued to note its weaknesses, like a rear-end that tended to step out during sharp maneuvers and a cabin that was still cramped and uncomfortable.|$|E
