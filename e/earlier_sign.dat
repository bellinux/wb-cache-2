5000|$|In February 1997, Richard Kessler, who had {{previously}} {{been involved with the}} Days Inn chain, then set up his own Kessler Collection of lodgings, purchased the building from St. Johns County for $1.2 million and began to remodel the building to once again become a hotel. The county Tax Collector's office and Property Appraiser's office were given until 1998 to relocate, so workers had to avoid a section of the building for several months. The renovation was completed in less than 2 years and opened in December 1999 under the original name of the [...] "Casa Monica Hotel" [...] (the name came from Saint Monica, the North African mother of St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, for whom the Ancient City is named). Richard Kessler and architect Howard W. Davis decided to keep the historic Moorish Revival style of the hotel. Tina Guarano Davis painted the Moorish-style woodwork in the hotel lobby. The Casa Monica sign on the Cordova Street side of the hotel covers over an <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> for the St. Johns County Courthouse. State historic preservation officials told them to preserve the courthouse sign, so they covered it over rather than removing it. The huge flagpole on top of the hotel is actually a lightning rod.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Based on our {{clinical}} experience, the H-reflex amplitude asymmetry {{might be}} an <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of nerve root involvement than latency in patients with S 1 radiculopathy. However, no data to support this assumption are available. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review and report the electrophysiological changes in H-reflex amplitude and latency in patients with radiculopathy in order to determine if there is any evidence to support the assumption that H-reflex amplitude is an <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of nerve root involvement than latency. Results Patients with radiculopathy showed significant amplitude asymmetry when compared with healthy controls. However, latency was not always significantly different between patients and healthy controls. These findings suggest nerve root axonal compromise that reduced reflex amplitude earlier than the latency parameter (demyelination) during the pathologic processes. Conclusion Contrary to current clinical thought, H-reflex amplitude asymmetry is an earlier sign/parameter of nerve root involvement in patients with radiculopathy compared with latency. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} early signs’ sensemaking relevance to identifying unknown unknowns on innovative projects. When managing these projects, <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> {{of changes in}} the environment, combined with a sensemaking process, can help identify them prior to their occurrence and mitigate unwanted effects of these uncertainties. To this end, we conducted a field research to assess 16 projects, totaling 35 events representative of this kind of uncertainty. Based on in-depth interviews, we performed an initial qualitative analysis, and then applied non-parametric statistical tests. <b>Early</b> <b>signs</b> perception in cases where external factors may cause the occurrence of unknown unknowns show that this perception and the search for information are relevant to identifying unk unks. Furthermore, some biases, such as overconfidence and unrealistic optimism, can hinder it. There was a high prevalence of project managers detecting <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> of change in their projects {{at the beginning of the}} project. However, the majority of perceived <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> can be considered to be the first symptoms of a problem. Thus, as a contribution, we suggest: learning processes, which can provide sensemaking for <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> in unknown unknowns; project managers stimulating their team to be alert to environmental changes that may affect the project; and discussion of <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> perceived by the team during stakeholder management...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that urinary lead, {{coproporphyrin}} (CP), and δ-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) are closely related after exposure to lead. We have confirmed the relationship in 50 automobile workers with different exposures, and have also estimated porphobilinogen (PBG) levels. There was some evidence that a raised ALA level gave an <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of lead absorption than a raised CP level. ALA-dehydratase activity (converting ALA to PBG) was greatly reduced by exposure, on the average to 20 % of normal. This reduction in activity was strongly correlated with the increases in urinary lead, CP, and ALA and is the most sensitive test of exposure to lead...|$|E
30|$|In retrospect, {{the actual}} onset time was thought when the {{drainage}} tube was opened and started suction. Seizure was masked by ongoing anesthesia and muscle relaxation; we recognized the seizure just after discontinuing anesthetics and {{reversal of the}} muscle relaxant. Regrettably, BIS was not monitored. If it had been monitored, abnormal spike waves might have been captured from {{the onset of the}} seizure. Although seizure activity might have damaged the central nerve system for a few minutes, it was fortunate that any neurologic sequelae had not been left. In order to detect <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of intracranial hypotension that can lead to SAH and other catastrophic events, we should have knowledge of surgical procedures and their related potentially life-threatening adverse intracranial events even in common spinal cases. In addition, careful vigilance of patients and potentially useful BIS monitor are crucial. Brain CT and/or MRI are decisive to confirm intracranial hypotension and hemorrhage.|$|E

30|$|SAKI {{may present}} {{either as a}} {{functional}} or structural entity. The difference is clinically relevant since functional SAKI can be reversed completely by early adequate treatment whereas structural kidney damage will mostly require RRT. Discriminating functional from structural SAKI at the bedside, however, remains challenging. Low fractional excretions of sodium (FENa) and urea (FEUrea) are highly prevalent during the initial phase of sepsis. Oliguria is an <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of impending SAKI than the increase in serum creatinine. It is assumed that high FENa and low FEUrea values are associated with intrinsic SAKI whereas high values of both FENa and FEUrea concur with transient or functional SAKI. However, a definite discriminative power of these urinary indices has not been established [61]. They are also less specific than currently tested biomarkers of SAKI [62] and less accurate for differentiating transient from persistent AKI [63] and SAKI from non-SAKI [64].|$|E
40|$|I exploit unique data on National Football League (NFL) players’ {{contracts}} {{to show how}} contractual arrangements in the NFL shape renegotiation and through that channel significantly affect players’ compensation and allocations. I show that {{a change in the}} timing of payments through the use of roster bonuses leads to contractual renegotiation and termination earlier in the off-season. This change in renegotiation incentives has quantitatively important consequences for players’ compensation and allocations. Players are willing to forgo approximately $ 260, 000 for a contract with modified renegotiation incentives. Moreover, players who are terminated <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> more valuable subsequent contracts and rematch with other teams more frequently. These predictions are consistent with a model in which players in the NFL are subject to contractual holdup. Designing renegotiation incentives through an altered timing of payments—the roster bonus—ameliorates this problem, which substantially increases ex post transfers of players and changes player allocations...|$|E
40|$|Microalbuminuria (defined as urinary albumin {{excretion}} of 30 - 300 mg/day, or 20 - 200 µg/min) is an <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of vascular damage. It is {{a marker}} of general vascular dysfunction and nowadays is considered a predictor of worse outcomes for both kidney and heart patients. There is a significant correlation between blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Even high normal blood pressure is associated with significant higher frequency of microalbuminuria and this way may be a biomarker of increased cardiovascular risk. Microalbuminuria could be taken also, {{as an indicator of}} insulin resistance and of the increased renal and cardiovascular risk associated with metabolic syndrome. Renal involvement is a pivotal development in diabetes and microalbuminuria is generally the first clinical sign of renal dysfunction in diabetics. It is demonstrated that cardiovascular and renal risk is elevated even in the high normal range of microalbuminuria (below 30 mg/day). There is no doubt that therapies that prevent or delay the development of microalbuminuria and all measures that reduce it, may help to prevent or delay end organ damage...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaternal {{mortality}} and childbirth complications are major problem of delivery in rural area of many developing countries. In information era, {{it would be}} beneficial if the risk of delivery from uncertainty information could be informed or recommended to patients at <b>earlier</b> <b>sign.</b> As well as, physicians could draw approximate decision before it occurred. This paper proposes a modified nearest neighbor analysis, which is called CPD-NN algorithmto approximate risks about Caesarean sections due to Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD). In the CPD-NN algorithm, it consists of three phases: initial phase, distance measure phase, and predicting phase. Herein, two determined distances are applied. First, the threshold distance, Dmin, is set to identify the closest neighbors. Dmaxis defined to identify the farthest neighbors. The k-neighbors, here, is dynamic, which is located within defined distances above. The {{results show that the}} efficiency and accuracy of CPD prediction are {{based on the number of}} training cases, dynamical k value, and similarity measures with different rules. Finally, the accuracy is 100 % of predicting when applying the nearest rule in cosine similarity or correlation by 100 training cases with k ≈ 20, as well as 400 training cases with k ≈ 5...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{psychological}} and psycholinguistic studies on sign language are reviewed. One of earlier studies is Wundt's observation on natural {{signs of the}} deaf and some tribes like Indians. He reported that natural signs had motivational or imitative properties. From the observations on the developmental elaboration of sign use among American deaf children, the other researcher reported that those motivational or imitative signs would develop into arbitrary symbols, gradually acquiring linguistic rules, and losing their initial motivational or imitative properties. But if we regard a system of highly developped sign language as being composed of arbitrary signs only, we overlook {{an essential part of}} sign language. In sign discourse of the deaf, iconic, mimetric gestures are used as much as arbitrary signs. A question was raised about the iconicity of signs which might interfere with the information processing. A case that imagery plays an important role upon concept learning was illustrated, and it is suggested that there is little reason to consider that iconicity interferes in abstract thinking process. Inadequateness of research measures of <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> language studies derived from speech language studies, such as word order, syntax was discussed, and it is suggested that there exist many visuo-spatial rules specific to sign language...|$|E
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the binucleate, parasitic protist Giardia lamblia during interphase and divisional stages was studied by serial thin sectioning and three-dimensional reconstructions. The <b>earlier</b> <b>sign</b> of nuclear division {{is the development of}} a few peripheral areas of densely packed chromatin directly attached to the inner nuclear envelope. An intracytoplasmic sheet of ventral disk components grows from the cell periphery towards one of the nuclei, apparently constricting this nucleus, which becomes located at a ventral bulge. After the basal bodies become duplicated, a full nuclear division occurs in trophozoites, giving two pairs of parent-daughter nuclei. This full division occurs in a dorsal-ventral direction, with the resulting nuclear pairs located at the sides of the two sets of basal bodies. A new ventral disk is formed from the disk-derived sheets in the cell harboring the four nuclei. Cytokinesis is polymorphic, but at early stages is dorsal-to-dorsal. Encysting trophozoites show the development of Golgi cisternae stacks and dense, specific secretory granules. 3 -D reconstructions show that cysts contain a single pair of incompletely strangled nuclei. The dividing Giardia lacks a typical, microtubular spindle either inside or outside the nuclei. The nuclear envelope seems to be the only structure involved in the final division of the parent-daughter nuclei...|$|E

Methods Data from in-depth interviews with a convenience sample of service users with psychosis varying in gender, age, duration of mental health problems, and time since last relapse were analysed using a thematic approach. Interview transcripts were coded inductively and relationships between emerging themes were examined by the research team to provide a thorough synthesis of the data. Results Three central themes emerged from the analysis: 1) recognising risk factors (how risk factors were identified and linked to relapse, and reactions to such risk factors); 2) identifying <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> (issues related to both recognising and recalling signs of relapse); 3) reacting to deterioration (participants’ thoughts and feelings in response to <b>early</b> <b>signs,</b> including help seeking and its challenges). Conclusions There was considerable variation in the attention participants had paid to pre-relapse signs, the ease with which they were able to recall them, and their reactions to them. For many, there were substantial barriers to help seeking from services. A family or friend confidant was an important means of assistance, although the supportive presence of significant others was not always available.
