40|$|A static {{acoustic}} and propulsion {{test of a}} {{small radius}} Jacobs-Hurkamp and a large radius Flex Flap combined with four upper surface blowing (USB) nozzles was performed. Nozzle force and flow data, flap trailing edge total pressure survey data, and acoustic data were obtained. Jacobs-Hurkamp flap surface pressure data, flow visualization photographs, and spoiler acoustic data from the limited mid-year tests are reported. A pressure ratio range of 1. 2 to 1. 5 was investigated for the USB nozzles and for the auxiliary blowing slots. The acoustic data were scaled to a four-engine STOL airplane of roughly 110, 000 kilograms or 50, 000 pounds gross weight, corresponding to a model scale of approximately 0. 2 for the <b>nozzles</b> without <b>deflector.</b> The model <b>nozzle</b> scale is actually reduced to about. 17 with deflector although all results in this report assume 0. 2 scale factor.

The noise from the mixer nozzle model was compared to the noise from a model using a circular nozzle of the same area. The mixer nozzle model was quieter at the low to middle frequencies, while the circular nozzle was quieter at high frequencies.

50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} propeller systems {{where the}} rotation of the propeller is reversed to provide astern movement, a waterjet will continue to pump normally while a deflector is lowered into the jetstream after it leaves the outlet <b>nozzle.</b> This <b>deflector</b> redirects thrust forces forward to provide reverse thrust. Most highly developed reverse deflectors redirect the jetstream down and to each side to prevent recirculation of the water through the jet again, which may cause aeration problems, or increase reverse thrust. Steering is still available with the reverse deflector lowered so the vessel will have full maneuverability. With the deflector lowered about halfway into the jetstream, forward and reverse thrust are equal so the boat maintains a fixed position, but steering is still available to allow the vessel to turn on the spot - something which is impossible with a conventional single propeller.|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{growing demand}} for energy in Nepal and neighbouring- countries, {{investments}} in hydro- power projects appears continuously, both by local and multinational companies. As a consequence of this, Turbine Testing Lab was founded in 2011 at Kathmandu University in Nepal. The laboratory is rapidly developing, and is currently implementing a Francis turbine test rig. A long- term goal for the laboratory, is to execute model tests according to IEC 60193, which is the standard used in model tests of hydraulic runners. When determining the hydraulic efficiency of a runner, a central parameter is the discharge measurement. According to IEC, any secondary device {{used to measure the}} discharge shall be calibrated in sit&# 249; against one of the following primary methods: the weighing method, volumetric method or the moving- screen method. The aim of this work has been to develop and design a primary method for calibration of the flowmeter at TTL. Based on an evaluation of the mentioned primary methods, as well as economy, accuracy and correspondence with technical staff, a volumetric method is chosen as calibration principle. The principle of the method is based on collecting water into a tank with a known geometry, and by execution of level- and time measurements calculating the discharge. The calibration rig consists of a flowmeter, inlet <b>nozzle,</b> <b>deflector</b> mechanism, emergency weir, calibration tank, level measurement, time measurement, drainage system, emergency weir, and an upgraded pipe run at the measuring section of the flowmeter. It is developed a LabView program, for logging and processing the voltage output from the flowmeter. The other measurements executed is registered manually in a separate calibration sheet for data processing. An evaluation of the accuracy in the calibration method is conducted, which may be used to determine the total uncertainty when the calibration facility is installed. Provided design and installation according to ISO 8316, the accuracy in discharge measurement with the volumetric method lies within ± 0, 1 - 0, 2 %. The major uncertainty contribution in the method lies in the determination of the volume collected, and the corresponding tank calibration. It is proposed to reduce the diameter of the flowmeter from original size of 400 mm to 250 mm. Reduction in diameter and upgraded pipe run will increase accuracy of the flow measurement, a result of improved flow pattern at the measuring section. When the primary calibration rig is installed at TTL, this will be a large step towards an IEC- approved laboratory in Nepal, which open doors against an international market. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{computerized}} {{grain sorghum}} plant growth model {{is combined with}} recursive programming to analyze the potential irrigation water savings from adopting irrigation scheduling and low pressure center pivot irrigation technology. Results indicate that irrigation pumping can be reduced with increased yields and net returns by adopting low energy precision application (LEPA) irrigation systems. Variations in input and output prices affect optimal irrigation quantities for low pressure irrigataion systems less than for high pressure systems. Key words: irrigation scheduling, irrigation technology, plant growth model, recursive programming. Throughout irrigated regions of the United States, farmers have responded to declining water supplies and increasing pumping costs by adopting improved irrigation technology. Many irrigators have converted older high pressure center pivot irrigation systems to more efficient low pressure systems. Additional sav-ings may be gained by adopting the low energy precision application (LEPA) sprinkler system (Lyle and Bordovsky). Low pressure irrigation systems reduce variable pumping costs by re-ducing fuel consumed to create pressure in the irrigation nozzle. In addition, by moving the <b>nozzle</b> or <b>deflector</b> closer to the plants, water application efficiency is increased. In a static model, {{it is assumed that}} pro-duction occurs in the area where the marginal product and average product are positive and diminishing. Figure 1 shows the impacts that changes in crop prices and irrigation water costs have on demand for water under profit-max-imizing conditions. Because the marginal val-ue product is the marginal physical product of water times the price of the commodity, a de-crease in commodity price shifts the MVP curve downward to MVP 1.

Results show that particle breakage occurs at any conditions for all the dusts investigated, except for lycopodium. It is also found that dispersion through the rebound nozzle generates a more significant variation in particle size than dispersion through the annular nozzle. Furthermore, higher fractional loss is observed with increasing dispersion pressure.

40|$|Currently, the {{hydroelectric}} {{generating sets}} of small HPPs with Pelton turbines employ as their generating units conventional synchronous generators with electromagnetic excitation. To {{deal with the}} torque pulsatile behaviour, they generally install a supplementary flywheel on the system shaft that levels the pulsations. The Pelton turbine power output is adjusted by the needle changing water flow in the nozzle, whose advancement modifies the nozzle area and eventually – the flow. They limit the needle full stroke time to 20 – 40 sec. since quick shutting the nozzle for swift water flow reduction may result in pressure surges. For quick power adjustment so-called deflectors are employed, whose task is retraction of water jets from the Pelton turbine buckets. Thus, the mechanical method of power output regulation requires agreement between the needle stroke inside the turbine <b>nozzles</b> and the <b>deflector.</b> The paper offers employing frequency-controlled synchronous machines with permanent magnets qua generating units for the hydroelectric generating sets of small HPPs with Pelton turbines. The developed computer model reveals that this provides {{a higher level of}} adjustability towards rapid-changing loads in the grid. Furthermore, this will replace the power output mechanical control involving the valuable deflector drive and the turbine nozzle needles with electrical revolution rate and power output regulation by a frequency converter located in the generator stator circuit. Via frequency start, the controllable synchronous machine ensures stable operation of the hydroelectric generating set with negligibly small amount of water (energy carrier). Finally, in complete absence of water, the frequency-relay start facilitates shifting the generator operation to the synchronous capacitor mode, which the system operating parameter fluctograms obtained through computer modeling prove.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Several {{insect pests}} of {{economic}} importance are encountered on vegetable crops. Being high value crops, {{the introduction of}} biological control agents such as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) has stimulated great interest for above and below-ground pests. However, despite promising laboratory and field trials, success with EPN in vegetables has rarely been achieved in field applications under practical conditions. Improvements in application technology for EPN that aim at minimizing losses during the transfer from the mixing tank to the target insect, increasing the competitiveness of EPN, are badly needed. Twenty years ago, the effect of application technology on EPN was underestimated. Laboratory experiments investigated the possible detrimental effects of application equipment and resulted in some rules of thumb, e. g., considering spray liquid temperature, nozzle size and pressure. Numerous succeeding studies, however, indicated that those restrictions do not prevent nematode damage. The general objective of this thesis was, therefore, to systematically screen all steps of the spray application process, from spray tank to nematode deposition, for possible detrimental or efficacy reducing effects on EPN applied in vegetables. Research started with a literature review {{on the effects of}} application technique on EPN, and on the characteristics of three important vegetable pests (cabbage maggot, onion thrips and cabbage moth) and their control with EPN. Experiments were designed to investigate two important processes of the spray system, i. e., agitation and spray formation. More practical oriented experiments were performed to study the effect of the spray application technique on nematode deposition. Finally, the effect of spray volume on nematode deposition, viability and infectivity was studied. For the application of EPN, a good agitation system is indispensable as the nematodes tend to sediment fast in a spray tank without agitation. Three agitation systems, viz. mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic agitation were tested for their ability to keep the nematodes suspended. Hydraulic agitation was tested using a centrifugal and a diaphragm pump. Nematode damage was quantified based on viability and infectivity of the EPN. Mechanical agitation at a speed of approximately 696 revolutions min- 1 did not influence the viability nor the infectivity of the nematodes. Also pneumatic agitation during 120 min was not detrimental to the EPN. Viability, nor infectivity were affected. However, the effect of hydraulic agitation differed depending on the pump type used. Hydraulic agitation using the diaphragm pump did not harm the nematodes, whereas the use of the centrifugal pump clearly affected viability. After 120 minutes of recirculation, only 19. 3 % of the nematodes survived; infectivity was even reduced to 0 %. An additional experiment revealed that the temperature increase, from 21. 7 °C to 45. 4 °C, was responsible for the observed nematode damage. The ability of the agitation system to keep the nematodes in suspension was examined by comparing the nematode concentration observed in the samples taken at different agitation times. These measurements showed that the pneumatic agitation was unstable. Agitation during 120 minutes using the other agitation systems resulted in a significant loss of nematodes at 15 cm above the spray tank bottom. In general, the experiments prove that the agitation systems developed to agitate a chemical solution are not always suited to agitate a nematode suspension and can attribute to reduced efficacy of EPN. One of the major considerations related to the selection and use of an application system is the application distribution pattern. A completely uniform distribution of the nematodes in soil applications is not essential because the nematodes can move over short distances; however, uniform distribution is important in foliar EPN applications. The volumetric distribution pattern of EPN was tested beneath four nozzle types, i. e., a standard flat fan nozzle (TeeJet XR 110 08), an air induction flat fan nozzle (TeeJet AI 110 08), a drift reducing <b>deflector</b> type <b>nozzle</b> (TeeJet TT 110 08) and a TwinJet spray nozzle (TeeJet TJ 60 110 08). A comparison with the distribution of a chemical tracer (Brilliant Sulfo Flavine, BSF) was made to reveal possible distribution problems. A significant effect of nozzle type on the distribution of EPN beneath a spray nozzle was found. The differences between the nematode distribution and the distribution of the chemical tracer were negligible for the flat fan and the TwinJet nozzle. Small differences were measured for the air induction nozzle, while a remarkable difference in EPN-BSF distribution was found for the <b>deflector</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The nematode concentration shows a sharp peak {{in the center of the}} spray fan and declines much faster toward the edges as compared with the BSF concentration. Ideally, the distribution of EPN beneath the spray boom should be uniform. A theoretical calculation of the coefficient of variation of the nematode distribution beneath a spray boom was performed and showed that the spray overlap from a spray boom decreases differences in nematode distribution. An acceptable value for the coefficient of variation was found for all nozzles, except for the TwinJet nozzle where the coefficient of variation was slightly above 7 %. Effective control of insect pests using EPN requires more than a judicious choice of the nematode species. The biological agent must also be delivered in a way that enables the nematodes to infect the host. The optimization process needs to account for the particular requirements of the EPN species used, the target pest, and the crop. The effect of spray application equipment was studied on the deposition of EPN in five pest control applications, viz. cabbage maggot (Delia radicum) and cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in both cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda) and onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek (Allium porrum). The nematode deposition (number of nematodes) and spray pattern (distribution of EPN in the droplets) were compared after applying a nematode suspension using a 5 -nozzle spray boom equipped with flat fan (TeeJet XR 110 08), air induction flat fan (TeeJet AI 110 08) or TwinJet spray nozzles (TeeJet TJ 60 110 08). Two additional spray application systems, viz. air support and row application, were evaluated on their effectiveness to deliver nematodes to their target site. Deposition of Steinernema feltiae was observed in the leek shaft (habitat of onion thrips) and at the cauliflower and savoy cabbage foot (habitat of cabbage maggot), while the deposition of S. carpocapsae was measured at the underside of cauliflower and savoy cabbage leaves (habitat of cabbage moth). Control measurements were performed using Petri dishes filled with water. Empty Petri dishes were used after spraying to measure the spray pattern. The cabbage plants were young but their foliage already sheltered the nematode spray significantly; approximately 40 % of the applied nematodes did not reach the foot of the plants. Changing nozzle type did not affect the deposition results, except for the TwinJet nozzle. A spray boom equipped with these dual fan nozzles delivered significantly fewer EPN at the foot of the cauliflower as compared with the flat fan nozzle. The use of an air support system or a row application system improved nematode deposition at the foot of the savoy cabbage. These systems, however, did not significantly increase deposition at the cauliflower foot. With the standard boom spray application technique, relative nematode deposition on the bottom side of the savoy cabbage leaves was 27. 2 %, while only 2. 6 % of the applied nematodes reached the bottom side of the cauliflower leaves. Neither nozzle type nor application technique affected nematode deposition at the bottom side of the savoy cabbage or cauliflower leaves. After spraying leek with a standard boom, a low nematode deposition was measured in the leek shaft. With this technique, only 7. 3 EPN cm- 2 reached the transition zone in the leek shaft. Changing nozzle type or using the air support system did not significantly increase nematode deposition in the leek shaft. Overall, no differences in nematode deposition were found on Petri dishes at different sampling positions along the spray boom, thus an even nematode distribution was obtained underneath the 5 -nozzle spray boom. Relative deposition on the horizontal Petri dishes, calculated based on the theoretical maximum deposition, was significantly higher for the air induction nozzle as compared to the flat fan nozzle for both nematode species. Nozzle type also affected the spray pattern of nematodes. The Petri dish surface covered with nematode containing droplets was very low and varied from 13. 6 % (flat fan nozzle) to 15. 8 % (air induction nozzle). The experiments provide evidence that EPN frequently do not reach their target sites using standard application techniques. Moreover, the nematodes reaching their target are applied in droplets that cover only a small part of the treated surface. The use of adapted spray application techniques that direct the spray to the target site are indispensable to increase chances for contact of EPN with their target and to result in a cost-effective and reliable application. Spray volume can influence the amount of free water on the leaf surface and subsequently the ability for EPN to move. Therefore, the effect of spray volume, viz. 548, 730 and 1095 L ha- 1, was investigated on the deposition, viability and infectivity of EPN against Galleria mellonella on savoy cabbage, cauliflower and leek. Leaf disks and filter paper disks, placed at different angles to the spray nozzle, were exposed to a nematode spray. Increasing spray volume decreased nematode deposition on top of 7. 1 cm² leek leaf disks in a 15 ° angle with the spray nozzle. Although the number of living nematodes observed after 240 min of incubation (24 °C and 60 % RH) was not significantly different between the low and the high volume application, a greater infectivity was obtained in the latter application. No significant effect of spray volume was observed on the relative deposition of S. carpocapsae on the bottom side of cauliflower and savoy cabbage leaf disks. Despite the low S. carpocapsae deposition on the bottom side of the savoy cabbage disks, high infectivity was obtained against G. mellonella. Using the lowest spray volume, infectivity decreased with increasing exposure time, while infectivity was not affected by exposure time when a spray volume of 730 L ha- 1 or more was used. Based on these experiments, spray volume can be considered as an important application parameter since it can affect nematode infectivity. The results of this research confirm that the technique used for the spray application can have severe efficacy reducing effects on EPN. These effects can be observed in the different steps of the application process and vary from nematode death, loss of nematodes and problems to keep the nematodes suspended in the spray tank to difficulties to reach the target pest and covering the target site evenly. The application of chemical insecticides is known to be very inefficient since only small amounts of the applied product reaches the insect, but eventually results in acceptable pest control due to the high persistence of the chemicals. Entomopathogenic nematodes, however, have low persistence on exposed surfaces and are currently too expensive to be applied in excessive amounts. More research is therefore badly needed to develop new or adjusted spray equipment or other application techniques which can deliver nematodes more efficiently at their target site in large field applications...|$|R
