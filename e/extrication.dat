5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began a {{training}} program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program began at the 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live <b>extrication</b> exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders. The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged <b>extrication</b> time.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In a cold, wet, or windy environment, cold {{exposure}} can {{be considerable}} for an injured or ill person. The subsequent autonomous stress response initially will increase circulatory and respiratory demands, and as {{body core temperature}} declines, the patient's condition might deteriorate. Therefore, the application of adequate insulation to reduce cold exposure and prevent body core cooling {{is an important part}} of prehospital primary care, but recommendations for what should be used in the field mostly depend on tradition and experience, not on scientific evidence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal insulation properties in different wind conditions of 12 different blankets and rescue bags commonly used by prehospital rescue and ambulance services. METHODS: The thermal manikin and the selected insulation ensembles were setup inside a climatic chamber in accordance to the modified European Standard for assessing requirements of sleeping bags. Fans were adjusted to provide low (< 0. 5 m/s), moderate (2 - 3 m/s) and high (8 - 9 m/s) wind conditions. During steady state thermal transfer, the total resultant insulation value, Itr (m 2 C/Wclo; where C = degrees Celcius, and W = watts), was calculated from ambient air temperature (C), manikin surface temperature (C), and heat flux (W/m 2). RESULTS: In the low wind condition, thermal insulation of the evaluated ensembles correlated to thickness of the ensembles, ranging from 2. 0 to 6. 0 clo (1 clo = 0. 155 m 2 C/W), except for the reflective metallic foil blankets that had higher values than expected. In moderate and high wind conditions, thermal insulation was best preserved for ensembles that were windproof and resistant to the compressive effect of the wind, with insulation reductions down to about 60 - 80 % of the original insulation capacity, whereas wind permeable and/or lighter materials were reduced down to about 30 - 50 % of original insulation capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated insulation ensembles might all be used for prehospital protection against cold, either as single blankets or in multiple layer combinations, depending on ambient temperatures. However, with extended outdoor, on-scene durations, such as during prolonged <b>extrications</b> or in multiple casualty situations, the results of this study emphasize the importance of using a windproof and compression resistant outer ensemble to maintain adequate insulation capacity...|$|R
