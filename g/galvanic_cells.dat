The reactor comprises a gas pipeline connecting the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> with the fuel cell for bringing the hydrogen produced at the cathode of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> to the anode of the fuel cell. The hydrogen production cell is arranged in a reservoir containing the aqueous solution and partially below a surface of the aqueous solution, while the fuel cell is partially arranged above the surface of the aqueous solution. The fuel cell is arranged above the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> displayed as hydrogen production cell. The fuel cell comprises an inlet opening (14) to the supply of air oxygen to a cathode of the fuel cell and an outlet opening to the removal of produced water. The inlet opening and the outlet opening are arranged above the surface of the aqueous solution, while the openings of the hydrogen production cell are arranged {{below the surface of the}} aqueous solution. The reservoir is given through a sea or another water or a part of sea water or another water. The hydrogen production cell comprises an inlet valve, an outlet valve for closing the openings of the hydrogen production cell, and a pump for producing or maintaining a flow of the aqueous solution within the hydrogen production cell or through the hydrogen production cell. The hydrogen production cell comprises a housing containing an anode and a cathode of the hydrogen production cell, and a supply container arranged external of the housing and connected over the supply line with the housing, where the supply container has openings. The anode of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> is formed from zinc or aluminum or magnesium or an alloy containing zinc and/or aluminum and/or magnesium as the hydrogen production cell. The hydrogen production cell and the fuel cell are electrically turned in row. A resistance load is connected or combined over the anode and the cathode of the hydrogen production cell to each other for increasing a fluent flow for the production of an excess of hydrogen or for balancing hydrogen losses through the hydrogen production cell. A filter is arranged in a progress or at an end of the gas pipeline and/or at an inlet opening leading to the cathode of the fuel cell. A memory is provided for a liquid oxidizer, which is guided from the memory of a cathode of the fuel cell. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of producing hydrogen. USE - Electrochemical reactor useful for power supply of a system, which is an electrically driven boat, a buoy, a sea-water mark, marine research plant, a board power supply system or an emergency power supply system (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The electrochemical reactor can be simply, safely and economically produced in an environmentally friendly manner...|$|R

25|$|The {{first known}} {{electric}} locomotive {{was built in}} 1837 by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen in Scotland, and it was powered by <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> (batteries). Thus {{it was also the}} earliest battery electric locomotive. Davidson later built a larger locomotive named Galvani, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two direct-drive reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of one and a half miles (2 kilometers). It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their job security.|$|E
500|$|By 1849, {{generators}} {{based on}} Faraday's law of induction had become advanced enough to replace {{both types of}} machines, and Bird was recommending them in his lectures. [...] <b>Galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> suffered from the inconvenience of {{having to deal with}} the electrolyte acids in the surgery and the possibility of spillages; electrostatic generators required a great deal of skill and attention to keep them working successfully. [...] Electromagnetic machines, on the other hand, have neither of these drawbacks; the only criticism levelled by Bird was that the cheaper machines could only deliver an alternating current. [...] For medical use, particularly when treating a problem with nerves, a unidirectional current of a particular polarity was often needed, requiring the machine to have split rings or similar mechanisms. However, Bird considered alternating current machines suitable for cases of amenorrhœa.|$|E

50|$|The {{electrode}} potential cannot be obtained empirically. The <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> potential {{results from a}} pair of electrodes. Thus, only one empirical value is available in a pair of electrodes and {{it is not possible to}} determine the value for each electrode in the pair using the empirically obtained <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> potential. A reference electrode, standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), for which the potential is defined or agreed upon by convention, needed to be established. In this case SHE is set to 0.00 V and any electrode, for which the {{electrode potential}} is not yet known, can be paired with SHE - to form a <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> - and the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> potential gives the unknown electrode's potential.

2500|$|Hermann Nernst {{developed}} {{the theory of}} the electromotive force of the voltaic cell in 1888. He developed methods for measuring dielectric constants and was the first to show that solvents of high dielectric constants promote the ionization of substances. Nernst's early studies in electrochemistry were inspired by Arrhenius' dissociation theory which first recognised the importance of ions in solution. In 1889, Nernst elucidated the theory of <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> by assuming an [...] "electrolytic pressure of dissolution," [...] which forces ions from electrodes into solution and which was opposed to the osmotic pressure of the dissolved ions. He applied the principles of thermodynamics to the chemical reactions proceeding in a battery. In that same year he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the free energy change in the chemical reaction producing the current. He constructed an equation, known as Nernst Equation, which describes the relation of a battery cell's voltage to its properties.|$|E
