5|$|<b>Double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E
25|$|In the past, UVA was {{considered}} not harmful or less harmful than UVB, {{but today it}} is known to contribute to skin cancer via indirect DNA damage (free radicals such as reactive oxygen species). UVA can generate highly reactive chemical intermediates, such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals, which in turn can damage DNA. The DNA damage caused indirectly to skin by UVA consists mostly of single-strand breaks in DNA, while {{the damage caused by}} UVB includes direct formation of thymine dimers or other pyrimidine dimers and <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breakage. UVA is immunosuppressive for the entire body (accounting for {{a large part of the}} immunosuppressive effects of sunlight exposure), and is mutagenic for basal cell keratinocytes in skin.|$|E

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) are N-glycosylases that {{remove a}} specific adenine from the sarcin/ricin loop {{of the large}} rRNA in a manner analogous to N-glycosylases {{that are involved in}} DNA repair. Some RIPs have been reported to remove adenines from single-stranded <b>DNA</b> and cleave <b>double-stranded</b> supercoiled <b>DNA.</b> The molecular basis for the activity of RIPs on <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> is not known. Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a single-chain RIP from Phytolacca americana, cleaves supercoiled DNA into relaxed and linear forms. <b>Double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> treated with PAP contains apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites due to the removal of adenine. Using an active-site mutant of PAP (PAPx) which does not depurinate rRNA, we present evidence that <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> treated with PAPx does not contain AP sites and is not cleaved. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} PAP cleaves supercoiled <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> using the same active site that is required for depurination of rRNA...|$|R
500|$|In {{bacterial}} conjugation, where DNA {{is transferred}} between bacteria through direct cell-to-cell contact, homologous recombination helps integrate foreign DNA into the host genome via the RecBCD pathway. [...] The RecBCD enzyme promotes recombination after DNA is converted from single-strand DNA–in which form it originally enters the bacterium–to <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> during replication. [...] The RecBCD pathway is also {{essential for the}} final phase of transduction, a type of horizontal gene transfer in which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus. [...] Foreign, bacterial DNA is sometimes misincorporated in the capsid head of bacteriophage virus particles as DNA is packaged into new bacteriophages during viral replication. [...] When these new bacteriophages infect other bacteria, DNA from the previous host bacterium is injected into the new bacterial host as <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA.</b> [...] The RecBCD enzyme then incorporates this <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> into the genome of the new bacterial host.|$|E
500|$|In this pathway, a three-subunit enzyme complex called RecBCD initiates {{recombination}} by binding to a blunt {{or nearly}} blunt {{end of a}} break in <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA.</b> [...] After RecBCD binds the DNA end, the RecB and RecD subunits begin unzipping the DNA duplex through helicase activity. [...] The RecB subunit also has a nuclease domain, which cuts the single strand of DNA that emerges from the unzipping process. [...] This unzipping continues until RecBCD encounters a specific nucleotide sequence (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') known as a Chi site.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a major}} DNA {{repair process}} in bacteria. [...] It is also important for producing genetic diversity in bacterial populations, although the process differs substantially from meiotic recombination, which repairs DNA damages and brings about diversity in eukaryotic genomes. [...] Homologous recombination has been most studied and is best understood for Escherichia coli.

500|$|Two primary {{models for}} how {{homologous}} recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA are the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway (sometimes called the double Holliday junction model) and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. [...] The two pathways {{are similar in}} their first several steps. [...] After a double-strand break occurs, the MRX complex (MRN complex in humans) binds to DNA {{on either side of}} the break. [...] Next a resection, in which DNA around the 5' ends of the break is cut back, is carried out in two distinct steps. In the first step of resection, the MRX complex recruits the Sae2 protein. The two proteins then trim back the 5' ends {{on either side of the}} break to create short 3' overhangs of single-strand DNA. [...] In the second step, 5'→3' resection is continued by the Sgs1 helicase and the Exo1 and Dna2 nucleases. [...] As a helicase, Sgs1 [...] "unzips" [...] the <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA,</b> while Exo1 and Dna2's nuclease activity allows them to cut the single-stranded DNA produced by Sgs1.|$|E
500|$|Transformation (the {{transfer}} of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium) {{appears to be}} part of an adaptation for DNA repair. [...] H. pylori is naturally competent for transformation. [...] While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions, such as starvation, H. pylori is competent throughout logarithmic growth. [...] All organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage. In H. pylori, homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The AddAB helicase-nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single-strand DNA (ssDNA), which then mediates strand exchange, leading to homologous recombination and repair. The requirement of RecA plus AddAB for efficient gastric colonization suggests, in the stomach, H. pylori is either exposed to <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination-mediated event. [...] In particular, natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in H. pylori, and a connection exists between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in H. pylori, suggesting natural competence contributes to persistence of H. pylori in its human host and explains the retention of competence in most clinical isolates.|$|E

Component II in m-NaCl is denatured with alkali within a sharp pH range, but component I is denatured over a wide pH range (pH 11. 2 to 12. 4). The midpoints of the transition in m-NaCl are pH 11. 3 and 11. 9, respectively. Component I in 0. 1 -phosphate is irreversibly denatured at pH 12. 7 to 12. 8 or higher, giving rise to a structure which sediments in neutral m-NaCl with an S 20,w = 40 s. The configuration of denatured <b>double-stranded</b> φX <b>DNA</b> has been studied by means of velocity sedimentation, isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl and spectrophotometry, and also the reactivity for formaldehyde has been determined. From the results it is concluded that denatured <b>double-stranded</b> φX <b>DNA</b> occurs as a highly twisted structure in which all or almost all hydrogen bonds have been disrupted. Denatured <b>double-stranded</b> φX <b>DNA</b> does not renature at high temperatures in low or high salt concentrations, but is converted spontaneously to native <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> after introduction of a single-strand break by pancreatic DNase.
