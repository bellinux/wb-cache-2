50|$|In {{a typical}} power {{distribution}} grid, electric transformer power loss typically contributes about 40-50% {{of the total}} transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>loss.</b> Energy efficient transformers are therefore an important means to reduce transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>loss.</b> With the improvement of electrical steel (silicon steel) properties, the losses of a transformer in 2010 can be half that of a similar transformer in the 1970s.

40|$|Dc microgrids {{including}} grid-tied inverter, {{energy storage}} system, and distributed generations {{have the advantage}} of high efficiency as compared to the ac system. Droop control has been realized to suppress the current mismatching among distributed sources. However, the conventional droop control involves <b>distribution</b> <b>loss</b> due to the line impedance. In this paper, a novel droop control is proposed to minimize the <b>distribution</b> <b>loss</b> by adjusting controllable droop coefficient. The control objective of the novel droop control is that energy storage system supplies the most adjacent load with their energy within rated power. Hence, the <b>distribution</b> <b>loss</b> can be minimized significantly by tracking the new reference voltage in order to maintain same output voltage of each converter. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to verify proposed droop control method.

This problem is partially caused by the widespread existence of illegal connections, altered metering systems and low bill collection capacity in certain areas.|$|E

Also, in August 2007, an agreement was reached between Unión Fenosa and Nicaragua’s new government.

25|$|The {{reforms of}} the 1990s did not achieve their objectives. It had been {{expected}} that privatization would bring investment in new generation, but very little capacity was added {{in the years that}} followed the reform. Moreover, the generation capacity added in the last decade has been mainly dependent on liquid fuels, making the country more vulnerable to rising oil prices. In addition, as mentioned, <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> have remained at very high levels (28%). The reform also aimed at implementing gradual changes in electricity tariffs that would reflect costs, which proved to be politically unfeasible.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{an average}} of 259 liters/person/day of water were {{produced}} in urban areas. Actual water consumption is much lower than this level due to <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> estimated around 45%. Per capita water production has decreased by 26% since 1997 when production was at 352 liters/person/day. This decrease may be partly due {{to an increase in}} the share of metered users from 24% to 47% (1997–2005). According to the National Sanitation Plan, it is inadmissible that with such high levels of production water supply remains intermittent in many cities.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} original panel {{data from}} 86 countries between 1985 and 2006.

The research findings suggest that reform variables such as the entry of independent power producers (IPPs), unbundling of generation and transmission, establishment of regulatory agencies, {{and the introduction of}} a wholesale spot market are the driving forces of increasing generation capacity, as well as reducing transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>loss</b> in the respective regions. In this study, we can assume that, firstly, different electric industry's reform policies/measures have different impacts on geographically and economically diverse countries.

25|$|Public {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} in Germany is universal and of good quality. Some salient features of the sector compared to other developed countries are its very low per capita water use, the high share of advanced wastewater treatment and very low <b>distribution</b> <b>losses.</b> Responsibility for {{water supply and}} sanitation provision lies with municipalities, which are regulated by the states. Professional associations and utility associations {{play an important role in}} the sector. As in other EU countries, most of the standards applicable to the sector are set in Brussels (see EU water policy). Recent developments include a trend to create commercial public utilities under private law and an effort to modernize the sector, including through more systematic benchmarking.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{has responded to}} the challenges in various ways, including through a ban on drilling new wells, the introduction of more efficient irrigation techniques, the reduction of water losses, an ambitious municipal wastewater treatment program, and the gradual concentration of industries in newly created industrial estates. However, there are no limits on the extraction of water from more than 25,000 existing wells, water <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> remain high, the use of efficient irrigation techniques remains limited and untreated wastewater continues to be discharged into the environment. The challenges thus are far from being resolved. In 2006 the {{government has}} temporary revived plans for an expensive scheme to bring in water from the Euphrates river, located more than 400km from Damascus.|$|E
25|$|The {{per capita}} water use in Latin America varies greatly among countries, among {{cities in the}} same country, and between urban and rural areas, and {{obviously}} among those with a house connection, a public tap or no improved water source at all. The average net urban water use (i.e. excluding <b>distribution</b> <b>losses)</b> was estimated at about 240 liter/capita/day, a level that is about as high as in the United States and almost {{twice as high as}} in Central Europe. The highest water use can be found in some utilities in Chile and Argentina, where water resources are abundant and water use is almost 500 liter/capita/day. The lowest water use is in Aguas de Illimani serving La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, with less than 50 liter/capita/day. In rural areas water use is sometimes even lower than this level.|$|E

Some of the challenges are a decreasing population, declining investment, fiscal constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change.|$|E
25|$|Just like data {{on water}} availability, {{publicly}} available data on water use in Greater Damascus are contradictory and outdated. In 2001 water use {{has been estimated}} at between 1,350 and 1,700 million cubic metres per year. This includes water use for irrigation that was estimated at between 920 and more than 1,200 million cubic metres per year, accounting for 68% and 76% of total water use in the basin. Domestic water use was estimated at between 300 and 390 million cubic metres per year. The lower bound of this estimate is probably more realistic and is equivalent {{to an average of}} about 220 liter/capita/day before <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> for a population connected to the network of about 3.75 million. Taking into account non-revenue water of about 50%, this corresponds to about 110 liter/capita/day which is about as much as domestic water use in Germany. However, during summer water availability and thus water use drop significantly. For example, in the summer of 2001 the city received 317,000 cubic meter per day, corresponding to about 85 liter/capita/day before losses and 43 liter/capita/day after losses.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian {{government}} has {{at various times}} considered two alternative mega-projects to bring additional water to the Greater Damascus area. One plan consisted in the transfer {{of water from the}} coastal region over a distance of at least 225km and a cumulated difference in altitude of about 1000m. The water sources considered were two reservoirs in the coastal basin and even offshore springs in the Mediterranean or desalination of seawater at a total cost of more than US$1 per cubic meter including its transfer. By 2010 this plan was considered to have been abandoned. The other plan consists in building a pipeline from the Euphrates River. In 2006 Syrian officials said they were “pressing ahead” with a feasibility study by a Swiss company to transfer water from the Euphrates to Damascus at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. The project would involve conveying water from Lake Assad, some 441 kilometers away with pumping over an altitude of 712 meters. A capacity of 850 million m3 per annum has been envisaged, about twice the current water deficit in Greater Damascus. The cost for bulk water before <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> would be more than US$0.50 per cubic meter.|$|E
