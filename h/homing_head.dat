Flight mission data is inserted into the missile control system after input of target coordinates. An inertial system controls the missile in flight, stabilizes it at an assigned altitude and brings it to a target location area. At a certain target range, the <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> is switched on to search for, lock on and track the target. The inertial control system then turns the missile toward the target and changes its flight altitude to an extremely low one. At this altitude, the missile continues the process of homing by the data fed from the <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> and the inertial control system until a hit is obtained.|$|E

5000|$|The {{draft project}} was {{completed}} in 1970 and progressed to testing using testbed aircraft. One of these was a converted early-production MiG-25 (aircraft P-10), and was used in 1972 for autonomous test launches from the upgraded APU-40 pylon. A MiG-21 (serial 76211524) was converted into the LL-21 testbed to test the missile seekers, while a Tu-104 jetliner (serial 42324) was converted into LL-104-518 (also known as LL-2) by NTK [...] "Vzlet" [...] to test the MFBU-410/"Zaslon" [...] radar along with missile <b>homing</b> <b>heads</b> mounted on GVM-410 mockups. The space on board the passenger aircraft-based testbed allowed for the carriage of extensive diagnostic and support equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 2004, the Russian Air Force began a major {{update of}} the {{original}} Soviet Su-27 ('Flanker-B') fleet. The upgraded variants were designated Su-27SM (Russian for [...] "Seriyniy Modernizovanniy" [...] - literally [...] "Serial Modernized"). This included upgrades in air-to-air capability with the RVV-AE missile with an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>head.</b> The modernized Su-27SM fighters belong to the 4+ generation. The strike capability was enhanced {{with the addition of}} the Kh-29T/TE/L and Kh-31P/Kh-31A ASM and KAB-500KR/KAB-1500KR smart bombs. The avionics were also upgraded.|$|E
50|$|Testing {{three models}} of the first bombs {{were made in the}} spring of 1945. The bombs were dropped on the heat target 10 × 30 meters (the fire burning on the raft). The results were not satisfactory, {{despite the fact that the}} <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> worked quite {{confident}} satisfactorily demonstrated itself plumage bomb. Only 5 or 6 out of 50 bombs dropped hit the target. Based on these results, the fleet created two new models with advanced bomb plumage, but by the time the bombs were ready for testing, the war ended.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can be set}} {{to travel}} at one of four pre-selected heights, {{depending}} on the surface conditions. Near the target, the missile climbs to a height at which it can [...] "acquire" [...] the target. The launching helicopter illuminates the target with its radar (originally the specially developed Ferranti Seaspray {{in the case of}} the Lynx), and the missile's <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> homes in on the reflected energy. On impact it penetrates the hull of a ship before detonating the 62 lb blast fragmentation warhead. A semi armour piercing (SAP) warhead is also available; this contains 9 kg of RDX, aluminium and wax. The fuze is an impact-delayed model.|$|E

50|$|The {{seeker head}} of 9M31, however, {{utilizes}} the PbS elements differently from usual. Taking {{advantage of the}} fact that the clear sky gives strong and constant background emission at below 2 micrometer range, peaking at visual light (0.4 to 0.7 micrometer) wavelengths at which PbS in 295 kelvins temperature still provides a response, the seeker head is used to track a change of radiation from the target compared to the background. The method is called optical photocontrast homing (Rus.: фотоконтрастное наведение). The advantage of photocontrast homing method over traditional heat-seeking <b>homing</b> <b>heads</b> using PbS elements is that it negates the most serious drawback of early-generation IR-homing missiles: complete lack of front-aspect engagement capability against approaching jets. Even early cooled seeker heads had usually only limited forward hemisphere engagement abilities, often reducing to zero in case of jets approaching exactly towards the shooter.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{change over the}} Strela 2 was the introduction of an all-new infra-red <b>homing</b> seeker <b>head.</b> The new seeker worked on FM modulation (con-scan) principle, which is less vulnerable to jamming and decoy flares than the earlier AM (spin-scan) seekers, which were easily fooled by flares {{and even the most}} primitive infrared jammers. The new seeker also introduced detector element cooling {{in the form of a}} pressurized nitrogen bottle attached to the launcher.|$|R
50|$|Armament {{interceptor}} {{includes four}} supersonic (M>5) UR great range R-40T (R-40TD) air-to-air missiles with thermal <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> and R-40P (R-40RD) with semi-active radar guidance system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal {{on a collision}} course - 35-60 km). A fuel tank can be suspended under the fuselage. The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability. As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000m (66,000 ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500 kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres.|$|E
50|$|The US Air Force studied various {{improvements}} to the AGM-158, resulting {{in the development of}} the JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), which received the designation AGM-158B in 2002. Using a more efficient engine and larger fuel volume in an airframe with the same external dimensions as the JASSM, the JASSM-ER is intended to have a range of over 575 mi as compared to the JASSM's range of about 230 mi. Other possible improvements were studied but ultimately not pursued, including a submunition dispenser warhead, new types of <b>homing</b> <b>head,</b> and a new engine giving ranges in excess of 620 mi. The JASSM-ER has 70% hardware commonality and 95% software commonality with the original AGM-158 JASSM.|$|E
5000|$|Red Top was {{faster and}} had a longer range than Firestreak, and [...] "was capable of all aspect homing against super-sonic targets." [...] An {{important}} difference between Firestreak and Red Top was the electronics technology used. Firestreak electronics used thermionic valves, which were [...] "wired in" [...] to the control / guidance electronics and required a system of cooling pipes to remove the heat generated by the valve filaments. For this reason, the Firestreak missile on ground test was cooled by Arcton and in flight by ammonia pumped through the missile from the parent aircraft. The Red Top electronics were constructed using transistors which were heated instead and the IR sensor in its dome-shaped <b>Homing</b> <b>Head</b> was cooled by purified air at [...] filtered to 3 µm.|$|E
50|$|The Sidewinder {{subsequently}} evolved {{through a}} series of upgraded versions with newer, more sensitive seekers with various types of cooling and various propulsion, fuse, and warhead improvements. Although each of those versions had various seeker, cooling, and fusing differences, all but one shared infrared homing. The exception was the U.S. Navy AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IB (later AIM-9C), a Sidewinder with a semi-active radar <b>homing</b> seeker <b>head</b> developed for the F-8 Crusader. Only about 1,000 of these weapons were produced, many of which were later rebuilt as the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile.|$|R
2500|$|The 9M38 uses a {{single-stage}} X-winged design {{without any}} detachable parts; its exterior design {{is similar to}} the American Tartar and Standard surface-to-air missile series, which led to the half-serious nickname of Standardski.

In the forward compartment of the missile, a semi-active <b>homing</b> radar <b>head</b> (9E50, [...] ), autopilot equipment, power source and warhead are located. The homing method chosen was proportional navigation. Some elements of the missile were compatible with the Kub's 3M9; for example, its forward compartment diameter (33cm), which was less than the rear compartment diameter.|$|R

5000|$|By August 2016, Russia was finalizing {{the trials}} of the Kh-32 cruise missile, a {{derivative}} of the Kh-22. Designed {{for use by the}} Tu-22M3 bomber, the missile is designed to climb to 40 km to the stratosphere after launch, transition to level flight, then perform a steep dive to the target; its combination of speed and flight path makes it virtually invulnerable to interception by ground-based air defenses and fighters. The advanced cruise missile is designed to target enemy ships, radars, and [...] "radio-contrast targets" [...] like bridges, military bases, electric power plants, and others. The Kh-32 has an inertial navigation system and radar <b>homing</b> <b>head,</b> making it independent of GPS/GLONASS navigation satellites.

50|$|The R.510 was {{optically}} {{guided by}} a PbS infra-red photocell with a 20° field of view. Testing of the R.510 began at Hammaguir in October 1952, and a limited production run of 100 missiles were ordered. However the PbS seeker was insensitive and could only effectively track targets at night. However The R.511 entered service in 1957, replacing the R.510. The R.511 used a Thompson-CSF semi-active radar <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> which was tuned to home on to reflections of the launch aircraft's radar; its antenna scanned conically 8° off the boresight of the missile {{at a rate of}} 225 revolutions per second. For longer range firing guidance commands were transmitted directly to the missile via an antenna on the trailing edge of the missiles wing. Limitations of the launch aircraft's radar restricted operation to above 3000 m.|$|E

These were the by-products of the vibration department, whose experience in electronics was, early in 1952, to provide the nucleus of a team which began the design of guided weapons: besides guided missiles, de Havilland Propellers undertook the manufacture of aircraft cold-air units, turbine-driven electric alternators, radar scanners, electronic equipment, plastic structures—even an experimental 80 ft windmill to derive electricity from the wind. In that year the company received a contract from the Ministry of Supply (MoS) {{for the development of}} a compact turbo-alternator to meet electrical power requirements of missiles developed by other companies.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} necessary components to design cooperative guidance strategies for area air defense applications, {{as a part}} of a project supported by UK MoD and French DGA MCM-ITP (Materials and Components for Missile - Innovation and Technology Partnership) programme. The main considerations in developing the cooperative guidance scheme are the uncertainty of the target manoeuvre and the zone defence concept. For the interception of unpredictable targets before they reach any asset in the defended area, Earliest Intercept Geometry (EIG) and Intercept Geometry (IG) are introduced; EIG is analytically obtained and IG is numerically computed in consideration of physical constraints of the missile and target. Then, two mid course guidance laws are proposed using the geometries, termed the Earliest Intercept Geometry Guidance Law (EIGGL) and Intercept Geometry Guidance Law (IGGL). Since the EIG or IG represents a capture zone of the missile, the defended assets can be protected if the guidance law guarantees no overlapping between the geometry (EIG or IG) and the defended area. In many-on-many engagement scenarios, it is clear that the performance of the guidance scheme depends on the target allocation policy, thus an optimal target allocation algorithm is designed using the EIG and IG to maximize the reachability and safety margin. Multiple co-existing hypotheses about future target trajectory in the mid course and homing phase result in an initial angular di erence between actual flight path and the flight path demanded by the homing guidance law at handover, termed the heading error. Even if a hypothesis of future target trajectory is common to mid course and <b>homing</b> guidance laws, <b>heading</b> error can be caused by errors in uplink data because of radar/launcher misalignment, tracker lag, radar measurement error etc. Since this error might result in an abrupt change of the missile acceleration, it is undesirable. In order to resolve this problem, an optimal homing guidance law is developed by introducing a second order polynomial function into the cost function of the guidance problem. The performance of the optimal guidance law heavily depends on the accuracy of the time-to-go estimates. Because the optimal guidance laws are used in the calculation of the IG and the terminal homing guidance, a time-togo estimation algorithm is also proposed. The performance of each algorithm is demonstrated using simple numerical examples. Furthermore, the overall performance of the cooperative guidance algorithm is verified using scenarios in naval and ground context and a Simulink Common Model (CM). For the algorithm test and development, these scenarios and CM have been shared between partners and have evolved during the project. Future work within this research area is discussed further in the last chapter of this thesis, along with other applications for the cooperative guidance scheme i...|$|R
50|$|Being the {{successor}} of the DM2A3, it features an advanced electrical propulsion {{system and a}} fiber optic cable for torpedo guidance and communication, which, in conjunction with advanced signals processing and mission logic, makes the torpedo largely countermeasure resistant. The DM2A4/SeaHake mod 4 is the first torpedo ever to be guided by a fiber optic wire. With a fully digital system architecture, increased range and speed and its new conformal array sonar with a very wide panoramic sensor angle {{as well as the}} additional wake homing sensor, the DM2A4/SeaHake mod 4 provides greatly advanced performance over its predecessor. The <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> shell is a hydrodynamic optimised parabolic shape which aims to reduce torpedo self-noise and cavitation to an absolute minimum. The homing head's conformal transducer array permits detection angles of +/-100° in the horizontal and +/-24° in the vertical, therefore supporting larger acquisition angles in comparison to traditional flat arrays. The wide angle array is designed to reduce maneuvering when in search and reconnaissance stages, therefore also reducing self-noise and preserving battery power.|$|E
50|$|One system {{comprising}} up to 8 divisions (battalions) {{can control}} up to 72 launchers, {{with a maximum}} of 384 missiles (including missiles {{with a range of}} less than 250 km). The missiles are fired by a gas system from the launch tubes up to 30 metres into the air before the rocket motor ignites, which increases the maximum and decreases the minimum ranges. In April 2015, a successful test firing of the missile was conducted at an airborne target at a range of 400 km; TELs carrying the long-range 40N6 may only be able to hold two missiles instead of the typical four due to its larger size. Another test recorded a 9M96 missile using an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>head,</b> reached a height of 56 km. All the missiles are equipped with directed explosion warhead, which increases the probability of complete destruction of targets. In 2016, Russian anti-aircraft missile troops received new guided missiles for S-300 and S-400 defense systems. Anti-aircraft missile system, designed to destroy aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles, it can also be used against ground objectives. The S-400 is able to intercept cruise missiles out to a range of about 40 km due to their low altitude flight paths.|$|E

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{some issues}} of matching the operating {{area of the}} Doppler shortrange location system (SRLS) with the destructing area of a fragmentation warhead {{in a wide range}} of applicability with no information about the angular position of the target. When action is against the low altitude aerial targets at the sea surface background Doppler SRLS are often used to provide frequency selection of a target owing to differences in the spectral characteristics of the required signal and interferences. However, Doppler systems have an inherent disadvantage i. e. the inability to estimate the angular position of the target wit respect to the SRLS. Consequently, an arising problem to ensure the effectiveness of the combat unit, which includes the guidance system, Doppler SRLS, and fragmentation warhead is of significant practical use, when acting against the low altitude aerial targets {{in a wide range of}} encounter environment with a lack of information about the angular position of the target. The article considers a practical method for ensuring the effectiveness of the combat unit by selecting the width of the destructing elements separation angle and its orientation in space. An approximate method of geometric matching the scopes of warhead and SRLS based on computer aided numerical calculation is used. With the geometric approach to the efficiency estimation in any desired angular position of the target, Doppler SRLS should form a command to burst the warhead ensuring the straddling of the target by the field of destructing elements in an arbitrary predetermined point of conditions. Algorithms of the warhead and SRLS functioning are developed and utilized as applied programs. A Doppler SRLS model is proposed. The SRLS is integrated with semi-active Doppler <b>homing</b> <b>head</b> in case there is small-sized radar target. The article presents a mathematical description of the fragmentation warhead for relatively small misses, ignoring the air resistance. It considers a procedure for forming the predetermined detonation angle of the Doppler SRLS and discusses the features of its implementation in case of large angles of the velocity triangle with a wide-angle warhead. As examples to confirm an efficiency of the developed algorithms and programs, results are given which reflect numerical calculations for some typical SRLS functioning in a wide range of the changing angles of the velocity triangle and relative velocities. The developed approach can be used for the justification of requirements for the operating accuracy of Doppler SRLS at different design stages, including the initial phase just when forming a conceptual structure only of combat unit. </p...|$|E
