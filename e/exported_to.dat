40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to derive {{potential}} Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> major African countries. Park (2001) adopted conventional RCA and MCA techniques to evaluate the relative performance of Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> draw {{up a list of}} recommendable <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Africa. We improve Park's results in two ways; first, we develop a new indicator reflecting the characteristics of the African market, which was ignored in the former analysis, and second, we derive the RCA and MCA values of Chinese and Japanese <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Africa and compare them with those of Korean products. The final list of Korea's potential <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the African market is carefully derived and we find that competing with Japanese exports rather than Chinese ones is a more appropriate strategy for amending Korea's record of underperforming <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Africa...|$|R

40|$|I {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} China's GDP on Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the world and Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> China based on the VAR model. It is found that the responses of Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> shocks in China's GDP are very different by export type (exports of raw materials, capital goods, and consumption goods). Reflecting the trend {{that the proportion of}} capital goods in Korean exports is increasing, Korean exports of capital goods respond most sensitively to these shocks among the three export types. Another finding is that Korean exports of raw materials do not respond very sensitively relative <b>to</b> the other <b>export</b> types. These findings are almost same as those for Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> China in terms of response to GDP shocks. In addition, Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the world and Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> China are more responsive to China’s GDP growth shocks over time...|$|R
