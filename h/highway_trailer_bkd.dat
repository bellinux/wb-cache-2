2500|$|In 1959, when 85ft flat cars {{capable of}} {{carrying}} two 40-foot <b>highway</b> <b>trailers</b> in trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC), or [...] "piggyback" [...] service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on <b>highway</b> auto-carrier <b>trailers.</b> Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the <b>highway</b> <b>trailer</b> body without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack.|$|R

50|$|The K-36 trailer was a 2-ton trailer {{built by}} both the American Coach and Body Co. and the <b>Highway</b> <b>trailer</b> Co. Its gross weight was 6,815 Lbs. Besides {{carrying}} poles it could also carry cross arms and Pylon transformers. A later upgraded version was called the V-13/GT trailer 3.5-ton. The Engineers designated the same trailer the M271.|$|R
5000|$|The K-37 trailer {{could be}} {{configured}} to haul telephone poles, or wire reel for line construction. Its gross weight was 12.000 Lbs. and was towed by the 1.5-ton K-42, K-43, or k-44 telephone construction trucks. after World War II it was upgraded and renamed the M310. the primary manufacturer was the <b>Highway</b> <b>Trailer</b> Co. of Edgerton, Wisconsin ...|$|R
50|$|However, the {{southern}} end of the airfield is something of an industrial estate with large numbers of grain silos and <b>highway</b> <b>trailers</b> being parked. In addition, there appears to be a very large graveyard of ex MOD equipment (now operated by Witham Specialist Vehicles Limited who dispose of surplus UK MOD equipment), where C-47s and CG-4 Waco Gliders once were parked prior to the invasion of Continental Europe.|$|R
50|$|A list {{of serial}} numbers, {{manufacturers}} and dates of delivery is in compilation, {{and seems to}} indicate that <b>Highway</b> <b>Trailer</b> made the earliest units at the start of World War II, FWD production was later in World War II, and Regent Manufacturing post World War II production. York-Hoover and Transport Freight production has not yet been dated.USA serial number information does not seem to exist - at least in quantity, and images of the unit is service are very few.|$|R
5000|$|A logging {{railroad}} first reached Elba on March 20, 1892, {{with the}} first permanent rail line arriving in October 1898. The [...] "Dorsey Trailer Company" [...] was constructed {{at the end of}} this railroad line, and this company manufactured the <b>highway</b> <b>trailers</b> that served on railroads and highways starting with the piggyback railroad or containerized cargo boom of the second half of the 20th century. The new railroad line ended in West Elba, where the [...] "New Town" [...] industrial section of the town was located. The Seaboard System Railroad ceased all railroad service to Elba, including freight service, on November 27, 1984.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometry}} {{required to}} make a trailerable flooding-ballast boat function is such {{that they are a}} little awkward in appearance. This is accentuated by the high freeboard and narrow beam required to meet <b>highway</b> <b>trailering</b> limits ... Such boats almost always score poorly relative to their fixed keel counterparts in both sailing performance and power to carry sail. Apart from issues of portability and low cost, the more conventional fixed-keel boats ... are superior ... in most respects. Certainly if one is on a limited budget but wants a refined, good sailing, capable boat, one should consider a previously owned ... fixed-keel vessel.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sailboat}} {{designs for}} trailering incorporate special features. The MacGregor 26S, for {{example is a}} boat 25.82 ft in length, but that weighs 1650 lb empty and dry and carries 1200 lb of flooding water ballast in tanks which are filled when the boat is launched and drained when the boat {{is removed from the}} water, thus making the boat lighter to transport than if it used more traditional iron or lead ballast. The design also has a pivoting centreboard, plus a pivoting rudder and easily rigged mast to make getting the boat from the trailer to the water easy to accomplish. It also has a beam of 7.82 ft, under the 8.00 ft width limit for <b>highway</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|All was not {{necessarily}} lost after this incident when only four months later, the Illinois Central Gulf sold the CO&E Railroad its trackage and property altogether after they discontinued freight service along the entire route. With this new advantage in hand, the railroad's first common carrier freight services would commence soon afterwards and the first revenue train was pulled behind 2-4-2 #5 on [...] These changes in operation immediately took off successfully as freight customers started growing rapidly with CO&E's new locally owned and operated service. Piggyback service was also eventually added in [...] when a large fleet of more than 200 new flatcars and 600 <b>highway</b> <b>trailers</b> painted for the CO&E Railroad were delivered. A new engine was acquired {{at the same time}} to help switch cars around when a small Davenport 35-Ton switcher arrived on the property in 1978. Not long afterwards, the first test run of the 2-8-0 steamer finally occurred on [...] after an extensive four-year overhaul and quickly became the primary power of choice by July.|$|R

2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting <b>highway</b> freight <b>trailers</b> on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of {{securing}} each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|R
2500|$|NS {{is a major}} {{transporter}} {{of domestic}} and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, {{as well as the}} Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the [...] "Clearfield Cluster". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are <b>highway</b> truck <b>trailers</b> with interchangeable wheel sets.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} which components of heavy-duty highway vehicles are candidates for the substitution of titanium materials for current materials if the cost of those Ti components is very significantly reduced from current levels. The processes which could be used to produce those low cost components were also investigated. Heavy-duty highway vehicles are defined as all trucks and busses included in Classes 2 C through 8. These include heavy pickups and vans above 8, 500 lbs. GVWR, through <b>highway</b> tractor <b>trailers.</b> Class 8 is characterized as being a very cyclic market, with ''normal'' year volume, such as in 2000, of approximately 240, 000 new vehicles. Classes 3 - 7 are less cyclic, with ''normal'' i. e., year 2000, volume totaling approximately 325, 000 new vehicles. Classes 3 - 8 are powered about 88. 5 % by diesel engines, and Class 2 C at very roughly 83 % diesel. The engine portion of the study therefore focused on diesels. Vehicle production volumes were used in estimates of the market size for candidate components...|$|R
5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first cellular container ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial <b>highway</b> freight <b>trailers</b> and transit buses.|$|R
