25|$|Yield curves {{are usually}} upward sloping asymptotically: {{the longer the}} maturity, the higher the yield, with {{diminishing}} marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). There are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, {{it may be that}} the market is anticipating a rise in the risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors who are willing to lock their money <b>in</b> <b>now</b> need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments.|$|E
