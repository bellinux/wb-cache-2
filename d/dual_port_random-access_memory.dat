Spin-transfer torque technology has the potential to make possible MRAM devices combining low current requirements and reduced cost; however, the amount of current needed to reorient the magnetization is at present too high for most commercial applications, and the reduction of this current density alone is the basis for present academic research in spin electronics.|$|R

30|$|Nonvolatile memory {{technologies}} in Si-based electronics {{date back to}} the 1990 s. Ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) {{was one of the most}} promising devices replacing the conventional Flash memory facing physical scaling limitations at those times. A variant of charge storage memory referred to as Flash memory is widely used in consumer electronic products such as cell phones and music players while NAND Flash-based solid-state disks (SSDs) are increasingly displacing hard disk drives as the primary storage device in laptops, desktops, and even data centers. The integration limit of Flash memories is approaching, and many new types of memory to replace conventional Flash memories have been proposed. Emerging memory technologies promise new memories to store more data at less cost than the expensive-to-build silicon chips used by popular consumer gadgets including digital cameras, cell phones and portable music players. They are being investigated and lead to the future as potential alternatives to existing memories in future computing systems. Emerging nonvolatile memory technologies such as magnetic <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (MRAM), spin-transfer torque <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (STT-RAM), ferroelectric <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (FeRAM), phase-change memory (PCM), and resistive <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (RRAM) combine the speed of static <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (SRAM), the density of dynamic <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (DRAM), and the nonvolatility of Flash memory and so become very attractive as another possibility for future memory hierarchies. Many other new classes of emerging memory technologies such as transparent and plastic, three-dimensional (3 -D), and quantum dot memory technologies have also gained tremendous popularity in recent years. Subsequently, not an exaggeration to say that computer memory could soon earn the ultimate commercial validation for commercial scale-up and production the cheap plastic knockoff. Therefore, this review is devoted to the rapidly developing new class of memory technologies and scaling of scientific procedures based on an investigation of recent progress in advanced Flash memory devices.|$|R

5000|$|Dynamic <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (DRAM) {{is a type}} of <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. The capacitor can be either charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. Since even [...] "nonconducting" [...] transistors always leak a small amount, the capacitors will slowly discharge, and the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to static <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (SRAM) and other static types of memory. Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory (vs. non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. However, DRAM does exhibit limited data remanence.|$|R
