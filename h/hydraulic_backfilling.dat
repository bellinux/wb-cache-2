40|$|Permeability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters in the design of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfilling</b> of mine stopes. A simple and reproducible method was developed for preparing reconstituted hydraulic fill sample in the laboratory, that is representative of the hydraulic fill in the mine stope, replicating the slurry sedimentation process taking place in the mine. Constant head and falling head permeability tests were carried out on the samples, giving consistent results. A brick permeameter was developed to study the flow characteristics of the porous barricade bricks under one-dimensional flow, simulating the flow conditions in the mine. Three different methods were used to determine the permeability of the brick and the results showed very good agreement. This is the first rational attempt to measure the permeability of the porous barricade bricks that are used to close the horizontal access drives in the mines, thus retaining the hydraulic fill. The measurements show that the permeability of the barricade brick is about two to three orders of magnitude greater than that of the hydraulic fill...|$|E

40|$|Backfill is {{commonly}} used in underground mines. The quality control of the backfill is a key step to ensure it meets the designed strength requirement. This is done through sample collection from the underground environment, followed by uniaxial compression tests to obtain the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) in the laboratory. When the cylindrical cemented backfill samples are axially loaded to failure, several failure modes can be observed and mainly classified into diagonal shear failure and axial split failure. To date, the UCS obtained by these two failure modes {{are considered to be}} the same with no distinction between them. In this paper, an analysis of the UCS results obtained on a cemented <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill</b> made of alluvial sand at a Canadian underground mine over the course of more than three years is presented. The results show that the UCS values obtained by diagonal shear failure are generally higher than those obtained by axial split failure for samples with the same recipe and curing time. This highlights the importance of making a distinction between the UCS values obtained by the two different modes of failure. Their difference in failure mechanism is explained. Further investigations on the sources of the data dispersion tend to indicate that the UCS obtained by laboratory tests following the current practice may not be representative of the in-situ strength distribution in the underground stopes due to segregation in cemented <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill...</b>|$|R

By contrast, such technique has been widely used in the Polish coal mining industry for the purpose of subsidence control and for enabling thick seam extraction methods, with the most common method of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill</b> with sand (HBS) (Palarski 1989, 2004).

40|$|Returning waste {{material}} underground, as backfill, has been practiced {{for many years}} so as to improve the economical and environmental performance of underground mining operations. A specific type of backfill, {{which is used to}} fill mined areas that will not be exposed to further mining, is called <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill.</b> Cemented backfill has also been used to provide mechanical support for underground mining. Such backfill has allowed mining companies to extract more ore, while simultaneously improving working and environmental conditions. Cemented backfill, however, represents 50 to 85 percent of operating costs compared with the 5 to 10 percent that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill</b> consumes. The objective of this thesis is to investigate use of sodium silicate as a partial or total replacement for cement in stabilised backfill. Sodium silicate is a viscous material that is usually used to activate pozzolanic materials such as slag and fly ash. The chemical compound has many applications, namely, in waste treatment, cement and other construction materials. In order to determine the influence of sodium silicate on backfill performance, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out on samples with different binder compositions, such as: cement; slag and cement; slag, cement and sodium silicate; and slag and sodium silicate. Additionally, the effects of mixing time and addition order on the backfill samples' performance were studied. The subsequent thesis focuses mainly on the strength of paste and slurry backfill samples containing sodium silicate in addition to the observation of a number of experimental variables, which include: pulp density (relative amount of water), curing time, and binder dosage. In order to investigate the overall suitability of sodium silicate for use in stabilised backfill, other properties such as porosity, elastic modulus, and trends of water release are also studied. The results of the research endeavour demonstrate that sodium silicate-fortified backfill materials behave favourably compared with cemented backfills. Sodium silicate, thus, has potential as a backfill binder or additive...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, mine {{backfilling}} has progressively integrated into underground mining operations. The high stresses associated with mining at depth in the Canadian Shield, also requires innovative approaches to mine backfilling to withstand the loading both during and after mining operations. Not only new or modified minefill systems are required, but also new techniques are needed {{to increase the speed}} of the mining cycle for optimizing the mining operation. Three major purposes of mine backfill are known as (1) providing safe working condition, (2) maximizing ore recovery and (3) improving underground stability. Therefore, mine backfill has contributed greatly to the economics and environmental aspects of mining industry. In order to improve the mechanical behaviour of fill, cementitious materials are used. These cementitious materials are expensive. As a result the consumption of these cementitious materials has to be optimized and minimized {{in a way that the}} required strength is met. The objective of this research is to investigate a new type of backfill, which is known as gelfill. Gelfill binders usually consist of alkali activators such as sodium silicate and the other cementitious materials. Sodium silicate has been used in waste treatment and activation of artificial pozzolans such as blast furnace slag and fly ash. The work presented in this thesis is to evaluate the use of sodium silicate in gelfill. Consequently, the influence of mixing time, mixing sequence and curing time are studied on gelfill and silica sand <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill.</b> Various tests including unconfined and confined compressive strength were conducted in order to investigate the mechanical behaviour of samples. By conducting mercury intrusion porosimetery (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microstructure and mineralogical properties of specimens were studied. The result of this thesis demonstrates that gelfill compared with silica sand <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill</b> has better mechanical properties. In addition, other variables, including: mixing time and sequence, have a significant effect on gelfill...|$|R

40|$|Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} export {{industries}} in Australia. When the ore is removed from the ground voids are <b>backfilled.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>backfill</b> and paste fill are most common backfills. These backfills provide safe working conditions and increase the strength of the ground. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>backfills</b> consist of classified mine tailings with not more than 10 % by weight of size less than 10 μm and approximately 70 % by solid weight. These are prepared on the surface by dewatering the mine tailings and transported to the stope transported by gravity through boreholes and pipelines. The solid particles of hydraulic fills settle rapidly after entering the stopes. Excess water initially tends to pond on the surface building up from the lowest corners of a stope and then commences a vertical path of drainage due to gravity. Several miners and equipment had been trapped in mines due to barricade failures and the resulting in rush of mine fills into the drives. An extensive study of drainage and settlement characteristics of hydraulic fills is required to improve design of drainage and barricades. Most permeability measurements reported in the literature are from undisturbed or reconstituted samples in the laboratory under no surcharge. However, in the mine stopes the hydraulic fill is subjected to significant surcharge due to the overburden. In this research, extensive laboratory tests have been performed to measure permeability of hydraulic fill samples subjected to vertical stress. An analytical solution has been developed to estimate vertical stress development in a vertical and inclined mine stope using continuous compression arch of principal stresses. It has been verified with different analytical model discussed in literature. Degree of saturation of hydraulic fills within mine stopes decreases with continuous drainage of water through barricades. Laboratory tests have been performed to study the moisture content variation in a mine stope with depth and time. Soil-water characteristic curves have been developed using Filter Paper Method for hydraulic fills. Permeability of hydraulic fill has been computed using vertical stress and moisture content variation in a stope. It has been shown graphically. The anecdotal evidence suggests that the consolidation of the deslimed hydraulic fill is instantaneous. In this dissertation, laboratory tests have been conducted using conventional oedometer and modified triaxial cell to measure the settlement of hydraulic fills. It has been found that the immediate settlement and time dependent settlement contributes equally to the total settlement. Pore water pressure dissipation has observed using modified triaxial cell. Time of consolidation and coefficient of consolidation have been estimated and reported. Settlement- effective stress- time plot has been used to investigate the variation of coefficient of secondary compression (Cα) and it has been observed that Cα of hydraulic fill increases with effective stresses and is independent of time. Concept of equivalent permeability has been used to estimate drainage and maximum pore water pressure in a stope using method of fragments. Empirical equation has been proposed to estimate water level in stope at any time after filling. Reliability analysis has been carried out using First Order-Second Moment Analysis Method to measure the effect of parameter and modeling errors in drainage and settlement analysis. It has been verified using Monte Carlo Simulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} mine {{backfill}} {{shows that in}} the past, considerable improvements in backfill-reliant mining technology were made when new fill systems were introduced. The present trend in mine backfill technology is towards the use of high-density fill systems. Tight filling and void reduction have also become essential requirements in engineering design of mines to ensure global stability. High-density fills have a low moisture content and are more competent products requiring less binder and time for stabilization, compared to conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>backfill.</b> Cemented rockfill and tailings/sand paste fills are two familiar high-density backfill systems in current use. In future {{there could be a}} high demand for low porosity high-density fills, as mines go deeper and ground stresses increase. This study was an original attempt to investigate the characteristics and property of high-density composite fill systems. Composite fills are made up of derivatives of waste rock, tailings, sand and metallurgical by-products. Composite fills represent the future direction of backfill technology. As mines go deeper, the ore could be processed underground and the waste rock and tailings combined together to form a low-porosity competent fill product. The application of composite fill systems will also increase the material available for backfilling, provide more flexibility in backfill mix design and produce competent fill systems for ground support. It will also benefit the underground mine environment through effective utilization of mine wastes. The fundamental basis of the work required the study and understanding of the characteristics and properties of cemented rockfill and paste backfill. The effects of sand addition to fine tailings as a means of reducing porosity and improving the mechanical properties of the fill product were also investigated. Additionally, a new concept of backfill, namely, Composite-Aggregate Paste (CAP) that consists of a mixture of fine tailings and graded coarse aggregates was introduced and the material properties were investigated...|$|R

40|$|Fly ash is a {{lightweight}} coal combustion by-product (CCB) {{separated from the}} exhaust gases of power generating plants using suspension-fired furnaces in which pulverized coal is used as the fuel. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} make it useful in construction and industrial materials, especially in cement manufacturing, concrete, liquid waste stabilization, and <b>hydraulic</b> mine <b>backfill.</b> The addition of fly ash into aluminum alloys has the potential to reduce the cost and density of aluminum castings while improving other physical and mechanical properties of the resulting metal matrix composites (MMCs). This study investigated the effect of fly ash addition on the mechanical properties and microstructural behaviour of aluminum casting alloy A 535. The unreinforced A 535 alloy and its MMCs containing a mixture of 5 wt. % fly ash and 5 wt. % silicon carbide, 10 wt. % fly ash and 15 wt. % fly ash were investigated in the as-cast and solution heat treated conditions. Microhardness measurements, Charpy impact testing, tensile testing, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP/MS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) were used to evaluate these effects. The results of this study show that increasing the fly ash content of the melt increased the porosity of the castings, which ultimately affected the density, tensile and impact properties of the MMCs. The density, microhardness, tensile strength and Charpy impact energy of the composites decreased with increasing fly ash content. The decline in density of the MMCs was due to extensive porosity developed with fly ash addition. Depletion of solid solution strengthening magnesium in the matrix was the reason observed for the decline in hardness. The loss in Charpy impact energy and tensile properties of the MMCs are also attributed partly to the depletion of solid solution strengthening magnesium atoms from the matrix and partly to porosity. Microstructural studies revealed non-uniform distribution of reinforcement particles in the composites. The fly ash particles were found to congregate at the boundaries of a-aluminium dendrites in the castings. Mg content of A 535 alloy decreased with increasing weight fraction of fly ash. Mg was found to be tied up in a complex network of Mg 2 Si thereby reducing its availability in the matrix for solid solution strengthening...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} soil–bentonite slurry trench cut-off walls is {{highly dependent on}} the hydraulic conductivity of the soil–bentonite backfill, which according to laboratory tests can decrease significantly as consolidation pressure increases due to corresponding reductions in void ratio. Consequently a reliable estimate of the <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity of <b>backfill</b> in the field requires proper calculation of effective stresses. A model is proposed to predict the steady-state horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the backfill after consolidation. The arching effect is considered by way of force equilibrium, and the lateral squeezing effect of inward displacement of the trench side walls is considered by assuming the cut-off wall is surrounded by soil, which is represented by a Winkler idealisation. The proposed model is applied to consider a soil–bentonite slurry trench cut-off wall in New South Wales, Australia, and the predicted stress profile is in good agreement with that calculated from cone penetration test data. Compared to those predicted by geostatics and other alternative models, the proposed method offers a significant improvement in the prediction of stress in soil–bentonite slurry trench walls. The obtained stresses are then used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in the backfill. It is found that the hydraulic conductivity is relatively high in the shallow region owing to the low state of effective stresses, which requires consideration in cut-off wall design, and decreases slightly with the depth in the deeper region. Finally a parametric study identifies the side wall friction and the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction of surrounding soil as having the most {{significant impact on the}} estimated stresses...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} master {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} the spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge over and behind {{the crest of a}} coastal defence structure. The influence of the most relevant parameters on this process is explored. This research has been performed by means of a physical model. The following relevant parameters were varied during the experiments to consider their influence on the spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge: wave height, wave steepness, water depth, crest height and wave spectrum. Four different types of wave overtopping discharges were measured in this research: total wave overtopping discharge, wave overtopping discharge directly behind the crest, wave overtopping discharge over impermeable backfill and wave overtopping discharge over permeable backfill. Based on the equality of the comparison between the experiment results and existing theoretical methods to calculate the total wave overtopping; further experiment results are considered as acceptable and reliable and can be used to derive the relation for the spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge. The total overtopping discharge flows over the crest of the breakwater and is divided in two components: the infiltrated discharge into the crest and the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest. A method to describe this distribution is defined. This method includes the influence of the wave height, wave length and crest height. The spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge behind the crest depends on the permeability of the backfill. For an impermeable backfill with a slope of 3 % towards the breakwater, the overtopping discharge at every point behind the breakwater is divided in two parts: one part flows back over the impermeable backfill under the influence of gravity and the other part passes the point and travels further away from the breakwater. The final relation between the reduction factor (ratio between the overtopping discharge at a certain distance behind the crest and the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest) and the distance behind the crest was found to depend on a dimensionless presentation of the wave energy flux. For a permeable backfill, the overtopping discharge at every point behind the breakwater is divided in two parts: one part infiltrates into the backfill and the other part passes the point and travels further away from the breakwater. The influence of the wave energy flux on the relation between the reduction factor and the distance behind the crest was found to be smaller than for an impermeable <b>backfill.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Soil-bentonite (SB) slurry {{walls are}} one of the most popular {{techniques}} for minimizing the horizontal migration of contaminants. Backfill arching, or “hang-up” of the backfilled slurry, on the wall trench has the potential to significantly reduce the effectiveness of these barriers. This research was conducted to supplement the design and installation of an 11, 000 m long slurry wall at PotashCorp’s mine in Rocanville, Saskatchewan. The slurry wall is being installed through low permeability glacial till containing permeable granular zones. This study was undertaken to improve the understanding of vertical stress distribution in these deep barriers. In particular, the objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the factors controlling arching and hydraulic conductivity (k) of SB walls. Slurry wall “hang-up” or arching is dependent on shear along the wall of the trench and on a coefficient of lateral earth pressure (K). Consolidated drained (CD) shear box tests were conducted to study the shear strength parameters of the backfill mixes. Six inch proctor mold was modified with load cells on the side walls to measure horizontal stresses along with consolidation. This was used to calculate coefficient of lateral earth pressure, K (which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical effective stress). The results of the laboratory testing program found that K was relatively independent of the percentage of fines present in the SB mix. It also showed that backfill angle of internal friction and k of the backfill decreased with increased fines content. The results of the laboratory testing program were used to model the vertical stress distribution in deep walls. An analytical model (discrete model) and a coupled seepage stress-strain finite element model (FEM) were used to predict vertical stress changes with time and depth for the different backfill materials. The primary conclusion of this research is that slurry wall backfill arching or “hang-up” significantly delays the magnitude and timing of vertical stress build-up in backfill. This loss of vertical stress results in backfill with lower density and higher hydraulic conductivity. The situation was found to be most critical for deep narrow slurry walls. Any advantage in using a coarser graded backfill was offset by higher <b>backfill</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity. The net result is that the upper portions of slurry walls may not be able to achieve their hydraulic conductivity objectives as soon as expected, if at all. In addition, the backfill in the upper portion of the trench may be susceptible to chemical attack and osmotic consolidation. Construction of a 2 m high surcharge berm over the slurry wall was found to increase vertical effective stress and result in significantly lower (2 to 8 times) hydraulic conductivity values in the top 5 metres of the trench. The final hydraulic conductivity (k) at a depth of 5 m was approximately 75 % lower with a surcharge berm. Thus, construction of a surcharge berm over the slurry wall helps to satisfy the k requirement for SB walls and lowers the risk of osmotic consolidation...|$|R
