2500|$|The {{mystery of}} Jandek's {{identity}} was partially resolved in October 2004 when he performed {{live at the}} <b>Instal</b> 04 music festival in Glasgow, Scotland. This was Jandek's first known live appearance and he performed with Richard Youngs (bass) and Alex Neilson (drums). The man on stage was obviously {{the same man who}} appears on the album covers. Per Corwood's stipulations, the performance was not publicized in advance, nor was it identified as it happened or at any point afterwards. This performance, and all the subsequent performances up to the All Tomorrow's Parties one, seem to have been initiated and organised by Barry Esson, whose company Arika stages music festivals in Scotland, including <b>INSTAL</b> and Music Lovers' Field Companion. David Tibet of Current 93, who had headlined the festival the previous day, advised fans not only that none of the other artists knew of the performance but also that the word [...] "Jandek" [...] was never used, the man who performed alongside Youngs and Neilson being identified only as [...] "a representative of Corwood Industries" [...] (the full text of Tibet's messages to the Jandek mailing list can be read at Seth Tisue's website, linked below).|$|E

2500|$|In May 2005, however, Jandek made {{appearances}} at the Music Lovers’ Field Companion festival in Gateshead, England, {{and at the}} Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow, Scotland, again with Youngs and Neilson. The Gateshead performance was another guitar/bass/drums trio similar to the performance as <b>Instal</b> '04 while the Glasgow show found Jandek playing piano with Youngs on bowed contrabass and Neilson on percussion. It later transpired that, as rumored at the time, this performance was a single song in many parts titled [...] "The Cell". It lasted around 90 minutes and {{has been described as}} lacking the dissonance often associated with Jandek, instead being gentle and melodic with many of the piano parts resembling Erik Satie. These first shows have since been released as Glasgow Sunday, Newcastle Sunday, and Glasgow Monday.|$|E

25|$|The {{developmental}} {{stages of}} C. megacephala include egg, larva and pupa. A female fly may lay {{as many as}} 200 to 300 eggs, often in human feces, meat or fish. Larval stages include first, second and third <b>instals</b> or growth periods. The eggs take approximately one day to develop, while the larvae take 5.4 days and the pupae 5.3 days. Population numbers as well as body size are greatly influenced by temperature. The adult lifespan of the fly is approximately seven days. The development of C. megacephala {{is linked to the}} length of time spent feeding in the larval stage, as well as to temperature; the lower the temperature, the more slowly the larvae develop. In laboratory studies conducted at 27°C., eggs hatch in 18 hours; the first molt occurs in 30 hours; the second molt in 72 hours; pupation after 144 hours; and the adult emerges after approximately 234 hours. These intervals vary depending on geographical location; other environmental factors also can determine how long flies will stay in the larval stage. Males tend to emerge two or three hours ahead of the females.|$|R
