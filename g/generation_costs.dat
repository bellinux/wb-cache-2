5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical <b>generation</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

Starting around the same time hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling became more widely used since they made shale energy reserves more accessible. The industry pushed to drill more natural gas in more places, because they believed that they had the technology, expertise, and need as well as the fact that tremendous energy and profit could be made from more sites.

In this process, under a line outage the <b>generation</b> <b>cost</b> {{is to be}} minimised {{and to keep the}} power flow in their security limits, in addition to that the losses is to be minimised after installing the FACTS device. A versatile FACTS device Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is considered as a combination of SVC and TCSC. The operating limit of the FACTS device is defined not only to minimize the total <b>generation</b> <b>cost</b> but also to reduce transmission loss.

2500|$|The {{electricity}} {{retail market}} was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition {{was expected to}} result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year. In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation. [...] In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while <b>generation</b> <b>costs</b> had in fact fallen 35% by 2012. These price increases and large subsidies have led to South Australia paying the highest retail price for electricity in the world.|$|E
