60|$|He {{tossed his}} {{straight}} <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his flashing eyes, and scarcely interrupted to roll a long, brown, Mexican cigarette.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him wonderingly, and putting his <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his face, and kissing him, asked what he meant.|$|E
6000|$|When {{this had}} been done, he kissed his father twice, {{smoothed}} the <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the pale, damp forehead, and whispered,-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have much}} to say, and I will go on. You are a rich man, and I am your son-in-law." [...] Mr. Wharton put his left hand up to his forehead, {{brushing}} the few <b>hairs</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his head, but he said nothing. [...] "Had I received from you during the last most vital year that assistance which I think I {{had a right to}} expect, I also might have been a rich man now. It is no good going back to that." [...] Then he paused, but still Mr. Wharton said nothing. [...] "Now you know what has come to me and to your daughter. We are to be expatriated." ...|$|R
60|$|It had all {{happened}} so suddenly that no one--least of all Licinia--could guess {{what it was}} that had so angered my lady. Dea Flavia had raised herself to a sitting posture, and thrown her <b>hair</b> <b>back,</b> away <b>from</b> her face which looked flushed and wrathful, whilst two sharp furrows appeared between her brows.|$|R
60|$|She {{gripped his}} fingers tight, and laughed shakily. Then {{she dropped her}} hand. He put the <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her brows, {{stroking}} her temples, kissing them lightly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Yes. Tell me," [...] she replied, {{lifting his}} dusty {{head on her}} knee. Her hands trembled as she brushed his wet <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his clammy brow.|$|E
60|$|She drew {{away and}} {{smoothed}} her ruffled <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her forehead, looking ruefully {{in the glass}} at her tear-stained cheeks, and down at the crushed violets in her corsage.|$|E
60|$|A {{young man}} with a lithe figure and smooth black <b>hair</b> brushed {{straight}} <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his forehead had paused at the table {{on his way to the}} cashier's desk.|$|R
5000|$|... wears a houppelande of {{dark blue}} figured fabric {{with a narrow}} belt. Her <b>hair</b> is shaved <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her forehead, and she wears a blunt pointed cap (now over-restored), France or Flanders, c. 1410.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{said the}} Actor, {{as he put}} out his arm with that splendid gesture that we have known and admired for years, {{at the same time}} {{throwing}} back his leonine head so that his leonine <b>hair</b> fell <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his leonine forehead. [...] "Not at all. I do better in both of them. My genius demands both tragedy and comedy at the same time." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the very}} {{midst of this}} awed silence the woman {{suddenly}} threw back her head, brushed the <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her face, and looked straight {{into the eyes of}} the Duke.|$|E
60|$|The {{bearer of}} the torch shook his long loose <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his eyes, and {{thrusting}} his face eagerly into {{that of the}} locksmith, fixed upon him a look which told his history at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh' I don't know," [...] she answered, wearily {{brushing}} her <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her eyes. [...] "It seemed best when I did it-and it can't be helped now." [...] There was infinite, dull despair and resignation in her voice.|$|E
60|$|Van Teyl, as he hastened {{forward to}} meet his friend, {{presented}} at first sight a very good type of the well-groomed, athletic young American. He was over six feet tall, with smooth, dark <b>hair</b> brushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his forehead, a strong, clean-shaven face and good features. Only, as he drew nearer, there was evident a slight, unnatural quivering {{at the corner of}} his lips. The cordiality of his greeting, too, was a little overdone.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Barbecue-Smith {{belonged to}} the old school of journalists. He sported a leonine head with a greyish-black mane of oddly unappetising <b>hair</b> brushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a broad but low forehead. And somehow he always seemed slightly, ever so slightly, soiled. In younger days he had gaily called himself a Bohemian. He did so no longer. He was a teacher now, a kind of prophet. Some of his books of comfort and spiritual {{teaching}} were in their hundred and twentieth thousand.|$|R
60|$|Domiloff stood leaning {{with his}} back against the long deal table. Gathered {{together}} before him were a dozen men or more in the undress uniform of the Moranian Guards. Dartnoff, his white <b>hair</b> brushed straight <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his forehead, a tall, soldierly figure notwithstanding his sixty years, stepped a little forward.|$|R
60|$|She rose, and, {{with a shrug}} of the {{shoulders}} and a quick, graceful movement, shook out her skirts, and pushed the <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her face. Then {{she held out her}} hand, and Paul found himself compelled, against his will, to stand by her side.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, Lillo?" [...] said Romola, {{pulling his}} <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his brow. Lillo was a {{handsome}} lad, but his features were {{turning out to be}} more massive and less regular than his father's. The blood of the Tuscan peasant was in his veins.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{pushed the}} long <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his {{forehead}} (he didn't recognize me at first). Then he said: [...] "You ought to know. You foretold it, Old Thing. I'm shoeing horses for hire. I'm not even Weland now," [...] he said. [...] "They call me Wayland-Smith."' ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Nigel had to {{tell their}} rank, ere the porters {{admitted}} the small company: but the seneschal marshalled them forward in full state. And James never looked more the king than when, in simple crimson robe, the pure white cross on his breast, his auburn <b>hair</b> parted <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his noble brow, he stood towering above all heads, passively receiving the Duke of Burgundy's elaborate courtesies and greetings, nor seeming to note the lavish display of gold and silver, meant to amaze the poorest king in Europe.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} {{appeared in}} the dock. He had become paler, and perhaps thinner, for his square determined jaw, and the resolute mould of his lips, were more than usually remarkable, and were noted in the physiognomical brain of Harvey Anderson; {{as well as the}} keen light of his full dark hazel eye, the breadth of his brow, with his shining light brown <b>hair</b> brushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> it; the strong build of his frame, and the determined force, apparent even in the perfect quiescence of his attitude.|$|R
60|$|Her picture lies {{before me}} as I write,--a pretty child {{standing}} in a chair, with a basket of toys {{on the table before}} her; curly <b>hair</b> pushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the face, pensive eyes, and a pair of stout little feet crossed one over the other as if glad to rest. I wish I could put the photograph into the story, because the small heroine is an interesting one, and still lives with the good aunt, who is very fond and proud of her, and writes pleasant accounts of her progress to the friends in America.|$|R
60|$|The child, a {{handsome}} little fellow of some sixteen months, toddled across to his mother, waving {{his hands as}} he went, and laughing, while his large hazel eyes glowed with pleasure. His mother caught him, pushed the silken brown <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his forehead, and laid his cheek against hers.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} wavy <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her forehead--her eyes were bright, {{and there was}} a deep flush of colour in her cheeks. But the man was not to be deceived. He knew that these things were not for him. It was the {{accomplice}} she welcomed and not the man.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no use {{in saying}} I'm obliged {{to both of}} you, because you know it well," [...] I made shift to answer; and Sally Steel stroked the <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> my {{forehead}} in sisterly fashion as she smiled at Thorn. [...] "But what about the stock? Did they all get through?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} up on her couch and {{watching}} his approach. A woman? Surely only a child, with pale cheeks, large, anxious eyes, and masses of brown <b>hair</b> brushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her forehead. After all, was he indeed a strong man, vowed to great things? There was a queer feeling in his throat, almost a mist before his eyes. She seemed so fragile, so utterly, sweetly pathetic. And all the time there was the strange light, or was it want of light, in those haunting eyes. His speech of greeting was never spoken.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Paramor's eyebrows, which jutted {{from his}} clean, brown face like little clumps of pothooks, were iron-grey, and iron-grey his <b>hair</b> brushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his high forehead. Mrs. Pendyce {{wondered}} why he looked five years younger than Horace, who was his junior, and ten years younger than Charles, who, of course, was younger still. His eyes, which from iron-grey some inner process of spiritual manufacture had made into steel colour, looked young too, although they were grave; and the smile which twisted up {{the corners of his}} mouth looked very young.|$|R
40|$|Gate Boy's Mother" An {{older woman}} {{standing}} outside a house, surrounded by some trees and many varieties of baskets. She {{is dressed in}} tradition Chinese clothing, her <b>hair</b> is pulled <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her face, and she wears no shoes. In her hands is a leafy vegetable that she is working with a knife.; see also record 9106, "Gate boy...|$|R
60|$|The Rube {{tossed a}} long, damp welt of <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his big brow and nervously toed the rubber. I {{noted that he}} seemed to forget the runners on bases and {{delivered}} the ball without glancing at either bag. Of course this resulted in a double steal. The ball went wild--almost a wild pitch.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Call him!' echoed Barnaby, sitting upright {{upon the}} floor, and staring vacantly at Gabriel, as he thrust his <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his face. 'But {{who can make}} him come! He calls me, and makes me go where he will. He goes on before, and I follow. He's the master, and I'm the man. Is that the truth, Grip?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} mean that?" [...] She roughly dashed {{the tears from}} her eyes, and rose as she put the question. Holding him with one hand, she parted the <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his {{forehead}} with the other. [...] "I must see your whole face," [...] she said--"your face will tell me. Yes: you do mean it. The world hasn't spoilt you, yet. Do you believe in dreams?" ...|$|E
50|$|This Portrait of a Lady by Rogier van der Weyden {{shows the}} <b>hair</b> pulled {{smoothly}} <b>back</b> <b>from</b> {{her face and}} confined in a caul or early hennin beneath a sheer veil. The gown has a wide V-neckline that shows the dark kirtle beneath and is worn with a wide red belt and a sheer partlet at the neck, Netherlands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{sitting at}} the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in the world as easy as lifting a finger. There's a way of doing it. She knew. I saw her working it. She was healthy-looking and plain dressed. She had her <b>hair</b> drawn <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her {{forehead}} and face--no curls or frizzes; that's the way she looked. Now I'll tell you the way they work the game; it's simple. When she wants a man, she manages it so that every time he looks at her he finds her looking at him. That's all.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose and}} looked out of the window, and, as she gazed upon the crowd which swept {{up and down the}} {{beautiful}} avenue, she could not but smile as she thought that she, a plain New England countrywoman, with her gray <b>hair</b> brushed <b>back</b> <b>from</b> her brows, with hands a little hardened and roughened with many a year of household duties, which had been to her as much a pleasure as a labor, was in all probability richer than {{most of the people who}} sat in the fine carriages or strolled in their fashionable clothes along the sidewalk.|$|R
