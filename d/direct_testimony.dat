5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided <b>direct</b> <b>testimony</b> to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E

According to Woodward, then–Director of the CIA William J. Casey admitted to him in February 1987 that he was aware of the diversion of funds to the contras. The controversial admission occurred while Casey was hospitalized for a stroke, and, according to his wife, was unable to communicate. On May 6, 1987, William Casey died the day after Congress began its public hearings on Iran–Contra. Independent Counsel, Lawrence Walsh later wrote: [...] "Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion.

[...] Gust Avrakodos, who was responsible for the arms supplies to the Afghans at this time, was aware of the operation as well and strongly opposed it, in particular the diversion of funds allotted to the Afghan operation.

[...] The contemporary Gaulish terms for “sea” and “dead” appear to have been mori and *maruo-; compare their well-attested modern Insular Celtic cognates muir and marbh (Irish), môr and marw (Welsh), and mor and marv (Breton). The same word for “sea” is also known from Germanic, but with an a (*mari-), whereas a cognate of marbh is unknown in all dialects of Germanic. Yet, given that Pliny had not heard the word directly from a Cimbric informant, it cannot be ruled out that the word is in fact Gaulish instead.|$|R
2500|$|The edifice, or the [...] "small house" [...] is a rectangular, {{elongated}} cube {{that lies}} directly {{on top of}} the pyramidal stone steps, and is six and a half feet (2m) in width, six and a half feet (2m) in height, and 10ft (3m) in length.

It was inside this chamber where the bed and coffin of Cyrus the Great would have been situated. The edifice has a pediment roof possessing the same length and width dimensions as the edifice itself. Around the tomb were a series of columns, the original structure which they supported is no longer present.

2500|$|According to most rabbis, {{reasonable}} {{circumstantial evidence}} {{is sufficient to}} prove {{the death of the}} husband, and no <b>direct</b> <b>testimony</b> is required. This is based, among other things, on the talmudic assertion: [...] "The Rabbis taught: 'If he fell into a lion's den, [...] testify , if he fell into a ditch of snakes and scorpions - [...] no [...] to testify '" [...] (Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 121a). In other words, if it is known that the man fell into a ditch of snakes and scorpions and did not come out, it can be assumed that he is dead, and {{there is no need for}} further evidence (unlike falling into a lion's den where there is still a slight chance of survival). If, however, it is later discovered that the husband is not dead, the woman will find herself in particularly bad circumstances: her children from her second marriage will be considered mamzerim (bastards), and she will be forced to divorce both her first and second husbands, subject to the halakhic ruling that an adulterous woman [...] "is forbidden to her husband and the man with whom she fornicated". While such situations are extremely rare under normal circumstances, they did occur in the aftermath of the Holocaust and also occurred frequently in the wake of pogroms and other forms of persecution.|$|E

40|$|Although {{recent studies}} have shown that John of Biclarum built his Chronicle {{following}} a precise plan and at the service of a specific political discourse, as far as the treatment of his sources is concerned scholars maintain a certain inertia which tends to make of him a sort of well-intentioned witness, whose information would have mostly come from his own experience and <b>direct</b> <b>testimonies.</b> However, it is possible to maintain not only that John of Biclarum used in a sophisticated way materials produced by Byzantine historians, but also that he could rely on Gregory of Tours’s Decem Libri Historiarum so as to propose an alternative reading of Hermenegild’s rebellion meant to sustain the legitimacy of the catholic monarchy and of the royal lineage. Finally, a coherent analysis of John’s political discourse and practice also permits to suggest that the chronological frame of the Chronicle’s composition and publication should be extended, possibly including Sisebut’s reign. </p...|$|R

IUFM contribution to the SEDEC project is essentially built on a reflexion on educational implications of the links between science and European citizenship. We are convinced that European citizenship may be developed in scientific activities in school, by the introduction of communication moments, where pupils have to express and defend their ideas, and also to understand and accept the others’ ones. We have implemented two activities using the results of the SEDEC survey on science perception, that make the pupils get a better view on scientific research, especially in the knowledge of two scientific “jobs”, astronomer and botanist. Our approach consists of allowing the children express their conceptions of these jobs, of organising a debate to clarify these ideas, and of confronting them with other pupils’ opinions in Europe, with the history of the involved science and with <b>direct</b> <b>testimonies</b> of scientists. The project should be pursued in allowing classes in Europe to communicate about a scientific problem and so, to live their European citizenship...|$|R

It processes <b>direct</b> <b>testimonies</b> about sailors' life and work on Czechoslovak ships; there are included topics as travelling, emigration, direct experience with communist regime on ships, private life of sailors, and their father and husband role.
