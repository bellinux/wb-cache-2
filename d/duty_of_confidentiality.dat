25|$|An {{especially}} thorny issue {{concerned the}} interpretation of the secrecy which the CIA had previously enjoyed. According to its agents, the CIA's mandate included not only access to state secrets, but also the commission of clandestine acts in furtherance of USG policy, as ordered from time to time by the President. Consequently, the CIA had a primary duty to protect such secrets and to refrain from public discussion of any covert activity. An area of conflict arose when this CIA <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> to the President came into direct conflict with the Agency's duty to respond honestly to legislative investigations of the executive branch authorized by the Constitution. Up until then, such potential conflict had been negotiated by quiet understandings between Congress and the CIA.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to {{determine}} which set of private law rules ought {{to apply to the}} use and storage of bodily material. I recommend that the most appropriate legal approach is through a combination of property rights and <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> The suggestion is that where a healthcare institution obtains possession of bodily material, their possession of the material may give rise to property rights in the material. In addition, where an individual retains entitlements in bodily material that is held by a healthcare institution, the entitlements of the individual ought to be protected through the imposition <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> on the healthcare institution that are akin to <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> This recommendation is the product of two main inquires. The first inquiry concerns which entitlements individuals and institutions {{ought to be able to}} exercise in separated bodily material. This involves an investigation into which aspects of the relationship between a person and their body can also be found in the relationship between a person and their separated bodily material. It also involves an assessment as to which societal interests can be served through allocating entitlements in bodily material to healthcare institutions, and how to resolve the conflict between individual and societal interests in the use and storage of bodily material. The second main inquiry concerns the way in which different branches of private law are able to protect entitlements in things. I identify that property rights, rights of bodily integrity and privacy are similar insofar as they protect entitlements through the exclusion of others. Property rights are nonetheless distinct as property law concerns rights than can exist independently of the rights-holder. The recommended approach follows from connecting the different entitlements in bodily material that ought to obtain legal protection with different ways an entitlement may be afforded legal protection.

As state bar rules and legal cultures and sub-cultures de-emphasize or remove the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> zealousness, zealousness becomes increasingly counter-cultural. The article explores those trends, and shows (drawing on existing criminal defense ethical literature) why zealousness is justified in the adversarial and consequential immigration context. The {{article examines}} why a broadly understood and well-elaborated standard of zealous advocacy for immigration lawyers would be useful, and shows how it would affect important decisions that are made by immigration lawyers throughout the course of litigation. The article also exposes the untenable dilemmas pitting <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> against <b>duties</b> to the court, and frames the ways in which zealousness needs to guide decision-making when those dilemmas arise...|$|R

40|$|Many lawyers {{believe that}} ethical <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and zealousness {{require them to}} assert attorney-client {{privilege}} as aggressively as they assert a criminal defendant’s lack of guilt. They treat client information {{as if it is}} “privileged until proven unprivileged,” even though it is the claimant of privilege that has the evidentiary burden of showing that all the legal elements of privilege are met. Ordinarily, the adversary system works well to expose and control frivolous claims, but challenges to frivolous claims of privilege face unique obstacles. Challengers must operate “in the dark,” without the detailed knowledge of the communication needed to determine whether it really is privileged and whether its strategic value justifies the expense of opposition. This has made it easy and advantageous for lawyers to make frivolous claims of attorney-client privilege, despite the threat of court-imposed sanctions. Such abusive claims of privilege decrease the quality of justice by preventing consideration of relevant evidence and increase the cost of litigation by forcing expensive collateral litigation around privilege claims. The strategic advantage of frivolous claims of privilege combined with the inadequacy of the adversary system to discover and sanction such claims suggests that the rules of ethics could serve as a counter-balance. Yet, our existing ethical rules actually seem to encourage lawyers to make frivolous, “knee-jerk” claims of privilege by emphasizing the ethical <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and zealous representation. Against this, I argue that a limit to claims of attorney-client privilege should be understood as implicit in the existing Model Rules of Attorney-Client Privilege and that explicit ethical limits of the kind proposed in the article will not undermine confidentiality. However, an effective ethical limit requires that useful guidance about what constitutes a frivolous claim of privilege can be provided. I condense an analysis of cases in which lawyers have been either legally sanctioned or ethically disciplined for making such claims into a proposed added Comment to Model Rule 3. 1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{maintenance}} of full and frank disclosure between lawyers {{and their clients}} is the main justification for the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> The basis for this rationale is utilitarianism, in that it works to promote the work of solicitors, who are officers of the court. It allows clients to freely discuss intimate details without fear that such information could be subsequently disclosed to the general public.

40|$|Because of its {{perceived}} ability to predict future health and its relevance for family members, genetic information challenges the traditional justifications for medical confidentiality. This thesis examines {{the question whether}} a health care professional should have the discretion or a duty to breach confidentiality in order to inform a patient's relatives of their increased genetic risk. There is currently no exception to the statutory, common law and ethical <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> for the non-consensual disclosure of genetic information to relatives. Precedents developed {{in the context of}} threats of harm and communicable diseases are of limited value. The law should not recognise the existence <b>of</b> a <b>duty</b> to warn in the context of genetics. As a last resort, health care professionals should be authorized, but not required, to disclose genetic risk information when there is a serious risk of preventable harm and when the potential harm of non-disclosure outweighs that of disclosure...|$|R

40|$|Under Quebec law, {{the members}} of thirty-nine {{regulated}} professions are bound by statute to professional secrecy. This obligation is reinforced by section 9 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It protects patients and clients against the extrajudicial disclosure of confidential information but it also operates as an evidentiary privilege which the courts must enforce ex officio in all proceedings of a non-criminal nature. According to the authors, this statutory equation <b>of</b> professional <b>confidentiality</b> with privilege necessarily leads to the overgrowth of privilege or to the atrophy <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> The rule interferes excessively with the administration of civil justice and compels the courts to adopt result-oriented interpretations detrimental to the coherence of the law. The article first describes {{the relationship between the}} applicable legislation and the several codes of professional ethics defining the scope of professional secret. A second part explores the possible justifications for legal <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and evidentiary privileges ; most of these rationales are compatibles with a distinction between in-court and out-of-court requirements of secrecy. The authors then review in a third part various cases in which Quebec courts have dealt with objections based on professional secret. Three conflicting interpretations were adopted in these cases. All three interpretations restrict the scope of professional privilege, sometimes at the expense of legitimate claims for out-of-court confidentiality. It therefore appears desirable to re-establish in the legislation a distinction between the judicial and extrajudicial aspects of professional secret. The conclusion contains suggestions for a reform of the law of professional secret in Quebec...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. {{criminal}} justice system is built {{on the concept of}} an adversarial trial. The defense and prosecution present competing narratives to a neutral audience that judges whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In this context, defense counsel {{is expected to be a}} zealous advocate for the defendant, providing the most effective representation possible in light of the evidence presented by the government. However, there are occasions outside of trial where defense counsel’s traditional role changes and she is asked to disclose, not to the jury, but to the court, personal opinions and knowledge about her client and the attorney-client relationship. This Note argues that during these occasions, defense counsel becomes a “quasi witness. ” Even though she is not presenting testimony at trial, she is still providing information about her client to the judge. Indeed, the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and loyalty that defense counsel owes her client are pitted against those she owes the court, spawning a serious ethical dilemma. This Note examines this dilemma and the potential damage that it can cause to the attorney-client relationship. Ultimately, this Note proposes several mechanisms for limiting the disclosures needed from defense counsel but argues that now that the category of quasi witness has been identified, a more profound debate within the profession is warranted...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and unresolved quandaries of First Amendment jurisprudence involves when civil liability for speech will trigger First Amendment protections. When speech results in civil liability, two starkly opposing rules are potentially applicable. Since New York Times v. Sullivan, the First Amendment requires heightened protection against tort liability for speech, such as defamation and invasion of privacy. But in other contexts involving civil liability for speech, the First Amendment provides virtually no protection. According to Cohen v. Cowles, there is no First Amendment scrutiny for speech restricted by promissory estoppel and contract. The First Amendment rarely requires scrutiny when property rules limit speech. Both of these rules are widely-accepted. However, there is a major problem - in a large range of situations, the rules collide. Tort, contract, and property law overlap significantly, so formalistic distinctions between areas of law will not adequately resolve when the First Amendment should apply to civil liability. Surprisingly, few scholars and jurists have recognized or grappled with this problem. The conflict between the two rules is vividly illustrated by the law <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> People routinely assume express or implied duties not to disclose another 2 ̆ 7 s personal information. Does the First Amendment apply to these <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality?</b> Should it? More generally, in cases where speech results in civil liability, which rule should apply, and when? The law currently fails to provide a coherent test and rationale for when the Sullivan or Cohen rule should govern. In this article, Professors Daniel J. Solove and Neil M. Richards contend that the existing doctrine and theories are inadequate to resolve this conflict. They propose a new theory, one that focuses {{on the nature of the}} government power involved...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{data science}} allow for {{sophisticated}} analysis of increasingly large data sets. In the medical context, {{large volumes of}} data collected for health care purposes are contained in electronic health records. The real-life character and sheer amount of data contained in them makes electronic health records an attractive resource for public health and biomedical research. However, medical records contain sensitive information that could be misused by third parties. Medical confidentiality and respect for patients’ privacy and autonomy protects patient data, barring access to health records unless consent is given by the data subject. This creates {{a situation in which}} much beneficial records-based research is prevented or seriously undermined, because the refusal of consent by some patients introduces a systematic deviation, known as selection bias, from a representative sample of the general population, thus distorting research findings. Although research exemptions for the requirement of informed consent exists, they are rarely used in practice due to concerns over liability and a general culture of caution. In this paper, we argue that the problem of research access to sensitive data can be understood as a tension between the medical <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and beneficence. We attempt to show that the requirement of informed consent is not appropriate for all kinds of records-based research by distinguishing studies involving minimal risk from those that feature moderate or greater risks. We argue that the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> easy rescue – the principle that persons should benefit others when this can be done at no or minimal risk to themselves – grounds the removal of consent requirements for minimally risky records-based research. Drawing on this discussion, we propose a risk-adapted framework for the facilitation of ethical uses of health data for the benefit of society...|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{demonstrates}} that the theory underlying ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1. 13 (c), granting lawyers the option to reveal certain client confidences on a discretionary basis, doesn’t work. Despite some compelling reasons for permitting disclosure of clients’ “bad” behavior, economics dictate {{that it should be}} a rare case in which a lawyer will actually disclose. The Essay utilizes the facts of a recent case involving in-house certified public accountants who revealed to state tax authorities that their employer had not been compliant with state tax laws, and were fired from their jobs. In thinking about whether similarly situated attorneys could be fired or would violate their professional ethical duties if they engaged in the same acts, the Essay reviews and reflects upon the existing commentary on organizational/corporate lawyers’ <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and the Model Rules’ up-the-ladder reporting requirements. The conclusion: Even if the Rules permit disclosure in some circumstances, the real possibilities of being fired or tagged as a lawyer who can’t be trusted with a secret are simply too great for even well-intentioned lawyers. The rule, then, is unlikely to encourage lawyers to disclose. The argument is made through a brief Essay rather than a longer analytical piece for two reasons. First, there exists ample and excellent literature filled with good and comprehensive analyses of the rules. What is lacking is an examination of how theory plays out in the real world. Second, the Essay is meant to provoke thought both among scholars, who function primarily in the realm of theory, and practitioners, who reside in the world of practice...|$|R
