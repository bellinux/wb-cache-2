5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

25|$|Membrane {{distillation}} {{is a type}} of distillation {{in which}} vapors of a mixture to be separated are passed through a membrane, which selectively permeates one component of mixture.

25|$|Three main {{driving forces}} used in {{different}} version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential (Skaar, 1988; Keey et al., 2000). These are discussed here, including capillary action, {{which is a}} mechanism for free water transport in permeable softwoods. Total pressure difference <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force during wood vacuum drying.|$|E

25|$|The protons {{from the}} {{oxidized}} water molecules are {{released into the}} thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force for ATP synthesis via photophosphorylation and coupling the absorption of light energy and photolysis of water {{to the creation of}} chemical energy during photosynthesis. The O2 remaining after oxidation of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.|$|E

When {{it comes}} to B licence, the student goes through three steps, city road (for example driving in a soft manner), highway (making sure the student accelerates fast and yet driving safely for the {{environment}} and traffic safety), housing estate (making sure the student is observant of people and pets that may move through these areas). The student {{must be able to}} handle traffic and know the traffic rules.|$|E
25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} is an electrochemical {{process whereby}} one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact {{with each other}} in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower galvanic number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|Joseph W. Houppert {{acknowledges}} that {{some critics have}} tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force in the play and is therefore the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his personal relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.|$|E
25|$|Motivation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> {{force of}} desire behind all {{deliberate}} actions of humans. Motivation {{is based on}} emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative {{is defined by the}} individual brain state, which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury or violence because their brain is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance and the libido are seen to be primary motivators. Within economics, motivation is often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions generally posit divine or demonic influences.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E

500|$|Another {{effect of}} the mission was the {{promotion}} of the cult of Pope Gregory the Great by the Northumbrians amongst others; the first Life of Gregory is from Whitby Abbey in Northumbria. Gregory was not popular in Rome, and it was not until Bede's Ecclesiastical History began to circulate that Gregory's cult also took root there. Gregory, in Bede's work, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> force behind the Gregorian mission, and Augustine and the other missionaries are portrayed as depending on him for advice and help in their endeavours. [...] Bede also gives {{a leading role in the}} conversion of Northumbria to Gregorian missionaries, especially in his Chronica Maiora, in which no mention is made of any Irish missionaries. By putting Gregory at the centre of the mission, even though he did not take part in it, Bede helped to spread the cult of Gregory, who not only became one of the major saints in Anglo-Saxon England, but continued to overshadow Augustine even in the afterlife; an Anglo-Saxon church council of 747 ordered that Augustine should always be mentioned in the liturgy right after Gregory.|$|E
500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> guitar rhythmic figure {{centered}} on one chord, with [...] "accents that fell fractionally ahead of the beat". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray describes it as a [...] "rocking dance piece... its structure is utterly free-form, its basic beat is the jumping, polyrhythmic groove which he [...] learned in the Delta". [...] In an interview with B.B. King, Hooker confirmed that he used an open G guitar tuning technique for his guitar, although he usually used a capo, raising the pitch to B (1948), A (1959), or A (1970). [...] He also employed hammer-on and pull-off techniques, which are described as [...] "a slurred ascending bass line played on the fifth string [...] " [...] by music writer Lenny Carlson. [...] Although it is titled a [...] "boogie", it does not resemble the earlier boogie-woogie style. [...] Boogie-woogie {{is based on a}} left-hand piano ostinato or walking-bass line and, as performed on guitar, forms the popular 1940s instrumental [...] "Guitar Boogie". [...] Rather than being derivative, Hooker's boogie becomes [...] "as overwhelmingly personal a piece as anything ever done in the blues".|$|E
