5|$|A western rock lobster fishery {{developed}} {{on the island}} in the early 20th century. There are records of the island {{being used as a}} base for crayfishers as early as 1902, and for many years it was used as an anchorage by anglers. It was not until 1947, however, that a seasonally inhabited permanent camp was established there. According to former crayfisher Ron Bertelsen, the first camp was established by skippers George Barker and George Nelson and <b>deckhand</b> John Long, who relocated there when lobsters around Pigeon Island grew scarce. They camped {{at the southern end of}} North Island in a camp initially built from packing case timbers. A local carrier boat, the Betty Margaret, serviced the camp. From about 40 seasonal inhabitants in 1940, the population grew to about 130 by 2003. An airstrip was built in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In a {{move against}} the insurgency, the Cylons decide {{to have the}} NCP arrest 200 civilians {{they believe to be}} {{affiliated}} with the resistance. Headed by Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna), a former Galactica <b>deckhand</b> and resistance fighter, most of the arrests take place during the night. Those being arrested include Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) and Cally Henderson Tyrol (Nicki Clyne). Learning of Cally's arrest, Jammer attempts to get her released by Boomer, but Boomer is unable to help. After another suicide bombing at a power station, the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed, but require President Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) signature. When he refuses to sign, an Aaron Doral (Matthew Bennett) copy forces him to at gunpoint. Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer) attempts to stop him, but Doral shoots her in the head. Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons know he is leading the resistance. He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will be meeting next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen discovers where the resistance plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet.|$|E

40|$|Anthropological {{discussion}} of individuality, {{as a component}} of masculinity, has tended to focus on either the performance and championing of autonomy in the West (e. g., Kapferer) or the manner in which people in non-Western contexts become explicitly manifest through relationships with others (e. g., Strathern). In this paper, I consider an atypical example of masculine identity by describing intimate interpersonal relationships between Australian commercial shark boat skippers and their young <b>deckhands.</b> As in other Western fisheries (e. g., Icelandic), economic success and physical safety are promoted through synergism among fishers. In the Australian case, however, the degree of corporeal cooperation is so extreme that <b>deckhands</b> resemble living prostheses of their skipper, embodying their peripheral socio-productive status. I consider this bond {{in the context of the}} Australian ethos of masculinity, in which displays of "individuality" are key. However, for young <b>deckhands,</b> their prosthetic role can compromise their passage into manhood. <br /...|$|R

Controversy erupted after it was discovered from the captured Germans, that the three men taken from the sinking Columbia, had been locked away below decks {{on one of the}} torpedo boats and left to die, when the German vessel started to sink.

In 1773 on the British Royal Navy ship Racehorse, he travelled to the Arctic in an expedition to find a northern route to India. On that voyage he worked with Dr. Charles Irving, who had developed a process to distill seawater and later made a fortune from it. Two years later, Irving recruited Equiano for a project on the Mosquito Coast in Central America, where he was to use his African background to help select slaves and manage them as labourers on sugar cane plantations. Irving and Equiano had a working relationship and friendship {{for more than a}} decade, but the plantation venture failed.|$|E

25|$|From childhood, James Dunn was a {{voracious}} {{reader with}} an excellent memory.

However, before long he returned home where a job as a clerk at the law firm of George Gilbert, where he worked alongside Richard Bedford Bennett, led him to the decision to apply to Dalhousie University Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The small amount of money he had been able to save was not nearly enough to cover his education costs and Dunn worked at a variety of part-time jobs to pay his way through university, including a position in the university library.

When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps {{off the side of the}} ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as [...] "a {{heightened}} case of cabin fever", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her.
