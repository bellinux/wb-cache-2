This nanobiosensor platform comprises of mercaptopropionic acid functionalized electrospun zinc oxide nanofiber modified <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> film for covalent conjugation of protein. The highly oriented zinc oxide nanowires were synthesized by simple, low cost electrospinning technique and electrophoretically deposited on the ITO coated <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> sheet. The performance of nanobiosensor platform is validated by using BSA-Anti BSA interaction {{as a model}} system. The zinc oxide nanowire modified flexible biosensing platforms have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The fabricated <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> based immunosensor shows a remarkable detection limit of 100 fg/mL in the wider detection range of 100 fg/mL– 100 μg/mL.

40|$|Abstract –This work {{presents}} a novel method to transfer thin-film transistors from a Si wafer to another <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> substrate. First, high-performance poly-Si TFTs were fabricated on 1 -µm thick SiO 2 of a Si wafer and then adhered to a <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> substrate by the optical adhesive. Next, the spin-etching process was utilized {{to remove the}} backside Si with SiO 2 as a stopping layer. We have established a qualitative model to explain {{the relation between the}} chemical flow rate/rotation speed to the etching rate and the uniformity of Si removal. The Si etching rate is higher than 200 µm/min while maintaining Si to SiO 2 selectivity of 250 under optimized spin-etching parameters. Compared to that before transference, no degradation or yield loss was found due to substrate bonding and Si spin-etching steps. Additionally, extrinsic stress shows little effect to the properties of poly-Si resistors on the <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> substrate...|$|R

40|$|Alternatives for {{replacing}} the expensive ITO are explored and Poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) :polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced as one possibility. We present the first small-molecule organic solar cells employing only PEDOT:PSS as transparent electrode. Solar cells on glass and on <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> foil were prepared, using a p-doped hole transporting material, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and C 60 as donor-acceptor heterojunction, and an exciton blocking layer. Different methods to structure the PEDOT:PSS electrodes were investigated and are presented.

40|$|A {{composite}} {{made from}} the flexsible plastic waste and saw dust was studied.

The investigated ratio of <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> waste / saw dust were 100 / 0; 90 / 10; 80 / 20; 70 / 30; 60 / 40; and 50 / 50 respectively.

The composites were tested for their physical properties I, e flexibility, dimensional stability, curling, volatility, tensile strength, elongation at break, and hardness. The physical properties testing result show that a composite by using the <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> waste and saw dust in comparation of 90 / 10 could meet the requirements of SNI 03 / 4060 / 1996 for Vinyl Floor. The increasing saw dust content in composites decreased tensile strength, elongation at break, flexibility, and hardness, but increased dimensional stability, and volatility. Tensile strength of all composites was higher than particle board...|$|R
