25|$|Going into 2007, Michigan {{had high}} expectations. Standout players Chad Henne, Mike Hart, and Jake Long all opted {{to return for}} their senior seasons for one last crack at Ohio State and {{a chance at a}} {{national}} championship, causing Michigan to be ranked fifth in the preseason polls. However, Michigan's struggles against the spread offense reared <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> head again as the Wolverines shockingly lose the opener to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. The game marked the first win by a Division I-AA team over a team ranked in the Associated Press Poll. The next week, Michigan was blown out by Oregon, another spread team. Despite the early rough start, Michigan won their next eight games and went into the Ohio State game with a chance to win the Big Ten championship. However, Michigan once again fell to the Buckeyes, this time 14–3. After the game, Lloyd Carr announced that he would retire from Michigan after the bowl game. In the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Carr's final game, Michigan defeated the defending national champion Florida Gators, led by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, 41–35. Carr's accomplishments at Michigan included a 122–40 record, five Big Ten championships, and one national championship.|$|E

During high school and then college, Robinson had been exploring philosophical and theological questions and has said, [...] "The Episcopal Church got a hold on me." [...] He graduated from Sewanee cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies in 1969 and attended seminary that fall. Robinson studied for a Master of Divinity degree from the Episcopal General Theological Seminary in New York City.

[...] They continued dating and, as Robinson puts it, [...] "about {{a month before the}} marriage, [...] became frightened that ... this thing would raise <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> head some day, and cause her and me great pain."

According to Melchior, [...] "in each and every generation antisemitism tries to hide <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> face behind various disguises — and hatred of the State of Israel is its current disguise."

5000|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the fable {{was used}} to {{underline}} {{the perception of the}} black man's 'natural' inferiority, both moral and social.

They then asked the Shepherds what that should mean. So they told them, saying, Thus shall it be with the vile person.

5000|$|Price is a {{collector}} of antique guns, but his work does not glorify the revolutionary and Civil War battles featured in his earlier novels, but rather [...] "conveys the menace of war's depredations {{on the daily}} lives of ordinary people who thought they were involved in a gallant cause, only to be brought face to face with <b>its</b> <b>uglier</b> realities." [...] The many strong female characters that dominate his work show how terrible war is on the families left behind. [...] Rob Neufeld, an historian from Asheville, North Carolina and columnist for the Asheville Citizen-Times, writes that Price’s characters “dictate an unfashionable level of realism.” Noting that Price’s father was a Methodist minister, he adds that Price’s writing seeks to resolve “the disturbing chasm between the gentle religion in which he’d been raised and the soulless horrors that plague us still.” ...|$|R

He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, Hollywood Causes Cancer, stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name [...] "Tom Green." [...] Green says, [...] "I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that – it's both abhorrent and not funny. To this day I still get asked about it, and it's annoying.

2500|$|Prominent in many cultures, {{the peacock}} {{has been used}} in {{numerous}} iconic representations, including being designated the national bird of India in 1963. The peacock, known as mayura in Sanskrit, has enjoyed a fabled place in India since and is frequently depicted in temple art, mythology, poetry, folk music and traditions. A Sankrit derivation of mayura is from the root mi for kill and said to mean [...] "killer of snakes". Many Hindu deities are associated with the bird, Krishna is often depicted with a feather in his headband, while worshippers of Shiva associate the bird as the steed of the God of war, Kartikeya (also known as Skanda or Murugan). A story in the Uttara Ramayana describes the head of the Devas, Indra, who unable to defeat Ravana, sheltered under the wing of peacock and later blessed it with a [...] "thousand eyes" [...] and fearlessness from serpents. Another story has Indra who after being cursed with a thousand ulcers was transformed into a peacock with a thousand eyes. In Buddhist philosophy, the peacock represents wisdom. Peacock feathers are used in many rituals and ornamentation. Peacock motifs are widespread in Indian temple architecture, old coinage, textiles and continue to be used in many modern items of art and utility. A folk belief found in many parts of India is that the peacock does not copulate with the peahen but that she is impregnated by other means. The stories vary and include the idea that the peacock looks at <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> feet and cries whereupon the tears are fed on by the peahen causing it to be orally impregnated while other variants incorporate sperm transfer from beak to beak. Similar ideas have also been ascribed to Indian crow species. In Greek mythology the origin of the peacocks plumage is explained in the tale of Hera and Argus. The main figure of the Yazidi religion Yezidism, Melek Taus, is most commonly depicted as a peacock. Peacock motifs are widely used even today such as in the logos of the US NBC and the PTV television networks and the Sri Lankan Airlines.|$|E

60|$|On {{my return}} in early April we caught the {{northeast}} Trades shortly after turning Cape Palmas, and kept them till close upon Grand Canary. They were a complete {{contrast with the}} Harmatan, the firmament looking exceptionally high, and the sun shining hot, while a crisp, steady gale made the 'herds of Proteus' gambol and disport themselves over the long ridges thrown up by the cool plain of bright cerulean. The horizon, when clear, had a pinkish hue, and near coast and islands puffy folds of dazzling white, nearly 5,000 feet high, were based upon dark-grey streaks of cloudland simulating continents and archipelagoes. Within the tropics the heavens appear lower, and we never sight blue or purple water save after a tornado. The normal colour is a dirty, brassy yellow-brown, here and there transparent, but ever unsightly in the extreme. It must depend upon some unexplained atmospheric conditions; and the water-aspect is often at <b>its</b> <b>ugliest</b> when the skies are clearest. I have often seen the same tints when approaching Liverpool.|$|R
