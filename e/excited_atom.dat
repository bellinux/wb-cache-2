25|$|If an atom {{is already}} in the excited state, it may be {{agitated}} by the passage of a photon that has a frequency ν21 corresponding to the energy gap ΔE of the excited state to ground state transition. In this case, the <b>excited</b> <b>atom</b> relaxes to the ground state, and it produces a second photon of frequency ν21. The original photon is not absorbed by the atom, and so the result is two photons of the same frequency. This process is known as stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} stimulated {{emission}} occurs {{is proportional to the}} number of atoms N2 in the excited state, and the radiation density of the light. The base probability of a photon causing stimulated emission in a single <b>excited</b> <b>atom</b> was shown by Albert Einstein to be exactly equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. Therefore, when the numbers of atoms in the ground and excited states are equal, the rate of stimulated emission is equal to the rate of absorption for a given radiation density.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelength}} of the photoelectron {{is dependent on}} the energy and phase of the backscattered wave which exists at the central atom. The wavelength changes {{as a function of the}} energy of the incoming photon. The phase and amplitude of the backscattered wave are dependent on the type of atom doing the backscattering and the distance of the backscattering atom from the central atom. The dependence of the scattering on atomic species makes it possible to obtain information pertaining to the chemical coordination environment of the original absorbing (centrally <b>excited)</b> <b>atom</b> by analyzing these EXAFS data.|$|E

2500|$|An {{electron}} in {{the lowest}} energy level of hydrogen (...) therefore has about 13.6 eV less energy than a motionless electron infinitely far from the nucleus. The next energy level (...) is −3.4 eV. The third (n = 3) is −1.51 eV, and so on.

2500|$|A Rydberg atom is an <b>excited</b> <b>atom</b> {{with one}} or more {{electrons}} that have a very high principal quantum number. These atoms have a number of peculiar properties including an exaggerated response to electric and magnetic fields, long decay periods and electron wavefunctions that approximate, under some conditions, classical orbits of electrons about the nuclei.

2500|$|In the {{experimental}} setup, X-rays are {{released from the}} particle beam by an undulator; a high-resolution monochromator produces a beam with small energy dispersion (typically 1.0 meV).

Typical parameters for {{the experimental}} scan are –20 meV below recoil-free resonance energy to +100 meV above it. The number of scans (often recorded for 5 seconds every 0.2 meV) depends {{on the amount of}} Mössbauer-active nuclei in the sample.

50|$|Because of the non-commutation {{of field}} variables, the variances {{of the fields}} cannot be zero, {{although}} their averages are zero. The electromagnetic field has therefore a zero-point energy, and a lowest quantum state. The interaction of an <b>excited</b> <b>atom</b> with this lowest quantum state of the electromagnetic field is what leads to spontaneous emission, the transition of an <b>excited</b> <b>atom</b> {{to a state of}} lower energy by emission of a photon even when no external perturbation of the atom is present.|$|E
