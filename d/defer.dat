5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also <b>defer</b> their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to <b>defer,</b> is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or <b>defer,</b> because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} value relevance analysis of <b>deferred</b> taxes on companies that revalued its fixed assets {{for the period}} of 2008 - 2015. Selection of these companies is because fixed assets revaluation is one of the components of <b>deferred</b> taxes. Fixed Assets Revaluation will cause <b>deferred</b> tax asset or liability depend on the comparison of the company recorded value and the market value. When the company recorded value is larger than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> tax liability, and in contrast if the company recorded value is lower than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> tax asset. 120 firms are the total sample of this study. This study uses Feltham & Ohlson’s price model in order to regress the value relevance of the sample. Dependent variable that used in this study is closed price per share. Independent variables that used in this study are <b>deferred</b> tax assets and liabilities and other components of <b>deferred</b> taxes (net <b>deferred</b> taxes, net <b>deferred</b> tax assets, net <b>deferred</b> tax liabilities, and net <b>deferred</b> tax based on quintile distribution).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of <b>deferred</b> tax assets and liabilities for a sample of large U.

In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net <b>deferred</b> tax assets and 48 reported net <b>deferred</b> tax liabilities. Firms differ substantially in the composition of their <b>deferred</b> tax assets and liabilities. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> tax liabilities are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total <b>deferred</b> tax assets for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> tax assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total <b>deferred</b> tax liabilities for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> tax liabilities were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of <b>deferred</b> tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} and investigate Tiled Shading. The tiled techniques, though simple, enable substantial improvements to both <b>deferred</b> and forward shading. Tiled Shading has previously been talked about {{only in terms of}} <b>deferred</b> shading (Tiled <b>Deferred</b> Shading). We contribute a more detailed description of the technique, introduce Tiled Forward Shading (a generalization of Tiled <b>Deferred</b> Shading to also apply to forward shading), and a thorough performance evaluation. Tiled Forward Shading has many of the advantages of <b>deferred</b> shading, e. g. scene management and light management is decoupled. At the same time, unlike traditional <b>deferred</b> and tiled <b>deferred</b> shading, Full Screen Anti Aliasing and transparency is trivially supported. We also contribute a thorough comparison of the performance of Tiled <b>Deferred,</b> Tiled Forward and traditional <b>deferred</b> shading. Our evaluation shows that Tiled <b>Deferred</b> Shading has the least variable worst case performance, and scales the best with faster GPUs. Tiled <b>Deferred</b> Shading is especially suitable when there are many light sources. Tiled Forward Shading is shown to be competitive for scenes with fewer lights, while being much simpler than traditional forward shading techniques. Tiled shading also enables simple transitioning between <b>deferred</b> and forward shading. We demonstrate how this can be used to handle transparent geometry, frequently a problem when using <b>deferred</b> shading. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Deferred</b> {{lighting}} (also {{known as}} Light Pre-Pass) is {{a modification of}} the <b>Deferred</b> Shading. This technique uses three passes, instead of two in <b>deferred</b> shading. On first pass over the scene geometry, only the attributes necessary to compute per-pixel lighting (irradiance) are written to the G-Buffer. The screen-space, “deferred” pass then outputs only diffuse and specular lighting data, so a second pass must be made over the scene to read back the lighting data and output the final per-pixel shading. The apparent advantage of <b>deferred</b> lighting is a dramatic reduction {{in the size of}} the G-Buffer. The obvious cost is the need to render the scene geometry twice instead of once. An additional cost is that the <b>deferred</b> pass in <b>deferred</b> lighting must output diffuse and specular irradiance separately, whereas the <b>deferred</b> pass in <b>deferred</b> shading need only output a single combined radiance value.|$|R
