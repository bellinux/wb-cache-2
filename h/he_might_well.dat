5|$|The loss of Schmitt was a {{significant}} blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, {{he was the most}} experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the sieges at Kehl and Hünigen, the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winterthur and Zürich. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>well</b> have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement, Franz von Weyrother. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at Hohenlinden in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and possessor of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory, but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was considered one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the strong two-term tradition, a few {{president}}s prior to Franklin Roosevelt did attempt to secure a third term. Ulysses S. Grant, after having served as president from 1869 to 1877, sought nomination for another term at the 1880 Republican National Convention, but narrowly lost to James Garfield, who {{would go on to}} win the 1880 election. Given the Republican Party's dominance during that period, had Grant been nominated, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>well</b> have won a third term.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} Myshkin's trip {{is to make}} the {{acquaintance}} of his distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna Yepanchina, and to make inquiries about a matter of business. Madame Yepanchina is the wife of General Yepanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his mid-fifties. When the Prince calls on them, he is instructed to wait by a servant. He strikes up a conversation with the servant, treating him as an equal and expatiating, to the lackey's surprise, {{on the subject of the}} horror of capital punishment. General Yepanchin has an ambitious and vain assistant, Gavril Ardalionovich Ivolgin (Ganya), who the Prince also meets while waiting. The General and his business partner, the aristocrat Totsky, are seeking to arrange a marriage between Ganya and Nastassya Filippovna. Though herself of noble descent, Nastassya Filippovna became a ward of Totsky at the age of 7, following a family tragedy. When she was 16, Totsky had settled her in a comfortable little house in the country, provided her with tutors, a library and other cultural refinements, and for the next four years treated her as his concubine. Now a grown woman, she has made it frighteningly clear to him that she does not intend to let him off lightly. Totsky, thinking the marriage might settle her and free him to pursue his desire for marriage with General Yepanchin's eldest daughter, has promised 75,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna, unsure of Ganya's motives and aware that his family does not approve of her, has reserved her decision but has promised to announce it that evening at her birthday soirée. Ganya and the General openly discuss the subject in front of Myshkin. Ganya shows him a photograph of her, and her face particularly strikes him. The Prince tells them of Rogozhin's interest in Nastassya Filippovna, and Ganya asks the Prince whether Rogozhin would marry her. The Prince replies that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>well</b> marry her and then murder her a week later.|$|E

500|$|In February 1988, after {{suffering}} from several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden {{was taken by}} long-distance ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and given lifesaving surgery to correct an intracranial berry aneurysm that had begun leaking; the situation was serious enough that a priest had administered last rites at the hospital. [...] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, which represented a major complication. [...] Another operation to repair a second aneurysm, which had caused no symptoms but was also at risk from bursting, was performed in May 1988. [...] The hospitalization and recovery kept Biden from his duties in the U.S. Senate for seven months. [...] Biden has had no recurrences or effects from the aneurysms since then. [...] In retrospect, Biden's family {{came to believe that}} the early end to his presidential campaign had been a blessing in disguise, for had he still been campaigning {{in the midst of the}} primaries in early 1988, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>well</b> have not have stopped to seek medical attention and the condition might have become unsurvivable.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, every English county cricket {{team had}} an amateur captain. Yorkshire had been led by amateurs since Lord Hawke {{took over the}} {{position}} in 1883. Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while professionals were mainly from the working classes. Class distinctions pervaded the game, which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs. They wished to preserve leadership roles {{for members of the}} Establishment, in defiance of broader social changes that had reduced their influence in other sports. Administrators argued that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over [...] employment. The Wisden editor believed that [...] "the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline. He would naturally hesitate to suggest to his committee that this player or that should be dropped, and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood. Further, feeling that an error of judgment would prejudice his standing with the committee, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>well</b> hesitate to take risks." [...] In 1925, Lord Hawke, then the Yorkshire president, expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side, had made the impromptu comment, [...] "Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England." [...] His remarks were widely reported in the press and heavily criticised. This was to leave Hawke in an awkward situation in 1927.|$|E

[...] According to Demosthenes, the rich hid their assets and [...] did not reveal them to the public unless war threatened them or their holdings. The accusation of evasion of public charges [...] was very common in judicial speeches: litigants clearly played upon the prejudices of the jury, [...] that all the rich preferred not to pay, if they could get away with it.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century, most captains were amateurs. Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while {{professionals}} were mainly from the working classes.

2500|$|Procurator patrimoni provinciarum Belgica et duarum Germaniarum ibi vice praesidis provinciae Germaniae Inferioris (i.e. Administrator of the Imperial Patrimonial Domains (i.e. the estates {{that belonged}} to the Imperial Office as opposed to the private estates of the Severan Dynasty) in Belgica and the two Germanies (i.e. Germania Inferior and Germania Superior). While holding that office he was also made vice praesidis (I.e. Acting Governor) of Germania Inferior - i.e. the lower Roman Rhineland - in which {{capacity}} he commanded the two legions stationed in that province during Alexander Severus's German war. (To make it possible for Timesitheus to be put in command of these legions while retaining his equestrian status was probably the main object of Julia Mammaea in securing him the procuratorial appointment: it provides yet further evidence of the trust she had in him. Whether or not he actually saw action in that abortive conflict with the Alemanni is unknown.) That Timesitheus remained an equestrian when <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>well</b> have been adlected to the senate and, thus, been eligible to be appointed as the praetorian legatus of Lower Germany instead of just a vicar - i.e. one who acted on behalf of (vice) such an officer - was probably his choice.
