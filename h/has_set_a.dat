The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) <b>has</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.05mg/m3, time-weighted average.

5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States <b>has</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) <b>has</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment <b>has</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make aspirin tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) <b>has</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{exposure}} in United States is {{regulated by the}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
