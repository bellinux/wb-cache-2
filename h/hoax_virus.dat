50|$|<b>Virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> {{are usually}} {{harmless}} and accomplish {{nothing more than}} annoying people who identify it as a hoax and waste the time of people who forward the message. Nevertheless, a number of hoaxes have warned users that vital system files are viruses and encourage the user to delete the file, possibly damaging the system. Examples of this type include the jdbgmgr.exe <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> and the SULFNBK.EXE hoax.|$|R
50|$|Anti-virus specialists {{agree that}} {{recipients}} should delete <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> when they receive them, instead of forwarding them.|$|R
50|$|Spam {{promoting}} a commercial service or product. This {{is the most}} common type of spam, but it excludes spams that are <b>hoaxes</b> (e.g. <b>virus</b> warnings), political advocacy, religious messages and chain letters sent by a person to many other people. The term UCE may be most common in the USA.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the website}} states that all {{articles}} there are fake, anti-virus software makers such as Symantec, Sophos and F-Secure had pages for the Tuxissa <b>virus</b> <b>hoax.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{consider}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> {{and other}} chain e-mails to be a computer worm {{in and of}} themselves. They replicate by social engineeringâ€”exploiting users' concern, ignorance, and disinclination to investigate before acting.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> is {{a message}} warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat. The message is usually a chain e-mail that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know.|$|R
50|$|The <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> {{has become}} part of the culture of the twenty-first century and the gullibility of novice {{computer}} users convinced to delete files on the basis of hoaxes has been parodied in several popular jokes and songs.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> that claim that csrss.exe is malware {{and should be}} removed to prevent damage to the system; these are false, as removing csrss.exe or killing the csrss.exe process {{will result in a}} Blue Screen of Death.|$|R
5000|$|One such parody is [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic's song [...] "Virus Alert" [...] {{from the}} album Straight Outta Lynwood. The song {{makes fun of}} the exaggerated claims that are made in <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes,</b> such as legally {{changing}} your name or opening a rift in time and space.|$|R
5000|$|The Goodtimes Virus was a {{computer}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> that spread {{during the early}} years of the Internet's popularity. Warnings about {{a computer}} virus named [...] "Good Times" [...] began being passed around among Internet users in 1994. The Goodtimes virus was supposedly transmitted via an email bearing the subject header [...] "Good Times" [...] or [...] "Goodtimes," [...] hence the virus's name, and the warning recommended deleting any such email unread. The virus described in the warnings did not exist, but the warnings themselves, were, in effect, virus-like. In 1997 the Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective announced that they had been responsible for the perpetration of the [...] "Good Times" [...] <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> as an exercise to [...] "prove the gullibility of self-proclaimed [...] "experts" [...] on the Internet." ...|$|R
50|$|The Life is {{beautiful}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> is an e-mail hoax which began circulating on the Internet around January 2002 in Brazil. The e-mail details a virus {{contained in a}} Microsoft PowerPoint attachment which is supposedly called Life {{is beautiful}}.pps. To date, no such virus has been found and the e-mail is widely considered a hoax.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{computer}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> {{appeared in the}} wake of Good Times. These messages were similar in form to Good Times, warning users not to open messages bearing particular subject lines. Subject lines mentioned in these emails include [...] "Penpal greetings," [...] "Free Money," [...] "Deeyenda," [...] "Invitation,", and [...] "Win a Holiday." ...|$|R
50|$|The jdbgmgr.exe <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> {{involved}} an e-mail spam in 2002 that advised computer users to delete a file named jdbgmgr.exe {{because it was}} a computer virus. jdbgmgr.exe, which had a little teddy bear like icon (The Microsoft Bear), was actually a valid Microsoft Windows file, the Debugger Registrar for Java (also known as Java Debug Manager, hence jdbgmgr).|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "payload" [...] is {{the actual}} body or data that perform the actual {{malicious}} purpose of the virus. Payload activity might be noticeable (e.g., because it causes the system to slow down or [...] "freeze"), {{as most of the}} time the [...] "payload" [...] itself is the harmful activity, or some times non-destructive but distributive, which is called <b>Virus</b> <b>hoax.</b>|$|R
40|$|Security is an {{important}} aspect regardless the end user is a corporate or home user. The Intemet viruses, worms, Trojans and spams are not new to the home users. They {{are the ones who}} are easily and badly affected by these cyber attacks. Most end users do not install or run any kind of antivirus or firewalls, like corporate users. There is a need of creating awareness among the home users to know that how hacker and crackers break security and what steps are necessary to protect systems. The broadband is an always-on connection making it an easier target to <b>hoaxes,</b> <b>viruses</b> and spam attacks. The hacking can be done round the clock raising its vulnerability than the dial-up connection. Mostly users of broadband are the residential consumers, having none or a little knowledge of security threats and risks. Although there are tools available to make broadband connection secure and reliable, but there are either not implemented fully or services not advertised sufficiently. Getting knowledge of which service provider is providing better security feature and that there is a minimum risk to their personal data, broadband users will adopt it. The local government along with the intemet service providers (ISP) may benefit home users by taking steps to increase awareness and include measures for increased security, while providers of technology i. e. broadband companies are responsible for ensuring adequate network security. Generally, when implementing security, it is recommended that the approaches should follow internationally accepted standards such as ISO 17799 : Which is based on BS 7799 to ensure that the minimum controls are in place to provide a secure information system. It is, however difficult to be able to measures compliance with the standard. These are quite few software products available, which an organization can use to assist them in implementing information security management. School of Computin...|$|R
50|$|Another {{parody of}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> is the honor system virus {{which has been}} {{circulated}} under the name Amish Computer Virus, manual virus, the Blond Computer Virus, the Irish Computer Virus, the Syrian Computer Virus, the Norwegian Computer Virus, Albanian Virus, Newfie Virus, the Unix Computer Virus, the Mac OS 9 virus, Discount virus and many others. This joke email claims to be authored by the Amish or other similar low-technology populations who have no computers, programming skills or electricity to create viruses and thus ask you to delete your own hard drive contents manually after forwarding the message to your friends.|$|R
5000|$|Bad Times is a {{computer}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoax</b> sent out by e-mail. This [...] "virus" [...] does not actually exist, and the [...] "warning" [...] is meant to parody the alarmist message that spread the hoax of the Goodtimes virus. Like the [...] "Goodtimes" [...] hoax, the message warns of the horrible consequences that the virus can inflict; however, unlike [...] "Goodtimes", where all of the consequences might have sounded plausible to people unfamiliar with computers, many of the claims made for the [...] "Badtimes" [...] virus are utterly implausible, such as that the virus [...] "will drink all your good beer" [...] and [...] "will leave dirty socks {{on the coffee table}} when you are expecting company." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Tuxissa {{virus is}} another {{parody of the}} <b>virus</b> <b>hoax,</b> based {{on the concept of}} the Melissa virus, but with its aim of {{installing}} Linux on the victim's computer without the owner's permission. The story says that it was spread via e-mail, contained in a message titled [...] "Important Message About Windows Security". It was supposed to first spread the virus to other computers, then download a stripped-down version of Slackware and uncompress it onto the hard disk. The Windows Registry is finally deleted and the boot options changed. Then the virus removes itself when it reboots the computer at the end, with the user facing the Linux login prompt and all his Windows security problems solved for him.|$|R
5000|$|Computer <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes</b> became {{widespread}} as viruses themselves {{began to}} spread. A typical hoax is an email message warning recipients of a non-existent threat, usually forging quotes supposedly from authorities such as Microsoft and IBM. In {{most cases the}} payload is an exhortation to distribute the message {{to everyone in the}} recipient's address book. Thus the e-mail [...] "warning" [...] is itself the [...] "virus." [...] Sometimes the hoax is more harmful, e.g., telling the recipient to seek a particular file (usually in a Microsoft Windows operating system); if the file is found, the computer is deemed to be infected unless it is deleted. In reality the file is one required by the operating system for correct functioning of the computer.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{a number}} of recent {{approaches}} to put memetics to the test of quantitative measurability. The focus is on the selection criteria for the spreading of memes put forward by Heylighen (1997), which include utility, novelty, simplicity, coherence, authority and proselytism. The general hypothesis is that memes scoring higher on these criteria will survive longer and be more prevalent than others. This can be tested by checking which story elements best survive a chain of person-toperson transmissions ("Chinese whispers " game), by simulating the cognitive and social processes that determine this differential survival and spread, and by correlating the score on the selection criteria with the actual frequency with which a meme is encountered. In a pilot study using an Internet survey, this method was applied specifically to <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes,</b> which can be seen as paradigmatic examples of clearly delimited, self-reproducing messages. ...|$|R
40|$|Once upon a {{time the}} most {{problematic}} chain emails were <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes,</b> as exemplifi ed by the Good Times hoax: however, perhaps the last really innovative malware-related hoaxes were the SULFNBK and JDBGMGR hoaxes of the early noughties. Since then, most anti-malware companies have virtually lost interest in memetic malware as its links with real, programmatic malware have declined. But does this mean the problem has gone away? Unfortunately, it hasnâ€™t. Somewhere in the no-manâ€™s land between malware and spam, the chain letter continues to create a range of problems for system administrators and IT support departments, from choked mail servers to choked support lines. However, it has also created both emotional and practical problems for the recipients as hoaxers have learned to apply increased pressure by hanging hoaxes and semi-hoaxes onto real-life tragedies and disasters such as the 2004 tsunami and missing children including Madeleine McCann. This paper traces {{the changes in the}} Meme Machine [1] from the 1990 s to 2009, from the Jeffrey Mogul metavirus [2] to the tsunami-related hoaxes that intermittently crippled public sector communication channels in the UK in the present decade, and considers some of the most recent examples, looking at underlying mechanisms as well as topical content. What has changed? What measures should we be taking to steer our users and customers away from the submerged 9 / 10 of this under-publicized iceberg? And if the security industry doesnâ€™t own the problem, who does...|$|R
40|$|Memes are {{contagious}} ideas, all {{competing for}} {{a share of}} our mind {{in a kind of}} Darwinian selection. Many hoaxes and their kin are Memes which are now commonly spread via e-mail and web sites. They are at the very least a nuisance, and in many companies they are causing major problems with wasted bandwidth and lost productivity. No matter how silly a hoax is, it still hits the support and infrastructure budget. Magnify this by the number of different hoaxes, urban legends and scams that are circulating within a company at any one time, now add the cost of trying to counter it, and the problem becomes more focused and expensive. This paper will look at common Memes spread via e-mail and ways to counter them and get your staff back to work instead of wasting their time (and your money) propagating them. It will also endeavour to answer the following questions: â€¢ How do I get my staff to stop sending hoaxes, etc. around? â€¢ How do I stop or minimise their penetration within my company and manage them when they do get in? â€¢ How can <b>virus</b> <b>hoaxes,</b> other hoaxes, chain letters, etc. be successfully defused? â€¢ What other resources, sites should I use?
