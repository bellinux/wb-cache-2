25|$|Exact {{figures on}} the non-Islamic {{population}} in Turkey are not available. Some sources estimate the Christian population between three and five percent.

25|$|Immigrant {{children}} and youths, mostly of lower-class background, are the fastest-growing {{segment of the}} German population.

25|$|Mining {{and other}} {{industries}} gradually {{developed in the}} area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>cities,</b> hit the city hard. In turn, as {{in the rest of}} the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the white community. Nonetheless, whites remained the majority to the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} urban {{planning}} theorist was Sir Ebenezer Howard, who initiated the garden city movement in 1898. This {{was inspired by}} earlier planned communities built by industrial philanthropists in the countryside, such as Cadburys' Bournville, Lever's Port Sunlight and George Pullman's eponymous Pullman in Chicago. All these settlements decentralised the working environment from {{the centre of the}} cities, and provided a healthy living space for the factory workers. Howard generalised this achievement into a planned movement for the country as a whole. He was also influenced by the work of economist Alfred Marshall who argued in 1884 that industry needed a supply of labour that could in theory be supplied anywhere, and that companies have an incentive to improve workers living standards as the company bears much of the cost inflicted by the unhealthy urban conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>cities.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{campaigned for}} {{efficiency}} and the Republican record of prosperity against Democrat Alfred E. Smith. Smith likewise was {{a proponent of}} efficiency earned as governor of New York. Both candidates were pro-business, and each promised to improve conditions for farmers, reform immigration laws, and maintain America’s isolationist foreign policy. Where they differed was on the Volstead Act which outlawed the sale of liquor and beer. Smith was a “wet” who called for its repeal, whereas Hoover gave limited support for prohibition, calling it an “experiment noble in purpose.” His use of “experiment” suggested it was not permanent. While Smith won extra support among Catholics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>cities,</b> {{he was also the}} target of intense anti-Catholicism from some Protestant communities, especially amongst Southern Baptists and German Lutherans. Overall the religious factor worked to the advantage of Hoover, although he took no part in it.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Zinta earned {{positive}} {{reviews for}} her role in Farhan Akhtar's National Film Award-winning Dil Chahta Hai. Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). Zinta starred as Aamir Khan's love interest, Shalini. Dil Chahta Hai was popular with critics, some of whom noted it broke new ground by introducing a realistic portrayal of Indian youth. The film was a moderate box office success in India; it performed well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>cities</b> but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle it presented.

Critics lauded Dil Chahta Hai as a groundbreaking film for its realistic portrayal of Indian youth.
