40|$|At {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} focal points {{appointed}} by the Governments of the signatory countries of the Declaration on the application of Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was held in Guadalajara, Mexico, on 16 and 17 April 2013, {{a decision was made}} to form working groups to advance towards the creation of a regional instrument. Thus, a working group on access rights and the regional instrument was formed for the purpose of gaining more in-depth knowledge on access rights {{in order to make a}} proposal on the nature and scope of the application of a regional instrument. At its first meeting, the working group determined that a study describing the different types of international instruments would be useful in helping it achieve its objective. This report explores the different types of instruments that are used in public international law, with an emphasis on the instruments that are relevant to Principle 10. The report has three chapters, which are as follows. The first chapter analyses the term “international instrument” and discusses the distinction between binding and non-binding legal instruments, illustrated with examples. The second chapter describes the function of implementation and compliance mechanisms in an international instrument, providing examples of these mechanisms. The third chapter presents the multilateral and regional instruments relevant to access rights regarding information, participation and justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean.

In this paper, an alternative approach based on consensus clustering between two different clustering methods is proposed to obtain homogeneous prototypes.

The consensus clustering is {{used to assess the}} correspondence between the clustering solutions obtained and to find the prototypes as a compromise between the two clustering methods...|$|R
40|$|Following an {{introductory}} chapter, <b>I</b> examine (<b>i)</b> <b>typologies</b> which have differentiated {{the literature on}} organisational culture and symbolism (Chapter 2), (ii) the contribution of organisation theory to organisation culture (Chapter 3), and (iii) recent literature on organisational culture and symbolism (Chapter 4). Within these chapters, I adopt Habermas' (1972) notion of knowledge-constitutive interests, assessing the contrubutions to understanding organisational culture made by literature guided by technical, practical and emancipatory cognitive interests. In doing so, I suggest that more critical studies on organisational culture and symbolism have been comparatively neglected. Lamenting this neglect, I suggest that Giddens' theory of structuration can be employed to advance {{the development of a}} critical, emancipatory conceptualisation of organisational culture. In particular, I argue that this Giddensian analysis, by penetrating the existential, poltical and material processes of cultural reproduction (Chapter 5), is able to disclose some of the more contradictory features of organisation culture. The remainder of the thesis comprises of a critical ethnography of the work cultures of public relations and personnel specialists located in a state bureaucracy. I begin the ethnography with a dicussion of my research methods (Chapter 6) and an overview of the departments studied (Chapter 7) : I then examine (i) the work cultures of the specialists (Chapter 8), (ii) the specialists' management of the relationships with the hosts bureaucracy (Chapter 9); and, (iii) opportunities the specialists had for developing an emancipatory praxis (Chapter 10). Finally, in a concluding section, I offer some critical reflections on the contributions of the thesis and suggest areas for future research...|$|R

40|$|Women's {{groups in}} unions are {{collective}} spaces within which women seek {{to advance their}} concerns and access empowering positions. This paper examines their pursuit of gender equality in unions. The need to explore unions and women's groups is heightened by women's significance {{as a source of}} union membership, and the connection between union revitalization and responsiveness to women. The paper uses case studies of two unions, MSF and USDAW, and seven women's groups. The analysis is structured by a typology of two frameworks: (<b>i)</b> a <b>typology</b> of gendered equality ideas derived from various literatures, and (ii) the dynamic and linked dimensions of Hyman's (1994) union organization model.

40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} tool for analysing time diary data, which not only provide detailed information about frequency and duration of daily activities (e. g. paid work, housework, leisure and rest), but also sequences of these activities. We conduct optimal matching analyses (OM) on “workweek-grid” data from the UK Time Use Survey (2000 - 01) and the French Time Use Survey (1998 - 99). Both surveys provide detailed information about the scheduling of paid work over a week with 15 -minute time slots. A special case of Optimal matching (Dynamic Hamming Matching) with no insertion and deletion operations is used in order to avoid altering the structure and length of workweeks. This variant of OM is applied in two steps. First, we build a typology of workdays by applying OM on the days people worked. Second, based on the typology of workdays, we build a simplified workweek and then a secondary level of empirical <b>typology,</b> <b>i.</b> e., the <b>typology</b> of workweeks.

It probes the limits of more-than-human ethics founded on personal encounters which struggle to cross distance and difference.

Empirical research in community gardens reveals diverse relationships with nonhumans and underlines the importance of attending to qualities of relating. <b>I</b> propose <b>typologies</b> for thinking through more-than-human relationships, organising them according to degree of care.

40|$|The {{ecological}} status classification of aquatic ecosystems requires separate quantification {{of natural and}} anthropogenic sources of environmental variability. A clustering of ecosystems into ecosystem types (<b>i.</b> e. <b>Typology)</b> is used in order to minimise natural variability. Among transitional water quality elements, benthic macroinvertebrates are the most exposed to natural variability patterns due to their life cycles and space-use behavior. Here, we address the {{ecological status}} classification issue for Mediterranean and Black Sea lagoons, using benthic macroinvertebrates, from a set of 12 reference lagoons. Two main classification approaches have been proposed in literature: the a-priori approach, based on standard multimetric indices, and the a-posteriori approach, based on linear mixed models. It may happen that different indices are in disagreement with respect to lagoon classification. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model in which the multimetric indices are jointly modeled through a multivariate normal mixture. Each mixture component is estimated as function of covariates of interest and corresponds to an ecological status. We compare the proposed model with the a-priori and a-posteriori approaches highlighting {{pros and cons of}} each method...|$|R
