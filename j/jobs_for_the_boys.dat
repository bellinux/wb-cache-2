We have a theatre, 18 hole golf course, three swimming pools, PX, etc. It’s actually a city in itself. Reminds one of Grand Central Station.

50|$|The story {{starts out}} in Luna Bay, California in 2007, {{one year before}} the events of Lost Boys: The Tribe. A young child enters into Edgar Frog's {{surfboard}} shop looking to become his next apprentice. He is subjected to a few tests {{in order to determine}} if he is a vampire. After his humanity is established Edgar turns him down and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> mentions training with his brother Alan Frog instead. Edgar tells <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> to be quiet and then starts to tell him a story. The story then leads into a flashback of the Frog Brothers hunting days in Washington, D.C. in 1990. They hunt a series of politicians in a <b>job</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> president. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> expresses skepticism that the president would hire them for such a task, and Edgar tells him how many politicians over the years were vampire slayers. The story then leads into another flashback in the year 1990 where the Frog brothers are returning to their comic book store in Santa Carla. When they arrive they think their parents are dead, and David Powers from the original film appears along with a crew of new vampires.|$|R

Nearly every one's charitable by instinct--only sometimes it's so difficult for a busy man to know exactly when and how to give. I started in one of the big cities, looking up prosperous middle-class families. I'd try to induce them, instead of just writing cheques for institutions and making things for bazaars, to take a personal interest in a family of about the same size as their own who were in a bad way. When they promised, all I had to do was to find the poor family and bring them together, and it was astonishing how much the one could do <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other without undue effort. There were the clothes, of course, and old housekeeping things, odd bits of furniture, food from <b>the</b> kitchen, a <b>job</b> <b>for</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> in <b>the</b> garden, a day's work <b>for</b> one of <b>the</b> girls in the house. I tell you I have lists of hundreds of poor families, who feel now that they have some one to fall back upon, and the richer half of the combination take a tremendous interest in their foster-family, as some of them call it. Sometimes there is trouble, but the world is governed by majorities, and in the majority of cases the thing has turned out excellently." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{its first}} term, the Howard {{government}} hired Australasian Research Strategies (ARS), headed by pollster Mark Textor, to conduct market research for several Commonwealth departments and agencies.
