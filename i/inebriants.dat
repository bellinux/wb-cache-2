50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, several studies {{attempted}} to establish soma as a psychoactive substance. A number of proposals were made, {{including one in}} 1968 by the American banker R. Gordon Wasson, an amateur ethnomycologist, who asserted that soma was an <b>inebriant</b> but not cannabis, and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria, as the likely candidate. Since its introduction in 1968, this theory has gained both detractors and followers in the anthropological literature. Wasson and his co-author, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian uses of the fly-agaric in shamanic ritual.|$|R
50|$|Schultes became {{curator of}} Harvard's Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium in 1953, curator of Economic Botany in 1958, and {{professor}} of biology in 1970. His ever-popular undergraduate course on economic botany was noted for his Victorian demeanor, lectures delivered in a white lab coat, insistence on memorization of systematic botanical names, films depicting native ritual use of plant <b>inebriants,</b> blowpipe demonstrations, and hands-on labs (using plant sources of grain, paper, caffeine, dyes, medicines, and tropical fruits). His composed and kindly persona combined with expressive eye gestures masked his exotic experiences and helped capture {{the imagination of the}} many students he inspired.|$|E
5000|$|Ultimately {{it seems}} that {{psychedelic}}s would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture. Beatnik poets Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs became fascinated by psychedelic drugs {{as early as the}} 1950s as evidenced by The Yage Letters (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred <b>inebriants</b> in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a [...] "complete disorientation of the senses" [...] (to paraphrase Arthur Rimbaud). They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine. LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.|$|E
5000|$|Ernst work on {{narcotics}} is {{his most}} famous and was recently translated into English and publish {{under the name of}} Plant Intoxicants. (...) [...] This {{was one of the first}} books to examine the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of the world’s major stimulants and <b>inebriants.</b> The book includes seventeen chapters : 1) coffee, 2)coffee leaves as a beverage 3) tea, 4) Paraguayan Tea (yerba maté), 5) Guarana, 6) chocolate, 7) Fahan Tea (the orchid Angraecum fragrans Thouars as a source of coumarin), 8) Khat, 9) Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria) opiate derived from the [...] "poison lettuce,"10) thorn apple, 11) coca, 12) opium, 13) Lactucarium 14) hashish, 15) tobacco 16) Betel and Related Substances (Areca catechu, areca nut; Piper siriboa, the betel leaf) and 17) arsenous acid or arsenic trioxide (As2O3). Because of Ernst's early investigation and writing on coffee, he is occasionally referenced in modern coffee literature.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, several studies {{attempted}} to establish soma as a psychotropic substance. A number of proposals were made, included {{an important one}} in 1968 by Robert Gordon Wasson, an amateur mycologist, who (on Vedic evidence) asserted that soma was an <b>inebriant,</b> and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria, as the likely candidate. Wasson and his co-author, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian uses of the fly-agaric in shamanic ritual. Furthermore, the mountainous origin of soma matches the habitat of fly-agaric, and when discussing soma, the Vedas do not mention any part of a flowering tree.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989, in {{a highly}} {{influential}} text, Harry Falk pointed out that both the Flattery and Wasson arguments assumed that haoma was hallucinogenic, although the effect desired by Zoroastrian and Vedic ritual use was not. Falk noted that, in the texts, both haoma and soma were said to enhance alertness and awareness, did not coincide with the consciousness altering effects of an entheogen, and that [...] "there is nothing shamanistic or visionary either in early Vedic or in Old Iranian texts," [...] nor could the small doses administered in living Zoroastrian custom justify its consideration as an <b>inebriant.</b> Living custom also does not give the extract enough time to ferment.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{definitions}} of luxury foods and considers {{the role of}} luxuries in marking social distinction. It is proposed that luxury foods are those foods that offer a refinement in texture, taste, fat content or other quality (such as stimulant or <b>inebriant)</b> and offer distinction, because of either their quantity or quality. Ethnographic research has revealed that an emphasis on quantity of food and elaboration of common staples is found mostly in societies without strong social stratification, while an emphasis on quality and style is characteristic of societies with institutionalized forms of social ranking. In the former context the consumption of luxury foods is used primarily to create or enhance social bonds, in the latter to create or enhance exclusivity and distance. The archaeological recognition of luxury foods is reviewed to demonstrate how archaeology is well placed to add regional breadth and chronological depth {{to the study of}} the changing role and meaning of luxury foods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Summarized are psychonautic bioassays (human self-experiments) of pharmaiiopo {{crystalline}} bufotenine (5 -HO-DMT; 5 -hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine; dimethylserotonine), {{at times}} combined with harmaline or harmine-via intranasal, sublingual, intrarectal, pulmonary (inhaled vapor) and oral routes. This {{is done by}} way of pharmacological modeling of diverse South American shamanic <b>inebriants,</b> principally the snuffs iiopolyopo and cebWhattij, prepared from seeds of Anadenanthera peregrina var. peregrina and A. colubrina var. Cebil, respectively. Psychoptic (visionary) activity of bufotenine has been established and the 1 967 Holmstedt-Lindgren hypothesis of the paricti effect-intranasal potentiation of tryptamines by concomitant administration of monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting (MAO!) P-carbolines from stems of Banisteriopsis caapi admixed with the snuffs-has been confirmed by 25 psychonautic bioassays. Salient phytochemical and psychonautic literature is reviewed, and isolation of bufotenine from Anadenanthera seeds detailed (with one table and eight references).

5000|$|The Cannabis genus {{was first}} {{classified}} using the [...] "modern" [...] system of taxonomic nomenclature by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, who devised the system {{still in use}} for the naming of species. He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named Cannabis sativa L. (L. stands for Linnaeus, and indicates the authority who first named the species). Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. In 1785, noted evolutionary biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck published {{a description of a}} second species of Cannabis, which he named Cannabis indica Lam. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. He described C. indica as having poorer fiber quality than C. sativa, but greater utility as an <b>inebriant.</b> Additional Cannabis species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names Cannabis chinensis Delile, and Cannabis gigantea Delile ex Vilmorin. However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept was still widely accepted, except in the Soviet Union where Cannabis continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name Cannabis indica was listed in various Pharmacopoeias, and was widely used to designate Cannabis suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations.|$|R
