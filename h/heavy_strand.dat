25|$|For human {{mitochondrial}} DNA (and {{probably for}} that of metazoans in general), 100–10,000 separate copies of mtDNA are usually present per somatic cell (egg and sperm cells are exceptions). In mammals, each double-stranded circular mtDNA molecule consists of 15,000–17,000 base pairs. The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their nucleotide content, with a guanine-rich strand {{referred to as the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> (or H-strand) and a cytosine-rich strand referred to as the light strand (or L-strand). The <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> encodes 28 genes, and the light strand encodes 9 genes for a total of 37 genes. Of the 37 genes, 13 are for proteins (polypeptides), 22 are for transfer RNA (tRNA) and two are for the small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The human mitogenome contains overlapping genes (ATP8 and ATP6 as well as ND4L and ND4: see the human mitochondrial genome map), a feature that is rare in animal genomes. The 37-gene pattern is also seen among most metazoans, although in some cases {{one or more of these}} genes is absent and the mtDNA size range is greater.|$|E
40|$|The two {{complementary}} strand {{species of}} 5 -bromodeoxyuridine-substituted, adenovirus-associated virus type 2 (AAV- 2) deoxyribonucleic acid were preparatively separated in CsCl density gradients and further purified by sedimentation through 5 to 20 % sucrose. The base composition of each strand species was determined, {{and it was}} found that the species banding at a greater density in CsCl (<b>heavy</b> <b>strands)</b> had an expected higher thymidine content (26. 5 %) than that 21. 7 %) of the less dense species (light strands). Furthermore, the base composition of in vivo-synthesized, AAV-specific ribonucleic acid was similar to that of light-strand deoxyribonucleic acid, and this ribonucleic acid apparently hybridized only with <b>heavy</b> <b>strands.</b> These observations indicate that the heavy-strand species alone serves as the transcriptional template in vivo. This study represents the first instance in which the base composition and specificity of in vivo transcription have been determined for each of the complementary strands of an animal virus deoxyribonucleic acid...|$|R
40|$|A gene specifying {{tyrosine}} transfer RNA {{has been}} purified and transcribed in vitro. The purification procedure {{made use of}} two specialized transducing phages carrying the tRNA(Tyr) gene of Escherichia coli inserted into their DNA in opposite orientations. The separated <b>heavy</b> <b>strands</b> of the two phages were annealed and the single-stranded tails of the resulting hybrid were removed by digestion with Neurospora endonuclease. The size of the purified double-stranded structures was determined by electron microscopy.

40|$|The {{repair of}} DNA {{containing}} interstrand crosslinks induced by psoralen-plus-light in E. coli cells has been investigated. During a 30 -minute incubation after psoralen-plus-light treatment, crosslinks were excised and the cellular DNA was cut into discrete pieces. The molecular weight of these pieces corresponds to {{about twice the}} single-strand distance between crosslinks, as measured by sedimentation velocity in alkaline sucrose. During further incubation, these DNA fragments were covalently joined into high molecular weight DNA. This joining did not occur in cells carrying a mutation at recA; in these strains the DNA was further degraded to smaller polynucleotides and acid-soluble material. The possibility that repair of crosslinked DNA involves strand exchanges between homologous duplexes was investigated. Cells were grown in 13 C, 15 N-containing medium for several generations, then switched to medium of normal density that also contained [3 H]thymidine for about 0. 5 generation. After the crosslinking treatment, the cells were incubated in medium of normal density in order for repair to occur. The DNA was extracted and centrifuged in alkaline CsCl density gradients, where the light and <b>heavy</b> <b>strands</b> were separated. Molecules of intermediate density that contained 3 H accumulated during repair in wild-type cells, but not in control cells or treated recA- cells. After molecular weight reduction of the intermediate-density DNA, the 3 H could {{be separated from the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>strands,</b> demonstrating that covalent joining between <b>heavy</b> and light <b>strands</b> of homologous duplexes accompanies repair. A mechanism involving sequential excision and genetic recombination is proposed for the repair of DNA containing interstrand crosslinks...|$|R
25|$|When {{transcription}} {{takes place}} on the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> a polycistronic transcript is created. The light strand produces either small transcripts, {{which can be used}} as primers, or one long transcript. The production of primers occurs by processing of light strand transcripts with the Mitochondrial RNase MRP (Mitochondrial RNA Processing). The requirement of transcription to produce primers links the process of transcription to mtDNA replication. Full length transcripts are cut into functional tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA molecules.|$|E

40|$|When alkali-denatured DNA from CELO virus (an avian adenovirus) was {{annealed}} for 15 min at 37 C in 0. 1 M NaCl, 70 % of {{the molecules}} formed single-stranded circles. This is {{probably due to}} base pairing of complementary sequences not more than 110 nucleotides long {{at the ends of}} the single strands and implies an inverted terminal repetition in the duplex DNA similar to that reported for the DNA from human adenoviruses. The circular molecules had a uniform length that was approximately {{the same as that of}} linear single-stranded molecules. The complementary strands of CELO virus DNA were separated on a preparative scale, and at least 40 % of the <b>heavy</b> <b>strands</b> and 56 % of the light strands were found to be intact as judged by the formation of single-stranded circles...|$|R

50|$|Each D-loop {{contains}} an {{origin of replication}} for the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand.</b> Full circular DNA replication is initiated at that origin and replicates in only one direction. The middle strand in the D-loop can be removed and a new one will be synthesized that is not terminated until the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> is fully replicated, or the middle strand {{can serve as a}} primer for the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> replication. As the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> replication reaches the origin of replication for the light strand, a new light strand will be synthesized in the opposite direction as the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand.</b> There is more than one proposed process through which D-loop replication occurs, but in all of the models, these steps are agreed upon. The portions not agreed upon are what is the importance of maintaining a D-loop when replication is not in progress, because it is energetically expensive to the cell, and what mechanisms, during replication, preserve the detached strand of DNA that is waiting to be replicated.|$|E

50|$|In many organisms, one {{strand of}} DNA in the plasmid {{comprises}} heavier nucleotides (relatively more purines: adenine and guanine). This strand {{is called the}} H (<b>heavy)</b> <b>strand.</b> The L (light) strand comprises lighter nucleotides (pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine). Replication begins with replication of the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> starting at the D-loop (also known as the control region). A D-loop is a short portion in circular DNA that has three strands instead of two. The middle strand, which is complementary to the light strand, displaces the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> and forms a displacement loop (D-loop). Circular DNA is stable with this small D-loop and can remain in this formation, but the middle strand, or the displacing strand, is replaced frequently due to its short half-life, and is very energetically expensive to the cell. When diagramed, the resulting structure looks like the letter D. The D-loop was first discovered in 1971 we researchers noticed that many DNA in the mitochondria they were examining under microscope contained a short segment that was tripled stranded.|$|E

5000|$|... == In {{mitochondria}} == Researchers at Caltech {{discovered in}} 1971 that the circular mitochondrial DNA from growing cells included a short segment of three strands which {{they called a}} displacement loop.

Since then, {{it has been shown}} that the third strand is the initial segment generated by a replication of the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> that has been arrested shortly after initiation and is often maintained for some period in that state.The D-loop occurs in the main non-coding area of the mitochondrial DNA molecule, a segment called the control region or D-loop region.|$|E
50|$|Replication of the {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{can occur}} in two different ways, both starting in the D-loop region.One way continues replication of the <b>heavy</b> <b>strand</b> through a substantial part (e.g. two-thirds) of the circular molecule, and then replication of the light strand begins. The more recently reported mode starts at a different origin within the D-loop region and uses coupled-strand replication with simultaneous synthesis of both strands.|$|E

40|$|When {{the nuclear}} DNA of Chinese hamster cells {{grown in the}} {{presence}} of bromo-deoxyuridine for one or less generation is analysed in an alkaline CsCl density gradient, a small fraction of replicated DNA can be found at densities intermediate between those of the light and <b>heavy</b> <b>strands.</b> The labelling pattern of these displaced molecules and their segregation into fully light and heavy fragments after sonication indicate that they are formed by the covalent joining of light and heavy segments. The duplexes giving rise to displaced DNA upon denaturation are mostly found at the position of light-heavy DNA in a neutral gradient; a minor component, however, bands at densities between light-heavy and heavy-heavy DNA. The high degree of renaturability of the former molecules suggests that they contain cross-links between the complementary strands; the latter, on the contrary, are likely to comprise a segment substituted in both strands, which is interpreted as being a heteroduplex resulting from somatic crossing-over between uninemic sister chromatids. Although the frequency of these recombinant-like molecules is increased several-fold after u. v. irradiation, the data do not support any direct implication of these exchanges in a postreplication repair mechanism of the type found in bacteria. © 1975 Academic Press Inc.

40|$|The {{physical}} properties of F-like and I-like R {{factors have been}} {{compared with those of}} the wild-type F factor in Escherichia coli K- 12 unmated cells and after transfer to recipient cells by conjugation. The F-like R factor R 538 - 1 drd was found to have a molecular weight of 49 × 106, whereas the molecular weight of the I-like R factor R 64 drd 11 was 76 × 106. The wild-type F factor, F 1, had a molecular weight of 62 × 106. When conjugation experiments are performed by using donor strains carrying these derepressed F-like or I-like R factors, the transferred deoxyribonucleic acid can be isolated as a covalently closed circle from the recipient cells. This circular deoxyribonucleic acid was characterized by making use of the observation that the complementary strands of these R factors can be separated in a CsCl-poly (U, G) equilibrium gradient. The results of the strand-separation experiments show that only one of the complementary strands of the R factor is transferred from the donor to the recipient. With both the F-like and I-like R factors, this <b>strand</b> is the <b>heavier</b> <b>strand</b> in CsCl-poly (U, G). These results indicate that even though F-like and I-like R factors differ greatly in many properties (phage specificity, size, compatability, etc.), they are transferred by a similar mechanism...|$|R

50|$|The fale is lashed {{and tied}} {{together}} with a plaited sennit rope called afa, handmade from dried coconut fibre. The afa is woven tight in complex patterns around the wooden frame, and binds the entire construction together. Afa is made from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the niu'afa (afa palm). The husks are soaked in fresh water to soften the interfibrous portion. The husks from mature nuts must be soaked from four to five weeks, or perhaps even longer, and very mature fibre is best soaked in salt water, but the green husk from a special variety of coconut is ready in four or five days.Soaking is considered {{to improve the quality}} of the fibre. Old men or women then beat the husk with a mallet on a wooden anvil to separate the fibres, which, after a further washing to remove interfibrous material, are tied together in bundles and dried in the sun. When this stage is completed, the fibres are manufactured into sennit by plaiting, a task usually done by elderly men or matai, and performed at their leisure. This usually involves them seated on the ground rolling the dried fibre strands against their bare thigh by hand, until <b>heavier</b> <b>strands</b> are formed. These long, thin strands are then woven together into a three-ply plait, often in long lengths, that is the finished sennit. The sennit is then coiled in bundles or wound tightly in very neat cylindrical rolls.|$|R

40|$|When DNA is {{extracted}} from Chinese hamster cells {{grown in the}} presence of 5 -bromodeoxyuridine {{from the beginning of the}} S (synthesis) phase until the middle of the first replication round, a significant fraction of total replicated DNA bands at intermediate densities between light-light and light-heavy DNA, in a CsCl gradient. Incomplete bromodeoxyuridine substitution compared with light-heavy DNA justifies the displaced banding of these molecules. Since "intermediate DNA" following alkaline or thermal denaturation gives rise to unsubstituted and fully substituted single strands, its particular density in neutral gradients cannot be ascribed to a uniformly reduced degree of bromodeoxyuridine substitution nor to covalently joined light and <b>heavy</b> <b>strands.</b> The segregation of DNA of intermediate densities into light-light and light-heavy components after shearing suggests that it includes at least one junction between replicated and still unreplicated segments, i. e. one replication fork that may or may not have lost one of its prongs. DNA of intermediate density specifically contains one to two sites sensitive to breakage by Neurospora crassa endonuclease. When a two-minute pulse of tritiated bromodeoxyuridine is given during replication in unlabelled heavy medium, the DNA fragments (mol. wt 35 × 106) containing labelled segments band essentially at intermediate positions and are progressively converted to light-heavy molecules, with increasing duration of chase. The half-life of this pulse-labelled intermediate DNA (about 25 min) is consistent with the proportion of total replicated DNA found at displaced densities (10 to 15 %) and, together with the distribution of the intermediate radioactivity, is compatible with the existence of adjacent growing replicons. If DNA is labelled and extracted during the second replication round {{in the presence of}} bromodeoxyuridine, "intermediate DNA" with similar properties is found between the light-heavy and heavy-heavy peaks. © 1974.
