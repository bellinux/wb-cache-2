40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the factors influencing the resistance upset butt welding process to obtain {{an understanding of the}} metal behaviour and welding process characteristics, so that new automotive steels can be welded with reduced development time and fewer failures in production. In principle the welding process is rather simple, the materials to be joined are clamped between two electrodes and pressed together. Because there is an interface present with a higher resistance than the base material, heat will be generated at the joint position once the welding current and voltage are applied. As soon as the material is warm and soft enough, an extra (upsetting) pressure is applied and a weld is formed. For making wheel rims, after welding, the upset is removed by means of chisels and shear cut- ting the edges of the weld, followed by rolling the remaining material into the rim. After the upset has been removed the wheel rim is cold formed in several steps to its final shape. For the {{purpose of this}} research 2. 0 mm thick S 460 MC and 1. 65 mm thick HR 45 steel were examined at a test welding facility at Fontijne Grotnes BV. Both steels were specially developed for cold forming and deep drawing purposes and have a mainly ferritic microstructure. An initial research into the crack formation in wheel rims during production was performed, proving that there were no hard and crack susceptible microstructures present in the weld area of the researched materials. The idea that the wheel rims crack due to for example to the presence of bainite and martensite was rejected. There were two main types of cracks discovered, large cracks which are formed due to initial misalignment of the sheets, grease and/or oil at the interface during welding and an uneven heat distribution during welding. The other type of cracks were micro-cracks, which originate from notches introduced during the trimming and rolling of the wheel rim edges after welding. A good alignment of the chisels and cutting tools is necessary to minimise the amount of material that is pushed into the wheel rim Because it was not feasible to do welding experiments in a full wheel rim welding machine at a production facility, the Fontijne Holland Welderr was employed, this is a scaled down version of a production welding machine, but without the material feed or post weld handling facilities. During welding it was observed that the weld sample did not heat up evenly, the emitted light at the interface was brighter at some places than at others. Also after welding the oxidation of the joint area showed that there was a non-uniform heating, with warmer and colder areas. This non-uniformity results in non-uniform weld characteristics and weld quality differences over the length of the weld. Tensile tests of samples taken both from the edges and the centre of welded samples showed that the maximum tensile strength can be as high as 95 % of the tensile strength of the base material. However, the strain to failure of the welded samples was only a maximum of 60 % with a 30 % difference between the central test sample and the edge samples. Erichsen testing was also employed to provide an indication of weld quality. Only the centre of samples was tested due to the way the <b>Erichsen</b> <b>tester</b> is constructed. The Erichsen height was upto 85 % of the base material height for the welded samples and it was found that if there are no edge defects present, the Erichsen test is a quick and valid weld quality test. Due to observed non-uniform weld quality and heating of the weld area, the focus of the research shifted to understanding why there was a non-uniformity present. Temperature measurements both by thermal camera and thermocouples showed that there is indeed a non-uniform temperature distribution present during welding over the joint interface. The outer edges of the joint line have higher temperatures than {{the central part of the}} weld. Local difference can be as high as 300 K over just 20 mm distance. Also there are hot spots present at either end of the joint line approximately 10 mm from the edges. These hot spots can give rise to local melting in steels with low melting temperature segregation bands. The causes of the uneven temperature distribution were sought. Employing local current measurements during welding was not possible, however when the welding process is just started and there has been no signifcant heating of the weld sample, it is possible to link the voltage distribution directly to the current density distribution. Measuring voltage distributions is relatively easy, voltage probes were spot welded to the surface of the weld samples and measurements showed that there was a non- uniform voltage distribution present during welding. This non-uniformity had the same distribution as the temperature distribution, low voltages at the places were the temperatures were low and high voltage signals where the temperatures were high. Because the non-uniform voltage distribution was measured for both 1 and 2 -piece samples (samples with and without an interface) it can be concluded that the boundary conditions governed by the welding equipment have a major influence. The influence of the clamping system and the contact surface of the electrodes were researched to determine their its influence on the heating of the weld area. It was shown that the clamping pressure of the samples was not high enough to prevent slip of the samples during welding and that the samples had to be positioned in the centre of the electrodes to minimise non-uniform heating. At the places of the highest local pressure, the contact resistance is the lowest and heating will consequently be slower at those locations. The highest edge temperatures were measured at the far end of the electrodes, where the lowest clamping pressures are expected. To obtain more uniform heating it is necessary to obtain a more uniform current distribution. This can be accomplished by changing the contact interface between the electrode and the sample surface or the interface between the weld samples. Adapting the electrodes has a small influence but will also result in longer welding times due to a decrease in contact surface area (decrease of 10 % results in a 5 % increase in weld time). The interface change can decrease the welding time by up to 20 % due to a local faster initial heating. Unfortunately the change in interface surface resulted in less repeatable welds. Residual stress in the welded samples was also examined. Both samples with the upset present as well as samples where the upset was removed were measured. The samples with the weld present showed tensile stresses at the centre of the joint line, but compressive stresses at the edges of the sample. When the upset was removed the overall stress state of the sheet became more neutral, the compressive and tensile stress peaks become lower. The stress distribution was explained conceptually with the aid of a modified bar model. Modelling with both MS. Marc and ABAQUS was employed in this research to obtain a better understanding of the complex electrical, thermal and mechanical relationships as observed during real experiments. Three different models were developed, a thermal model, a thermo-mechanical model and a local strain model. The local strain model showed that the Erichsen testing method is a valid method for weld quality assessment. The modelled total strain observed during flaring of wheel rims was lower than the modelled and measured strain during Erichsen testing. Both the thermal and thethermo-mechanical models are predictive. The first one is based on input parameters directly coming from measurements during welding experiments. The thermo-mechanical model is based on the temperature dependent material parameters. The initial thermal model was designed to determine if the non-uniform current density distribution, as measured during experiments, could result in a non-uniform heating of the weld area. The model did not include any temperature dependent parameters nor a mechanical coupling. This showed that the non-uniform current input resulted in a non-uniform heating of the sample. By obtaining a more uniform current distribution over the length of the joint area, a more uniform heating can be obtained. It was also indicated that around contaminations at the interface, either conductive or insulating, a locally higher temperature exists. The mechan- ical model is a more realistic model as it includes the upsetting force. The model predicts the formation of the upset when there are misalignments of the sheets during welding. Because this model includes the temperature dependent material parameters, it is possible to predict the residual stresses after welding, which are in qualitative agreement with the measured residual stresses in real welds.

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between draw die and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw die radius. Developing the ability to accurately predict and reduce the potential tool wear during the tool design stage is vital for shortening lead times and reducing production cost. This paper investigates the effects of draw die geometry on the sheet metal tool wear distribution over the draw die radius using numerical and experimental methods. A numerical tool wear model is introduced and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel bend tests are carried out using an <b>Erichsen</b> sheet metal <b>tester</b> to verify the numerical model. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, are numerically investigated, and the wear volume and contact pressure distribution along the radii are determined.

Developing the ability to accurately predict and reduce the potential tool wear during the tool design stage is vital for shortening lead times and reducing production costs. This thesis investigates the influence of draw die geometry on the wear distribution over the draw die radius for AHSS and develops a methodology for optimising the draw die geometry to reduce wear using numerical and experimental methods. Tool wear predictions on automotive sheet metal forming die and recommended protections of the tool surface under the initial production conditions were obtained from AutoForm simulation software. Effects of lubrication coefficients, binder pressure loads and die coating on tool wear distributions were investigated as well. It is concluded that the areas that are most sensitive to tool wear occurs at the locations corresponding to the large gradient of drawing depth. To study the tool wear distributions for more common stamping parts, a numerical tool wear model was developed and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel tests are carried out using an <b>Erichsen</b> sheet metal <b>tester</b> with high pressure prescale films to verify the numerical model results. Comparing the results obtained from the prescale film with {{the results from the}} simulation, it is concluded that the contact pressure distributions indicated by the prescale film are consistent with those from the simulation. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, were numerically investigated using the tool wear model developed, and the contact pressure distribution and tool wear work along the radii were determined. The following conclusions were reached from the investigations: (1) The colour contour of the high contact pressure on the die radius can be divided into three distinct zones of high pressure and tool wear; (2) The dominant zone leading to maximum contact pressure and tool wear severity depends on the geometry of die radius profile under the same material and process conditions; (3) The geometry of draw die radius has a significant influence on the tool wear and standard circular and elliptical curves can lead to the achievement of reduced and uniform contact pressure distribution (wear distribution) along most of zones of the draw die radius arc. The results suggest that to minimise contact pressure and tool wear using this approach it would be necessary to optimise the shape for a particular combination of material type, thickness and forming process. Effects of control parameters, such as blank geometry, punch geometry, deep-drawing process parameters and tool material, on wear behaviour in deep-drawing for various shape of die radius were then investigated to provide guidelines for impacts of these parameters. A specialised software routine was then compiled for optimisation of die radius profiles to minimise and achieve uniform contact pressure (wear distribution) using Python programming language. The routine was fully integrated with Abaqus software and has the following functions: (1) To provide a user-friendly Graphical User Interface for pre-processing data input for users who have less experience and skill; (2) To optimise a die radius profile according to the control parameters that users input. The results obtained are relevant to the issue of reducing the high tool wear in automotive stamping tools by predicting the causes of such tool wear related to tool geometry and process parameters. They provide useful guidelines for enhancing the tool life of sheet metal processing in automotive industry...|$|R
