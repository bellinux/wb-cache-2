[...] Employee headcount rose from 400 in 1872 to 1,000 in the mid-1890s and peaked at 1,500.A new office block was built in 1886, which subsequently housed the drawing office. [...] The adjacent foundry business of Messrs Collis and Stace was purchased in 1895 along with the Pelican Yard. [...] Avelings were now making cement manufacturing machinery (including concrete mixers), lamp posts and girders, the latter of which {{can be seen in the}} roof of the covered slip at Chatham Historic Dockyard. [...] In the same year the company was incorporated as a limited company. In 1899 Avelings turned out [...] "one large road engine per day", paid £70,000 pa in wages locally using [...] "220 lathes and other tools". [...] In common with most engineering works Avelings made a lot of their own machine tools themselves.

He {{received}} his BS from the University of Nebraska in 1951 and his Masters in Public Health from the University of Minnesota in 1955. After he received his BS, {{he worked as a}} sanitarian for the Lancaster County Health Department in Nebraska from 1951 - 52. He then worked for the UMN University Health Service as a housing inspector (1952 - 54) and as an assistant to the public <b>health</b> <b>engineer</b> (1954 - 55). Stauffer then joined the faculty of the UMN School of Public Health, first as a sanitarian and instructor (1955 - 58), then senior sanitarian and assistant professor (1958 - 62), and assistant professor and assistant director (1962 - 66). From 1966 - 68, he was executive secretary of the American College Health Association. In 1970, he returned to the UMN as assistant director of Continuation Medical Education in the College of Medical Sciences and assistant professor of the School of Public Health. In 1970, he was appointed dean of the School of Public Health. He resigned in 1982 to return to the faculty and conduct research. He retired in 1991. Lee Stauffer begins by discussing his background, including his education and employment history. He describes his experiences working for Gaylord Anderson, becoming dean of the UMN School of Public Health, working as a sanitarian, inspecting student housing for the UMN, as assistant to the public <b>health</b> <b>engineer,</b> as a student in the School of Public Health, and as dean of the School of Public Health.

40|$|Inadequate or {{improper}} {{collection and}} disposal of liquid waste leads to pollution of surface and groundwater and pose major threats to public health and community well being. The emergence of big cities and industries has typically demanded centralised collection, treatment and disposal systems for liquid wastes. Most cities in developed countries have reticulated sewerage systems which collect and treat the wastes to acceptable standards. In fact a majority of municipal authorities and public <b>health</b> <b>engineers</b> consider the reticulated sewerage system with a modern high technology treatment system and disposal facility as the only suitable approach to liquid waste for a municipal area. Such systems require continuous and plentiful supply of water {{along with all the}} capital intensive infrastructure necessary for treatment and these conditions are not always easily fulfilled. Developing countries and smaller more isolated communities find the cost of providing such facilities to achieve the necessary public health requirements prohibitively high. In rural and semi-rural and particularly remote areas a centralised system generally costs much more on a per capita basis than a locally based independent system of liquid waste. disposal. In this context there are now a variety of options for wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse. Such systems can produce an effluent quality equal to or better than a conventional treatment plant. The major concern for municipal authorities and public <b>health</b> <b>engineers</b> is to dispose of the waste with minimum nuisance and health problems and at a price that can be managed within capital and recurrent budgets. From {{the point of view of}} a local community there are questions of the affordability of the chosen system for them, but also wider and deeper issues of community development and control over technologies that have the potential to influence the dynamics, form and autonomy of the society into which they are introduced. There are now growing environmental and social pressures to consider all the possibilities for reusing wastes and to begin introducing systems which are of a sustainable nature.
