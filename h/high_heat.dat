5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> loss to the walls.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to <b>high</b> <b>heat,</b> the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study of}} the {{charring}} rate of wood, I determined the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> values (gross heat of combustion) and the chemical composition of samples from four hardwoods and four softwoods. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of wood was correlated with lignin and extractive contents. There was a highly significant linear correlation between the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the extractive-free wood and lignin content. Equations are presented {{that can be used to}} determine the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of extractive-free wood when the Klason lignin content is known. The equations should be useful to those interested in using a variety of species of wood as fuel...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{properties}} are the fundamental parameters {{which are often}} {{required in order to}} choose the suitable technology for the combustion process of a fuel. The fuel property focused in this study was <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value which is the energy content of agricultural waste. An experimental study was carried out to obtain <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of a few waste samples. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value was obtained through calorimetric experiment using a bomb calorimeter. The results indicate that coconut husks has the <b>highest</b> <b>heating</b> value with 21. 3 MJ/kg while paddy straw has the lowest heating value of 15. 6 MJ/kg.

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides a}} novel approach for the determination of water content and <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil from Napier grass {{was used in this}} study. Water content was determined with pH adjustment using a Karl Fischer titration unit. An equation for actual water in the oil was developed and used, and the results were compared with the traditional Karl Fischer method. The oil was found to have between 42 and 64 % moisture under the same pyrolysis condition depending on the properties of the Napier grass prior to the pyrolysis. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the pyrolysis oil was determined using an oil-diesel mixture, and 20 to 25 wt% of the oil in the mixture gave optimum and stable results. A new model was developed for evaluation of <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of dry pyrolysis oil. The dry oil has <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> values in the range between 19 and 26 MJ/kg. The developed protocols and equations may serve as a reliable alternative means for establishing the actual water content and the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of pyrolysis oil...|$|R
5|$|ZnO is a {{relatively}} soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale. Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III-V semiconductors, such as GaN. The <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> capacity and heat conductivity, low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics. ZnO exhibits a very long lived optical phonon E2(low) with a lifetime as high as 133 ps at 10 K.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce <b>high</b> <b>heat,</b> a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{intensified}} {{through the}} night of August19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled eye. At 0100UTC August20, the storm passed 120mi (190km) {{to the south of}} Sea Buoy42056, which recorded a significant wave height of 36ft (11m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> content, and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160mph (260km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210mi (335km) from its first landfall.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the energy recovery potential of lignocellulosic crops as solid biofuel depends on various characteristics. One of the main characteristics in this field is the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value. It {{is defined as the}} amount of heat emitted by the combustion of a fuel, including the heat coming from the condensation of the water vapor. Its value depends on the content of main components of the lignocellulosic crops. Two models predicting the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value have been built based on the content of main components of the following lignocellulosic crops: miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus J. M. Greef & Deuter ex Hodk. & Renvoize), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Jerusalem artichoke (aerial part) (Helianthus tuberosus L.), fiber sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), fiber corn (Zea mays L.) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) [trials made at Libramont (Belgium) in 2007 and 2008 J. The first model predicts the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the lignocellulosic crops based on sum of the products between the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of each component and its amount. The second model predicts the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the lignocellulosic crop based on a multiple linear regression using step by step least mean squares...|$|R

Seven people were killed from a direct result of tornadoes; four in Iowa, two in Kansas, and one in Indiana. Eleven additional people were killed across five states by other weather events including lightning, flash flooding, and straight-line winds. Severe flooding was also reported in much of Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa {{as a result of the}} same thunderstorms, while <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> and humidity affected much of eastern North America; particularly along the eastern seaboard of the United States from New York City to the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean passed {{south of}} Jamaica {{on the evening}} of August 19 and began to intensify again that night. Its eyewall {{replacement}} cycle was thought to be completed. A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August 20, but did not last long. The hurricane, still tracking west-northwest under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered high pressure system to the north, moved over waters with extremely <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> content and began to strengthen once again. The eyewall became even better defined during the day, and, at 8:35pm AST on August 20 (0035 August 21, UTC), Dean restrengthened to a Category 5 hurricane, the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall as a Category5 storm in Quintana Roo's Costa Maya region, 40mi (65km) northeast of the border between Mexico and Belize, and weakened on its way over land, reemerging on the western side of Yucatán as a Category1 storm. Dean regained strength as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico, and made its second landfall as a Category2 storm on August 22, at around 11:30 CDT, near Tecolutla, Veracruz, to the south of Tuxpan, where after it moved westward, losing strength and disintegrating over central Mexico. A small remnant circulation reached the Pacific Ocean, eventually moving northwestward around an anticyclone, roughly parallel to the Mexican coast and finally back inland over the southwestern United States, where it completely dissipated on August 27.|$|E

The physiochemical properties of fuel are important in design of fuel system for compression ignition engine run on diesel,biodiesel or biodiesel blend. The HHV is an important property which characterizes the energy content of a fuel such as solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. The biodiesels were characterized for their physical and main fuel properties including viscosity, density, flash point and <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value. The viscosities of biodiesels were much less than those of pure oils and their HHV’s of approximately 42 MJ/kg were 10 % less than those of petro diesel fuels.
