5|$|Bran and Meera Reed {{are fleeing}} the wights, who {{continue}} to follow them from the cave. Bran, still in his visions, witnesses several events: Jaime Lannister killing King Aerys Targaryen, a dragon flying over the Red Keep, his fall from Winterfell which left him paralyzed, the Night King transforming Craster's last son <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> Walker, the Massacre at Hardhome, Ned Stark's beheading, {{the murder of his}} mother Catelyn and brother Robb in the Red Wedding, and wildfire exploding beneath King's Landing. As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and destroys some of the wights while pulling Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.|$|E
5|$|The show {{focused on}} Arab heritage, like the wedding rituals of {{countries}} in the region, and included Arab poems and songs. Iftah Ya Simsim premiered in Kuwait in September 1979, and was broadcast in all Arabic-speaking countries excluding Egypt. The show's opening consisted of a catchy tune that became beloved of its young viewers. As the song played, the opening footage showed children across the Arab world running past familiar landmarks like the Pyramids and playing in playgrounds and ancient alleyways before running <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> fort that had its gates open wide. The show's set consisted of an intricately traditional Arabian neighborhood called Sharee Eshreen (20th Street).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the ship}} Virginia Maid arrives in England from the New World, {{carrying}} the young Virginia Dare, {{the first child}} born in Roanoke colony, {{as well as her}} hulking, fair-skinned, blond Native American bodyguard Rojhaz. They are taken to meet the Queen only for a vulture-like assassin to snatch Virginia. Rojhaz quickly disables the attacker, but Virginia has transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> gryphon. Rojhaz subdues Virginia, and Stephen Strange bespells her to human form before Fury sees her transformed. She has strange shapeshifting powers, and Strange suspects she is the cause of the disastrous weather. Fury interrogates one of the assassins to learn who sent him. He is told that it is Otto von Doom, ruler of Latveria, but Fury is too late to stop one of Doom's machines from killing Elizabeth with a poison gas released by dropping a pill into aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
25|$|At the contest, the Tolmachevy Sisters {{were joined}} on stage by four backing vocalists: Anna Nilsson, Jenny Tärneberg, Anna Strandberg and Rui Andrade. The Russian {{performance}} featured the Tolmachevy Sisters performing with long translucent sticks and interacting with a platform that moved like a balance and eventually opened <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> sun-like canvas.|$|E

25|$|Rigel, {{also known}} as Beta Orionis, is a B-type blue supergiant that is the sixth {{brightest}} star in the night sky. Similar to Betelgeuse, Rigel is fusing heavy elements in its core and will pass its supergiant stage soon (on an astronomical timescale), either collapsing {{in the case of}} a supernova or shedding its outer layers and turning <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf. It serves as the left foot of Orion, the hunter.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{residing}} at Acland St, St. Kilda, Louise Faulkner {{developed a}} friendship with Corrine Wylde, a neighbour in the same block of flats. On 25 April 1980, Anzac Day in Australia, Louise and Charmian attended a first birthday party for Wylde's son. Faulkner told Wylde {{that she was going}} to visit her boyfriend in Gippsland. The following day, Wylde saw the two Faulkners get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> ute with an older man. This was the last confirmed sighting of either of them. Louise Faulkner was aged 43 and Charmian was two at the time of their disappearance.The only suspect was her lover 60 year old George Sutherland who Louise Faulkner named as Charmian's father.|$|E

25|$|The 10-year-old Kampusch {{left her}} family's {{residence}} in Vienna's Donaustadt district {{on the morning}} of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> minibus by two men, although Kampusch did not report a second man being present. A massive police effort followed in which 776 minivans were examined, including that of her kidnapper, Přiklopil, who lived about half an hour from Vienna by car in the Lower Austrian town of Strasshof an der Nordbahn, near Gänserndorf. Although he stated that {{on the morning of}} the kidnapping he was alone at home, the police were satisfied with his explanation that he was using the minibus to transport rubble from the construction of his home.|$|E
25|$|The first {{coronation}} rite is the purification bath of {{the king}} (พระราชพิธีสรงพระมูรธาภิเษก). On {{the morning of the}} coronation day, the king will arrive at the Amarin Winitchai throne hall in the uniform of a field marshal of the Royal Thai Army. He will first light a candle and make a special offering to the Buddha images inside the hall, and then proceed to the Phaisan Thaksin Hall. After performing a brief prayer (repeating the Five Precepts), and receiving a blessing from the assembled monks inside the hall, at the auspicious time the Chief Brahmin will invite the king to take a ceremonial bath. The king will change <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> robe, symbolic of purity (similar to a monk's Kasaya). Prior to taking the bath, the king will pause at an altar erected in the courtyard to light candles and make offerings to Hindu deities.|$|E
25|$|At ambient {{pressure}} and temperatures above 17°C, tungsten hexafluoride is a colorless diamagnetic gas. The WF6 molecule is octahedral with the symmetry point group of Oh. The W–F bond distances are 183.2 pm. Between 2.3 and 17°C, tungsten hexafluoride condenses into a pale yellow liquid having {{the density of}} 3.44 g/cm3 at 15°C. At 2.3°C it freezes <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> solid having a cubic crystalline structure, the lattice constant of 628 pm and calculated density 3.99 g/cm3. At −9°C this structure transforms into an orthorhombic solid with the lattice constants of a= 960.3 pm, b= 871.3 pm, and c= 504.4 pm, and the density of 4.56 g/cm3. In this phase, the W–F distance is 181 pm, and the mean closest intermolecular contacts are 312 pm. Whereas WF6 gas {{is one of the}} heaviest gases, with the density exceeding that of the heaviest elemental gas radon (9.73 g/L), the density of WF6 in the liquid and solid state is rather moderate.|$|E

25|$|Cinderella finds a gown {{that belongs}} {{to her mother and}} decides to refashion it for the ball, but her step family impedes this by giving her extra chores. Cinderella's animal friends, {{including}} Jaq and Gus, refashion it for her, completing the design with a necklace and sash discarded by Drizella and Anastasia, respectively. When Cinderella comes downstairs wearing the dress, the stepsisters are upset when they realize Cinderella is wearing their accessories, and tear the dress to shreds before leaving for the ball with their mother. A heartbroken Cinderella storms out into the garden in tears, where her Fairy Godmother appears before her. Insisting that Cinderella goes to the ball, the Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, Cinderella's horse, Major, into a coachman, and dog, Bruno, into a footman, before turning Cinderella's ruined dress <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> ball gown and her shoes into glass slippers. As Cinderella leaves for the ball, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will break at the stroke of midnight.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} was Cornelia Tuthill's 1840 novel Virginia Dare, or the Colony of Roanoke, in which Virginia marries a Jamestown settler. Virginia Dare met the Indian princess Pocahontas in E.A.B. Shackleford's 1892 novel Virginia Dare: A Romance of the Sixteenth Century. Virginia Dare was the main {{character}} in Sallie Southall Cotten's 1901 book in verse The White Doe: The Fate of Virginia Dare. In the book, she is turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> doe by an Indian witch doctor after she rejects his advances. When her true love, an Indian warrior, shoots her with a silver arrow, she turns back into a woman just before she dies in his arms. Cotten has asserted, however, that the tale of Dare as the White Doe had survived for some three centuries as part of colonial folklore. In the 1908 novel The Daughter of Virginia Dare, author Mary Virginia Wall made Pocahontas the daughter of Virginia Dare. In Herbert Bouldin Hawes' 1930 novel The Daughter of the Blood, Virginia Dare {{is involved in a}} romantic triangle with John Smith and Pocahontas.|$|E

500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{not having a}} studio {{attached}} before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> character but Atchison felt [...] "it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her." [...] Lionsgate's President of Production Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script, claiming {{that he was the}} only person who could do it because the story [...] "was in his heart and in his mind".|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of a yacht out on water, which then segues to {{an image of the}} Statue of Liberty: the words [...] "Nas" [...] and [...] "The Don" [...] have been {{superimposed}} in mid-air on the left and right-hand sides of the statue respectively. After quickly moving between various images of New York City, Nas is shown sitting at a table at an open-air restaurant with a female, at which point he raps the opening lyrics of the song. Again, the video moves rapidly between images, this time addressing Nas' lifestyle, with shots of sunglasses, jackets and shirts all featured. Shortly following this, Nas is escorted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> Rolls Royce, wearing a white suit. He is then shown standing in a ring of fire set up on the ground, whilst continuing to recite lyrics from the song.|$|E
