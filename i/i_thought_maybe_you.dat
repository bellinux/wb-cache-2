6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{but there}} is always the hope of escape or of exchange. When you spoke kindly to me this {{afternoon}} I partly understood what you said, for in this long time I have been on board I have come to understand a little Spanish, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> would assist me in some way." ...|$|R

Yer honour will excuse me, but it just seemed natural that you should be wishing to send a line; and a sweeter young lady never trod the sod." ...|$|E

In fact, Bonzo drummer John Bonham and I had already started {{discussing}} plans for a hard-driving rock album after that. We both felt that In Through the Out Door was a little soft. I was not really very keen on [...] "All My Love". I was a little worried about the chorus. I could just imagine people doing the wave and all of that. And I thought, That is not us. That is not us. In its place it was fine, but I would not have wanted to pursue that direction in the future.|$|E

I have heard {{something}} of this story before, and {{now that we are}} attacking Wortham Castle, and the earl has sworn to level it to the ground, it is of importance if possible to find out whether any of the secret passages lead beyond the castle, and if so, where. Almost all the castles have, I have been told, an exit by which the garrison can at will make sorties or escape; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> might have heard enough to give us some clue as to the existence of such a passage at Wortham." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{could not}} help smiling at his now {{attentive}} face, and went on: [...] "Some days afterwards I got hold of a newspaper four or six months old, {{and there was a}} description of all that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had seen and felt,--only far more beautiful and touching, as you shall see, for I cut it out of the paper and have kept it. It seemed to me that it must be some personal experience,--as if the writer had followed some dear friend there,--although it was with the unostentation and indefiniteness of true and delicate feeling. It impressed me so much that I went back there twice or thrice, and always seemed to move to the rhythm of that beautiful funeral march--and I am afraid, being a woman, that I wandered around among the graves as though I could find out who it was that had been sung so sweetly, and if it were man or woman. I've got it here," [...] she said, taking a dainty ivory porte-monnaie from her pocket and picking out with two slim finger-tips a folded slip of newspaper; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> might recognize the style of the writer, and perhaps know something of his history. For I believe he has one. There! that is only a part of the article, of course, but it is the part that interested me. Just read from there," [...] she pointed, leaning partly over his shoulder so that her soft breath stirred his hair, [...] "to the end; it isn't long." ...|$|R

"If {{the time}} should come, Harry, when the fortune of war may compel the king {{to retire from}} Oxford--which I trust may never be--I would then grant your request, for after your {{encounter}} with the officer who commanded the Roundheads here, {{it would not be}} safe for you to remain behind. But although you are too young {{to take part in the}} war, I may find you employment. After a council that was held yesterday at Oxford, I learned, from one in the king's secrets, that it was designed to send a messenger to London with papers of importance, and to keep up the communication with the king's friends in that city. There was some debate as to who should be chosen. In London, at the present time, all strangers are closely scrutinized. Every man is suspicious of his neighbor, and it is difficult to find one of sufficient trust whose person is unknown. Then <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> could well fulfill this important mission. A boy would be unsuspected, where a man's every movement would be watched. There is, of course, some danger attending the mission, and sharpness and readiness will be needed. You have shown that you possess these, by the manner in which you made your escape from London, and methinks that, did you offer, your services would be accepted. You would have, of course, to go in disguise, and to accept any situation which might appear conformable to your character and add to your safety." ...|$|R
5000|$|Where {{the hell}} do any of you get off, telling me I sold out? Where do you get off? Where {{do you find the}} nerve, to call me a whore? You think I hate ECW? I love that place. I love that place! But ECW simply didn't love me back. She was like the girl I can't let go off, but the one who makes me sick, upon seeing her. She wanted too much blood, too much of my heart, too much of my life! So I left, and I found fame and fortune in WWE. And Paul Heyman was right. There's only one real {{difference}} between me and Tommy Dreamer. I'm a whore, and he's not. You see, seven years ago, I pulled the sock out of my pants, and made Vince McMahon laugh, and the doors of opportunity open wide for Mick Foley, but not for Tommy Dreamer. All he's got is his heart, his pride and the initials ECW. And I wanted to tell Edge that I went back and I watched our WrestleMania match, the greatest hardcore match of all time, I said. Well the truth is, maybe it wasn't quite as good as <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>Maybe</b> Edge, <b>you</b> and <b>I</b> are gonna have to be tougher than ever, hungrier than ever, sicker than ever, to walk into that steaming cesspool that is the Hammerstein Ballroom. 2,500 sickening, twisted fans, screaming for our blood, because Tommy Dreamer can do everything I can, and maybe with more passion. He's gonna beat us up, all over New York City. He's gonna bludgeon us. Terry Funk, the greatest wrestler I ever saw. You look at Terry Funk and you see an old man, you're not seeing the real Terry Funk. His slaps are worse than most men's punches. His punches dole out concussions, and when he picks up a weapon, he can use it like no man ever has. He has an excruciating pain waking up every single day, looking for one more chance to have one great last match. I blew {{the son of a bitch}} up in Japan, and he came back and hugged me. I set him up on fire in Philadelphia, and he put his arm around me. He doesn't put his arm around me anymore. I don't want your arm around me, Terry Funk. Tommy Dreamer, the only difference between me and you, is I have the guts to go to WWE. (At this point, a fan was audibly heard on the telecast telling Foley to shut up.) No, you shut your mouth! (pointing out to said fan) Because when I go to Hammerstein Ballroom, Edge and I are prepared to take the beatings of our lives, and I will do that to exorcise the sick, twisted whore that is ECW. I want her out of my life. You’ve seen me thrown off cells, you've seen me slammed in tacks, you've seen me go through a burning table at WrestleMania; it is nothing compared to the horrors I will unleash on Dreamer and Funk at (goddamn you) ECW. 'Cause I'm gonna stake the hearts of your heroes, and I'm gonna shove them down their throats for making me fall in love with you to begin with. You stepped on my heart, you stepped on my soul, you took everything I've had faith in, and you just throw it away. And then when I walk to that ring at the Hammerstein Ballroom as a WWE Legend, you Terry Funk and you Tommy Dreamer will learn about loss...Have a nice day. Mick Foley on his kayfabe thoughts on ECW ...|$|R
