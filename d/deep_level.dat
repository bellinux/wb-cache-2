5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> platforms that is not connected to any of the others by <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E

A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, but the original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with the construction of the <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> platforms and Portcullis House, which sits above the station.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, works to complete the electrification of the LNER lines were slowed or halted. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for reconstruction on 11 September 1939. Northern line services were extended from East Finchley to High Barnet on 14 April 1940, and started serving the <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> platforms at Highgate on 19 January 1941, though not all of the new station buildings had been completed. The surface platforms at Highgate continued to be served by LNER steam trains.|$|E

5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main line station itself. With the entrance within the main line station able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E
5|$|During September 12, the {{depression}} continued to develop quickly {{with both the}} JMA and the JTWC reporting that {{the depression}} had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi-wan and the international designation of 0915. During September 13, Choi-wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi-wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day, before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that had wrapped into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye. During September 14, Choi-wan intensified further whilst moving along the southwestern edge of a <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> subtropical ridge of the northeast, intensifying into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1-minute winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E
5|$|The Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B) was a tube railway {{company which}} had been {{purchased}} by the DR in 1898, but had remained a separate financial entity. It had permission to construct a line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus, but had not raised the capital to do so. At South Kensington it was to connect to the <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> line planned by the DR. On 12 September 1901, the DR-controlled board of the B sold the company to the MDETC. In the same month, the B took over the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN), a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park. The routes of the B and GN were subsequently linked and combined with part of the DR's tube route to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP).|$|E

50|$|The Rouffignac {{cave and}} the Villars Cave possess the most {{extensive}} cave system of the Périgord with more than 8 km of underground passageways. There are 10 natural shafts that lead to a <b>deeper</b> <b>level.</b> It is astonishing {{that most of the}} artistic representations nearly always seem to be associated with these dangerous places. So far, a further 4 km of passageways have been explored in this <b>deeper</b> <b>level.</b> Below the <b>deeper</b> <b>level</b> exists a bottom level with a small underground rivulet. Visitors of the cave have to board an electric train that takes them about 2 km into the interior.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway {{as part of}} the companies' extension of the Inner Circle route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between the two parts of the station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E

25|$|An early feature was a laboratory, where {{trials of}} various types of filter were carried out, and {{incoming}} effluent was analysed. Attempts to improve the treatment process proved successful in 1914, when two chemists, Ardern and Lockett, discovered the Activated Sludge Process, which was soon in use worldwide. A second <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> sewer, started in 1911, eventually reached the works in 1928, and {{to cope with the}} increased flows, half of the sewage was fed into a new Activated Sludge plant. Three separate operating systems were installed, so that comparisons on their efficiency could be made. A second Activated Sludge plant was built between 1955 and 1966, and the control system on the first was upgraded between 1970 and 1973.|$|E
25|$|The {{first decade}} of the 20th century saw other {{developments}} at Earl's Court station. On 30 June 1900 The Middle Circle service was withdrawn east of Earl's Court which became the terminus of the service until 31 January 1905 when the service was cut back again to terminate at Addison Road. On 15 December 1906, the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP, now the Piccadilly line) opened between Hammersmith and Finsbury Park serving Earl's Court from platforms in deep tube tunnels constructed beneath the surface station. Unlike at Gloucester Road and South Kensington, other stations served by both the District and Piccadilly lines, a new building to house the lifts to the <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> platforms was not required. Instead space was provided within the existing station shed, near Earls Court Road, and the lifts descended directly to platform level without the need for intermediate stairs below ground.|$|E
25|$|At present Northern Ireland {{still faces}} {{policing}} issues, though {{not to the}} extent of the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police of children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> of mistrust between the youth and the police. Further, Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion, for example only to those who are Catholic. The Northern Ireland Police force has moved away from police brutality given the focus on accountability for the past and the significant decrease {{in the use of the}} baton amongst police members (guns are rarely used) however harassment continues to be a key issue for Northern Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{features}} of the Saint Petersburg Metro make it stand out amongst others, even those in the former USSR. It is customary to have stations in the centre of a city built very deep, not only to minimise disruption, but also, because of the Cold War threat, they were built to double as bomb shelters, and many old stations do feature provisions such as blast doors and air filters. In most cities, the lines become shallow or even begin to run above ground as they reach the city's outer residential districts. However, {{this is not the case}} in Saint Petersburg. The difficult geology means that 56 out of 63 stations are at a <b>deep</b> <b>level.</b> The design and architecture went through numerous phases. The original stations were predominantly of the pylon type, of which there are 15 stations. Also popular was the column layout, and there are 16 such stations in the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} officially {{announced}} on February 19, 2002, when EA revealed that {{although it would}} be multi-platform, it was initially being developed by Stormfront Studios for the PlayStation 2. They revealed that players {{would be able to}} control Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in full 3D environments taken directly from the films. On May 16, EA announced a Game Boy Advance version, developed by Griptonite Games, in which players could control Frodo, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Éowyn. This version would also feature co-op multiplayer through the Game Link Cable. Also on May 16, Ritual Entertainment advertised for staff to work on an unspecified Lord of the Rings game for Windows, to be published by EA. This was presumed to be a port of the PlayStation 2 version. At the E3 event in May 2002, EA made available a brief playable demo of the PlayStation 2 version, featuring gameplay from the final Helm's <b>Deep</b> <b>level,</b> with Aragorn as the playable character. A non-playable demo of the Game Boy Advance version was also made available.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to deal with river pollution, the council created the River Medlock Improvement Committee on 1 April 1863. Such {{problems}} were not limited to Manchester, and two pieces of legislation were introduced nationally to address the issues. The first was the Public Health Act 1875, and the second was the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876. In the following year, the River Medlock Improvement Committee became the Rivers Committee, and proposed a combined drainage scheme {{for the city and}} 15 other authorities with responsibility for the areas around the city. All pulled out of the scheme because of the likely cost, but in 1888, the City of Manchester decided to proceed on its own. Two <b>deep</b> <b>level</b> sewers were authorised, which intercepted the existing sewers before they discharged into the rivers. When the first sewer reached Davyhulme, further progress was impeded by the Manchester Ship Canal, then being built, and the site became the location of the sewage treatment works.
