50|$|Darmera peltata (<b>Indian</b> <b>rhubarb</b> or {{umbrella}} plant) is a flowering plant, {{the only}} species within the genus Darmera {{in the family}} Saxifragaceae. It is a slowly spreading rhizomatous perennial native to mountain streamsides in woodland in the western United States (southwestern Oregon to northwestern California), growing to 2 m tall by 1 m wide. The name Darmera comes after Karl Darmer, a Berlin horticulturist from 19th century.|$|R

50|$|Heracleum maximum, cow parsnip (also {{known as}} <b>Indian</b> celery, <b>Indian</b> <b>rhubarb</b> or pushki) {{is the only}} member of the genus Heracleum native to North America. Its {{classification}} has caused some difficulty, with recent authoritative sources referring to it variously as Heracleum maximum or Heracleum lanatum, or as either a subspecies, H. sphondylium subsp. montanum, or a variety, H. sphondylium var. lanatum, of the common hogweed (H. sphondylium). The classification given here follows ITIS.|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{composition}} of Essiac is unclear, but it reportedly contains burdock (Arctium lappa), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), slippery elm bark (Ulmus rubra), and <b>Indian</b> <b>rhubarb</b> (Rheum officinale) or turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Some formulations may also contain watercress, blessed thistle, red clover, and kelp. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, {{who claimed that}} it had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated. However, this has never been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy, and there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American culture. Several of the plants in the mixture (burdock, sheep sorrel, <b>Indian</b> <b>rhubarb</b> and turkey rhubarb) are not indigenous to the Americas, and were not growing in the wilds of Northern Ontario during the time Caisse began prescribing this tea. The name [...] "Essiac" [...] is Caisse's surname spelled backwards. Today, Essiac is often sold with apparatus (such as bottles and infusers) for making the tea, and is sometimes promoted with untrue claims that scientific studies have shown it to be effective.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, studies on social groups and {{cultural}} influences have helped researchers understand {{the conditions in}} which people confide and withhold personal information. The {{purpose of this study was}} to study self- disclosure with a focus on the difference between <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> and non <b>East</b> <b>Indians.</b> The present study examined whether a sample of 76 second generation <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> Americans living in the United States scored lower than 81 non <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> on the revised Magno Self Disclosure questionnaire. It was also examined if <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> who scored higher on the Suinn Lew Self Identity Acculturation scale would score higher on the Magno Self Disclosure scale. <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> participants did score significantly lower on the measure of self-disclosure than non <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> and <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> who scored higher on the self-disclosure measure scored significantly higher on acculturation to Western United States practices. Results indicate that <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> tend to self-disclose less information than non <b>East</b> <b>Indians,</b> but those who are more acculturated disclose more, indicating their practices more closely follow American groups cultural and social norms...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the release}} of King of Suriname {{presented}} a breakthrough for <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music, it was quite short lived, as few artists managed to succeed Ramdew Chaitoe {{in the years to}} follow. It was not until the 1960s that another Surinamese would catapult <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music onto the scene once again. In 1968, a woman by the name of Dropati debuted with an album of traditional wedding songs, titled, Lets Sing & Dance. Once again, although religious in nature, Dropati's songs, much like those of Ramdew Chaitoe, went on to become huge pop hits within the <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> community. Dropati's epic songs such as [...] "Gowri Pooja" [...] and [...] "Lawa" [...] became such big hits that they firmly secured her name in history as one of the pillars of Indo-Caribbean music (Dropati, 1993). Lets Sing & Dance along with King of Suriname remain two of the best selling <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> albums of all time, even to this day (Ramdew Chaitoe, 1993). The effects of {{the release of}} these two albums were tremendous. Not only did they prove <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music as a legitimate art form, but they also united the <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> of the Caribbean regardless of whether they were Guyanese, Trinidadian, Jamaican or Surinamese. However, these two albums also showed the need for a more popular, non-religious form of <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music, one that would combine the high pitched dholak, dhantal & tassa drum beats with the folk and Hindi lyrics that made Lets Sing & Dance and King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe becoming so popular. http://www.saxakali.com/caribbean/Hemchandra1.htm.|$|R
