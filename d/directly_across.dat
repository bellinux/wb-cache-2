Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> the street from the London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the courthouse building, the public square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> the street.|$|E
5|$|London is a {{regional}} centre {{of health care}} and education, being home to the University of Western Ontario, Fanshawe College, and several hospitals. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, insurance, and information technology. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of Highway 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor (which is <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> the border from Detroit), and Sarnia. It also has an international airport, train and bus station.|$|E

60|$|The trappers {{continued}} down Ogden's River, until they ascertained that it lost {{itself in a}} great swampy lake, to {{which there was no}} apparent discharge. They then struck <b>directly</b> westward, <b>across</b> the great chain of California mountains intervening between these interior plains and the shores of the Pacific.|$|R
5|$|The Elephant Man exhibit was {{moderately}} successful, {{and made}} money {{primarily from the}} sales of the autobiographical pamphlet. Merrick {{was able to put}} his share of the profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own. The shop on Whitechapel Road was <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> the road from the London Hospital, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick. One visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague Frederick Treves.|$|E
5|$|The Toward 2016 Strategic Plan {{prescribed}} {{a complete}} reconfiguration of the Lincoln Center campus, {{to be completed}} by 2032. The first phase of the project, including renovations of the Lowenstein Building as well as a new Law School building and residence hall designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, were completed in 2014. In 2014, Fordham University had purchased a building at 45 Columbus Avenue and incorporated it in its Lincoln Center campus. The nine-story building is <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> from the former Law School building. Fordham University at Lincoln Center also shares a parking lot with New York Institute of Technology {{across the street from the}} Lincoln Center campus.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies {{occurs in}} the western and central parts of the winter range, although some birds occur as far east as Kenya. S. b. woodwardi winters in eastern and southern Africa. Movements in Africa are poorly known, although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years. There are {{only a handful of}} records of birds recorded in Europe in winter, from Corsica, the UK and Ireland. Spring migration routes are poorly known, but appear to lie more <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> the Mediterranean. This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iceland, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, Yemen, Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Madeira.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Michigan Central Depot, {{from which}} the area took its name, no longer stands, but it was between the northeast {{side of the tracks}} and the west side of River Street, <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> from the freighthouse, since replaced by a parking lot. The freighthouse, built in 1878, does still stand, and the area immediately around the freighthouse is home to the Depot Town Farmers' Market, one of two farmers' markets in Ypsilanti.

Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4° {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (or over) the Sun at inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun at or near one of its nodes—the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)—and appears to pass <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4°, Venus can be as far as 9.6° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E
