2500|$|The panellists play as {{individuals}} or as two teams. [...] "Celebrity What's My Line?" [...] completely destroyed {{the intent of}} the original— for players to guess the occupation of a third party by asking yes/no questions. The I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue version once employed the famous actress (and fan of the show) Dame Judi Dench in this role and the renowned television gardener Alan Titchmarsh. Each began by performing a mime illustrating their occupation, giving a cryptic clue to the panel (appearing to a radio listener as a short silence punctuated by <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> the panel and laughter from the studio audience), before fielding apparently serious questions from the teams (e.g. [...] "Is that your own hair?" [...] or [...] "Do you kill people for money?"), who pretended not to know who they were.|$|E
2500|$|An immense mass {{of people}} {{assembled}} in the Free Trade Hall [...] on the 16 September 1876, to hear a lecture from Mr. John O'Connor Power, MP, on a non-political subject. The chair was taken by Mr. J. G. Biggar, MP. On rising to introduce the lecturer, he soon discerned that trouble was impending, that there was, so to say, [...] "a storm in the offing." [...] An [...] "Advanced" [...] person, a Mr. Flesh of Ramsbottom, came on the Platform and informed him that {{at a meeting of}} Nationalists held on the previous evening, it was decided that the lecture might be allowed to proceed only on the condition that the lecturer should first answer satisfactorily a series of questions which had been drawn up for him. The main purpose of those interrogatories was to ascertain whether he held and was prepared to support the principles of Wolfe Tone, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and Robert Emmet. The chairman said those questions were not in order, as the lecture was to be on a non-political subject; however, he would leave it to the lecturer to deal with the queries as he thought fit, Mr. O'Connor Power then came to the front and said, amidst much noise, that with regard to the questions that had been read, his view was identical with that of the chairman. He begged leave to point out – He could say no more: the platform was rushed; there was a smashing of chairs and tables, a noise of heavy blows, and of fierce <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> men engaged in close combat, mingled with the shouts and screams of women, while blood flowed freely from many wounded persons ... The subject of Mr. O'Connor Power's intended lecture was [...] "Irish Wit and Humour".|$|E

60|$|There were <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> {{the others}} {{standing}} {{round in the}} snow, but Kermode glanced at Ferguson. His face grew darkly red, but with an effort he controlled his anger.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> {{one of the}} men {{diverted}} the attention of the others.|$|R

60|$|Such {{were the}} <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> the three Rover boys after {{listening}} to Bill Dangler's declaration that the lad who had run away from Putnam Hall was the nephew of Merrick.|$|E
60|$|As Dick Rover {{ran into}} the {{farmhouse}} he heard a slight scream coming from the sitting-room. The scream was followed by <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> two men, and then a wild thumping as if someone was hitting {{the floor with a}} cane.|$|E
60|$|He {{rushed to}} the door and tore it open. There was a startled <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> the {{darkness}} outside.|$|R
60|$|But a hasty <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> Kate {{stopped her}} {{abruptly}} in her conjectures, and Ralph Nickleby {{walked into the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Crocker {{left the}} room. Bayliss, {{preparing}} {{to follow her}} example, was arrested by an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> the table.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} a brief silence. The clamour of <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> the little groups of people still filled the air outside. They could hear cars coming and going. The man whom Hunterleys and Mr. Grex were tying up was still groaning and cursing.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> Dora, Grace and Nellie, as all rushed forward {{to where the}} boys were {{alighting}} from the Dartaway.

60|$|There {{were many}} {{surprised}} <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> the bystanders, and, glancing at that beautiful girl, {{who was standing}} near with the others, I found her dark eyes fixed on my face {{with an expression of}} tenderness and sympathy in them that sent the blood rushing to my heart.|$|E

60|$|He turned immediately, {{with his}} cap in his hand, and followed. In the hall he pricked up his ears {{as he took}} the mandoline from the chest. He could hear the stifled cries and <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> Mrs. Tuke. At the same moment the door of the study opened, and the musician, a burly fellow with troubled hair, came out.|$|E
60|$|He heard excited <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> the {{quarters}} of the soldiers and he heard men running in his direction.
