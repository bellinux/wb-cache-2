He is driven from his home to his offices in parliament in an armored police vehicle, and wears a bulletproof vest. His office is located in the most isolated corner of the Dutch Parliament building, and was chosen because potential terrorists can get to it through only one corridor, making it easier for his bodyguards to repel an attack. He is married to Krisztina Wilders (née Marfai), a former diplomat of Hungarian origin, with whom he can only meet about once every week due to security concerns. The restrictions on his life because of this, he said, are [...] "a situation that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy".|$|E

500|$|Willy Loman is {{an aging}} {{suburban}} Brooklyn, New York salesman whose less than spectacular career {{is on the}} decline. He has lost the youthful verve of his past and his camaraderie has faded away. His business knowledge is still at its peak, but without his youth and heartiness, {{he is no longer}} able to leverage his personality to get by. [...] Time has caught up with him. The play presents Loman's struggle [...] "to maintain a foothold in the upward-striving American middle class" [...] while combating his own self-doubt that plagues him in reminders from the past that his life rests on unsolid ground. According to Charles Isherwood, Loman is the play's dominant character because [...] "It is his losing battle against spiritual and economic defeat that provides the narrative spine of the play." [...] Loman is a symbolic representation of millions of white collar employees who outlived their corporate usefulness. <b>He</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world with delusions about how popular, famous, influential and successful he is and about the prospects for the success of his sons. His wife not only allows these delusions, but also she buys into them, somewhat. His misplaced values of importance and popularity were shaken to the core by his declining ability to leverage those self-perceived traits successfully as he grew older.|$|E
