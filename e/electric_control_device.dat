Recently, it is well-known that Orbital drilling, which is also called Circular milling, Planetary drilling or Spiral drilling, is superior to conventional drilling for hole making of CFRP/TiAl 6 V 4 stacks. The author newly developed hole making machine based on Double Eccentric Mechanism so that a cutting tool driven by one built-in air motor can rotate clockwise on its own axis at high speed, simultaneously can revolve counter-clockwise on eccentric axis at low speed (Yagishita, 2012). The driving mechanism of the machine is entirely different in that respect both high speed rotation and low speed revolution of cutting tool can be created by one built-in air motor from Novator's mechanism (PCT/SE 2008 / 050719) which needs two driving sources. The {{purpose of this paper is}} that by replacing a built-in air motor used in the previous hole making machine with a built-in AC motor it is achieved to lighten the weight of the machine and also to be handy by applying <b>electric</b> <b>control</b> <b>device.</b> After that hole making tests are executed to CFRP/TiAl 6 V 4 stacks by using a new type cemented carbide endmill having 6 blades...|$|E

It {{is important to have}} a good control of the roasting process in order to obtain a high quality final beverage. In this work a numerical model, based on a 3 D digitized geometry, able to describe the heat and moisture transfer inside a coffee bean during the roasting process, was developed. The model makes reference to a rotating cylinder roaster in natural convection conditions. For the multiphysics model development heat and mass transfer equations inside the coffee bean were numerically solved using a finite element technique. To validate the numerical model, green coffee bean was singularly roasted using a rotating drum roasters prototype. The calculated moisture concentration and time-temperature curves were then compared with the observed data. The calculated temperature values, in the centre of the bean, appear to be in good agreement with those measured inserting thermocouples into the coffee bean (RMSE 6 °C). Similarly the calculated volume averaged moisture was in good agreement with the experimental data (RMSE 265 mol/m 3) over the entire time span.

40|$|Multiferroic materials, {{in which}} {{ferroelectric}} and magnetic ordering coexist, are of fundamental {{interest for the}} development of novel memory devices that allow for electrical writing and non-destructive magnetic readout operation. The great challenge is to create room temperature multiferroic materials with strongly coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) orderings. BiFeO 3 has been the most heavily investigated single-phase multiferroic to date due to the coexistence of its magnetic order and ferroelectric order at room temperature. However, there is no net magnetic moment in the cycloidal (antiferromagnetic-like) magnetic state of bulk BiFeO 3, which severely limits its realistic applications in <b>electric</b> field <b>controlled</b> spintronic <b>devices.</b> Here, we predict that double perovskite Zn 2 FeOsO 6 is a new multiferroic with properties superior to BiFeO 3. First, there are strong ferroelectricity and strong ferrimagnetism at room temperature in Zn 2 FeOsO 6. Second, the easy-plane of the spontaneous magnetization can be switched by an external electric field, evidencing the strong magnetoelectric coupling existing in this system. Our results suggest that ferrimagnetic 3 d- 5 d double perovskite may therefore be used to achieve voltage control of magnetism in future spintronic devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{preservation}} and manipulation of a spin state mainly {{depends on the}} strength of the spin-orbit interaction. For pristine graphene, the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is only in the order of few ueV, which makes it almost impossible to be used as an active element in future <b>electric</b> field <b>controlled</b> spintronics <b>devices.</b> This stimulates the development of a systematic method for extrinsically enhancing the SOC of graphene. In this letter, we study the strength of SOC in weakly fluorinated graphene devices. We observe high non-local signals even without applying any external magnetic field. The magnitude of the signal increases with increasing fluorine adatom coverage. From the length dependence of the non-local transport measurements, we obtain SOC values of ~ 5. 1 meV and ~ 9. 1 meV for the devices with ~ 0. 005 % and ~ 0. 06 % fluorination, respectively. Such a large enhancement, together with the high charge mobility of fluorinated samples (u~ 4300 cm 2 /Vs - 2700 cm 2 /Vs), enables the detection of the spin Hall effect even at room temperature.
