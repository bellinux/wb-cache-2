5000|$|A {{simpler and}} more {{qualitative}} way of determining dangling bond energy levels is with Harrison diagrams. Metals have non-directional bonding {{and a small}} Debye length which, due to their charged nature, makes dangling bonds inconsequential if they can even be considered to exist. Semiconductors are dielectrics so electrons can feel and become trapped at defect energy states. The energy levels of these states {{are determined by the}} atoms that make up the solid. Figure 1 shows the Harisson diagram for the <b>elemental</b> <b>semiconductor</b> Si. From left to right, s-orbital and p-orbital hybridization promotes sp3 bonding which, when multiple sp3 Si-Si dimers are combined to form a solid, defines the conduction and valence bands. If a vacancy were to exist, such as those on each atom at the solid/vacuum interface, it would result in at least one broken sp3 bond which has an energy equal to that of single self hybridized Si atoms as shown in Figure 1. This energy corresponds to roughly the middle of the bandgap of Si, ~0.55eV above the valence band. Certainly this is the most ideal case whereas the situation would be different if bond passivation (see below) and surface reconstruction, for example, were to occur. Experimentally, the energies of these states can be determined using absorption spectroscopy or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, for example, if instrument sensitivity and/or defect density are high enough.|$|E

As an <b>elemental</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> porous silicon is a unique example {{of this type of}} material whose biocompatibility and biodegradability lend it great potential value to biomedical applications [2]. The complementary morphology of hollow silicon nanotubes (SiNTs) also provides opportunities in areas such as battery technology, photovoltaics, as well as drug delivery. SiNTs are tunable in their inner diameter as well as in their wall-thicknesses [3]. They provide a uniform structure compared to the dendritic pore growth of porous silicon in the target porous regime (30 to 90 Â nm pore diameter), and therefore, such structures are attractive for infiltration with nanoparticles or molecules (e.g., superparamagnetic (SPM) iron oxide nanoparticles of the form Fe 3 O 4). In terms of possible candidates for loading, superparamagnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (NPs) also offer a low toxicity and thus can be applied to diverse uses in biomedicine, e.g., for hyperthermia, NMR imaging, and functionalization with anti-cancer agents [4].|$|E

Metal alloy catalysts permitted a greater inclusion of Sn in Ge nanowires compared with conventional Au catalysts, when used during vapour-liquid-solid growth. The addition of an annealing step close to the Ge-Sn eutectic temperature (230 [thinsp][deg]C) during cool-down, further facilitated the excessive dissolution of Sn in the nanowires. Sn was distributed throughout the Ge nanowire lattice with no metallic Sn segregation or precipitation at the surface or within the bulk of the nanowires.

40|$|Using the {{advanced}} technology developed {{to visualize the}} melt-solid interface in low Prandtl number materials, crystal growth rates and interface shapes have been measured in germanium and lead tin telluride semiconductors grown in vertical Bridgman furnaces. The experimental importance of using in-situ, real time observations to determine interface shapes, to measure crystal growth rates, and to improve furnace and ampoule designs is demonstrated. The interface shapes observed in-situ, in real-time were verified by quenching and mechanically induced interface demarcation, and they were also confirmed using machined models to ascertain the absence of geometric distortions. Interface shapes depended upon the interface position in the furnace insulation zone, varied {{with the nature of}} the crystal being grown, and were dependent on the extent of transition zones at the ends of the ampoule. Actual growth rates varied significantly from the constant translation rate in response to the thermophysical properties of the crystal and its melt and the thermal conditions existing in the furnace at the interface. In the <b>elemental</b> <b>semiconductor</b> germanium the observed rates of crystal growth exceeded the imposed translation rate, but in the compound semiconductor lead tin telluride the observed rates of growth were less than the translation rate.

A new three-beam pump-probe technique is used to study interband recombination in various narrow gap systems. Studies of PbSe show that the lead salts have the lowest Auger coefficient of any <b>elemental</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Room temperature measurements in In_ 1 _-_xGa_xSb alloys (x = 0 - 0. 2) give excellent agreement with analytical approximations for non-radiative and radiative mechanisms showing a decrease of Auger coefficient with increasing energy gap. Order of magnitude Auger suppression is observed in type-II ''W'' laser structures compared to type-I III-V semiconductors with the same energy gap. Double resonance measurements of self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots allow determination of confinement energies of both electrons and holes in the neutral dots and show that inhomogeneous broadening of the photoluminescence cannot be attributed solely to size or potential fluctuation. Measurements on annealed samples show improved results with reduced linewidth confirming that the large inhomogeneity is due to In composition fluctuations within the dots. The effects of reduced dimensionality on carrier lifetimes in Landau quantised PbTe and InAs/AlSb are studied using saturation cyclotron resonance and pump-probe techniques. Results show enhanced carrier lifetimes due to suppression of LO-phonon scattering in low dimensional structures of PbTe for photon energies greater than the optical phonon energy. For InAs/AlSb, in tile regime where the photon energy is {{less than that of}} the optical phonon, a bottleneck in the LO-phonon cooling of carriers is observed away from resonance, independent of temperature between 4 and 80 K. Finally, direct measurement of Shockley-Read recombination rate and trap density (N_T 5 x 10 " 1 " 4 cm"-" 3) is made on unbiased non-equilibrium InSb detector structures.

40|$|Irradiation-induced pattern {{formation}} has {{the potential}} to become a cost-effective method for rapid fabrication of large-area nanostructures. However, on <b>elemental</b> <b>semiconductor</b> surfaces, ion-induced formation of nanostructures such as nanodots and nanorods (NRs) occurs only in the presence of impurities. Alternatively, the surface stoichiometry of III-V compounds is easily modified by ion irradiation, thereby enabling self-organization of nanostructures via a balance between preferential sputtering and ion-enhanced diffusion. In this thesis, several approaches to focused ion beam (FIB) -induced formation of nanostructures, including Ga droplets, InSb ripples, and InSb NRs, were examined, and new insights into their formation were revealed. 	To separately examine Ga droplet formation and coarsening, Ga droplets were fabricated by FIB irradiation of GaAs substrates with and without pre-patterned holes. We determined the droplet growth rate and size distribution as a function of FIB energy. The data suggest a droplet formation mechanism that involves Ga precipitation from a Ga-rich layer, followed by droplet coarsening via a combination of diffusion and Ostwald ripening or coalescence via droplet migration. To investigate the formation and evolution of ripples on FIB irradiated InSb surfaces, the influence of the local beam incidence angle (theta effective) by varying the distance between beam spots and/or the dwell time was examined. With increasing theta effective, the surface morphology evolves from pits to ripples to featureless surfaces. Continued irradiation of the rippled surfaces leads to island formation on the ripple crests, followed by NR growth. This ripple-nanorod transition, triggered by preferential sputtering and island-induced-self-shielding, provides a new approach for producing dense arrays of NRs. 	The formation and evolution of irradiation-induced NRs were examined through a comparison of FIB irradiation of InSb wafers and InSb/GaAs heterostructures. Above a critical ion dose, cone-shaped NRs capped with In islands form on both InSb surfaces. For InSb wafers, the NR base diameter increases with ion energy. In the case of InSb/GaAs heterostructures, as the milled depth approaches the InSb/GaAs interface, the cone-shaped NRs transition to capless NRs with a truncated cone shape. These results suggest a growth mechanism in which both the NR cap and body are supplied by redeposition of sputtered atoms...|$|E
