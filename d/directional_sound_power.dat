50|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>Sound</b> {{refers to}} the notion of using various devices to create fields of sound which spread less than most (small) {{traditional}} loudspeakers. Several techniques are available to accomplish this, and each has its benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, choosing a <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> device depends greatly on the environment in which it is deployed as well as the content that will be reproduced. Keeping these factors in mind will yield the best results through any evaluation of <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> technologies.|$|R

In this paper, we consider sound field control for two listeners. First, PP is extended to create spatial audio for two listeners consuming the same spatial audio content. Then, PC is used to create highly <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> and cancel interfering audio. Simulation results compare PP and PC against pressure matching (PM) solutions. For multiple listeners listening to the same content, PP creates <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> at lower effort than the PM counterpart. When listeners consume different audio, PC produces greater acoustic contrast than PM, with excellent directional control except for frequencies where grating lobes generate problematic interference patterns...|$|R

40|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>sound</b> {{can be used}} as {{a warning}} signal to denote that failure to follow an {{indicated}} action could result in serious accidents. In some applications such as to alert a vehicle that is likely to intrude into a highway construction work zone, long distance auditory warnings are necessary. In such cases, directed sound could be utilized to warn the specific vehicle without disturbing other vehicles on the highway. This report reviews the currently available scientific technologies that can potentially be used to develop a long distance auditory warning system for highway work zone applications. Of these, ultrasound based parameter arrays and time delay controlled arrays of compact ordinary speakers are taken up for detailed analysis and experimental evaluation. An ultrasound based parametric array is the most appropriate technology for generating highly <b>directional</b> <b>sound.</b> However, if cost, installation, maintenance, and price are considered, the most suitable technology is found to be arrays of flat panel loudspeakers with time delay control.

40|$|The legally {{prescribed}} {{noise limits}} for heavy goods vehicles {{have been reduced}} considerably in recent years. In many cases, noise abatement steps taken to comply with these limits entail screening and encapsulation measures. These are generally based on the 'open tubes' principle, which may result in highly <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> radiation {{to the front and}} rear, conferring advantages in the relevant measuring procedure as compared to the total radiated sound energy. A research project commissioned by the Federal Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt) was aimed at establishing the extent to which this effect actually occurs. Apart form noise measurements according to the homologation test method or to Annex XXI of Paragraph 49 StVZO (criteria for low-noise lorries), tests performed on a random sample of lorries, mainly comprising encapsulated vehicles, included measurements of the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level using the hemispherical enveloping surface method which is, for example, compulsory under the relevant EC directives for construction machines. The studies covered both driving and stationary noise measurements. Results showed that, in principle, <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> measurements of faster-moving sources like the lorries can be carried out with acceptable effort. There were, however, no significant differences in the noise rankings of the vehicles as determined by the two methods, so that the measuring effort as compared to the drive-by procedure appeared to be unjustified.

40|$|Individualised head-related {{transfer}} functions (HRTFs) {{have been}} shown to accurately simulate forward and backward <b>directional</b> <b>sounds.</b> This study explores directional simulation for non-individualised HRTFs by determining orthogonal HRTFs for listeners to choose between. Using spectral features previously shown to aid forward-backward differentiation, 196 non-individualised HRTFs were clustered into six orthogonal groups and the centre HRTF of each group was selected as representative. An experiment with 15 listeners was conducted to evaluate the benefits of choosing between six centre-front and six centre-back <b>directional</b> <b>sounds</b> rather than the single front/back sounds produced by MIT-KEMAR HRTFs. Sound localisation error was significantly reduced by 22 % and 65 % of listeners reduced their front-back confusion rates. The significant reduction was maintained when the number of HRTFs was reduced from six to five. This represents a preliminary success in bridging the gap between individual and non-individual HRTFs for applications such as spatial surround sound systems. Statement of Relevance: Due to different pinna shapes, <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> stimuli generated by non-individualised HRTFs suffer from serious front-back confusion. The reported work demonstrates a way to reduce front-back confusion for centre-back sounds generated from non-individualised HRTFs. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R

The operation of <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> sensor {{is based on}} the hearing organ of Ormia ochracea fly, which uses coupled bars hinged at the center to achieve the <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> sensing. The MEMS sensor design considered in this thesis is fabricated using a process by which the sensor has two resonant vibrational modes: rocking and bending. The sensor is simulated using finite element analysis and tested by actuating the sensor using a sound stimulus. An analysis is undertaken to describe, in mathematical terms, the relationship between the sensor's amplitude of vibration and various parameters such as the angle of incidence, frequency and the intensity of sound. The experimentally-observed vibrational frequencies are found to be in good agreement with the simulated data, which supports the use of the simulation in future sensor development. The observed amplitudes of vibration are significantly greater than those of sensors fabricated with the process used in previous studies. The relationship between the amplitude of vibration and the incident angle are found to agree with the theoretical predictions. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} fabricate miniature sound sensors that mimic the fly's hearing system. [URL] Navy author...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Directional</b> <b>sounds</b> {{simulated}} using nonindividualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) often {{result in}} front-back confusion. Objective: This {{study was designed}} to examine how manipulating these nonindividualized HRTF spectra can reduce front-back confusion in headphone-simulated <b>directional</b> <b>sounds.</b> Method: HRTFs of six ear-level directions were studied (angles of 0 Â°, 45 Â°, 135 Â°, 180 Â°, 225 Â°, and 315 Â°). The HRTF gains in each of six frequency bands (200 to 690 Hz, 690 to 2400 Hz, 2400 to 6500 Hz, 6500 to 10000 Hz, 10000 to 14000 Hz, and 14000 to 22000 Hz) were amplified or attenuated by 0, 12, or 18 dB. Each manipulated HRTF generated a <b>directional</b> <b>sound</b> stimulus. For this study, 32 participants were invited to localize the randomly ordered stimuli. Results: The results indicate that a 12 - or 18 -dB manipulation of five of the six frequency bands produced significantly better directional accuracy, with significantly less front-back confusion. A reduction of up to 70 % in localization error was obtained, along with 66 % less front-back confusion. Significant interactions were found between the manipulation level and frequency. Conclusion: A 12 -dB spectral manipulation of selected HRTF frequency bands produces better directional accuracy. Application: The results of this research could be applied to the development of tunable nonindividualized HRTFs for audio products. Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of a {{monopole}} source in free space is well known, {{and it is}} also known that the radiating <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> is not only determined by the source itself, but also the immediate environment surrounding the source. In this paper, a hybrid finite element method is used to study the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiating from a {{monopole source}} placed close to a pipe discontinuity. It is found that while the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of a monopole source in free space increases as frequency squared, the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated from the same source in a cylindrical pipe is constant in the plane wave region. A sharp increase in <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> is then seen to occur when the first high-order mode cuts on; <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> is then seen to decrease as a function of frequency until the second high-order mode cuts on, and so on. It is also found that a wave reflected by a discontinuity placed close {{to one side of the}} source will interact with a wave on the other side travelling away from the source.
