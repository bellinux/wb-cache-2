Bede {{was familiar with}} pagan authors such as Virgil, {{but it was not}} considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in De schematibus... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry <b>for</b> <b>examples.</b>|$|E
