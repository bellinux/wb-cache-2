5000|$|Software {{engineers}} Greg Duffy and Aamir Virani founded Dropcam in 2009. Duffy {{served as}} Dropcam’s CEO and Virani served as COO. They originally developed software for cameras made by Swedish company AXIS. Wanting {{to develop a}} less expensive camera, the two companies parted ways and Dropcam began producing its own cameras that primarily provide video monitoring for homes and small businesses. [...] Duffy and Virani credit Duffy’s dad with {{at least part of}} the inspiration for Dropcam. He wanted to identify the neighbor who was letting their <b>dog</b> <b>poop</b> on his lawn but they were having trouble finding a security camera that made it easy to record, stream and monitor large amounts of data.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1993, Roth {{was arrested}} in New York City's Washington Square Park for buying what he {{described}} as [...] "$10 worth of Jamaican bunk reefer" [...] from an undercover police officer. The arrest made headlines and became a late-night television punch-line. When asked by Howard Stern whether the bust was a publicity stunt, Roth said, [...] "Howard, in New York City this small of a bust is a $35 traffic citation. It literally says 'Buick, Chevy, Other'. Your <b>dog</b> <b>poops</b> on the sidewalk, it's $50. If I was looking for publicity, I would have pooped on the sidewalk." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Houbraken {{he was a}} {{colleague}} and {{the same age as}} the flower painter Abraham Mignon - he painted flowers on satin in his studio in Amsterdam. [...] He was assisted by his wife, a painter whom he had married while living in England.She was near-sighted and a poor housekeeper and their household included a <b>dog</b> that <b>pooped</b> on the floor, which did not go unnoticed by their patrons.Husband and wife both worked at their easels smoking a pipe. Their material of choice was satin rather than canvas, which may be the reason that no works have survived.Though they painted generally on satin, this had an extraordinary effect. Ducart died in 1727, aged 67.|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to a human’s best friend it seems Western {{societies}} {{turn a blind eye to}} practices that fail to meet their usually high standards of everyday hygiene. This chapter will explore practices related to canine excrement and the micro-interactionist strategies deployed by dog owners and non-owners to cope with it. We present here the results of our own observations of the habitual behavior of dog-walkers at various times of the day in various settings, mainly in Germany and Portugal – the authors’ respective countries of residence – but also report on similar observations made in Poland, France, Belgium, Britain, and Japan. Our account is also based on our own experiences of dog walking and engaging in the removal of excrement. We draw additionally on a number of informal conversations with dog owners and non-owners on such topics, including the techniques used to deal with excrement, as well as reports and discussions published online. In thus exploring the ways dog waste is removed, we try and solve the riddle of why, in some cases, even when action has been taken to clean it up, plastic bags filled with dog droppings have been thrown onto the ground in certain carefully selected spots or even hung up in trees or displayed on fence posts or railings. The chapter will present inquiries into micro-forms of interactional behavior and <b>dog</b> walking and <b>pooping</b> practices. Some of these strategies will be accounted for as qualitatively new forms of what Erving Goffman (1971) once referred to as civil inattention. Thus, we explore the logic of civil inattention by focusing on what might be called “poop on display. ”info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{takes place}} in the summer of 1941, after the events of A Christmas Story, which took place in December 1940. It has several plot lines, one each for Ralphie, his father, and his mother, {{followed}} by one involving him and his dad on a fishing trip. His quest for most of the film is to find a top tough enough to knock that of a bully's out of a chalk circle in a game of [...] "Kill". Meanwhile, his dad has a series of skirmishes with his hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, and all forty-three Bloodhounds named Big Red. He calls in Barkley, the family dog, to distract the Bumpuses' hounds when he comes home from work. When he gets out of the car, he accidentally steps in <b>dog</b> <b>poop.</b> Ralphie's mom would like to finally get something other than a Ronald Colman gravy boat on dish night at the local cinema. Scut, the main bully, is demoted, with a new head bully ruling over him.|$|E
50|$|During a rehearsal, Leicht, the {{assistant}} musical director randomly gives Noa a solo that the troupe's prima donna member, Yaffa (Smadar Brenner), initially sings. As Noa amazes {{everyone in the}} rehearsal hall, Yaffa storms out of the room. When Datner and Bazooka learn about the new recruit welcome wagon tradition, they decide to get revenge by playing practical jokes back on the veteran troupe members. On their first performance, Yaffa and the troupe's shorty male divo Doron receive electric shocks when touching wet microphones, Shuka, the drummer gets his drums destroyed, Moni, the keyboard player gets powder puffing out of his keyboard, and the audience find it to be hilarious,thinking {{it was part of}} the act. The next day, Doron with Moni and Shuka spread <b>dog</b> <b>poop</b> all over Datner's bus seat. When Datner sees the messy seat, he faints. After the seat is cleaned, he suddenly winks at Moni’s girlfriend and featured soloist Micki (Liron Nirgad), who begins to have a secret liking for him. The bus brings the troupe from show to show, making stops at cafes in between.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3.5 out of 4 {{stars and}} called it [...] "a treasure". He wrote, [...] "Movies like [...] "Spy Kids" [...] are so rare. Families are often reduced to {{attending}} scatological dumber-and-dumbest movies like [...] "See Spot Run"--movies that teach vulgarity as a value. [...] "Spy Kids" [...] is an intelligent, upbeat, happy movie that {{is not about the}} comedy of embarrassment, that does not have anybody rolling around in <b>dog</b> <b>poop,</b> that would rather find out what it can accomplish than what it can get away with." [...] Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "It's entertaining and inoffensive, a rare combination in kids' films, which are usually neither." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety observed, [...] "A full-blown fantasy-action adventure that also strenuously underscores the importance of family, [...] "Spy Kids" [...] is determined to take no prisoners in the under-12 demographic, a goal it sometimes dazzlingly achieves. Robert Rodriguez's film, in which two kids become real spies to save the world from a mad genius, fulfills kids' empowerment fantasies and features enough techno-wizardry and cool f/x to satisfy those weaned on videogames." ...|$|E
5000|$|Schippers {{returned}} to VPRO television in 1971, writing De Fred Haché Show, with The Hague comedian Harry Touw as the character Fred Haché, directed by Schippers and Ruud van Hemert, Gied Jaspars, and Wim van der Linden. His girlfriend Ellen Jens produced the show, {{and worked with}} Schippers throughout his television career. Subsequently, he wrote Barend is weer bezig (which ran for five episodes) for the Hachéshows character Barend Servet (played by IJf Blokker). The two shows were closely related (Schippers also designed the sets for both), and featured absurdist comedy which included the kinds of low-brow content {{not allowed to be}} seen or heard on Dutch television— <b>dog</b> <b>poop,</b> nudity, profanity. Controversy arose over a skit in which Barend Servet interviewed Juliana of the Netherlands (played by [...] "Ria"); the queen drank sherry and cleaned Brussel sprouts in order to pretend to feel close to the Dutch people, before throwing them in the trash or donating them to a children's home. The show led to questions being asked in parliament about the depiction of her majesty, and the VPRO was censured by the minister of culture, narrowly escaping having its broadcasting hours cut.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{constant}} {{efforts by}} various scholars {{to define the}} meaning of privacy, privacy has remained to be a concept as elusive as ever. Some say {{that we need to}} note its unique ethnographic content, that the meaning of privacy varies from society to society. Others advise that it is perhaps best to identify what specific interests of the individual we think the law ought to protect. Following the above logic, one finds that the Continental Europe grounds the concept of privacy in human dignity. The English holds dear to their concept of breach of confidence, which has a close affiliation with property rights, while the Americans are concerned with guarding against intrusion by the state. Privacy seems have survived well in each beholding state. Yet the Internet Age has beckoned us to re-examine privacy as a concept when geographical and ethnographical differences are no longer a valid concern. One particular challenge is the rise of citizen participatory journalism in the Internet, which every Internet user can literally be a reporter and add his story onto the Internet news. This would mean our daily life may be under the minute scrutiny of our neighbours, any passerby on the street, or anyone we may have met. Though our stories may take place in the public, little are we prepared that our movements and gestures will be captured by modern technology at any moment and later to be broadcast on the Internet for a public trial of millions to watch and to criticize. For instance, in 2005, The <b>Dog</b> <b>Poop</b> Girl story featured a South Korea University student who refused to clean up the feces of her dog in a subway compartment was posted on the Internet. The story soon hit the national headlines and even the Washington Post. The Internet users were not merely content to expose her wrongful deeds. They hunted her down, and exposed her personal data. Facing mounting public pressure, the girl eventually resigned from her university. Indisputably, the act took place in public, that it was a disgraceful act, that the violators were not members of the organized state force or the prying paparazzi but has the shaming and monitoring power of the Internet gone too far? Similar stories involving like issues are reported elsewhere. In the proposed paper, drawing on existing literature, I will examine the concept of privacy in the growing age of Internet policing by citizen-reporters...|$|E
