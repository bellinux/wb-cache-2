40|$|Doppler flow measurementThis {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} a novel sensing method for measuring fuel flow which {{was developed for}} the Ford Motor Co by Sira Ltd. The fuel flow sensor uses an optical technique based on detecting light scattered from particles carried in the flowing fuel. Two off axis light sources illuminate the fuel flow region. As particles move with the fuel some light is scattered normal to the fuel flow direction. The scattered light is focused onto a course beam splitter which then directs the light onto two matched detectors. The course beam splitter has 5 linear reflecting grooves per mm each with an included angle of 1351. As a particle that is smaller than the groove width moves across {{the field of view}} the effect is to focus scattered light from the particle alternately onto each of the two detectors. Each detector therefore receives optical modulation which is in antiphase to that received by the other detector. The difference of the two detector signals is then used. Also presented will be a new design for an optically based steering wheel position. The sensor is now in full scale production and is manufactured by First <b>Inertia</b> <b>Switch</b> Ltd. An assembly consisting of a number of parallel light guides, each 0. 25 mm wide, views the light reflected from a black and white striped tape that is stuck to the steering column. The signals from the detectors that are mounted remotely {{at the end of the}} light guides are interpreted by a PLA device to give rotational information. The sensor offers a higher resolution than traditional similar sensors while maintaining a low manufacturing cost...|$|E

30|$|Online {{optimization}} is used {{to calculate}} the inertial response and the damping power, which increases the computational burden of the digital signal processor (DSP). However, for MG applications, particularly considering the requirement for autonomous operation, the VSG is desired to operate using the voltage control method (VCM) as it can provide direct voltage and frequency support for the loads. Based on this fact, the bang-bang control strategy of alternating virtual inertia for the VSG operating with VCM has been proposed to suppress frequency and power oscillations effectively [16, 17]. During each cycle of oscillations, the value of <b>inertia</b> is <b>switched</b> between a big moment of inertia and a small one for four times. Each switching may cause power oscillations. On the other hand, applying a large constant virtual inertia for bang-bang control will result in a sluggish response. Besides, this method also does not explore the use of adaptive virtual damping that acts during the oscillation following a power disturbance. In order to overcome these limitations, a novel self-tuning (ST)-VSG based frequency control method is developed in this paper, which decreases the computational burden of the DSP and provides the self-tuning virtual inertia as well as virtual damping.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} contribute to the policy discussion on how to design efficient and sustainable energy policies. In three self-contained chapters, it applies microeconomic theory and empirical analysis to identify three market failures in European energy markets and to evaluate specific policy measures that strive to overcome these failures in order to increase market efficiency and to enhance environmental or societal sustainability. Chapter 1 and 2 study European electricity markets, which {{play an important role in}} the transition towards a carbon-neutral energy future. Overcoming barriers to efficient electricity markets is a crucial step to keep the costs of this transition as low as possible to society. Both chapters focus on obstacles to electricity market efficiency that have recently been highlighted by the European Commission. On the supply side, subsidies for renewable electricity may distort production incentives and competition in wholesale electricity markets. Chapter 1 applies a theoretical model to study the effect of different subsidies on producer strategies and competition in wholesale electricity markets. On the demand side, the European Commission seeks to overcome the reluctance of residential electricity consumers to switch electricity supplier in order to ensure effective competition in the retail electricity market. Chapter 2 empirically quantifies different reasons for <b>switching</b> <b>inertia</b> using a structural discrete choice model and performs counterfactual analysis to study the effect of different policy measures that seek to overcome <b>switching</b> <b>inertia.</b> Chapter 3 looks at the building sector, which accounts for 40 % of final energy consumption in Europe and is a major emitter of carbon emissions. In the residential housing market information asymmetries hamper incentives to invest in energy efficiency improvements of rental property. This chapter empirically analyzes the effect of a European policy that mandates the use of energy performance certificates aiming at establishing an efficient market for energy efficient dwellings.

40|$|Cognitive inertia {{also makes}} a {{prediction}} about the rate of learning in each block. Because cognitive inertia occurs only in the second block when participants have to switch from applying one categorization rule to applying the opposite categorization rule, learning should be slower in the second block (indicated by a smaller rate of learning parameter r) than the first block. Consistent with this hypothesis, the rate of learning parameter r is significantly smaller in the second block (r = 1. 2965, SE =. 0993) than in the first block (r = 1. 6697, SE =. 1340; rfirst block – rsecond block =. 3732, lower 95 % limit =. 0463). The strength of cognitive inertia depends on {{how difficult it is}} to switch from one categorization rule to the opposite categorization rule, which in turn depends on the association pattern between the targets (e. g., Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi) and the attributes (pleasant and unpleasant words).

40|$|Purpose: Service {{research}} typically relates {{switching costs}} to customer loyalty, and portrays them as effective switching deterrents that engender harmful word-of-mouth (WOM). Rather than to customer loyalty, this paper aims to relate switching costs to consumer inertia, {{and show that}} while switching costs may result in customer retention, they can engender positive and negative WOM. This depends on whether the inertia stems from satisfaction or indifference. Design/methodology/approach: A mall-intercept survey investigated 518 customers' perceptions of their mobile phone service providers. Structural equation modelling fitted the data to the conceptual model. Findings: Switching costs deterred switching and engendered negative WOM, but only with low-inertia customers. With high-inertia customers, retention and WOM behaviours depended on whether the inertia stemmed from satisfaction or indifference. Satisfied customers with high switching costs tended to stay, gave more positive and less negative WOM. With indifferent customers, switching costs were unrelated to retention or WOM behaviours. Research limitations/implications: While they may be perceived negatively, switching costs can engender PWOM. Hence, research should not consider switching costs alone without considering the context that produces them. Practical implications: Service providers should segment their customers into low-inertia, high-inertia/satisfied and high-inertia/indifferent, and target each segment differently. By converting customers into the high-inertia/satisfied segment, service providers can make {{the best use of}} switching costs – not only in the traditional sense as a barrier to defection, but also as a way of generating positive WOM. Originality/value: This study is the first to consider the role of <b>inertia</b> with <b>switching</b> costs, positive WOM, and negative WOM. The findings suggest that past studies portraying switching costs as negative impediments that evoke only negative WOM might be misleading. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} day-to-day {{dynamics}} {{in an urban}} traffic network induced by joint route and departure time switching dynamics in commuter decisions under real-time information. The role of <b>switching</b> <b>inertia,</b> the user's sensitivity to experienced and lagged system attributes, and travel demand management measures on day-to-day evolution are analyzed. A simulation-based day-to-day network analysis framework is developed by incorporating empirically calibrated user behavior models under information. This model {{can be used to}} analyze network reliability and stability measures. Because it can model users' responses to information and experience, this framework permits relaxing the assumption that user behavior remains unchanged. Therefore, {{it can be used to}} model the transient effects due to various types of system perturbations and shocks. Computational experiments are used to investigate the effect of the aforementioned factors. The findings suggest that trip time variability and lateness propensity increase under high congestion. Under joint switching dynamics, a significant deviation from equilibrium is observed even after nearly 2 months. Departure time switching behavior appears to exert a greater influence than route switching on day-to-day dynamics, and transportation control measures can improve trip time and network reliability. These results have important implications for congestion mitigation strategies, network reliability assessment, and evaluation of intelligent transportation system technologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCurrent {{architecture}} of many computer systems relies on dynamic allocation of {{a pool of}} resources according to workload conditions to meet specific performance objectives while minimizing cost (e. g., energy or billing). In such systems, different levels of operation may be defined, and switching between operating levels occurs at certain thresholds of system congestion. To avoid rapid oscillations between levels of service, " hysteresis " is introduced by using different thresholds for increasing and decreasing workload levels, respectively. We propose a model of such systems with general arrivals, arbitrary number of servers and operating levels where each higher operating level may correspond to an arbitrary number of additional servers and soft (i. e. non-deterministic) thresholds to account for " <b>inertia</b> " in <b>switching</b> between operating levels. In our model, request service times {{are assumed to be}} memoryless and server processing rates may be a function of the current operating level and of the number of requests (users) in the system. Additionally, we allow for delays in the activation of additional operating levels. We use simple mathematics to obtain a semi-numerical solution of our model. We illustrate the versatility of our model using several case study examples inspired by features of real systems. In particular, we explore optimal thresholds as a tradeoff between performance and energy consumptio...|$|R
40|$|Many {{organizations}} observe clear {{link between}} customer satisfaction and price perceptions associated with switching service providers. The reason is that, customers have different preferences and cost heterogeneities. The above aspects {{have important implications}} how firms should target their customer service efforts. The present research examines a sample of 804 users of mobile phones in Greece. Statistical analysis includes factor analysis, while all the tests were defined in a 95 % confidence level. Cluster analysis was used in order to group the variables and identify differences between the samples. The results of statistical analysis show four factors that influence the customer buying decision to change service provider. The Cluster {{analysis of the data}} identified three distinct groups of customers. This paper, however, argues that strategies must be implemented to overcome non-loyal purchasing behavior. According to the research findings users face difficulties changing providers; this is a costly action in the sense that there is often some kind of fixed cost associated with a change. Therefore in order to change service providers a nontrivial amount of inconvenience is required. This inconvenience is likely to be greater if the customer has a large number of accounts with the firm. Both the administrative costs as well as the learning costs associated with switching to a new service provider are likely to create some amount of <b>inertia</b> to not <b>switch...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{efficient}} and reliable operation of material flows in transportation networks {{is a subject}} of broad eco-nomic interest. Important applications include the control of signalized intersections in urban road systems and the planning and scheduling of logistic processes. Traditional approaches to operating material flow networks are however known to have severe disadvantages: centralized controllers suffer from their high computational demands that make an on-line control hardly possible in larger networks, whereas a decentralized control using clearing policies leads under rather general conditions to instabil-ities. As an alternative approach that may help to overcome these problems, a self-organization mechanism of conflicting flows is proposed that is inspired by oscillatory phenomena of pedestrian and animal flows at intersections or bottlenecks. For this purpose, a permeability function is introduced that allows to sequentially serve the different possible flow directions at an intersection in a fully demand-dependent way. The self-organized optimization achieved by the presented approach is demonstrated to be closely linked to synchronization of the oscillatory service dynamics at the different intersections in the network. For regular grid topologies, different synchroniza-tion regimes are present depending on the <b>inertia</b> of the <b>switching</b> from one service state to the next one. The dependence of this observation on the regularity of the considered network is tested. The reported results contribute to an improved understanding of the conditions {{that have to be}} present for efficiently operating material flow networks by a decentralized control, which is of major importance for future implementations in real-world traffic or production systems.

40|$|Increasingly {{organizations}} are recognizing {{the value of}} establishing close relationships with their customers. Despite this, research has not deeply explored how the intangible aspects of relational exchange such as customer satisfaction, as well as affective commitment, calculative commitment, and trust, combine to determine loyalty in the higher-education sector. This is in part a result of reluctance within the sector to view students as customers of institutional brands. This research uses a structural equation modeling approach and a sample of 474 students to examine, first, the determinants of loyalty within the higher-education sector and, second, the role of relationship strength as a moderator of those determinants. The results indicate that student loyalty was most strongly determined by psychological attachment, {{and a sense of}} belonging to the brand. Student satisfaction, while a contributing determinant, alone was insufficient in generating loyalty. The results also indicated that students rejected the notion of loyalty determined by <b>inertia</b> and high <b>switching</b> costs. In addition, trust was not found to be a strong determinant of recommendation or return. Importantly, while relationship strength has been found to determine loyalty in other service contexts, the drivers of loyalty remained the same despite the strength of the relationship that students perceived that they had with their institution. The findings of this study suggest the need for a more comprehensive, involved, and proactive strategy to developing, managing, and maintaining the student–university relationship. The study also encourages the sector to adopt a relationship marketing approach to the management of higher-education services. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} three objectives. First, {{it seeks to}} set an agenda in which technologicalsuccessions can be meaningfully discussed. Second, it aims to {{establish}} the necessaryconditions under which a technological succession may occur. Third, in establishing thisset of conditions, the paper identifies some useful analytical tools which could beemployed in a formal model of technological transitions. Opening up the research agenda on transition phases from established to newtechnologies is a key issue in discussions of technological evolution and its impacts onsociety and the environment. Given the increasing returns to adoption enjoyed by anestablished technology, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the conditions under which it ispossible for technological succession to occur. In so doing, the paper takes on board theimportant insights into increasing returns to adoption and path dependency made by thelock-in literature but places these within a new, more general, historical setting. A number of steps need to be taken when preparing the ground for a formal model oftechnological succession. First, one must have a clear definition of the elementsnecessary to operationalise the concept of succession in the social domain. Second, thepaper offers an interpretation of previous work on socio- technology paradigms, wherebythese are viewed as a set of coupled selection mechanisms that shape the rate anddirection of technological innovation. Third, a socio-technical matrix approach is used inorder to appreciate the way in which agents - with heterogeneous preferences - comparerival technologies and make their selections. Finally there is a discussion of factors thatmay produce <b>inertia</b> to technological <b>switching.</b> With these elements in place, the paperargues, we can begin to explain how technological learning generates long period ofstasis punctuated by sudden bursts of rapid technological change. ...|$|R
40|$|We exploit a {{targeted}} {{change in the}} health insurance offerings of a large employer to evaluate whether individuals {{are willing to pay}} more to keep their existing primary care doctor. Beginning in 2011, employees in one of the health insurance plans were given the option of choosing a new plan which had a lower premium in exchange for a more limited network of doctors. For individuals whose doctors were covered under both the old and new plans, we argue this new option strictly dominated, since all other aspects of insurance coverage remained identical and the option value of the larger network was close to zero. We use the choices of these employees to estimate the amount of non-switching due to inertia. Employees whose existing doctors were not covered under the new option had to decide whether to pay more to keep their current doctor. This setting allows us to identify the costs that individuals associate with switching doctors separately from inertia. We estimate that 22 % of employees are initially inattentive and that 16 % are inattentive a year later, even though they could save between $ 638 and $ 1, 851 annually by switching to the new plan. A substantial fraction of individuals are willing to pay higher premiums to keep their doctor, even after controlling for inertia, with 35 % of employees choosing to pay an average of over $ 100 extra per month to retain their doctors. These <b>inertia</b> and doctor <b>switching</b> costs vary by income, age, gender, family composition and prior health care utilization patterns.

40|$|Of all {{the periods}} in the Phanerozoic time scale, the Cambrian {{system is the}} most perplexing. Several lines of {{evidence}} which together suggest that the Cambrian Earth may have experienced a large, rapid episode of true polar wander (TPW) include: (1) The Cambrian is short. Once thought to have a duration approaching 100 Ma, stratigraphic Rb/Sr and U/Pb geochronometry now suggests a time span of about 20 Ma. (2) Lithostratigraphic analyses suggest that Northern Africa went from high to low and back to high latitudes within this time interval. North America at least moved into the carbonate belt during the early Cambrian. (3) Improvements in biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and carbon isotopic stratigraphy around the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary now allow precise correlations to be made between strata in Siberia, China, Morocco, Australia, and with somewhat less precision to North America. Isochronous poles from Australia and Africa demonstrate that they were moving separately in the late Precambrian. (4) Paleomagnetic poles, derived from biostratigraphically-dated units, suggest nearly 90 ° of APW for many, if not all, of these continents during Cambrian time. We interpret these effects as an episode of TPW resulting from the collision of East and West Gondwana during the early Cambrian. This suturing event would stop subduction of a large equatorial plate dipping under Africa (responsible {{at least in part}} for the Pan-African metamorphic events). Thermal warming of the orphaned slab then removes its mass anomaly, causing the magnitudes of the minimum and intermediate eigenvectors of the total earth moment of <b>inertia</b> tensor to <b>switch,</b> leading to a 90 ° TPW reorientation of the crust. The Cambrian sea-level transgression may then be the result of moving a large ocean basin from the polar region onto the equatorial buldge. Similarly, the enormously accelerated rates of organic evolution observed during Cambrian time {{may be the result of}} paleoenvironmental dislocation driven by TPW...|$|R
40|$|The {{peak power}} {{consumption}} of multi-axis production machinery (e. g. industrial robots) {{is determined by}} the forces during acceleration phases of continuous movements. The required high electric currents represent a cost factor in terms of the mains power supply. In this paper a new Modelica-based method is presented to save the mechanical braking energy of production machinery into a local flywheel-based energy recuperation system (ERS) for later utilization. An ERS has twofold advantages: on the one side it reduces the apparent power peaks from the mains power system. On the other side the overall energy consumption can also be reduced therewith. However; a mechanical ERS with a flywheel needs to be controlled in advance; as its internal <b>inertia</b> and the <b>switched</b> magnetic field introduce some dead time in the process. Therefore; the here presented approach uses an interdisciplinary Modelica model of the machinery to compute future power requirements prior execution of new movements. It is assumed that the machine program is known upfront in a textual form. The movement commands must be carried out with the virtual machine model first. The simulation computes the energy demand; according to which the stored amount of energy within the ERS (i. e. the angular velocity of its flywheel) must be controlled. The here computed reference angular velocity signal is put later also to the real controller; where the physical ERS is attached to as an extra motor. This paper presents the methodology along an example of a 3 -axis robotic manipulator that is installed in the VDTC building of the Fraunhofer IFF; Magdeburg. This specific example has been used to validate the concept: 12 % less power-consumption and 10 % less power peaks were achieved during the operation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of essays {{about how to}} improve education markets through analyzing data generated by such markets. In chapter 1, I start with looking at how families decide which school to attend in a school choice system. Though such systems are designed assuming that families make well-informed choices upfront, I use data from NYC's high school choice system to show that families' choices change after the initial match as they learn about schools. I develop an empirical model of evolving demand for schools under learning, switching costs, and demand responses to prior assignments. The estimates {{suggest that there are}} even more changes in underlying demand, undermining the welfare performance of the initial match. To alleviate the cost of demand changes, I investigate dynamic mechanisms that best accommodate choice changes. These mechanisms improve on the existing discretionary reapplication process. In addition, the gains from the mechanisms dramatically change depending on the extent of demand-side <b>inertia</b> caused by <b>switching</b> costs. Thus, the gains from a centralized market depend not only on its design but also on demand-side frictions (such as demand changes and inertia). In chapter 2, I turn to education production after students start attending schools. In centralized school admissions systems, rationing at oversubscribed schools often involves lotteries on top of preferences of students and schools. This random assignment is extensively used by empirical researchers to identify the effect of getting in a school on outcomes such as test scores. I theoretically study whether a popular empirical research design extracts a random assignment as intended, providing a condition under which the research design successfully extracts a random assignment. Chapter 3 (with Atila Abdulkadiroglu, Josh Angrist and Parag Pathak) considers the complementary question of how best to use the lottery-generated variation for impact evaluation. We develop easily-implemented strategies that fully exploit the random assignment embedded. We apply these methods to find large achievement gains from charter school attendance in Denver. By analyzing test-score consequences, chapters 2 and 3 complement chapter l's analysis of welfare/happiness consequences of school attendance. by Yusuke Narita. Thesis: Ph.
