5|$|All {{roads in}} Bintulu are {{maintained}} by the Bintulu Development Authority (BDA). Bintulu is connected to Miri and Sibu by the Pan Borneo Highway. Bintulu is also connected to Mukah and Samalaju Industrial Park. Kemena Bridge crosses the Kemena River. It is the second bridge in Malaysia built using the <b>incremental</b> launch method. Keppel Road in Bintulu is named after a friend of James Brooke, Sir Henry Keppel.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} industries, the {{trucking}} industry {{has benefited from}} the use of computers and the Internet. The Internet helps firms explore new opportunities by aggressive sales and marketing. The <b>incremental</b> cost of conducting business transactions on the Internet is as little as one-fifteenth as expensive as paper transactions.|$|E
5|$|Outdoor air pollutants, {{especially}} chemicals {{released from}} the burning of fossil fuels, {{increase the risk of}} lung cancer. Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an <b>incremental</b> increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the Königsbergs was {{prepared}} in 1913. The design was an <b>incremental</b> improvement over the previous , with a larger hull and greater displacement, but with the same armament, speed, and armor protection. By 1916, thirteen German light cruisers had {{been lost in the}} course of World War I; after they were commissioned, the ships of the Königsberg class took the names of four of these lost cruisers.|$|E
5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through <b>incremental</b> power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Funcom {{decided to}} instead use a recent {{version of the}} Dreamworld engine, the same version used for their 2008 MMORPG Age of Conan. This new engine {{features}} improved water rendering, particle effects, and character animation. It also includes <b>incremental</b> improvements to technologies already used in Anarchy Online, such as the dynamic weather system. No new release date has been announced, although periodic status updates are published in the game's official weekly development blog Friday With Means.|$|E
5|$|SMS Helgoland, {{the lead}} ship of her class, was a {{dreadnought}} battleship of the German Imperial Navy. Helgolands design represented an <b>incremental</b> {{improvement over the}} preceding , including {{an increase in the}} bore diameter of the main guns, from 28cm (11in) to 30.5cm (12in). Her keel was laid down on 11 November 1908 at the Howaldtswerke shipyards in Kiel. Helgoland was launched on 25 September 1909 and was commissioned on 23 August 1911.|$|E
5|$|The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) was the United States Army's {{replacement}} {{program for}} armored fighting vehicles in Armored and Stryker brigade combat teams. The GCV was organized under the Follow On <b>Incremental</b> Capabilities Package of the BCT Modernization program. The first {{variant of the}} vehicle was to be prototyped in 2015 and fielded by 2017. It replaced the canceled Future Combat Systems, manned ground vehicles program. The Ground Combat Vehicle program was cancelled in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and <b>incremental</b> ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|The second Königsberg {{class was}} {{authorized}} in 1913 and laid down starting in 1914. They were named for cruisers {{that had been}} sunk {{in the early months}} of the war. They were an <b>incremental</b> improvement over the Wiesbaden class, being some five hundred tons heavier. They carried the standard eight 15cm guns, the forward wing mounts were placed a deck higher to improve their firing arc. They were otherwise identical to the preceding light cruiser designs.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective <b>incremental</b> failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} three tables are lists of economies by <b>incremental</b> GDP from 2006 to 2050 by Goldman Sachs. They illustrate that the BRICs and N11 nations are replacing G7 nations {{as the main}} contributors to world's economic growth. From 2020 to 2050, nine of the ten largest countries by <b>incremental</b> GDP are occupied by the BRICs and N11 nations, in which the United States remains {{to be the only}} G7 member as one of the three biggest contributors to the global economic growth.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Incremental</b> Algorithm(IA) by Dale and Reiter was {{the most}} {{influential}} algorithm before 2000. It {{is based on the}} idea of a preferential order of attributes or properties that speakers go by. So in order to run the <b>Incremental</b> Algorithm, first a preference order of attributes has to be given. Now the algorithm follows that order and adds those properties to the description which rule out any remaining distractors. Furthermore, Dale and Reiter stress the attribute type which is always included in their descriptions even if it does not rule out any distractors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Incremental</b> {{health risk}} is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of <b>incremental</b> health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small <b>incremental</b> health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|E
25|$|A {{monthly pass}} {{provides}} unlimited travel between any two zones for one passenger on {{every day of}} a respective month. Monthly passes {{can be used on}} any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail or online from Metra's website. Monthly pass holders may also purchase a Pace PlusBus card in conjunction with their monthly pass purchase. The PlusBus card provides unlimited rides on all Pace suburban buses. A CTA/Pace Link-Up pass is also available for purchase. On CTA buses and the CTA 'L' the Link-Up pass allows unlimited travel during weekday rush hours and on Pace buses it allows unlimited travel anytime. Monthly pass holders may also travel beyond the zones listed on the monthly pass by purchasing <b>incremental</b> tickets from conductors on the train. <b>Incremental</b> tickets cost $1 beyond the first zone and 50 cents for every additional zone thereafter. There is no surcharge to purchase <b>incremental</b> tickets for monthly pass holders.|$|E

25|$|But even <b>incremental</b> change came slowly. Many on the AFT {{executive}} council felt they owed allegiance to Shanker, not Feldman, and they balked at even <b>incremental</b> {{changes in the}} union's spending priorities. While the union's educational research and organizing programs remained healthy, the union's servicing capabilities continued to decline {{during the first few}} years of her tenure. The union's research and collective bargaining staff remained small and stagnant despite strong membership growth, the union lacked comprehensive membership and collective bargaining databases, and financial oversight of local unions was inconsistent (a situation which led to embezzlement scandals in Miami, Florida and Washington, D.C. in 2002 and 2003).|$|E
