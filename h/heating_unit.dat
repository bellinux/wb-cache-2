5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a <b>heating</b> <b>unit.</b> Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

Research was conducted in order to determine predictive correlations among temperature (<b>heat</b> <b>units),</b> precipitation, and springtime subterranean termite swarming in Texas. <b>Heat</b> <b>units</b> were accumulated from December 21 through the date of the initial spring swarms for the years 1994 - 99 in nine Texas cities. Analysis of the <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> data showed that none of the fifty-four initial spring swarm events occurred before a minimum of 602 <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> had accumulated, so this was determined to be the minimum <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> threshold for this set of swarm data. Additionally, mean accumulations of <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> were statistically similar in seven of the nine cities. Analysis of the precipitation data showed no statistical significance among accumulated amounts of precipitation.

A <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> accumulation model incorporating a rainfall adjustment factor was developed which described adult emergence in the spring. Adult midges initiated emergence after accumulating 431 centigrade <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> (based on mean daily to-cm soil temperatures starting 1 April) above a threshold temperature of 14. 8 °C, whereas, 679 and 977 <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> were required for 50 and 95 % emergence, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> {{concept of}} time-temperature {{relationships}} {{is used in}} this thesis {{as a means of}} studying the temperature element of the climate at nine Oregon stations. The stations, Astoria, Baker, Burns, Eugene, Medford, Pendleton, Portland, Roseburg, and Salem, were {{selected on the basis of}} distribution and availability of Weather Bureau data. One table of average daily <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> totals was compiled for each of five selected threshold temperatures, 30 °, 35 °, 40 °, 45 °, and 50 °F, for each of the nine stations. The method of <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> computation devised by Lindsey and Newman was considered the best adapted to the aims of this study. An average daily <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> graph and an annual accumulation graph were prepared for each of the stations. In an effort to note similarities and/or differences in <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> occurrences in the several parts of Oregon, the following aspects were considered: time of occurrence of maxima and minima, range between maxima and minima, rates of change of <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> occurrence, rates of <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> accumulation, and annual <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> totals. Astoria has the greatest seasonal lag of maxima after the summer solstice, approximately two months, while the remainder of the stations have lags of approximately one month. During the cool season, all stations exhibit a similar lag of about twenty days. Pendleton has the highest maxima at all threshold levels, while Medford has the next highest, followed by Burns, Baker, Portland and Salem, Roseburg, and Eugene, with Astoria having the lowest maxima at all thresholds, Astoria has the highest minima at the 30 °F threshold and eastern Oregon stations have the lowest minima, with Roseburg, the Willamette Valley stations, and Medford being intermediate. Astoria has the smallest range between maxima and minima; the eastern Oregon stations have the greatest range. Ranges at Medford resemble those of the eastern Oregon stations, while Roseburg and the Willamette Valley stations have similar ranges between those for Astoria and the eastern Oregon stations. The eastern Oregon stations have the most rapid rate of increase in daily <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> in the spring and the most rapid rate of decrease in the fall. Astoria has the most gradual rate of change during these two periods, while the Willamette Valley stations are intermediate. Roseburg resembles Portland, Salem, and Eugene, while Medford is more similar to the eastern stations of Pendleton, Baker, and Burns. Pendleton, Medford, Baker, and Burns have the most rapid accumulation rates during the summer, the Willamette Valley stations and Roseburg have intermediate rates, and Astoria the least rapid rate during this period. During the cool season, however, the accumulation curves for Medford and the eastern Oregon stations are not as steep as the others. Medford has the greatest accumulated <b>heat</b> <b>unit</b> total at the 30 °, 35 °, and 40 °F thresholds, with Pendleton having the greatest totals for the 45 ° and 50 °F threshold levels. Baker has the lowest totals for the 30 °, 35 °, 40 ° and 45 °F thresholds, and Astoria the lowest total for the 50 °F threshold...|$|R
40|$|This study {{involves}} {{the determination of}} the base temperature for grain sorghum, so that <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> can be used to predict the stage of plant growth at any time. The number of <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> required for emergence is determined. Seed viability is also an important factor in producing good stands. This study determines the relationship of seed density and weight to germination and emergence for grain sorghum. The effect of seed weight and density on grain sorghum germination and emergence was studied in a growth chamber. It was concluded from this study that the seed weight does not affect seed germination and plant growth, but that the seed density is related to grain sorghum seed germination and seedling growth. Time for emergence was the same for the four varieties at any given temperature. It was concluded from this that the number of <b>heat</b> <b>units</b> required for emergence is a constant for the four varieties of grain sorghum used in this study. The emergence dropped from 91 percent at 82 ⁰F to 66 percent at 65 ⁰F. It was concluded that for good stands the seeds should be planted when the smallest amount of time elapses between planting and emergence. <b>Heat</b> <b>unit</b> theory used in conjunction with climatological data and weather forecasts can predict when to plant for optimum stands.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate heat storage in a <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM heat storage model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a PCM <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the <b>heat</b> storage <b>units</b> top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> <b>heated</b> from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> <b>heated</b> from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall heat storage model was developed to combine heat supply, heat storage and heat distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> and the <b>heat</b> transfer rate to the surroundings. The heat supplied to the <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit</b> was based on calculations of batch combustion of wood. The results showed that none of the tests for the PCM <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit,</b> or the optimization of the PCM <b>heat</b> storage <b>unit,</b> reached the requirements of heat transfer to the surroundings set for the model.
