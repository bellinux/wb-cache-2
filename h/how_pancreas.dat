40|$|This article {{looks at}} <b>how</b> <b>pancreas</b> {{stem cells are}} a {{potential}} source of insulin-producing and cells for the therapy of diabetes. In adult tissues the ‘side population’ (SP) of cells that effluxes the DNA binding dye Hoechst 33342 through ATP-binding cassette transporters has stem cell properties. We hypothesised therefore that the SP would expand in response to β cell injury and give rise to functional β cells. SP cells were flow sorted from dissociated pancreas cells of adult mice, analysed for phenotype and cultured with growth promoting and differentiation factors before analysis for hormone expression and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. SP cell number and colony forming potential (CFP) increased significantly in models of type diabetes, and after partial pancreatectomy, {{in the absence of}} hyperglycaemia. SP cells, ~ 1 % of total pancreas cells at 1 week of age, were enriched > 10 -fold for CFP compared to non-SP cells. Freshly isolated SP cells contained no insulin protein or RNA but expressed the homeobox transcription factor Pdx 1 required for pancreas development and β cell function. Pdx 1, along with surface expression of CD 326 (Ep-Cam), was a marker of the colony forming and proliferation potential of SP cells. In serum-free medium with defined factors, SP cells proliferated and differentiated into islet hormone-expressing cells that secreted insulin in response to glucose. Insulin expression was maintained when tissue was transplanted within vascularised chambers into diabetic mice. SP cells in the adult pancreas expand in response to β cell injury and are a source of β cell progenitors with potential for the treatment of diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) {{can involve}} the main pancreatic duct (MD-IPMNs) or its secondary branches (BD-IPMNs) in a segmental of multifocal/diffuse fashion. Growing {{evidence indicates that}} BD-IPMNs {{are less likely to}} harbour cancer and in selected cases these lesions can be managed non operatively. For surgery, clarification is required on: (1) when to resect an IPMN; (2) which type of resection should be performed; and (3) <b>how</b> much <b>pancreas</b> should be resected. In recent years parenchyma-sparing resections as well as laparoscopic procedures have being performed more frequently by pancreatic surgeons in order to decrease the rate of postoperative pancreatic insufficiency and to minimize the surgical impact of these operations. However, oncological radicality is of paramount importance, and extended resections up to total pancreatectomy may be necessary in the setting of IPMNs. In this article the type and extension of surgical resections in patients with MD-IPMNs and BD-IPMNs are analyzed, evaluating perioperative and long-term outcomes. The role of standard and parenchyma-sparing resections is discussed as well as different strategies in the case of multifocal neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDetermining the {{functional}} attributes of pancreatic transcription factors {{is essential to}} understand <b>how</b> the <b>pancreas</b> is specified distinct from other endodermal organs, such as liver, stomach and duodenum, and to direct the differentiation of other cell types into pancreas. Previously, we demonstrated that Pdx 1 -VP 16 was sufficient to convert liver to pancreas. In this paper, we characterize {{the functional}} ability of another pancreatic transcription factor, Ptf 1 a, in promoting ectopic pancreatic fates at early stages throughout the endoderm and later during organogenesis. Using the transthyretin promoter to drive expression in the early liver region/bud of transgenic Xenopus tadpoles, we find that Ptf 1 a-VP 16 is able to convert liver to pancreas. Overexpression of the unmodified Ptf 1 a {{on the other hand}} has no effect in liver but is able to convert stomach and duodenum to pancreas. When overexpressed at earlier embryonic stages throughout the endoderm, Ptf 1 a activity is similarly limited, whereas Ptf 1 a-VP 16 has increased activity. Interestingly, in all instances we find that Ptf 1 a-VP 16 is only capable of promoting acinar cell fates, whereas Ptf 1 a promotes both acinar and endocrine fates. Lastly, we demonstrate that, similar to mouse and zebrafish, Xenopus Ptf 1 a is essential for the initial specification of both endocrine and exocrine cells during normal pancreas development...|$|R
40|$|The {{curative}} {{promise of}} stem cells and their descendants for tissue regeneration and repair is currently {{the subject of an}} intense research effort worldwide. If it proves feasible to differentiate stem cells into specific tissues reliably and safely, this approach will be invaluable in the treatment of diseases that lead to organ degeneration or failure, providing an alternative or supplementary source of tissue for transplantation. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation blastocyst that can produce all cells and tissues of the foetus. In recent years, several laboratories have described the directed differentiation of ES cells into multiple mature cell types including: cardiomyocytes; haemopoietic cells; hepatocytes; neurones; muscle cells and both endocrine and exocrine cells of the <b>pancreas.</b> <b>How</b> the immune system of the host will respond when these ES cell-derived mature cells are transplanted is ill defined.

40|$|Background: Tissue {{transplantation}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the treatment of diseases. Pancreatic beta cell transplantation {{is the best way to}} obtain normal blood glucose in patients with diabetes type 1. However, it is not clear <b>how</b> long endocrine <b>pancreas</b> cells can be used for transplantation after the donor′s death. The present study was conducted to analyze the performance and viability of pancreatic islet cells after death. Materials and Methods: Pancreas was separated from Balb/c mice at different times (0, 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after death) at temperatures of 4 °C and 23 °C, and was cultured in Roswell_Park_Memorial_Institute (RPMI) 1640. Insulin shock, MTT assay, aldehyde fuchsin staining, dithizone staining, and florescence microscopy methods were applied to analyze the performance of beta cells, cell viability, islets′ diagnosis, islet cells′ diagnosis, and viable and necrotic cells diagnosis, respectively. Results: Islets of Langerhans and beta cells were diagnosed. By increasing the temperature and time, the viability and performance of beta cells decreased significantly (P < 0. 05).

40|$|It {{would seem}} self-evident {{that a good}} {{knowledge}} of the physiology of pancreatic secretion should be a preliminary quest of the physician in order that deviation from normal function can be recognized and understood and that pancreatic function tests may be formulated and based on sound principles. To this end {{a number of questions}} must be posed. What is the function of the <b>pancreas?</b> <b>How</b> is the gland controlled? What measurements must be made to assess function? What are the normal ranges of the parameter measured? Briefly the function of the pancreas is to provide the appropriate enzymes for the hydrolysis of food-stuffs so that absorption and further digestion can occur, and to provide electrolyte to carry the enzymes into the duodenum and there, with the secretions of the liver and Brunner's gland, provide the appropriate milieu for enzymatic action. The Control of Pancreatic Secretion The control of pancreatic secretion may be con-veniently classified for descriptive purposes into three phases, according to the site at which the stimuli act to excite secretion. 1 CEPHALIC PHASE Pancreatic secretion is initiated by unconditioned and conditioned reflexes which are evoked on eating a meal. The taste of food, its sight, the accompanying noises and smell all combine reflexly to excite efferent fibres lying in the vagus nerves (Preshaw...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough many of {{the genes}} that {{regulate}} development of the endocrine pancreas have been identified, comparatively {{little is known about}} <b>how</b> the exocrine <b>pancreas</b> forms. Previous studies have shown that exocrine pancreas development may be modeled in zebrafish. However, the timing and mechanism of acinar and ductal differentiation and morphogenesis have not been described. Here, we characterize zebrafish exocrine pancreas development in wild type and mutant larvae using histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses. These data allow us to identify two stages of zebrafish exocrine development. During the first stage, the exocrine anlage forms from rostral endodermal cells. During the second stage, protodifferentiated progenitor cells undergo terminal differentiation followed by acinar gland and duct morphogenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses support a model in which the intrapancreatic ductal system develops from progenitors that join to form a contiguous network rather than by branching morphogenesis of the pancreatic epithelium, as described for mammals. Contemporaneous appearance of acinar glands and ducts in developing larvae and their disruption in pancreatic mutants suggest that common molecular pathways may regulate gland and duct morphogenesis and differentiation of their constituent cells. By contrast, analyses of mind bomb mutants and jagged morpholino-injected larvae suggest that Notch signaling principally regulates ductal differentiation of bipotential exocrine progenitors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEndothelial {{cells are}} {{required}} to initiate pancreas development from the endoderm. They also control the function of endocrine islets after birth. Here we investigate in developing <b>pancreas</b> <b>how</b> the endothelial cells become organized during branching morphogenesis and how their development affects pancreatic cell differentiation. We show that endothelial cells closely surround the epithelial bud {{at the onset of}} pancreas morphogenesis. During branching morphogenesis, the endothelial cells become preferentially located near the central (trunk) epithelial cells and remain at a distance from the branch tips where acinar cells differentiate. This correlates with predominant expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in trunk cells. In vivo ablation of VEGF-A expression by pancreas-specific inactivation of floxed Vegfa alleles results in reduced endothelial development and in excessive acinar differentiation. On the contrary, acinar differentiation is repressed when endothelial cells are recruited around tip cells that overexpress VEGF-A. Treatment of embryonic day 12. 5 explants with VEGF-A or with VEGF receptor antagonists confirms that acinar development is tightly controlled by endothelial cells. We also provide evidence that endothelial cells repress the expression of Ptf 1 a, a transcription factor essential for acinar differentiation, and stimulate the expression of Hey- 1 and Hey- 2, two repressors of Ptf 1 a activity. In explants, we provide evidence that VEGF-A signaling is required, but not sufficient, to induce endocrine differentiation. In conclusion, our data suggest that, in developing pancreas, epithelial production of VEGF-A determines the spatial organization of endothelial cells which, in turn, limit acinar differentiation of the epithelium...|$|R
40|$|The {{endoderm}} {{gives rise}} to many different cell types including those that will form the liver and <b>pancreas.</b> <b>How</b> cells differentiate during embryonic development is an important focus for the field of regenerative medicine. Understanding the normal development of liver and pancreatic cell types may allow us to develop strategies {{for the production of}} hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells for therapeutic purposes. One potential method of producing cells for therapeutic purposes is via transdifferentiation, or, the conversion of one cell type to another. In this thesis we aimed to establish a protocol for the transdifferentiation of liver ductal cells (termed cholangiocytes) to either hepatocyte or pancreatic lineages. We also aimed to investigate the signalling pathways important for normal differentiation of embryonic liver and pancreas. In order to address the potential of a cholangiocyte cell line (biliary epithelial cells or BECs) to transdifferentiate to other cell types, BECs were infected with a combination of candidate transcription factors known as ‘master switch’ genes that have previously been demonstrated to induce transdifferentiation to hepatic or pancreatic lineages. We demonstrated that overexpression of the hepatic transcription factors C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and HNF 4  resulted in the up-regulation of the hepatocyte genes Albumin and Gs and de novo expression of Afp. In complementary experiments we also demonstrated that overexpression of the pancreatic transcription factors Pdx 1, Ngn 3, NeuroD and Pax 4 resulted in de novo expression of insulin II in BECs. While these results were encouraging further work is necessary to enhance the maturation status of the nascent cells. We also addressed the role of the Notch signalling pathway in the differentiation of embryonic hepatic and pancreatic cells using ex vivo organ culture models of liver and pancreas development. We treated pancreata with N-[N-(3, 5 -Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl) ]-S- phenylglycine t-Butyl Ester (DAPT) a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Treatment with DAPT inhibits the Notch signalling pathway. Following treatment with DAPT we observed reduced branching morphogenesis, loss of the acinar cell phenotype (amylase expression) and an enhancement in endocrine differentiation (insulin and glucagon expression). We propose that in the absence of Notch signalling the proendocrine gene Ngn 3 is no longer repressed by the Notch target Hes 1, allowing endocrine differentiation to take place. Finally we observed that β-cells in pancreata treated with DAPT are functionally more mature in terms of responsiveness to glucose stimulation. Overall these results have important implications for the development of potential therapies in the treatment of liver failure and diabetes...|$|R
40|$|The common {{observation}} of pathological specimens of human endocrine pancreas has repeatedly raised questions. Among those, one is recurrent: {{what is the}} mechanism underlying the adaptation of the human endocrine pancreas to face the increased or lowered needs of insulin, does it solely rely on changes in β cell function or does it also depend on changes in the β cell mass; in other words, {{the question is whether}} and <b>how</b> the endocrine <b>pancreas</b> is able to undergo hyperplasia and atrophy in relation to the changes in insulin needs and whether the endocrine pancreas could be considered as a “plastic” organ? Among the rationales that generate these questions are the analyses of the pancreases of infants suffering from persistent hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia bearing a focal lesion hypersecreting insulin. Surprisingly, this localized abnormal insulin hypersecretion seems to induce the resting and atrophy of the islets of Langerhans located in the healthy part of the pancreas. No experimental model was adapted to the study of this pathology and of the mechanisms underlying atrophy of the normal islets surrounding the abnormal source of insulin hypersecretion and recovery after its resection. The purpose of this thesis has been to develop and characterize a model inducing plasticity of β cells. This model had to be flexible, specific to β cells and convenient for the study of β cell plasticity, defined as the dynamic adjustment of β cell mass and function to ensure normoglycemia through changing metabolic circumstances (Kargar and Ktorza 2008). We developed a model based on the implantation of insulin pellets inducing hyperinsulinaemia and concomitant profound atrophy of β cells. After the removal of these insulin implants, an impressive and rapid reconstitution of β cell mass occurred, mainly achieved through the replication of pre-existing β cells. We then decided to investigate whether regenerative mechanisms, in addition to the replication of pre-existing β cells, would require the reactivation of transcription factors that recapitulate the molecular events of embryogenesis and lead to the sequential differentiation of islet cells. Consequently, we explored the expression of several of these transcription factors using real-time PCR (RTqPCR) after laser capture microdissection (LCM) allowing a selective isolation of islets from surrounding cells in tissue sections. These findings were correlated with cellular localisation of the proteins revealed by immunofluorescence technique(SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic surgery, and to {{some degree}} the {{surgeons}} who specialize in pancreatic surgery, has had an almost mythical 9 ̆ 7 if not mystical 9 ̆ 7 quality imbued to it. The oft quoted warnings about staying away from the pancreas and the general jitters that some people get when confronted with these problems have served to reinforce {{the idea that there is}} something fundamentally different about the pancreas. I cannot say that I have witnessed any concerted effort to dispel such notions, and I may have seen a few people try very hard to reinforce the idea. And in some ways that may have been a good thing. Our understanding of <b>how</b> the <b>pancreas</b> works, <b>how</b> it fails to function properly, who is at greater risk for developing pancreatic disorders, and who is best capable of treating people who have pancreatic diseases continues to unfold at a refreshingly rapid pace. In this issue, an excellent series of reviews are provided that should well acquaint the reader with what we currently believe to be true regarding benign disorders of the pancreas. For those of you who like to hear the other shoe drop, we expect to include in a future issue a similarly comprehensive review of what we know about malignant disorders of the pancreas. Over the past twenty years or so, there have been tremendous advances in our capacity to diagnose and treat patients who have pancreatic disorders. Along with this increase in knowledge, there has been a concerted effort to 9 ̆ 3 centralize, 9 ̆ 4 (for lack of a better word) by some and to limit the care of these patients to certain locations. The motivations of those who have supported this effort, in my opinion, have been to maximize benefit to the individual patient and to the collective group of patients at large. Yet, there are some who could look upon this 9 ̆ 3 centralization 9 ̆ 4 as a 9 ̆ 3 restraint of trade 9 ̆ 4 issue. And since the practice of medicine and delivery of health care are still private industries, legislative fiat is limited in how much it can do to enforce such matters. The evolution of thinking on who should deliver complex and unusual services for patients who have pancreatic diseases has moved along in parallel track to the development of our improved understanding. For a period of time it was suggested that institutional volume was the sole determinant of who could best provide care. Subsequently, it would appear that individual volume (of surgeons, at least) is probably a better predictor, though we don't really know what the actual volume of patients should be. It never made sense to me that a surgeon who has a high volume pancreatic experience in one facility would become less capable if he or she moved to another facility. Nor did it make sense that if a hospital had a high overall volume of a given procedure that a 9 ̆ 3 low volume 9 ̆ 4 surgeon would derive 9 ̆ 3 institutional benefit 9 ̆ 4 for performing procedures infrequently unless the operative part of the patient's care was not really that important. It would therefore stand to reason that there are probably some features of surgeons that are important (something I think most people who perform these procedures often would agree with), and there are some institutional features that are important, as they may influence not only the care of the patient in 9 ̆ 3 non-operative 9 ̆ 4 situations but may also impact the ability of the surgeon to develop a high volume practice. The traditional concept of the general surgeon has been one of an 9 ̆ 3 in-charge 9 ̆ 4, individually responsible physician. We construct our training that way. The American Board of Surgery still instructs those of us who give the certifying exams to tell the candidates that 9 ̆ 3 their consultants are all unavailable. 9 ̆ 4 But the more realistic viewpoint is that we are all parts of a system in which overall system performance is becoming, if not already, more important that individual performance. Surely, the weak link in the chain theory holds true in such cases, but one link does not make much of chain 9 ̆ 7 strong link or otherwise. We as surgeons are most likely at a point where, if we want better operative outcomes for either individual patients or for collective groups of patients, we shall need to expend as much energy trying to improve the system lines that we work in as much as improve our own skill sets. Pancreatic surgery lends itself well to these challenges. The discipline relies heavily on diagnostic imaging, endoscopic evaluation and treatment, metabolic and physiologic support, behavioral counseling, operative expertise (not just from the surgeon but from the entire operative team), anesthetic care, and, in some cases, perioperative critical care. Many of these associated disciplines have their own volume-to-expertise ratios that have to be considered as well. All of these disciplines are associated with fixed basal costs to maintain appropriate staffing and equipment capitalization to offer competitive quality services. The availability of adequate patient volume and revenue generation to sustain a full-time supra-critical mass of all the key clinical elements in a service-line model for the care of patients who have pancreatic diseases is probably the major determinant of where pancreatic surgery could be practiced. Maintaining adequate resources to achieve outcomes that are competitive with the 9 ̆ 3 best practices 9 ̆ 4 that are available at a finically acceptable burden will probably be the major barrier for most institutions to clear in order to participate in this type of care. Individual focus and study as well as concentrating the challenging problems in the hands of fewer people who are willing to fully commit to their best solution for the patient has carried us a long way. As much as some of us might like to think that the discipline of pancreatic surgery is best characterized as 9 ̆ 3 one riot, one ranger 9 ̆ 4 (the motto of the Texas Rangers,) the reality is that we need to be a part 9 ̆ 7 an important part, no doubt, but a part of a larger team if we expect to be competitive with the best performing groups. The issue that Dr. Behrman has assembled should well familiarize the reader with the current state of understanding of benign pancreatic disorders. I am personally grateful to him for assuming the duties of editing this issue, as he did it on short notice as a favor. I would also like to acknowledge his other contributions to our country through his service in the United States Navy while activated as a reservist during the initial phases of this current military conflict.
