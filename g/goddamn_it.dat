500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. <b>Goddamn!</b> <b>It</b> feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E

5000|$|Within days of release, {{controversy}} surrounded this album, revolving {{especially around}} anti-homosexual subject matter. This November 11 article published on AllHipHop.com pointed {{out some of}} the objectionable lyrics on the album, such as “... He’s a fucking faggot so I’m lettin’ off my AK/Bust ‘em in his forehead/He ain’t worth lettin’ live/A man and man shouldn’t raise another man’s kids!” In discussing the album, Trick Trick remarks that “Homosexuals are probably not going to like this album. But it's okay, I don't want their faggot money any <b>goddamn</b> way. <b>It’s</b> just that every time that you turn on the TV, that sissy shit is on, and they act like it's fucking okay...and I address that issue.

5000|$|George Starostin {{retrospectively}} reviewed The Psychomodo album for his website, writing: [...] "...Fortunately, after testing our {{patience with}} these lumpy monsters, the album picks up steam {{again with the}} remaining three songs - the mock-sentimental [...] "Bed in the Corner", the amazing, crazy-violin-heavy 'Sling It!', and the romantic, soothing finale in the [...] "Tumbling Down" [...] ballad where you won't understand a single line {{until you get to}} the plaintive 'oh dear, what have they done to the blues?' coda. If anything, though, the song is so <b>goddamn</b> beautiful <b>it</b> serves as a perfect example of lyrics not being important. At all. More of that gorgeous orchestration that made [...] "Death Trip" [...] such a wallop. An anthemic singalong which causes you to join in even if you don't know what the hell you're doing." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Fall Dog Bombs the Moon" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} David Bowie in 2003 for his album Reality. According to Bowie himself {{at the time of}} the album release, [...] "It came from reading an article about Kellogg Brown & Root, a {{subsidiary}} of Halliburton, the company that Dick Cheney used to run. Basically, Kellogg Brown & Root got the job of cleaning up Iraq. What tends to happen is that a thing like an issue or a policy manifests itself as a guide. It becomes a character of some kind, like the one in Fall Dog. There's this guy saying, 'I'm goddamn rich'. You know, 'Throw anything you like at me, baby, because I'm <b>goddamn</b> rich. <b>It</b> doesn't bother me.' It's an ugly song sung by an ugly man. So it was definitely about corporate and military power." ...|$|R
2500|$|LaLanne {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, the son of Jennie (née Garaig; 1882–1973) and Jean/John LaLanne (1881–1939), French {{immigrants}} from Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Both entered the U.S. in the 1880s as young children at the Port of New Orleans. LaLanne had two older brothers, Ervil, who died in childhood (1906–1911), and Norman (1908–2005), who nicknamed him [...] "Jack". He grew up in Bakersfield, California and later moved {{with his family to}} Berkeley, California circa 1928. In 1939, his father {{died at the age of}} 58 in a San Francisco hospital, which LaLanne attributed to [...] "coronary thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver". In his book The Jack LaLanne Way to Vibrant Health, LaLanne wrote that as a boy he was addicted to sugar and junk food. He had violent episodes directed against himself and others, describing himself as [...] "a miserable <b>goddamn</b> kid ... <b>it</b> was like hell".|$|R
5000|$|I had {{to decide}} whether we should risk the loss of maybe a dozen {{airplanes}} and crews just to get one man out. Finally I said to myself, <b>Goddamn</b> <b>it,</b> {{the one thing that}} keeps our boys motivated is the certain belief that if they go down, we will do absolutely everything we can to get them out. If that is ever in doubt, morale would tumble. That was my major consideration. So I took it on myself. I didn't ask anybody for permission. I just said, [...] "Go do it!" ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{motives for}} turning {{informer}} {{seem to have}} been purely financial: he was a poor man, and remarked that [...] "he was fit for no trade but an informer". His later change of stance he justified by saying that [...] "if the Protestants deserted him, <b>goddamn</b> <b>it</b> he would not starve." [...] Family loyalty seems to have been no part of his character: during his career as a priest-hunter he attempted to arrest a priest at the home of his brother Christopher at Sker, although Christopher would in theory be liable to the death penalty for harbouring a priest as a result.|$|E

5000|$|Former host Barbara Frum once {{interview}}ed Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. Another well-remembered {{interview was}} with a hard-of-hearing but imperturbable British farmer who had grown a prize-winning giant cabbage. The 1976 interview was conducted by an increasingly frustrated Frum, who could not get the farmer to give any kind of coherent replies to her straightforward questions; by mid-interview, Frum was stuck repeatedly asking the question [...] "What did you feed your cabbage?" [...] a little bit louder each time. Exasperated, she finally asks him [...] "WHAT. DID. YOU. FEED. THE. <b>GODDAMN.</b> CABBAGE?". [...] <b>It</b> is still occasionally played as an amusing interlude on the show, {{as well as on}} CBC Radio's afternoon series Rewind.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1998 essay for Mirabella, Burleigh {{described}} an occasion aboard Air Force One {{when she noticed}} President Bill Clinton apparently looking at her legs. The piece led to her being described as [...] "the Ally McBeal of former White House reporters" [...] by columnist Ellen Goodman. Approached by a Washington Post media reporter to discuss the Mirabella article, Burleigh stated, “I {{would be happy to}} give him a blowjob just to thank him for keeping abortion legal. I think American women should be lining up with their Presidential kneepads on to show their gratitude for keeping the theocracy off our backs.” Referring to the comment in a 2007 piece for The Huffington Post, Burleigh wrote, [...] "I said it (back in 1998, but a good quote has eternal life) because I thought it was high time for someone to tweak the white, middle-aged beltway gang taking Clinton to task for sexual harassment. These men had neither the personal experience nor the credentials to know sexual harassment when they saw it, nor to give a good <b>goddamn</b> about <b>it</b> if they did. The insidious use of sexual harassment laws to bring down a president for his pro-female politics was the context in which I spoke." ...|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{combination}} of two words: jumala, meaning god, and auta, meaning help (verb, imperative 2nd person). It is used in a similar fashion to Oh my God/God help (me)! In Finnish it has the same slightly frustrated emphasis. Another translation for Oh, God is Voi luoja (luoja = the creator, a synonym for God). An ad campaign for Church aid for third world countries used JumalAuta as an eyecatcher. This raised discussion for being too profane. The English expression God help me is an accurate (and literal) translation of jumalauta. However, since this lacks the undertones of profanity, a translation to <b>goddamn</b> <b>it</b> may be considered more correct. Often used replacement words are jumankauta, jumaliste or jumalavita.|$|E

[...] -Reggie Williams The National Task Force on AIDS {{prevention}} started as a project of the chapter of National Association of Black and White Men Together in San Francisco in 1985. Reggie Williams invited the representatives of various AIDS organization to his home after a BWMT presentation to discuss the lack of prevention aimed at gay men of color. Reggie Williams was the Executive Director of NTFAP from its birth until his retirement in February 1994. Randy Miller succeeded Williams [...] In 1996, Angel Fabian co-organized the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention's first Gay/Bisexual Young Men of Color Summit at Gay Men of Color Conference, Miami, Florida.

5000|$|Test Pilot brought {{together}} {{three of the}} most bankable Hollywood stars of the period, but while Loy and Gable became friends, an uneasy relationship existed between Tracy and Gable. Tracy was aware his male co-star, and tacitly the lead actor, was awed by acting with him, and proceeded to steal as many scenes as possible, including the lengthy death scene in the doomed aircraft. At the climax of another lengthy take where he was cradling his comrade's head in his arms, Gable was reported to have said, [...] "Die, <b>goddamn</b> <b>it,</b> Spence! I wish to Christ you would!" [...] and dropped Tracy’s head with a thud. Principal photography took place from December 1, 1937, to February 18, 1938, at MGM studios and on location at Van Nuys, California, Lindbergh Field (San Diego), March Field, California, and at the Cleveland National Air Races, with retakes on March 30 to early April 1938. Test Pilot utilized authentic United States Army Air Corps airfield settings and was able to obtain rights to film using Boeing's new Y1B-17, which was destined to become the progenitor of the wartime B-17 bomber series. The Drake Bullet was actually the SEV-S2 NR70Y, a modified civilian racer version of the U.S. Army Air Corps P-35. The other test aircraft that is flown to its top diving speed is a Northrop A-17 attack bomber. Renowned movie stunt pilot Paul Mantz served as the second unit director in charge of the flying sequences. Although uncredited, real-life test pilot Sammy Wroath did the flying sequences.|$|E
500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{returned}} to touring, playing larger venues, receiving more profit {{and dealing with}} less friendship, miscommunication, and spiraling drug problems. This culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with the Grateful Dead at Washington's RFK Stadium in June 1973, {{which resulted in the}} firing of three of the band's longtime roadies. The band played arenas and stadiums almost solely as their drug use escalated. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting the Starship, a customized Boeing 720B used by Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. [...] "When [...] got that <b>goddamn</b> plane, <b>it</b> {{was the beginning of the}} end," [...] said Allman. Both Allman and Betts released top-20 solo albums in 1974 (The Gregg Allman Tour and Highway Call). The sessions that produced 1975's Win, Lose or Draw, the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent; Gregg Allman was largely living in Los Angeles and dating pop star Cher, and was, according to biographer Alan Paul, [...] " [...] more famous for being famous than for his music." [...] His vocals were recorded there, as he could not be bothered to return to Macon much. Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were [...] "embarrassed" [...] about the album.|$|R

[...] In his 2012 preview of Street Fighter X Tekken, Nate Ming of Crunchyroll described Marshall and Paul Phoenix as [...] "get-rich-quick schemers". Sam Loveridge of Digital Spy ranked Marshall eighth in his 2016 selection of the nineteen [...] "absolute worst" [...] character names in video gaming, despite describing him as [...] "badass". In a 2014 interview, Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist actor Joey Ansah singled out Law in his criticism {{of the evolution of}} the Tekken series' storytelling: [...] "All these things started off as kind of Fist of the North Star sensibilities and they've ended up as this kind of comedy-slapstick almost pastiche of itself ...

5000|$|The Entertainer {{is talking}} to his {{alliance}} and thinks Tailor Made is a snake for hiding his alliance behind Entertainers back. Tailor Made, meanwhile, talks to his alliance and tells them to keep the alliance a secret. The next day, The Entertainer is chosen for captain for the Green Team, while Ice is the captain for the Gold Team. When the contestants arrive at the challenge site, Craig tells them that back by popular demand, the contestants will be doing the Chicken-A-Pult, first done last year. The challenge, like last year, is based on when Hottie from Flavor of Love cooked Flavs mother a raw chicken and was eliminated soon after. Four {{people will have to}} catch the flying chickens that are launched by the catapult, while three people have to build and launch the catapult. On the Gold Team, Ice, Prancer, and Buckwild are the builders, while Heat, 20 Pack, Bonez, and Tailor Made are the catchers. The Gold Team gets their catapult put up first, but the chicken is launched backwards. On the Green Team, The Entertainer catches the first chicken. The Gold Team continues launching the chickens, but they keep going the wrong way. Entertainer keeps catching the chickens, but on the third catch, the chicken slams into his ribs, but he soldiers on, catching two more chickens, but stalls on his last one, but then finally places it on the plate, meaning the Green Team has won their first challenge. At the house, Prancer admits being caught between the two alliances, and isnt sure what to do yet. Inside the vault, everybody in the secret alliance (Ice, Tailor Made, Prancer and Bonez) vote Buckwild, Heat, and 20 Pack into the box. Unhappy seeing his alliance members in the box, The Entertainer gets mad at Tailor Made, as do Buckwild and Heat. Buckwild tells Tailor Made that she will throw every challenge until Tailor Made is off the show, to which Tailor Made just mutters, [...] "Okay." [...] Heat throws a fit and kicks things. Before going on the Power Outing, Heat and 20 Pack drink a lot of alcohol. On the Power Outing, 20 Pack and Heat are drunk and slur their speech. The Entertainer then thinks Ice may have thrown the challenge, so the rest of the alliance could vote the three into the box. On the one on one time, Entertainer picks Heat. Heat slurs that he may not be a smart man, but he sees that the members on the Gold Team betrayed him and wants them out. Entertainer says in his interview that he loves Heat, but he hates seeing him drunk. Back at the house, The Entertainer asks his team who they want to see go home: 20 Pack, or Heat. Before the vote, Heat cries and says he really wants the money and doesnt want to leave. 20 Pack also cries. Myammee calls both of their pity cases [...] "BS." [...] At elimination, Buckwild is called up and receives her check first, and Buckwild thanks Entertainer with a kiss, which disgusts the other cast mates. The Entertainer calls up 20 Pack, and thinks 20 Pack is the biggest threat, but still doesnt know if he should keep him or not, so he asks the Green team if he should keep him or not. The Green Team says to give 20 Pack the check. The Entertainer agrees and gives him the check, and 20 Pack drops to his knees and cries. 20Pack approaches the Gold Team and spits on the ground and calls them traitors. Heat cries, and The Entertainer feels bad, and hugs him and says hes sorry for getting rid of him again (The Entertainer eliminated Heat on the first season) and Heat raves, [...] "We didn’t come here as friends, but <b>goddamn</b> <b>it,</b> I made a real friendship with you! I respect you, man!" [...] and the rest of their alliance hug Heat. Craig voids Heats check and Heat leaves. In his interview, Entertainer yells and says making him get rid of somebody from his alliance was the final straw and says he will do anything to stay in the house, and the editors edit to make Entertainer blow up for humor effects.|$|E
5000|$|After Duane's death, {{the band}} held {{a meeting on}} their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band {{returned}} to the road. They completed their third studio album, Eat a Peach, that winter, which raised each member's spirits: [...] "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach", said Allman. Eat a Peach was released the following February, and it became the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard album chart. [...] "We’d been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever", Allman recalled. The band purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia, which became a group hangout. Berry Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from {{the death of his}} friend, and in November 1972 he too was killed in a motorcycle crash. [...] "Upset as I was, I kind of breathed a sigh of relief, because Berry’s pain was finally over", Allman said.The band unanimously decided to carry on, and enlisted Lamar Williams on bass and Chuck Leavell on piano. The band began recording Brothers and Sisters, their follow-up album, and Betts became the group's de facto leader during the recording process. Meanwhile, after some internal disagreements, Allman began recording a solo album, which he titled Laid Back. The sessions for both albums often overlapped and its creation caused tension within the rest of the band. Both albums were released in late 1973, with Brothers and Sisters cementing the Allman Brothers' place among the biggest rock bands of the 1970s. [...] "Everything that we'd done before—the touring, the recording—culminated in that one album", Allman recalled. [...] "Ramblin' Man", Betts' country-infused number, rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and gave the band their biggest hit. The group returned to touring, and played arenas and stadiums almost solely. Privately, the group was dealing with miscommunication and spiraling drug problems. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting the Starship, a customized Boeing 720B used by Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.

[...] IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 9/10, giving particular praise to Jamie Dornan's ability to be [...] "magnetic in every scene." [...] Ratcliffe called his backstory her favorite fairytale of the series up to that point.

Gradually, the members of the band grew apart during these tours, with sound checks and rehearsals [...] "becoming a thing of the past." [...] Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate Jimmy Carter (an avowed fan of the group) as the only real [...] "high point" [...] in an otherwise [...] "rough, rough tour." [...] The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use. The [...] "breaking point" [...] came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring. Bandmates considered him a [...] "snitch", and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection. Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received a 75-year prison sentence, which was later reduced prior to a presidential pardon from Carter. For his part, Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal to turn state's evidence and that he (Herring) would take the fall; nevertheless, the band refused to communicate with Allman after the incident. As a result, the band finally broke up; Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level, Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band. The 1976 live album Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas was seen as [...] "the last gasp of a dying band," [...] which was unfortunate for the now-foundering Capricorn Records, which desperately needed the band together to stay afloat.|$|R
