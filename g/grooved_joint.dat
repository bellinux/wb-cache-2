50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and <b>grooved</b> <b>joint.</b> When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|E

50|$|Effectiveness of the {{insulation}} {{of a building}} envelope can be compromised by gaps resulting from shrinkage of individual panels. Manufacturing criteria require that shrinkage be limited to less than 1% (previously 2%).

Although “deceptively simple-looking,” Jackson’s design for the Library Chair features compound curves, a hidden Tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> between seat and back planes that bend in different directions, and arms that are joined to both the back legs and seat back on either side. The CNC cutter’s ability to move though complex cutting operations, switching tools as needed, enabled Jackson’s woodworkers to shape the chair’s components efficiently and with precision. Doing this work in-house at his factory in Long Island City allowed Jackson to produce the chair at a low unit cost and sell the chair at a competitive price.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} residence is {{a single}} storeyed timber building facing north with a rectangular plan and verandahs lining the two long sides. Part of the verandah has been closed in creating additional rooms. The main gabled roof is clad with corrugated iron and reduces in pitch at the verandah line. The timber construction technique is unusual, without visible horizontal support and using very high quality and well finished cedar slabs. The foundations of the building are a system of load-bearing bed logs that support floor joists and tongue and groove timber floors. The single skinned wall construction comprises regular 2 inch thick cedar boards measuring about 10 inches wide, joined with beaded tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>joints</b> and fixed into the foundations below the floor boards and into the ceiling joists above the ceiling, resulting {{in the absence of}} visible horizontal timber members.

An intervention of rehabilitation of the bridge led to a reinforcement of the existing hinges with the coupling of new metallic devices: new tongue and groove hinges were applied, that by one side allow the horizontal displacements and rotation, by the other side strongly reduce the relative vertical displacements of the two parts of the bridge. A dynamic test campaign was set up in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. The principal dynamic parameters were calculated and analysed with respect to the intervention that was realized. The tests clearly showed the effectiveness of the intervention, and helped the designer to have a better understanding of the structural behaviour of the bridge...|$|R
5000|$|Cabinet body. The cabinet carcase {{is usually}} made from plywood or {{high-quality}} particle board, particularly for flat sections {{that do not}} need to be shaped, such as shelves, cabinet sides, or drawer bottoms. Typical plywood thickness in these applications varies from 3/8 in to 3/4 in 1/4 in. Stiffness and strength are important factors since cabinets are expected to retain their shape over time and avoid bend or sag while continuing to support a heavy load. The best choices for strength are plywood and higher-quality particle board; they also have the benefit of being less susceptible to warping from moisture. Stiffness increases rapidly with shelf thickness; regardless of material choice, a 3/4 in shelf is 73% stiffer than a 5/8 in shelf, even though it is only 20% thicker. Shelves made of some particle board formulations, especially where not reinforced, may sag or deform. Particle board strength and rigidity varies by formulation and is determined by the resin used. Plywood carcases are usually assembled with screws and nails while particle board carcases do not hold screws or nails as well and therefore are typically joined with glue, <b>groove</b> <b>joints,</b> or mechanical fasteners such as confirmat-cam assemblies. Generally, plywood-carcase cabinets are more expensive than particle-board-carcase cabinets.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} was undertaken {{to examine the}} suitability of pulsed current {{gas metal arc welding}} of 12 mm thick P 91 steels in <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> configurations with metal cored filler wire. Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the groove angle. The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a groove angle of 75 degrees. The use of metal cored filler wires could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the solid wires. Overall, the present study showed that the pulsed current gas metal arc welding of medium to high thickness P 91 steels using metal cored filler wires could provide higher deposition rate and welding speed, and enhanced weld bead properties in comparison to solid wires.

However, the properties, particularly fracture toughness, of the weld are often inferior when compared to base material. This project evaluated the use of narrow groove gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to improve weld material properties. The welding procedures were developed for ASTM A 508 Class 4 base material using a 1 % Ni filler material complying to AWS Specification A. 23 - 90 -EF 3 -F 3 -N. A narrow <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> preparation was used in conjunction with the GTAW process so competitive fabrication rates could be achieved when compared to the ASAW process. Weld procedures were developed to refine weld substructure to achieve better mechanical properties. Two heaters of weld wire were used {{to examine the effects of}} minor filler metal chemistry differences on weld mechanical properties. Extensive metallographic evaluations showed excellent weld quality with a refined microstructure. Chemical analysis of the weld metal showed minimal weld dilution by the base metal. Mechanical testing included bend and tensile tests to ensure weld quality and strength. A Charpy impact energy curve versus temperature and fracture toughness curve versus temperature were developed for each weld wire heat. Results of fracture toughness and Charpy impact testing indicated an improved transition temperature closer to that of the base material properties...|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Lightweight structural sandwich panels made of two thin steel facings, {{which are}} bonded {{to a relatively}} thick and light insulating mineral wool core, are often used for wall claddings. The sandwich panel clad structures are frequently weakened by cut-outs and openings for doors, windows, and in other cases. If the resistance of remaining cross-section of a weakened panel is not sufficient an additional load-bearing support of adjacent panels through the longitudinal joints must be activated. The paper concerns effects of large openings on load-bearing capacity and structural stiffness of sandwich panel claddings. Since {{it is not possible}} to give generally acceptable rules to evaluate their complex structural behaviour at the present time this research project was conducted using finite element models to study the local and global behaviour for a certain sandwich panel product and a certain design examples. Firstly, a finite element model of double interlocking tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> between neighbouring panels was built to study behaviour of the panel-to-panel connection.

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} heat {{transfer}} phenomena in fusion welding process can provide important physical insight on {{the mechanism of}} weld pool development, and compute temperature field and final weld dimensions fairly reliably in several welding systems. In particular, the conduction heat transfer based numerical models are relatively simpler and computationally inexpensive {{in comparison to the}} comprehensive heat transfer and fluid flow models although the later can undertake greater physical attributes in weld pool. One significant requirement of the conduction heat transfer based models is the predetermination of a volumetric source term to account for the heat input from the welding heat source. We present here two efficient approaches to define the volumetric heat source term which do not require a-priori information of the final weld joint dimensions, which has always remained a difficult task. The first approach involves an intrinsic mapping of the heat source geometry with the numerically computed melt pool dimensions within the framework of modeling calculations in an iterative manner and is validated for the prediction of final weld dimensions in autogenous gas tungsten arc welds with butt joint geometry. The other approach involves an analytical estimation of the volumetric source term as function of only the welding conditions and the initial weld joint geometry and is examined successfully for the prediction of weld pool dimensions and thermal cycles in tandem submerged arc welds with typical <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> geometry...|$|R
30|$|A {{short arc}} is suited to {{applications}} that require low heat input, {{and it allows}} the joining of thin materials and sheet metals in any position. It {{is a good choice}} when distortion of the construction needs to be minimized. It is suitable for grooved welds as the root pass or for filling the gaps of joints, {{as well as for the}} root pass of open <b>groove</b> <b>joints</b> and plate <b>groove</b> welds. The short arc mode is widely used in the pipe industry and very applicable to root pass welds in pipes. It can be utilized with carbon steel with 100 % carbon dioxide shielding gas or a blend of a maximum of 25 % CO 2 and a balance of argon. The short arc mode is also applicable to low carbon steel, low alloy steel, and stainless steel with thicknesses between 0.5 and 2.6  mm. However, it is unable to perform welding of aluminium (Deruntz 2003). Although, conventional short arc is used in many applications, its use is limited by high potential excessive spatter generation, fume generation, lack of fusion, lower gap bridgability, and arc instability (Hermans and Ouden 1999; Jenkins et al. 2005). The poor performance of conventional short arc results from the limited ability of the power source to control every sequence of the short circuiting metal transfer mode (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). As a consequence of this limitation, conventional short arc is being progressively replaced by controlled short arc in root-pass sheet metal welding.|$|R

In the CTS, one of the joints providing linear motion is designed and fabricated with a linkage (telescoping inner strut (TIS)) in two halves, split along its neutral plane, to allow machining of the internal geometry. To support the dynamic, kinematic and aerodynamic loads induced, the two halves must be welded together while maintaining high tolerances on the inner geometry. The designed weld areas on the neutral plane require a penetration of 17. 1 mm from each face in 17 - 4 precipitation hardening (PH) martensitic stainless steel (SS). Using conventional joining techniques, such as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, the fabrication of a thick section requires a V <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> design and multiple passes to achieve the required penetration. However, exposure to a substantial heat input through this process renders large weld and heat affected zones on either face of the strut as well as distortion of the component, which poses considerable difficulties for assembly and motion. The application of a high energy density technique, namely electron beam (EB) welding, was utilized to penetrate the thick section with a single pass, while minimizing the weld region, heat affected zone (HAZ) and distortion of the strut (low heat input).
