40|$|The work {{presented}} follows {{an initial}} study into {{a method for}} the 3 -dimensional (3 D) scanning of an electrical contact surface, while in physical contact with a <b>glass</b> <b>plane.</b> The method allows the measurement of contact force and the associated contact area {{in contact with the}} glass. A new test apparatus is presented which allows improved control of the contact force and improved analysis of the contact area. The materials investigated include Ag and Cu contact surfaces and a multi-walled carbon nano-tube-Au composite surface. The methodology uses a con-focal laser scanner with 2 ?m spot size and 10 nm resolution to measure the contact surface height (Z) through the <b>glass</b> <b>plane.</b> A levelling procedure is used to ensure that the true contact region is measured, and a data grid resolution of 0. 1 ?m in the X,Y plane is used to identify the contact regions. The contact asperities are identified and compared with measurements using an AFM probe. The results are used to provide input data to the Greenwood-Williamson model for contact mechanics...|$|E

For this gridshell structure the common kitchen sieve was the inspiration: its quadratic mesh grid can be transformed into any desired geometry by altering the mesh grid into a rhombus shape. In combination with a diagonal cable net, the grid transforms into an ideal shell. Clad with glass panes, {{the result is a}} lightweight, transparent roof. The glass panes lie directly on the grid beams, thereby merging the load-bearing structure and <b>glass</b> <b>planes.</b> This serves to eliminate the typically necessary secondary structure.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{solid-state}} {{synthesis of}} AuNP dimers cross-linked with NDT molecules occurred directly on a glass surface coated by amine terminated molecules. These dimers have interparticle spacing {{determined by the}} length of NDT molecule. The orientation of the dimers on a glass surface is different. Major numbers of dimers are parallel {{to the surface of}} <b>glass</b> <b>plane,</b> while others have tilted orientation. This morphology of chemically attached dimers led to broadening of UV-visible absorption spectra and appearing of features in spectra of polarization difference ρ(λ) under different angles of incident light. The growing number of AuNP dimers leads to broadening of LSPR band due to dominating influence of interparticle plasmon coupling that caused by decreasing of interparticle distance.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of three drawing aids, the photograph, the <b>glass</b> <b>plane,</b> and the mirror, for use by students working with three-dimensional space representation. Four groups of eight students each were formed from two classes of AED- 100 (Drawing and Painting). They were freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior students, {{all of whom were}} non-art majors enrolled at Ball State University. Students in each of three experimental groups worked with a drawing aid, and students in a control group worked under the same studio-lab conditions but without aids. During the experiment, each student worked individually and completed a total of five drawings of two different still-life models. The models were simple three dimensional forms painted different shades of gray forbetter visibility. The general objectives of the research were related to the experimenter's expectancy that he would arrive at a -better understanding of the drawing process through the experience of observation and reflection during, as well as after the completion of, the experiment. This was the "soft" research and was the part "... conceived of by him whom it (was) not conceived of... " as mentioned in the Kena-Upanishad (D. T. Suzuki, Zen Buddhism, 1956). More specifically, the research was directed toward four major objectives: 1. the use and evaluation of a particular application of the drawing aids, along with a comparison of the effectiveness of the aids in teaching perspective drawing, 2. the rating of the instructional aids by comparison of gains within and between experimental categories, 3. the investigation of whether or not participation in the experiment noticeably influenced student preference for Renaissance linear perspective, and 4. the evaluation of the drawing experiment from the student's point of view through an interview. The findings of the study follow: 1. The control group working without technical aids improved the most on the drawing task. This was true when the student was compared to all others in the study and when his pre-test was compared to his post-test drawing. 2. Of the three aids tested in this study, the <b>glass</b> <b>plane</b> was the most helpful. The students in this group showed the most improvement when compared to all others using aids as well as when each individual's pre-test was compared to his post-test drawing. 3. The students found the <b>glass</b> <b>plane</b> and mirror techniques easiest to learn. 4. The mirror and <b>glass</b> <b>plane</b> appear to be useful aids for demonstrating 5. This study indicates that the students who looked at the model directly and simply drew did better than those who used the three aids. Therefore, it was concluded that the drawing aids as used {{in the context of this}} study were of no benefit. 6. The study suggests novelty, surprise, freshness, and the feeling of doing something significant are conducive to drawing improvement. 7. The attitudes of the students toward the study were positive. Students were highly motivated and interested in improving their drawing competencies. The investigator believes that the circumstances of this study would be ideal "routine" conditions for teaching and learning in art. 8. Participation in the experiment did not noticeably influence student preference for Renaissance linear perspective. 9. In exploring student preferences for drawing styles, a general preference for linear perspective was indicated when sixty-two percent of the students' choices were in favor of linear perspective and thirty-eight percent in favor of distorted perspective. 10. The variation of responses found in relation to "standardized directions" along with the students' inability to describe a troublesome ellipse problem suggest a relationship between descriptive verbal ability, perception and drawing ability [...] a relationship worth more investigation. The researcher believes the three drawing aids investigated in this study might be valuable in the regular classroom for direct instructional purposes. The experimenter noted many "openings" for instruction while students worked in the lab. It is possible that the drawing aids would be useful in clarifying a student's problems in drawing, thus enabling the instructor to be of assistance. As for the open-ended aspect of this research, the investigator's notions of "arriving at a better understanding of the drawing process by way of reflection and observation" [...] it can be said that this was achieved, in part.

Fagan's {{knowledge}} of boat {{building and the}} compromises {{that need to be}} reached between weight and durability versus speed has {{played a significant role in}} his material choices. He often employs the flitch beam where larger spans would make the size of timber uneconomical and bulky, as at House Mitchell (2005). Here he combines timber with plate steel to form rafters. He also employs cross beams to limit the size of rafters. The positions of these cross beams also help to define and demarcate spaces.

40|$|Reducing {{the price}} of solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems {{has been a constant}} challenge. Despite recent advances, solar PV systems are still more costly than conventional energy resources. For the first time, this study examines the effectiveness of three different structures/materials: (i) silvered <b>glass</b> <b>plane</b> mirror; (ii) convex spherical mirrors; and (iii) aluminum (Al) foil as reflector. Comparative analysis of four different cooling techniques, i. e., water sprinkling system, passive heat sink method, active air fan method, and closed loop method, for enhancement of output power was performed. A novel Bi reflector solar PV system (BRPVS) was suggested to control the working of the reflectors. The Al foil enhanced the power output compared to the others. In addition, the effect of using a reflector on the temperature of a solar PV system was studied. High operating temperatures resulted in a decrease in the maximum output power under the same solar radiation conditions. The combined enhancement of the output power by both Al foil BRPVS system and cooling system was almost 22. 75 – 38. 55 %. An optimal control algorithm to use cooling and BRPVS in an efficient manner is described...|$|E
40|$|Glass frit bonding is an {{universal}} technique with intermediate {{glass layer}} for the packaging of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The joining of two wafers {{is required to}} protect surfaced micro-machined structures during fabrication and use. The object {{of this paper is}} to investigate numerically the influence of the bonding process on the generated residual stress in the glass frit layer of a typical chip. The residual stresses are caused by different coefficients of thermal expansion of the frit glass and the silicon wafer. A determination of the stress level is required, since the residual stress can influence the properties of the capped micro-machined structures and also the long-term reliability of the bond frame. A parameterized Finite Element (FE) model of a typical chip structure was developed which consists of a silicon device wafer, the glass frit layer and a silicon cap wafer with a cavity. Frame width and thickness of the glass, also called seal glass were varied. It was shown, that significant stresses (a bout 100 MPa) occur in the plane of seal glass in cause of cooling after bonding. The influence of bond pressure is rather small. The residual stresses have to consider if further mechanical stresses are investigated. So a tension test normal to the seal <b>glass</b> <b>plane</b> was superposed with the residual stresses. The location of maximum stresses could be shown and it was in agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Laminated {{glass is}} {{comprised}} of multiple glass plates coupled together in a sandwich construction {{through the use of}} a polymorphous interlayer that acts as a bonding agent between the glass plates. Laminated glass offers several advantages over monolithic glass including the ability to resist post fracture collapse, improved sound insulation, lower ultraviolent light trans-mission, and improved thermal insulation. Because the stiffness of the interlayer is often many orders of magnitude less than that of the <b>glass,</b> <b>plane</b> sections prior to loading do not remain plane throughout the laminate?s thickness after load is applied. The behavior of laminated glass is controlled by the stiffness of the interlayer. This behavior rules out the use of classical theoretical formulations for thin plates. In such cases, it is necessary to use specially formulated equations or finite element analyses to evaluate the performance of laminated glass. Previous attempts have been made to develop procedures to quantify the interlayer stiffness for use in laminated glass design. However, there is no widely accepted technique that can be referenced for use. It is known that the interlayer stiffness is a function of both temperature and load duration. The primary objective of this thesis is to formalize a standard procedure to estimate the in situ interlayer shear modulus through the use of nondestructive testing. Physical experiments were carried out on simply supported laminated glass beams subject to three point loading in a temperature controlled environmental testing chamber. Strains and temperatures were recorded as a function of time. These data were used in combination with results from finite element analyses to quantify the variation of the interlayer stiffness as a function of temperature and load duration for a given laminated glass beam. This procedure was applied to three common types of interlayer materials: freshly man-factured polyvinyl butyral (PVB), over a decade old PVB, and freshly manufactured SentryGlas Plus (SGP). Results from these efforts provide specific design guidance for laminated glass that incorporates these interlayer materials. Further, the procedure was applied to various data presented in open literature by previous researchers. In addition, a standardized procedure to estimate interlayer stiffness is provided for the development of additional interlayer properties as required...|$|E
