One specific paper cutout can be mathematically described as the so-called Aztec Diamond, and a way to cover it with dominoes is a domino tiling. In this snapshot we revisit some of the seminal combinatorial ideas used to enumerate the number of domino tilings of the Aztec Diamond. The existing connection with the study of the so-called alternating-sign matrices is also explored. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|The Japanese kusudama (薬玉; lit. {{medicine}} ball) is a paper {{model that}} is usually (although not always) created by sewing multiple identical pyramidal units (usually stylized flowers folded from <b>square</b> <b>paper)</b> together through their points to form a spherical shape.

40|$|International audienceThe {{color change}} allows the folder {{to make some}} {{patterns}} appear on a paper with one color on each side. One {{is used for the}} foreground, the other one, for the background. It is typically a folding sequence related to an 'edge effect': Usually, the color cannot change on a model without crossing one edge of the paper. There are some exceptions, but as an edge of the paper is hidden, it cannot be used anymore for color change; consequently, this situation is close to the previous one. When folding a chessboard from an initial <b>square</b> of <b>paper,</b> the color changes are numerous. There are several chessboards folded from a strip of paper, or using modular origami; much less models use a unique <b>square</b> of <b>paper.</b> It is not surprising that a large square is needed for folding (without cutting) a quite small chessboard.

40|$|Suppose {{you have}} a closed curve. How {{do you find the}} area inside? While I was writing my first paper on {{exponential}} sums and lattice points, my seven year old daughter came home from school and said. "I know how you find the area of a curve. You count the squares". In other words, copy the curve onto <b>squared</b> <b>paper</b> and count how many squares lie inside the curve. If you want the area to greater accuracy, use <b>paper</b> with smaller <b>squares.</b> If the side of the squares is 1 /M, and you count N squares, then the area A is approximately N/M 2. As a number theorist I prefer to take the squares as unit squares, the curve as enlarged by a factor M, and the relation as being that N is approximately AM 2. Some squares are inconveniently cut by the curve. When do you count them? Rule 1. Count a square if its centre lies inside. Rule 2. Count a square if its lower left corner lies inside. Rule 3. Count all incomplete squares as half a square. Rules 1 and 2 are really the same rule: if we shift the <b>squared</b> <b>paper</b> by half a unit in the x and y directions, then the corners of the squares are now where th...|$|R

Folding an n × n {{checkerboard}} pattern from a <b>square</b> of <b>paper</b> that is white {{on one side}} and black on the other has been thought for several years to require a <b>paper</b> <b>square</b> of semiperimeter n 2. Indeed, within a restricted class of foldings that match all previous origami models of this flavor, one can prove a lower bound of n 2 (though a matching upper bound was not known). We show how to break through this barrier and fold an n×n checkerboard from a <b>paper</b> <b>square</b> of semiperimeter 1 2 n 2 + O(n). In particular, our construction strictly beats semiperimeter n 2 for (even) n> 16, and for n = 8, we improve on the best seamless folding. ...|$|R
50|$|The term renzuru ("conjoined cranes") {{refers to}} an origami {{technique}} whereby one folds multiple cranes from a single sheet of <b>paper</b> (usually <b>square),</b> employing a number of strategic cuts to form a mosaic of semi-detached smaller squares from the original large <b>square</b> <b>paper.</b> The resulting cranes are attached to one another (e.g., at {{the tips of the}} beaks, wings, or tails) or {{at the tip of the}} body (e.g., a baby crane sitting on its mother's back). The trick is to fold all the cranes without breaking the small paper bridges that attach them to one another or, in some cases, to effectively conceal extra paper.|$|R
