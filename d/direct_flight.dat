5|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like {{heads and}} necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast <b>direct</b> <b>flight.</b> Flocks fly to watering holes {{at dawn and}} dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes.|$|E
5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with <b>direct</b> <b>flight,</b> the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide. Many birds in the Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid <b>direct</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ellinair mainly {{operates}} <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> {{from its}} main base at Thessaloniki International Airport and from Athens International Airport with additional <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> to international destinations from Corfu International Airport and Heraklion International Airport {{during the summer}} leisure season. Also <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> from Thessaloniki International Airport to Cyprus (Larnaka International Airport), Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan.|$|R

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, <b>direct</b> <b>flight</b> muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with its white tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upperwing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upperparts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the royal tern can {{be confused with the}} adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less <b>direct</b> <b>flight</b> pattern and its lack of tail streamers.|$|E
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and <b>direct</b> <b>flight</b> action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Russia's busiest {{international}} {{airports are}} situated near Moscow, St Petersburg, Volgograd, Kazan, Krasnodar, Sochi, and Vladivostok. For more information see {{a list of}} airports in Russia. Moscow and Saint Petersburg are served by <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> from most European capitals, and Moscow also has <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> from any cities in East Asia, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and North America. Countries that have no <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> to Russia include Australia, Canada and Ukraine.|$|R
40|$|Many tourist {{industry}} officials often lobby their {{local governments to}} invest heavily airport infrastructure (e. g. longer runways and larger terminals) {{in order to accommodate}} <b>direct</b> <b>flights.</b> We evaluate the impact of the recent initiation of <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> from the U. S. west coast to Hawaii's neighbor islands, bypassing the previous hub, Honolulu, using interrupted time series analysis. We find a significant, though modest, increase in neighbor island travel. <b>Direct</b> <b>flights</b> may not always generate enough additional travel demand to warrant those investments. ...|$|R
50|$|On August 23, 2010, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Dr. Demuren and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Nigeria attained American Federal Aviation Administration International Aviation Safety Assessment (FAA IASA) Category One Certification. This allows <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> from Nigeria to Continental United States (USA). Prior to his appointment in 2005, there were no <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> between Nigeria and USA. There are now several <b>direct</b> <b>flights</b> between Nigeria and U.S. destinations including Atlanta, New York and Washington, D.C., with services to Houston to begin in November 2011.|$|R
5|$|Later, on 19 June, Chief of Staff al-Hariri led a {{high-ranking}} delegation that included Prime Minister al-Bitar, Aflaq and Education Minister Sami Droubi to Algeria {{for a state}} visit. While al-Hariri was away, the Committee used the opportunity to undertake a purge of about 30 elite officers—mostly political independents—under al-Hariri's command. Al-Hariri was ordered to take a <b>direct</b> <b>flight</b> to the Syrian embassy in the United States, where he was reassigned as the embassy's military attache. Instead, he returned to Syria via a flight to Beirut on 23 June to protest the Committee's move against him. Unsuccessful, he left the country for France in a self-imposed exile on 8 July. The Committee's virtual ousting of al-Hariri was {{to the chagrin of}} al-Bitar, who viewed al-Hariri as the last military counterweight able to check the Committee's domination over his government.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. The airport typically also has a few flights a week leaving Calgary at 8:45 PM and arriving in Penticton {{later on in the}} night, the plane then stays at the Penticton Airport and leaves for Calgary at 7:00 AM and arrives in Calgary around 9:00 AM. However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more <b>direct</b> <b>flight</b> and connection options for travellers. Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the main terminal building as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days coming in and out of Penticton.|$|E
5|$|Biman {{is notable}} for {{disruptions}} to its flight schedule and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for {{its failure to}} maintain flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, {{during the summer of}} 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhaka–London <b>direct</b> <b>flight</b> utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times, Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.|$|E
