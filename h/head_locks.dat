5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using <b>head</b> <b>locks,</b> but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{researches}} {{the necessity}} and possibilities of new/innovative lock gate technologies for future large & high <b>head</b> <b>locks,</b> like the Panama Canal Expansion Project. A historical data analysis has been performed, contemplates over 220 {{of the worlds}} largest locks throughout time, analyzing the development and application of conventional lock gate technologies. From this, the conclusions have been drawn that the required lock gate dimensions {{of a number of}} future projects, fall far outside the application area of current technologies, and that it may not be assumed that conventional technologies will lead to optimal solutions at this scale. In addition, a number of aspects will be highlighted for future large & high head lock gate design, especially reliability, water consumption and its effects on the locks accessibility. A new lock gate technology has been developed specifically attuned to the future dimensions and highlighted requirements resulting into the design of: ‘The Sliding Arch Gate’, an extremely slender gate design, using (tension) arch action to transfer loads to the lock head structure, minimizing recess dimensions and water consumption. In addition, the absence of submerged moving / mechanical parts, minimizes maintenance requirements and the modular design of the gate enhances ease of maintenance, transport and manufacture. The Sliding Arch Gate has been worked out to an operational design level, using the Panama Canal Expansion Project as reference, in order to evaluate its potential performance and to make comparison with conventional technologies. From the evaluation it has been concluded that Sliding Arch Gate will require higher initial investments but that major benefits are achieved by reduced water consumption and low maintenance. The first of which can result into over $ 2, 000 mln. in added revenues for the Panama Canal, during the commercial lifetime of the gate, due to increased lockage capacity. It has thus been concluded that new/innovative technologies, like the Sliding Arch Gate, can outperform up-scaled conventional technologies. However as the design of the Sliding Arch Gate is still in a pioneering stage, there are many optimizations to be found and uncertainties to be investigated.

5000|$|Print {{heads are}} {{available}} in 203 dpi, 300 dpi and 600 dpi resolution options. Each dot is addressed independently and when a dot is electronically addressed it immediately heats up to a pre-set, (adjustable) temperature.

When a dot ‘turns off’ that element of the print head immediately cools down and that part of the ribbon thereby stops melting/printing. As the substrate comes out of the printer it is completely dry and can be used immediately.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Evaluate the {{relationship}} between the postural alignment of the head and possible interference in the view of children. Methods: We evaluated 11 children between 2 and 7 years of age of both sexes, with the visually impaired, who had nystagmus and <b>head</b> <b>lock</b> position. The test Lea Grating Acuity Test&# 174; was used to collect measurements of visual acuity. This applied on two occasions: with and without postural alignment of the head. For reliability of the postural alignment of the head, the slopes were measured by Fisiologic&# 174; software. Results: The children had a poorer performance after physiological postural alignment. This poor performance is possible due to loss of position lock nystagmus to gain postural alignment, said to be ideal. Postural compensations were observed, and sharply increased eyestrain. Conclusion: The pursuit of traditional postural alignment affect the visual response of children with visual impairments...|$|R
