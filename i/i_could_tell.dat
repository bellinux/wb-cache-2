25|$|Several Australian composers {{have written}} sacred music to {{celebrate}} Mary MacKillop. In 2009 Nicholas Buc {{was commissioned by}} the Shire of Glenelg to write an hour-long cantata mass for the centenary {{of the death of}} Mary MacKillop. It was premiered by the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic in Portland, Victoria. The Mass of Mary McKillop is a setting for congregational singing, composed by Joshua Cowie. Hymns specifically used in St Mary of the Cross celebrations including A Saint for Today and Mary MacKillop, Woman of Australia by Josephite Sister Margaret Cusack, and If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Tell</b> The Love of God, In Love God Leads Us and Psalm 103 by Jesuit Priest Christopher Willcock.|$|E
25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|On 9 December 1980 (UK time), whilst {{staying at}} Starr's ex-wife's home, she {{received}} a phone call from Starr, two hours after Lennon had been shot in New York. [...] "The memory of Ringo's words, the sound of his tearful voice crackling over the transatlantic line, is crystal clear: 'Cynthia, I'm so sorry, John's dead'. I had only one clear thought.

Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour {{millions of dollars into}} the pursuit of an atomic bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will." ...|$|E

[...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman."

500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the filming}} of Last Summer, a seagull was killed. [...] "In one scene," [...] Hershey explained, [...] "I had to throw the bird {{in the air to}} make her fly. We had to reshoot the scene over and over again. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the bird was tired. Finally, when the scene was finished, the director, Frank Perry, told me the bird had broken her neck on the last throw." [...] Hershey felt {{responsible}} for the bird's death and changed her stage name to [...] "Seagull" [...] as a tribute to the creature. [...] "I felt her spirit enter me," [...] she later explained. [...] "It was the only moral thing to do." [...] The name change was not positively received. When she was offered a part opposite Timothy Bottoms in The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) (or Vrooder's Hooch), Hershey had to forfeit half her salary, $25,000, to be billed under the name [...] "Seagull" [...] because the producers were not in favor of the billing.|$|E
500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
