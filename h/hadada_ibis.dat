In {{addition}} to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Kongo Ranger Station, a mock up of a safari expedition. Animals in the exhibit include Rodriguez fruit bats, straw-colored fruit bats, Egyptian fruit bats, colobus monkeys, Allen's swamp monkey, <b>hadada</b> <b>ibis,</b> white-faced whistling ducks, slender-snouted crocodile, Nile monitor lizard, lungfish, cichlids, lesser flamingos, geckos, chameleons, African crested porcupines, African clawed frogs, and hooded vultures. The rainforest includes four main areas: the Bamba Du Jon Swamp, which houses the lungfish, cichlids, frogs and reptiles; the rainforest aviary, which houses the birds; the monkey habitat which houses the monkeys and chameleon; and the bat habitat.|$|E

50|$|A large, dark ibis {{with white}} {{shoulder}} patches and white eyes. A thin wattle {{hangs from the}} base of the broad bill. These two features, and no white line on cheek, distinguish this ibis from its close relative the <b>hadada</b> <b>ibis</b> (Bostrychia hagedash). The average length is 60 cm.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hadada</b> or hadeda <b>ibis</b> (Bostrychia hagedash), is an ibis {{found in}} Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R
50|$|The birdlife here is {{varied with}} many records of blue flycatcher, blue-spotted wood dove, harrier hawk, bat hawk, baglafecht weaver, tawny eagle, purple grenadier, sunbird, yellow-billed stork, <b>hadada</b> <b>ibis,</b> African citril, cape turtle dove, paradise flycatcher, yellow white eye, white-browed robin chat, black-headed gonolek, black kite among others.|$|E
50|$|The {{spot-breasted ibis}} is most {{closely related to}} the four other members of the genus Bostrychia, olive ibis, São Tomé ibis, <b>hadada</b> <b>ibis</b> and wattled ibis, which are also all {{restricted}} to sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the spot-breasted ibis is {{closely related to the}} olive ibis and São Tomé ibis, and these three species are sometimes placed into their own genus, Lampribis. There are no recognized subspecies of the spot-breasted ibis.|$|E
50|$|An adult {{individual}} is 68 cm long with all-white body plumage apart from dark plumes on the rump. The bald head and neck, thick curved bill and legs are black. The white wings show a black rear border in flight. Sexes are similar, but juveniles have dirty white plumage, a smaller bill and some feathering on the neck.This bird is usually silent, but occasionally makes some croaking noises, unlike its vocal relative, the <b>hadada</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The olive ibis has a {{distinctive}} brown crest which is purple near {{the neck and}} clearly distinguishes it at close range from the similar Hadada and spot-breasted ibises. The purple is more extensive {{on the crest of}} rothschildi. This crest is not usually seen in flight because of the flying ibis’s extended neck. The olive ibis and spot-breasted ibis are reportedly impossible to distinguish superficially in the field, but the akeleyorum subspecies appears heavier than the <b>Hadada</b> <b>ibis</b> and has a thicker neck.|$|E
5000|$|The call of {{the olive}} ibis also sounds harsh but measured, unlike the {{clamorous}} three-syllable shrieking of the <b>Hadada</b> <b>ibis.</b> [...] The {{call of the}} spot-breasted ibis lacks the honking timbre of that of the olive ibis and the olive ibis does not emphasise the second note of its call as does the spot-breasted ibis. The pattern of the call is therefore a more reliable feature than superficial appearance by which to distinguish the olive ibis and spo-breasted ibis in the field.|$|E
50|$|Opened in 1991, the Africa Rainforest exhibit covers 1.3 acre and {{was built}} {{at a cost}} of $4.3 million. In {{addition}} to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Kongo Ranger Station, a mock up of a safari expedition.

5000|$|Akleyorum {{occurs in}} the montane forests of eastern Africa at altitudes of 1800-12000m above sea level. It is found in eastern Zaire, on Mount Kenia and in the Aberdares of Kenya, Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, on Mount Peru [...] and on Mount Elgon; but is {{apparently}} absent from lowland forests in east Africa such as the Kakamega tropical rainforest in Kenya. However, its call was once reportedly heard in the Bwamba lowlands of Uganda. It is readily distinguished from the similar <b>Hadada</b> <b>ibis</b> by elevation of habitat since the latter occurs at altitudes in this region of less than 6000 feet. The olive ibis {{may be the only}} resident African species to inhabit only lowland tropical forests in West Africa and only higher-altitude montane forests in the East.|$|E
50|$|The Gran Caldera de Luba {{has much}} the highest density of fauna {{on the island}} due to its inaccessibility to hunters, who must walk for two days to reach the crater.A 2001 report said that 120 species of birds had been {{identified}} so far, including 36 that are endemic races on Bioko. Fernando Po batis is an endemic species found only in the lowland forest. Larger hunted species such as black-casqued wattled hornbill and <b>hadada</b> <b>ibis</b> are only found {{in this part of}} Bioko.The reserve is home to Ogilby's duiker, whose long-term survival may depend on enforcement of protection in the Gran Caldera de Luba reserve.Endangered green sea turtles lay their eggs in nests on the beaches.Other threatened turtle species that nest on the beaches are the hawksbill sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle and leatherback sea turtle.|$|E
