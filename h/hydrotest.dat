Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is increas-ingly becoming a significant problem in {{the oil and gas industry}} because of enhanced recovery and aging equipment. Apart from pigging of pipelines, mitigation of MIC relies mostly on biocides. seawater, used regu-larly for seawater injection in production, is also routinely used for <b>hydrotesting.</b> The water used for <b>hydrotesting</b> is usually treated, typically with biocides.

40|$|The {{state of}} the vessel steel {{embrittlement}} {{as a result of}} neutron irradiation can be measured by its increase in the nil ductility temperature (NDT). This temperature is sometimes referred to as the brittle-ductile transition temperature (DBT) for fracture. The life extension of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) vessel is calculated by using the method of fracture mechanics. A hydrostatic pressure test (<b>hydrotest)</b> is performed in order to determine a safe vessel static pressure. It is then followed by using fracture mechanics to project the reactor life from the safe hydrostatic pressure. The life extension calculation provides the following information on the remaining life of the reactor {{as a function of the}} nil ductility temperature increase: (1) the probability of vessel fracture due to <b>hydrotest</b> vs vessel life at several <b>hydrotest</b> pressures, (2) the <b>hydrotest</b> time interval vs the uncertainty of the nil ductility temperature increase rate, and (3) the <b>hydrotest</b> pressure vs the uncertainty of the nil ductility temperature increase rate. It is understood that the use of a complete range of uncertainties of the nil ductility temperature increase is equivalent to the entire range of radiation damage that can be experienced by the vessel steel.

40|$|The {{carbonate}} {{sands of}} the Sabkha layer in the Middle East have very low shear strength. Therefore, instant set-tlement and time-dependent secondary settlement occur when inner voids are exposed, {{as in the}} case of particle crush-ing. We analyzed settlement of the Sabkha layer under a large-scale foundation by <b>hydrotesting,</b> and compared the field test results with the results of laboratory tests. With ongoing particle crushing, we observed the following stress-strain behaviors: strain-hardening (Sabkha GL- 1. 5 m), strain-perfect (Sabkha GL- 7. 0 m), and strain-softening (Sabkha GL- 7. 5 m). General shear failure occurred most frequently in dense sand and firm ground. Although the stress-strain behavior of Sabkha layer carbonate sand that of strain-softening, the particle crushing strength was low compared with the strain-hardening and strain-perfect behaviors. The stress-strain behaviors differ between carbonate sand and quartz sand. If the relative density of quartz sand is increased, the shear strength is also increased.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} in which identification of the controlling crack path was critical to identifying the root cause of the failure. The case involves the rupture of a 30 -inch (0. 76 m) natural gas pipeline in 2010 that tragically led to the destruction of a number of homes and the loss of life. The segment of the pipeline that ruptured was installed in 1956. The longitudinal seam of the segment that ruptured {{was supposed to have been}} fabricated by double submerged arc welding. Unfortunately, portions of the segment only received a single submerged arc weld on the outside, leaving unwelded areas on the inside diameter. Post-failure examination of the segment revealed that the rupture originated at one of these unwelded areas. Examination also revealed three additional crack paths or zones emanating from the unwelded area: a zone of ductile tearing, a zone of fatigue, and a zone of cleavage fracture, in that sequence. Initial investigators ignored the ductile tear, assumed the critical crack path was the fatigue component, and (incorrectly) concluded that the root cause of the incident was the failure of the operator to <b>hydrotest</b> the segment after it was installed in 1956. However, as discussed in this paper, the critical path or mechanism was the ductile tear. Furthermore, it was determined that the ductile tear was created during the <b>hydrotest</b> at installation by a mechanism known as pressure reversal. Thus the correct root cause of the rupture was the <b>hydrotest</b> the operator subjected the segment to at installation, helping to increase the awareness of operators and regulators about the potential problems associated with hydrotesting...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 133 - 138 Turbomachinery life expectancy, {{economic}} conditions, {{and plant}} capacity enhancements {{have created a}} need for vintage compressors to be reevaluated and re-engineered for operational parameters {{that may not have}} been incorporated in the original design. Aerodynamic revamps have been standard practice for optimizing flow conditions to today's processes. These changeouts have traditionally been limited to manipulation within designed pressure ratings. Recently, in addition to the aerodynamic enhancements, processes are requiring increased pressure levels. These new requirements and requests have posed questions and concerns which have not been of predominant importance previously. Integrity of the containment vessel, leakage of process gases, condition, and life expectancy at above design conditions must be addressed to make an informed comparison between a rerate and purchase of replacement equipment. The hazards and possible expenses of operating turbomachinery above rated pressures without a systematic and consistent verification process should be avoided. Hence, a new field has been undertaken by OEMs driven by equipment user request, to certify existing casings at increased levels in the safest and most reliable manner. The following guidelines have been produced to conduct such rerates with minimal risk to the compressor case and thus, the processes in which these machines play an intricate part: ? Specific case testing history ? Examine records and designs to determine if the casing has been hydrotested previously, or has been hydrotested to appropriate new condition levels. ? Review of similar vintage machinery ? Review designs of similar machines built in the same era to determine if ratings have ever been within appropriate levels. ? Analyze the specific case design ? Analyze the case with the use of modem and proven finite element methods to verify the integrity of the case design at elevated pressures based on blueprint dimensions. Review data with the user, discussing concerns of both parties and come to a consensus whether a <b>hydrotest</b> is feasible. ? Inspect and review ? Inspect the case per manufacturing blueprints to verify thickness and overall condition of the case and continuity of FEA model. With the use of magnetic particles, inspect the casing for indications and discontinuities which could endanger the casing during the <b>hydrotest.</b> Review the data and determine if continuation of testing is feasible. ? Strain gauge casing ? Place strain gauge equipment at key high stress locations based on FEA model to protest casing during hydrotesting. ? <b>Hydrotest</b> case ? With online strain readings, <b>hydrotest</b> casing to the appropriate levels. Carefully monitor the strain data to protect the casing from going beyond prescribed stress levels at the desired pressure levels. If stress levels appear to be approaching recommended limits, consensus should be made on whether to continue. ? Recertification ?
