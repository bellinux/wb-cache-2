5|$|Sports such as polo do {{not judge}} the horse itself, but rather use the horse {{as a partner}} for human {{competitors}} as {{a necessary part of}} the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1966, Lane {{became a}} {{full-time}} Judge of the Queen's Bench Division (with the customary Knighthood), {{as well as}} a Bencher at Gray's Inn. He delivered some notable judgments: in 1968, he awarded damages against a school for a pupil who had been injured in 'horseplay' between his peers, saying that the school had a responsibility to stop <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> out of hand; and while acting as an appeal judge, he found for the publishers of Last Exit to Brooklyn who had been convicted of publishing an obscene book, because of faults in the trial Judge's summing-up. He was picked to head the inquiry into the Staines air disaster in 1972, and concluded that the underlying cause was an undiagnosed heart condition of the pilot which impaired his judgement, coupled with the pilot's known bad temper which led to his junior crew being unwilling to challenge him.|$|E

25|$|Foraging on {{the seabed}} {{typically}} {{takes place at}} depths between 20 and 40 m, although they can dive to depths of 700 m in search of food. Their flexible necks provide {{a wide range of}} movement while they are searching for food on the ocean floor. Some animals have been observed to suck up water and then forcefully expel it to uncover their prey hidden in the silt on the seabed. As their teeth are neither large nor sharp, belugas must use suction to bring their prey into their mouths; it also means their prey has to be consumed whole, which in turn means it cannot be too large or the belugas run the risk of <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> stuck in their throats. They also join together into coordinated groups of five or more to feed on shoals of fish by steering the fish into shallow water, where the belugas then attack them. For example, in the estuary of the Amur River, where they mainly feed on salmon, groups of six or eight individuals join together to surround a shoal of fish and prevent their escape. Individuals then take turns feeding on the fish.|$|E
500|$|Famitsu {{called the}} {{original}} version's gameplay a [...] "stressless experience", praising the game's size and saying the action-oriented battle system made it [...] "a very different Final Fantasy". Dengeki PlayStation similarly praised {{its size and}} the tense combat, though the review found aspects of the navigation less appealing. Hindman was generally positive about most aspects of gameplay and the high replay value, but found faults with the scripted opening of the overworld and the real-time strategy segments. Van Duine said the gameplay encouraged immersion and was harsh on novices; she praised several aspects of gameplay, but described the leveling system as [...] "tricky". The multiplayer functions were universally praised in Japan. Opinions were divided on the original camera, with Famitsu praising its movement, while Van Duine and Dengeki PlayStation found issues with <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> stuck in the environment or impeding visibility. The character AI also received criticism for being unresponsive or wayward.|$|E

The video {{is good for the}} most part, especially if you are a fan of dancing." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, [...] "it's genuinely a fun clip, absent of any overdone, sexed up R corniness." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the video to Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] (1987), and Janet Jackson's [...] "Alright" [...] (1990), concluding that [...] "sure, the 'Yeah 3x' clip is derivative. But at least Brown is making a serious effort to polish up his commercial appeal once again with both a feel-good, sing-along song and an equally sunny video." [...] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard magazine simply called it a [...] "kid-friendly clip". The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's vibrant, {{colourful}} and [...] "groundbreaking" [...] graphics. IGN's Lucas Thomas expressed surprise that Nintendo's 16-bit system could deliver rendered 3D models and praised the detailed character animations, [...] "lush backgrounds" [...] and the [...] "verdant jungle" [...] {{setting of the}} game. GamePro declared in their review that [...] "DKC has {{all the elements of}} a classic: outstanding graphics, involving game play, and lots of hidden stuff". Later, the game was released as a pack-in game in the SNES [...] "Donkey Kong Set" [...] (which contains a console, controller, connections, and the game). This facilitated additional sales of more than 1 million copies, contributing to <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> the Player's Choice re-release treatment around 1998. At review aggregator GameRankings, the SNES version received an 89% score, the Game Boy Color version 90%, and the Game Boy Advance version 79%. Nintendo Power gave a positive review to the Game Boy Color version of the game, finding that the game was [...] "improved with multiplayer minigames and a GB Printer feature" [...] while noting that even though [...] "the graphics lack the detail of the classic, they're still worth going ape over." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E
500|$|In January 1903, as the {{blockade}} continued during the negotiations, the German SMS Panther attempted {{to enter the}} lagoon of Maracaibo, a centre of German commercial activity. On 17 January it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> {{close enough to the}} fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the Vineta, with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January the Vineta bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town. [...] The action had not been approved by the British commander, who had been told by Admiralty after the incident of 13 December not to engage in such action without consulting London; the message was not passed to the German commander, who had been told previously to follow the British commander's lead. The incident caused [...] "considerable negative reaction in the United States against Germany"; the Germans said that the Venezuelans fired first, which the British concurred with but declared the bombardment [...] "unfortunate and inopportune" [...] nonetheless. The German Foreign Office said that the Panther's attempted incursion into the lagoon of Maracaibo had been motivated by a desire to ensure the effective blockade of Maracaibo, by preventing Maracaibo from being supplied across the adjacent Colombian border. Subsequently, Roosevelt informed the German Ambassador that Admiral Dewey had orders to be ready to sail to Venezuela from Puerto Rico at an hour's notice.|$|E

2500|$|A port (often {{referred}} to by brand names such as Port-a-Cath or MediPort) is a central venous line {{that does not have}} an external connector; instead, it has a small reservoir that is covered with silicone rubber and is implanted under the skin. Medication is administered intermittently by placing a small needle through the skin, piercing the silicone, into the reservoir. [...] When the needle is withdrawn the reservoir cover reseals itself. [...] The cover can accept hundreds of needle sticks during its lifetime. [...] It is possible to leave the ports in the patient's body for years; if this is done however, the port must be accessed monthly and flushed with an anti-coagulant, or the patient risks <b>it</b> <b>getting</b> plugged up. [...] If it is plugged it becomes a hazard as a thrombus will eventually form with an accompanying risk of embolisation. [...] Removal of a port is usually a simple outpatient procedure; however, installation is more complex and a good implant is fairly dependent on the skill of the radiologist. Ports cause less inconvenience and have a lower risk of infection than PICCs, and are therefore commonly used for patients on long-term intermittent treatment.|$|E
