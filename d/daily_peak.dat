London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase <b>daily</b> <b>peak</b> period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent.

40|$|Risk of {{hospital}} readmission and cardiac mortality increases with atmospheric pollution {{for patients with}} heart failure. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. Carbon monoxide (CO) a ubiquitous environmental pollutant could be involved. We explored the effect of daily exposure of CO relevant to urban pollution on post-myocardial infarcted animals. Rats with ischemic heart failure were exposed 4 weeks to <b>daily</b> <b>peaks</b> of CO mimicking urban exposure or to standard filtered air. CO exposure worsened cardiac contractile dysfunction evaluated by echocardiography and at the cardiomyocyte level. In line with clinical reports, the animals exposed to CO also exhibited a severe arrhythmogenic phenotype with numerous sustained ventricular tachycardias as monitored by surface telemetric electrocardiograms. CO did not affect cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness. Instead, mitochondrial dysfunction was exacerbated leading to additional oxidative stress and Ca 2 + cycling alterations. This was reversed following acute antioxidant treatment of cardiomyocytes with N-acetylcysteine confirming involvement of CO-induced oxidative stress. Exposure to <b>daily</b> <b>peaks</b> of CO pollution aggravated cardiac dysfunction in rats with ischemic heart failure by specifically targeting mitochondria and generating ROS-dependent alterations. This pathway {{may contribute to the}} high sensibility and vulnerability of individuals with cardiac disease to environmental outdoor air quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} impact of urbanization on the hydrologic characteristics of watersheds in the Berkeley Hills of central California. The initial approach was to calibrate three stream gaging station prior to the development of one watershed above one of these stations and to follow changes in hydrologic characteristics during and subsequent to development. Economic and political developments in 1974 and 1975 prevented the developer from building on the principal watershed. A summary of data on annual water yield, characteristics of flood peaks, sediment yield, and water quality for the three non-urban watersheds is presented. A subproject completed during the study compared periodicity of streamflow in previously urbanized and non-urbanized watersheds in the Berkeley Hills. Two <b>daily</b> discharge <b>peaks</b> which lagged 1. 5 hours behind two <b>daily</b> <b>peaks</b> in lawn irrigation were observed. <b>Peak</b> <b>daily</b> streamflow on the urbanized watershed was 10 times that of a similar non-urbanized watershed.

[...] The Mackinac Center for Public Policy also charges that the system does not benefit locals, pointing out that fewer than 30% of the riders are Detroit residents and that Saturday ridership (likely out-of-towners) dwarfs that of weekday usage.

40|$|Initial {{measurements}} of black carbon (BC) content at both 880 and 370 nm, obtained in two sites in southern Italy by an aethalometer, have been analyzed. The sites {{are located in}} the same region (Basilicata), but are affected by different emission sources. In one case the main source of BC is related to vehicular traffic from a nearby freeway. Data were collected, although not continuously, during 2008, 2009 and 2010. In the second case, a fresh crude-oil pre-treatment plant continuously burns petroleum-derived products, thus contributing to emissions of both carbonaceous matter and its organic component. The corresponding data-set was collected in the period January–April 2011. At the first site, two <b>daily</b> <b>peaks</b> were found for the BC content, typical of vehicles emissions, with maximum values ranging from 2000 ng/m 3 to 4700 ng/m 3 found during weekdays. This behavior disappears at the weekend or when polluted air-masses from north-east Europe are transported over the measurement site. At the second site, two <b>daily</b> <b>peaks</b> were never found, suggesting that crude oil chemical processes were the main source of the emissions. In this case, the maximum BC values ranged between 1000 – 8000 ng/m 3, depending on the processes occurring at the fresh crude-oil pre-treatment plant. Moreover, the estimated level of BC at 370 nm was higher than that of BC at 880 nm in all months, expect for April, indicating a clear organic component in atmospheric aerosols. Finally, based on a best-fit procedure applied to the seven wavelengths’ absorption coefficients, aerosols with different spectroscopic properties have been detected at these two sites...|$|R

Optimal weights associated with each model are not robust in time or space.
