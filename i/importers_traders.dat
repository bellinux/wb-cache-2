40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} marketing of vegetable seed in private sector as well as public sector in five selected areas of Bangladesh. Besides for traders` survey apart from above mentioned areas Mymensingh town and Dhaka city were selected. Three types of respondents, such as vegetable growers, seed traders and seed importers/producers were interviewed {{with the help of}} pretested questionnaire during January to April, 1998. 50 % of the seeds used were either retained by farmers from previous seasons or purchased from other farmers. Traders handled 48 per cent of the seed and the remaining two per cent was marketed by public sector. Importers and traders purchased seed at Tk. 502190. 47 and 140913. 33 per quintal, respectively. The production cost of seed producing farm was Tk. 162236. 84. Seed was sold by <b>importers,</b> <b>traders</b> and producing farms at Tk. 590790. 47, 157836. 66 and Tk. 212052. 63 per quintal, respectively. So the gross return of <b>importers,</b> <b>traders</b> and seed producing farms were Tk. 88600. 00, 16923. 33 and Tk. 49815. 79 per quintal, respectively. Their marketing costs were Tk. 1177. 45, 719. 48 and Tk. 353. 04 respectively and net returns were Tk. 87422. 55, Tk. 16203. 85 and Tk. 49462. 75 respectively. The problems in vegetable production were: adulteration of seed, low germination of seed, problem of collecting import permit, lack of capital, problem of collecting clearing permit, lack of technological facilities, non-availability of experienced farmer and lack of modern storage facilities. To solve the above problems, the respondents suggested for ensuring the supply of required quality of seed in appropriate time at reasonable price, provision for Bank loan, improving Banking procedure, providing training facilities to the farmers, paying reasonable wage to farmers and development of storage facility...|$|E
40|$|Regulations 1829 / 2003 /CE and 1830 / 2003 /CE {{have allowed}} the placing on the European market of GM {{products}} in food and feed chains, and have defined their rules of traceability and labeling. For some supply chains, like for soy and its derived products {{that are used in}} the production of feed, manufacturers have to face both non-GM and GM production, although there are no labeling requirements for animal products derived from animals fed with GMOs. This study presents the strategies of stakeholders involved in the feed production chain to maintain concurrent production of compound feed with GM and non-GM soy products, by dealing with the coexistence between those two crops. The stakeholders include <b>importers,</b> <b>traders,</b> soy processors, feed processors and retailers. The study shows that many tools are in place to ensure andmaintain the current coexistence.

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 1994, {{more and}} more genetically modified (GM) crops are grown worldwide and introduced in food or feed products. In the European Union (EU), the production, trade and marketing of GM products is strictly regulated, but the situation is becoming more complex due to the increasing number and complexity of GM crops, and asynchronic approval procedures with the major GM crop producing countries. <b>Importers</b> and <b>traders</b> are obliged to assess their respective supply chains for the potential presence of authorised and unauthorised GM organisms (GMOs), where wrong decisions may lead to substantial economic losses. This article presents a decision support system SIGMO aimed at guiding producers and traders with {{the assessment of the}} likelihood that their products may comprise authorised or unauthorised GM materials. The assessment is based on traceability data about the product (nature and origin of the raw materials, transportation aspects), as well as analytical results of the presence of GMOs in the final product or its ingredients. The approach uses a combination of data-driven and model-driven decision support. SIGMO is composed of (1) a data base providing data about GMO crop species produced and approved in counties worldwide, (2) a multi-attribute model for the assessment of GMO presence in food/feed products, and (3) an on-line user interface. SIGMO helps producers and traders to better comply to valid EU GMO regulations and to better control their products and supply chains in terms of the unintended presence of (unauthorised) GMOs in a cost-effective way. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, there have been {{significant}} reforms in the Moroccan agricultural sector.

40|$|Combining establishment-level {{data from}} the 1999 – 2003 Manufacturing Industry Surveys and the 2007 Industrial Census of Thailand, this paper {{examines}} and documents the relationships between establishment-level profitability and three types of international traders- exporters, <b>importers</b> and two-way <b>traders</b> in Thai manufacturing. The main analysis {{is divided into three}} parts. First, we empirically measure trader profitability premia for various profit measures such as operating profit, sales profit, and the rate of profit. Second, we test for trader profitability premia by running regressions of different profit measures on trader status using probit estimation to provide further evidence. Third, we examine whether trade activities are related to firm profitability. Comparing between four groups of firms: two-way traders (being both exporters and importers), only exporters, only importers, and firms that do not trade internationally, the results generally reveal that exporters tend to be the most profitable groups of internationally functioning firms. Two-way <b>traders</b> and <b>importers</b> are roughly the same in terms of profit performance, and firms with no trade are the least profitable as there is evidence for international trader profitability premia. We additionally find that there is a positive correlation between being various types of traders and firm profitability. Particularly, being an exporter is mostly and strongly correlated with an increase in sales profit and the rate of profit of a firm...|$|R
40|$|The {{complicated}} {{world of}} {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables commerce has inspired me to proceed with this project. The main topic of this research is the production cost of tomato and potato which are the highest- in consumption -vegetables in the Greek market. The study is focused on Greek production versus rest countries around it (European and non European countries) which export these products under specific circumstances. By stating European countries, it is implied that the countries are laid geographically in European continent and they are included in the European Monetary Union. In non European countries there are either countries that belong geographically to Europe but they are not included in the European Monetary Union. Or countries that do not lay geographically in Europe. Therefore the methodology is divided geographically in two main levels of research: 1. Data collection from Greece where there are focus groups of agronomists, cooperative unions, traders. There’s a base of around two hundred farmers who have filled in questionnaires regarding the crops mentioned above. 2. Data collection from rest countries is based from interviews of foreign exporters, local <b>importers</b> – <b>traders,</b> embassies and also from colleagues of the mother company that I am working for. The questionnaires are structured in such a way to avoid coincidental answers by the interviewed people. The analysis was based on the SPSS statistical program and this has led to several findings: - Contracted agriculture in Greece may keep production costs low and reinforce the competitive power towards rest countries. In future, it should obviously expand to more crops. - Low income farmers pay more attention to finding cheap equipment than the rest. - Most farmers, especially the ones with big lands (more than five hectares per person) make precautionary use of chemicals to protect their crops from plant diseases. - Young farmers invest more in new technology and equipment than older generations. - Farmers, who invest in their crop business, believe in the future of biological agriculture. - The current evolution of biological agriculture in Greece remains lower than the average European one. - Large production farmers are more professional and they work on economies of scale to minimize their costs. - The expansion of organic crops in the Greek market can lead to a sustainable level of income for both producers and traders - Apart from unpredictable parameters like weather, the marketing of agricultural production can fully guarantee positive income. - The more professional the farmers are the more the investment in their crops - On a contract basis agriculture, farmers and super markets may become valuable partners Furthermore, the conclusions of this project can probably lead to future research on the topics below: - The successful minimization of production cost to contracted potato crops should find application in other cultivations. - The development of private labels in {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} is another exit to large scale Greek agricultural production. - Once the consumers become familiar with private labels, then the future researchers should concentrate on the evolution of these products. - The Greek exports should prioritize on the production of competitive, safe and qualitative products. These are the key factors to adapt to the European consumers’ demands. - The typical bureaucracy regarding imports and exports to and from Greece has to be lessened, because it often causes delays to loadings and quality reduction. - Exports to Scandinavian countries need to be further investigated in future. These countries have the financial ability to pay the added value of products, but they have high quality standards. The risk of rejection and a permanent collaboration break is quite high in such countries, if there is quality uncertainty. - Commercial challenges among rest countries should also be analyzed in future studies (exports from Fyrom to north Europe, from Turkey to north Europe, from China to Europe and Russia). - New legislation that eliminates the export barriers from the third Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon etc) should change the balances in the European agriculture.

40|$|Trading is a {{fundamentally}} important aspect in the realisation of Open Object 9 ̆ 6 based Distributed Systems (OOBDS), {{and has been}} the joint topic of standardisation by the International Organisation for tandardisation (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU 9 ̆ 6 T) {{as part of their}} work on the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM 9 ̆ 6 ODP). Trading is an information infrastructure service that allows software entities to advertise, or export a service or resource to a trusted third party, known as the Trader. The service or resource being exported usually has properties associated with it, which may be static or dynamic. The Trader maintains a database of exported services which includes the type of service which is advertised and properties associated with the service. The application of Trading to Electronic Commerce is an area yet to be explored, where the services traded are of a commercial nature, and the Trader is used to match clients with appropriate service or resource providers. With the potentially widespread use of Traders for electronic service location, {{it is important that the}} Trading standard is error 9 ̆ 6 free and unambiguous. It is also important to ensure that the Trader is as efficient as possible, especially when interworking with other Traders. One way to ensure correctness of the Trader is to create a formal model which can be analysed to verify that the model behaves as expected under all conditions. Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) have been used to model the RM 9 ̆ 6 ODP Trading standard. This has resulted in the creation of two models which view Trader interactions at different levels of abstraction. The first model provides a description of the interactions between the <b>Trader,</b> <b>Importers</b> and Exporters. The second model provides a more detailed description of the internal logic of the Trader and concentrates on the interworking protocol used by Traders when cooperating. Analysis of the Trader models has been performed using Occurrence Graphs (OGs). In certain scenarios, it was found that the use of OG 9 ̆ 2 s with Equivalence Classes resulted in a significantly smaller equivalent OG. This was useful when verifying correct behaviour of the Trader, especially in scenarios involving interworking where the CPN model displays a great deal of concurrent behaviour. As a product of the modelling exercise, a number of omissions and ambiguities in the RM 9 ̆ 6 ODP Trading standard were detected, especially with regard to the interworking protocol. More specifically, these omissions relate to: - an incomplete behavioural specification regarding detection of duplicate Queries, - redundant forwarding of Queries to linked Traders whilst interworking, - non 9 ̆ 6 deterministic traversal of the entire linked Traders Offer Space which may result in an incomplete matching of appropriate offers. As a consequence of detecting these ambiguities/omissions in the Trading Standard, a number of suggestions for improvement to the protocol have been proposed. These suggestions were incorporated into the CPN model and verified using OGs. Traders were placed in a number of scenarios and the resultant behaviour analysed using OGs. Using the results from a number of scenarios, conclusions about the behaviour of the Trader model in more complex scenarios have been made. Having verified the Trader interworking protocol, the CPN model was used as the basis for creating a prototype Trader. This Trader was used in a concept demonstrator which applies Traders to the provision of a distributed electronic commerce lookup service. The prototype is implemented using Java and its built 9 ̆ 6 in distributed object facility known as Remote Method Invocation (RMI) ...|$|R
