5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E

Appeared {{opposite}} Green Lantern {{during one of the}} Marvel/DC shorts, and battered Lantern with a locker before Lantern turned his ring on <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> majority of the villains, he does not trust Luthor and at one point attempted to attack him during After Hours.|$|E
25|$|On December 18, 2007, Taylor was posthumously {{voted to}} his second Pro Bowl, {{becoming}} the first deceased player in NFL history to be elected to the Pro Bowl. During the Pro Bowl, Chris Samuels, Chris Cooley and Ethan Albright wore Taylor's #21 jersey to honor <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> Redskins had done earlier in the season, the NFC lined up with just one safety on the first play of the game.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} hearing {{took place}} on 1 July, {{at the insistence of}} Joseph Marichal, who was threatening to sue Cunard for their poor handling of the disaster. He testified that the second explosion had sounded to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rattling of machine gun fire and appeared to be below the second class dining room {{at the rear of the}} ship where he had been seated. Information about Marechal's background was sought out by the British government and leaked to the press so as to discredit him.|$|E
25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E
25|$|Vargas {{claimed that}} this would be the last fight of his career {{regardless}} of the result. He warned Mayorga that he would not tolerate any insults from <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ones he hurled at Oscar De La Hoya in their press conferences. Vargas stayed true to his promise when at the first official press conference for the fight, Mayorga said some offensive things towards Vargas and attempted to slap him. Vargas immediately jumped up from his seat and retaliated with punches and a brawl broke out between the two fighters' camps, though order was quickly restored. Vargas also recalled the time when Mayorga said Vargas was scared of him when he had defeated Javier Castillejo, then was stripped of his WBC light middleweight title rather than face Mayorga, who then defeated Michele Piccirillo for the vacant title. Ultimately the contestants faced off, and Mayorga defeated Vargas by majority decision on November 23, 2007. The scores were 113-113, 114-112, and 115-111. Crucially, Vargas was knocked down in the 1st round and again in the 11th round. Post-fight Ricardo Mayorga apologized to Vargas and the two forgave each other. Vargas officially declared his retirement soon after.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
500|$|The evening {{opened with}} Prabhupada's followers– men in [...] "Merlin gowns" [...] {{and women in}} saris– {{chanting}} Hare Krishna to an Indian tune, followed by Moby Grape. When the swami himself arrived at 10PM, the crowd of hippies rose to their feet to greet him respectfully with applause and cheers. Gurudas, one of the event's organizers, describes the effect that Prabhupada's arrival had on the audience, [...] "Then Swami Bhaktivedanta entered. He looked like a Vedic sage, exalted and otherworldly. As he advanced towards the stage, the crowd parted and made way for <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> surfer riding a wave. He glided onto the stage, sat down and began playing the kartals." ...|$|E
500|$|When Massey {{took over}} the Physics Department, most of his physicists, {{including}} Bates, Buckingham, Burhop and Robert Boyd, moved with <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> Mathematics Department, {{it was still in}} temporary accommodation owing to bomb damage during the war. A new building was under construction, but to develop the technical infrastructure, Massey hired Harry Tomlinson, who had worked for him in the British Mission in Berkeley. The Department acquired several accelerators, including a 20 MeV synchrotron from the Atomic Energy Authority. Dick Jennings and Franz Heymann built two microtrons. Under Massey, the Physics Department moved away from researching the physics of metals and liquids, and focused on [...] particle physics and upper atmosphere physics. Massey saw the potential of computers. He arranged with Andrew Booth for a copy of his All Purpose Electronic Computer, and recruited two programmers, Joan Lawson and Jane Wallace. When the University of London established a computing unit, Buckingham left to head it.|$|E

500|$|Jonathon Young {{returns as}} half-vampire Nikola Tesla. In the tenth episode, the {{character}} was [...] "de-vamped". Kindler felt this development was a bold choice, but also believed his vampirism {{was the least}} interesting character trait against being a genius and having electricity-based powers. The producers wanted to make Tesla somewhat heroic by sacrificing that part of <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> first season, there were instances where Young was unavailable to shoot some of his scenes due to theatre commitments, so he {{was replaced by a}} body double. Christine Chatelain returns as Will's girlfriend Clara Griffin. Clara was killed off in the second episode; Tapping viewed the death as an [...] "important casualty" [...] that has resonance to the main characters. Robert Lawrenson made a recurring appearance as Declan McRae, the head of the London Sanctuary following the death of James Watson in the season one finale. The character was originally going to be introduced in [...] "Hero", but Kindler decided {{it would be better for}} the character to be introduced earlier in the season.|$|E
2500|$|His views have engendered strong {{feelings}} about him amongst the art world; a year after his resignation one artist commented that [...] "they treat <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Black Death round here", although Massow has received less vocal support from many artists who fear they will never achieve recognition unless they follow the conceptual route.|$|E
2500|$|Ricci gives a brief {{account of}} the Tausu (道士, Daoshi), the {{followers}} of Lauzu (Laozi), and their books [...] "written in rather elegant literary style". He mentions their three main gods, which, to <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Buddhist trinity" [...] he had mentioned, is in indication of the [...] "father of lies" [...] persevering at [...] "his ambitious desire of divine similitude".|$|E
60|$|And {{while he}} talked {{and watched her}} as he talked, she answered, and behind her {{listening}} watched and thought about <b>him.</b> She <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> animated eagerness of his manner.|$|R

2500|$|The {{network was}} unable to confirm whether it was indeed Biryukova who had responded to them, as she {{was known to be}} staying with {{relatives}} at the time. However, Solomon told them it sounded to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way she would have talked. [...] "Obviously she's just trying to maybe get me kind of riled up," [...] he said. After reviewing the emails, ABC shared them with the Bellevue police, who could not comment on them but believed they might be of some value to their case.|$|E
2500|$|Sturges' rich writing {{style has}} been {{described}} as that of [...] "a lowbrow aristocrat, a melancholy wiseguy." [...] His scripts were almost congenitally unable to deliver a single mood. [...] In Hail the Conquering Hero, the series of lies, crimes, and embarrassments all somehow bolster the film's theme of patriotism and duty. [...] Sometimes this attitude could be conveyed in a single line of dialogue, such as when Barbara Stanwyck describes the man of her dreams with a combination of love and malice: [...] "I need <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> axe needs the turkey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris Carter from Destructoid {{wrote that}} Forza Motorsport 6 made <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{franchise}} again after Forza Motorsport 5, which {{he thought was}} [...] "rushed". He praised the game's rewind feature, visual upgrade, and graphical details. He also praised the Drivatar artificial intelligence system, due to their unstable behaviors. He thought that racing against these AI bots is as fun as racing against other players in the competitive multiplayer mode. He also described the content delivered by Forza Motorsport 6 as [...] "more than a full game", due to the increased number of both cars and tracks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you, Tom, DID you! I just {{forgive you}} {{everything}} for that!" [...] And she seized {{the boy in}} a crushing embrace that made <b>him</b> feel <b>like</b> <b>the</b> guiltiest of villains.|$|R
25|$|Family-oriented reviewers have harangued the film, {{noting that}} Galifianakis said {{he tried to}} forbid his own mother from seeing it and that he yells at parents of kids who tell <b>him</b> they <b>like</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|R

2500|$|After the mid-1970s, Lee eschewed horror roles almost entirely. Ian Fleming, {{author of}} the James Bond spy novels and Lee's step-cousin, had offered him {{the role of the}} titular {{antagonist}} in the first Eon-produced Bond film Dr. No (1962). Lee enthusiastically accepted, but by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the role. Lee finally got to play a James Bond villain in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), in which he was cast as the deadly assassin Francisco Scaramanga. Lee said of his performance, [...] "In Fleming's novel he's just a West Indian thug, but in the film he's charming, elegant, amusing, lethal... I played <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> dark side of Bond." ...|$|E
2500|$|Metropolitan Visarion thus invited nobleman from Kotor Ivan [...] "Zane" [...] Grbičić to Cetinje the {{following}} year, {{who was then}} elected the first Montenegrin Guvernadur. Venetians established a garrison in Cetinje, and fortified themselves in Cetinje Monastery. In July 1691 Suleyman was defeated yet again during his expeditions of punishment by Piperi and Bjelopavlići. In 1692 Visarion Borilović Bajica died under mysterious circumstances.The popular conspiracy theory has it that he was poisoned by the Venetians. In September of the same year, Suleyman launched another large campaign against Montenegro. The Venetian forces had no intent of facing <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> hajduks did seven years earlier and in turn retreated to the sanctuary of Cetinje monastery. Ottoman army reached Cetinje almost without a fight, with handful of Montenegrins giving only resistance. After negotiations, Venetian army was allowed to retreat from Cetinje. Before their departure, they time-mined the monastery, destroying it permanently. This move was quite unpopular among the local population and resulted in Montenegro turning its back on Venice. However, the strong ties remained, with guvernadur title being passed to the House of Vukotić, and then after, to the House of Radonjić. Ottoman army retreated from Cetinje shortly after.|$|E
2500|$|Challenge is {{an event}} often {{referred}} to as the [...] "Mini-Explorer Belt." [...] Challenge (now in its 20th year) was founded by Brian O'Connor from Cork- today the Spirit of Challenge Trophy is named after <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> Belt, it involves teams of two Venture Scouts of the same sex (in recent years different sex teams have also been allowed on the Challenge) walking 100km in 5 days while living on a budget of 4 euro per person per day in Ireland. The teams get dropped off in a previously unknown location with a map of the area, their budget money, a list of challenges to complete along the route and (in recent years) a mobile phone for checking in each evening.Each participant also has their own Special Interest Badge to complete. This is a challenge that the participant has planned independently, to complete along the route, before the trip. Once back at base camp, the participants also take part in an activity to do with the Adventure Skills Badges. They participants then get assessments at the base camp over 3 days an their assessors decide which standard award the participants are awarded. Successful entrants receive the Challenge woggle, a challenge badge and a certificate of completion for their efforts.|$|E
