5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> from its midst. State persecution prevented {{the formation of}} associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine psychology graduate students' attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women. It was hypothesized that the following variables would predict participants' attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women: participant gender, amount of client contact with <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women, <b>and</b> gender role attitudes. Additionally, a measure of social desirability was included to investigate the validity of responses. Data were analyzed by conducting an independent t-test, a correlated t-test, and hierarchical multiple regression. Results indicated that <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> were viewed more negatively than were lesbian women. As expected, participants' gender role attitudes significantly predicted their attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women. Contrary to predicted outcomes, results indicated that neither participant gender nor client contact predicted attitudes toward homosexuality. Finally, results suggested that participants were not engaging in socially desirable responding. Implications of this study for research, theory, and practice are discussed.

40|$|The Catholic Church tenets are in dissonance with American Counseling Association (ACA) ethical {{guidelines}} regarding same-sex sexual orientation. While homosexuality {{was removed}} from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual II as a disorder, the Catholic Church upholds same-sex sexual acts as grave depravity and disordered. Catholic counselors may face the dilemma of adhering to their religious tenets or their professional guidelines in working with <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women clients. Previous research has indicated that values conflicts between religious beliefs and ACA Ethical Codes on same-sex sexual orientation have resulted in legal issues due to counselors refusing therapeutic relationships or providing substandard therapy to <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women clients. An extensive literature review revealed no studies that exclusively focused on the disconnect between the Catholic Church 2 ̆ 7 s tenets and the ACA Ethical Codes. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the experience of values conflicts of Catholic counselors while working with <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women clients. Interpretative phenomenological analysis guided the analysis of data collected from interviews with 9 Catholic counselor participants. Six major themes emerged from the analysis: challenges, comfortable, identification with Catholic faith, personal view of Catholic position, referral, and multicultural training. The study provides insight to counselor educators and supervisors in improving multicultural competence of counselors and students. The study is an important contribution to the existing literature and would enhance social change initiatives through support <b>and</b> acceptance of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women, which the counseling profession advocates...|$|R

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> {{to serve}} openly. Openly {{gay and lesbian}} {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service {{did not have any}} negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess whether children’s attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women differ in {{relation}} to their ethnic backgrounds and whether ethnic differences are a result of perceived differential gender socialization practices. Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11. 47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50. 2 % had non-Western and 49. 8 % Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender...|$|R

For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two studies designed to further validate the construct of modern homonegativity {{as measured by the}} Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS). Similar to the concepts of modern racism and modern sexism, modern homonegativity rests upon three core assumptions: (1) <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women are making illegitimate (or unnecessary) demands for changes in the status quo; (2) discrimination against homosexual <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women is a thing of the past; <b>and</b> (3) <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women exaggerate the importance of their sexual preference and, in so doing, prevent themselves from assimilating into mainstream culture. The MHS was created to measure contemporary negative attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women (i. e., attitudes that are not based on traditional or moral objections to homosexuality). The scale contains two parallel forms: one for <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> (MHS-G) <b>and</b> one for <b>lesbian</b> women (MHS-L). Using Canadian participants (N = 374), results of Study 1 indicate that the parallel versions of the MHS are reliable, unidimensional, factorially, and conceptually distinct from a measure of old-fashioned homonegativity as measured by the Attitudes Toward <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> Gay Men Scale and a relatively new measure of homonegativity entitled Modern Homophobia. As well, modern homonegativity correlated in the hypothesized direction with the motivation to control prejudiced reactions. Finally, results of one-way ANOVAs indicated that individuals who reported having <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women as acquaintances and close friends evidenced significantly lower levels of modern homonegativity than did individuals who reported no contact experience. Study 2 was designed to examine the psychometric properties of the MHS from a cross-cultural vantage. Specifically, the psychometric properties of the MHS were investigated using a sample of American participants (N = 608). Results of this study confirmed the unidimensionality of the MHS-G, and its conceptual distinctiveness from other measures of homonegativity (the ATLG and "Modern" Homophobia scales). Also, modern homonegativity correlated in the hypothesized direction with political conservatism, religious self-schema, neosexism, and concern about acting prejudiced. Similar to Study 1, results of one-way ANOVAs confirmed that individuals who reported having both <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women as acquaintances and close friends evidenced lower levels of modern homonegativity when compared with individuals who reported not having gay or lesbian acquaintances or close friends. Finally, the metric invariance of the MHS-G and MHS-L factor loadings were tested. With the exception of four items on the MHS-G, the metric invariance of the parallel versions of the MHS was confirmed. In summary, the studies outlined in this thesis strengthen the argument that a new form of homonegativity exists. Further, the MHS possesses superior psychometric properties and will prove useful when used to measure negative attitudes toward homosexual <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in college and university settings. As an adjunct to the implications of the research, future directions are outlined...|$|R

Data were collected from 385 participants who self-identified as lesbian or gay, using a purposive quota sampling technique to promote representation across age, gender, race and socio-economic status lines. Multiple methods of recruitment were used to maximise the sample size obtained. Questionnaires were administered in either face-to-face interviews or distri-buted in person, by mail or via the internet. Multiple regression analysis indicated that lowered self-esteem and more frequent experiences of hate speech were the only significant predictors of vulnerability to depression. The regression model accounted for 21. 7 % of the variance in vulnera-bility to depression scores...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{there is}} a limited {{understanding}} of how interactions with <b>Gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lesbian</b> women impact on opposite-sex attracted peoples’ attitudes towards same-sex attracted people. In a sample of heterosexual Americans (N = 551), male and female participants were randomly allocated to an online interaction with either a Lesbian woman or a <b>Gay</b> <b>man,</b> created with text and cartoon images. In these interactions the same-sex attracted character acted in either a positive, negative or neutral manner. Results indicate that participants who experienced negative contact felt more anxious, rated the <b>Gay</b> <b>man</b> or Lesbian woman more negatively, and were comparatively unwilling {{to be friends with}} the <b>Gay</b> <b>man</b> or Lesbian woman, than were those in the positive or neutral conditions. No differences were found between positive and neutral contact. Findings also demonstrate that men are more prejudiced than women towards <b>Gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lesbian</b> women, particularly after contact with a <b>Gay</b> <b>man.</b> The findings show that contact has a marked effect on how opposite-sex attracted people feel about Gay or <b>Lesbian</b> strangers, <b>and</b> further, that negative contact has a more powerful impact than positive contact.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how stereotypes and media presentations related to gender norms influence public presentations of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women. Using online profiles from the online dating website Match. com, this paper examines the body types daters {{use to describe}} themselves, their ideal date, and if the poster has a photograph of themselves on their profile. These profiles are used {{as a method of}} observing public presentations that are in a unique situation to be tailored towards notions of publically displayed social desirability. Findings indicate that <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> present their online bodies as stereotypically masculine <b>and</b> athletic, while <b>lesbian</b> women are willing to display a slightly broader range of body types. In addition, regardless of gender, both <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women present their ideal dates as stereotypically attractive, with <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> having a particular affinity for dating athletic men. Regression analysis suggests that intersectional variables such as race and age influence a person’s willingness to display a profile picture in the public arena. Overall, this study concludes that heteronormative standards of masculinity combined with structural influences from both the media and peer groups likely have an impact on gay men’s ideal gendered body, while the comparative exclusion of lesbian women from these media influences allow other experiences of gender norms slightly more freedom...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} causes, consequences, and remedies of wage penalties {{in the labor}} market. The first chapter explores the relationship between prejudice <b>and</b> wages for <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> in the United States. I show that search models of taste-based discrimination can predict the empirical relationship between prejudice towards <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> their wages. The second chapter explores how individuals use wage penalties when deciding which college major to select. Using a laboratory experiment, I show that higher female wage penalties {{in the labor market}} deter female students from selecting a major. Since female students expect discrimination to be worse in STEM fields, this preference for majors with lower wage penalties leads to a gender participation gap in STEM. My experiment showed that correcting misinformation about wage penalties in the labor market can increase female interest in STEM majors. The final chapter explores how effective public policy has been at reducing the wage penalty against <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women in the United States. I show that the heterogeneous nature of state-level employment non-discrimination laws in the United States has important consequences for their effectiveness. Stronger laws are more effective at reducing the wage penalty for <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> but may lead to lower levels of employment for lesbian women. Weak laws in the United States had no effect on the labor market outcomes of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women...|$|R
