The Law focuses on external imbalances as impediments to growth and does not consider the case where <b>internal</b> <b>imbalances</b> (budget deficits or public debt) can also constrain growth. The recent European public debt crisis shows that when <b>internal</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{are out of control}} they can constrain growth and domestic demand in a severe way.

40|$|Our {{focus in}} this paper is {{macroeconomic}} policy in the countries of Central Europe: The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. All four are committed to joining the European Union. Accordingly, their macroeconomic policies need {{to put them on}} a credible path towards meeting the entry criteria {{at some point in the}} foreseeable future. We develop a framework for analysing and evaluating both macroeconomic policy and the development of policy-making institutions to put each of the four national economies on that path and keep them there as they move towards accession. We also seek to design this framework so that it is more generally useful in analysing developments in the other transition economies. The approach we take to the analysis of macroeconomic policy is to look first for signs of external balance, and then to look to internal balance as the economy is increasingly decontrolled. Signs of <b>internal</b> <b>imbalance,</b> either excessive budget deficits or unacceptably high inflation, are taken as indicators that a currently satisfactory external situation could become unsatisfactory in the future, as the <b>internal</b> <b>imbalance</b> spills over to the external sector. We recommend that, in their approach to external balance, the economies adopt a Pre-Pegging Exchange Rate Regime, which essentially means no active nominal devaluation (no nominal devaluation aimed at real devaluation) as the country converges towards Union membership. We recommend that, in their approach to internal balance, countries adopt a Multi-Annual Fiscal Adjustment Strategy. Both of these policy paths are designed to bring the economies to the point of accession along as smooth a convergence path as possible.

The centre-periphery divide {{of the national}} economies exacerbated existing problems in the euro area. In this article an empirical analysis {{of the development of}} intra-European imbalances is provided. The analysis shows that the problem of <b>internal</b> <b>imbalances</b> remains unsolved. High unemployment and high public debt in Eurozone’s periphery reflects the <b>internal</b> <b>imbalances.</b> In some Northern countries the public debt ratios are becoming higher, too. Significant current account imbalances provide an important indicator of external imbalances. The co-existence of large current account surpluses in Germany and the Netherlands and deficits in Greece challenges the possibilities of deeper European integration. The provided analysis shows a reduction in external imbalances because of better performance of periphery current accounts. A real solution of European problems needs deeper macroeconomic policy cooperation between national authorities and European institutions. The article highlights the limits of European institutions in promoting common economic policy. It is necessary to boost competitiveness by coordinated structural reforms in the euro area; fiscal austerity policies are not enough to restore pre-crisis internal balance. For sustainable economic growth European investment projects should be implemented in the euro area. The recovery of national economies should be used to reduce the high public debt levels in both centre and periphery countries.

But Chinese Government hesitates to revalue RMB because of the worry that RMB revaluations are contractionary thus have negative impact on China's economic growth and employment. The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the effects of RMB real exchange rate on China's output. The econometric work of the paper shows that even after sources of spurious correlation and reverse causation are controlled for, RMB revaluation has led to a decline in China’s output, suggesting that RMB revaluations do be contractionary.

The origin of this <b>internal</b> <b>imbalance</b> is due to negative impacts of external real exchange rate (RER) shocks, as well as to changes in the destination of foreign direct investment (FDI) among different sectors of the economy. The model used to explain the imbalance is based on the Dependent Economy theoretical framework, in which production in a small open economy is disaggregated into tradable and non-tradable goods. Under this production scheme, any RER movement in terms of appreciation or depreciation produces a displacement of resources, either along the production possibilities frontier or through the unemployment zone. After demonstrating that the RER suffered an important appreciation in 1997, a model of the aggregate-supply function is constructed considering two variable outputs (tradable and non-tradable goods) and two variable inputs (capital and labor), suggesting in the end the existence of a slow restructuring process at the expense of unemployment of the labor force.

Two hypotheses on how mortality progresses in a tree are proposed in the literature: Manion’s gradual decline hypothesis and Bossel’s sudden death hypothesis. Bossel already formulated a mechanism in his model, BAUMTOD, {{as the cause of}} sudden death phenomena. His model, however, cannot be used to generate a causal understanding to Manion’s hypothesis. Therefore, a causal mechanism for the gradual decline pattern, advocated by Manion, is suggested. BAUMTOD is modified accordingly and the modified model is called BAUMTOD-M. The suggested mechanism concerns the <b>internal</b> <b>imbalance</b> of respiration demand and available photosynthate supply. Then, the eigenvalue elasticity analysis (EEA) is employed to pinpoint how a simulated tree responds to various stresses. It is applied to BAUMTOD and BAUMTOD-M to study the likely structural causes behind tree mortality according to Bossel’s and Manion’s hypotheses, respectively.

This thesis addresses the question of the decomposability of the one-minute average value of ACE, ACE 1, the primary variable in the computation of CPS 1 and CPS 2, into components attributable to load fluctuations within defined zones inside the control area. It includes a description of the dynamic models of ACE and ACE 1 that are used to determine the contributions of the sub-areas. Some of the practical issues with on-line implementation of the proposed decomposition method, including non-linearities in the governors 2 ̆ 7 dead bands and the impact of load disturbance external to the control area are examined.

However, since long deep process of erosion of the role of foremen can be observed, together with numerous difficulties connected with carring out. that role and with a random selection of candidates for that post. The article contains the results of soundings carried out in years 1984 - 1988 among foremen and heads of production departments in various branches of light ind astry. The results indicate the following phenomena: a) The organizational and professional role of foremen in light industry enterprises is characterized by a considerable degree of <b>internal</b> <b>imbalance.</b> There exists among the researched persons an acute awareness of the disproportion between their duties and responsibility {{on the one hand and}} their actual rights on the other, b) A specific feature of the organizational and professional role of foremen m an enterprise is the conflict between the expectations towards a foreman formulated by workers on the one hand and the department management on the other. c) Foremen point at wrong attitude towards them on the part of department management. This attitude is often characterized by excessive autocracy. In effect, it gives rise to the situation where a foreman is only a passive executor of decisions rather than an active decision-maker and leader. The article also contains the conclusions — based on the opinions expressed by the researched persons — aimed at strengthening the role of foremen in an enterprise. Most of these conclusions can be reduced to the postulate of increasing the autonomy of foremen in the management structure.

The presence of humoral pathology and miasma theory in the representations of the effects of the plague on the body, as well as of adequate preventive measures, reveals a particular conception of the disease.

40|$|Expecting an {{appreciation}} of the Chinese currency seems to be a safe bet. There is a mounting pressure from U. S. representatives, and a majority of economists seem to believe that the Chinese economy is overheating and that the dollar peg should be loosened as soon as possible. Indeed, a nominal appreciation may help reduce reserve inflows and allow for a more autonomous monetary policy in the case of overheating. A plausible strategy would be a small one-step revaluation, which would bring the renminbi to parity with the Hong Kong dollar. However, such an adjustment may provoke additional speculative capital inflows and is not even necessary to bring about the real appreciation. Overheating should lead to an increase in domestic inflation rates above the U. S. level, which 2 ̆ 013 given the fixed nominal exchange rate 2 ̆ 013 delivers the real appreciation. There are certain signs that the Chinese economy is not characterized by overheating but rather by overinvestment. Indications for overinvestment are the strong expansion of investment above 40 percent of GDP, the increase in real estate prices in high-growth regions, and the lack of a strong increase in consumer prices. In that case, the present restrictive policy mix of the Chinese authorities is preserving the situation of excess supply and undervaluation. A nominal appreciation would even increase the <b>internal</b> <b>imbalance,</b> as claimed by Chinese authorities. Whereas the diagnosis is controversial with respect to overheating versus overinvestment, undervaluation can be taken as a stylized fact. Hence, short-run adjustment could be achieved by less restrictive monetary and fiscal policies conditional {{on the development of the}} consumer price inflation which should be allowed to show a positive differential versus the U. S. consumer price inflation. Apart from such short-run consideration, the more general question is how to sequence the shift to a flexible exchange rate regime, which seems to be adequate for a large country like China. On the one hand, it is plausible that China should learn to float while the capital account is relatively closed. On the other hand, both opening up the capital account and introducing exchange rate flexibility need a certain degree of capital market development. Additionally, one-side bets on the direction of exchange rate movements when giving up a peg should be avoided. Both preconditions are currently not given in the case of China. The priorities for balancing short-run adjustment and long-run optimality are (1) a real appreciation via higher consumer price inflation and (2) speeding up domestic capital market reform as long as capital controls are effective to some extent. This should allow phasing in an augmented inflation targeting regime and avoiding a hard landing, which otherwise may be the consequence of lifting a solid exchange rate anchor in stormy waters...|$|E
