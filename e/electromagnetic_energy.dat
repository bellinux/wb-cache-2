5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy,</b> according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E
5|$|Quasars (/ˈkweɪzɑr/) or quasi-stellar radio {{sources are}} the most {{energetic}} and distant members of a class of objects called active galactic nuclei (AGN). Quasars are extremely luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy,</b> including radio waves and visible light, {{that appeared to be}} similar to stars, rather than extended sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the methods {{for evaluating the}} stored <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energies</b> and the radiation Q for an arbitrary lossless antenna. New expressions for the stored <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energies</b> are derived by using the Poynting theorem in the complex frequency domain, and they are compared with previous theory and are validated by numerical examples. The minimization of radiation Q is also investigated. There exists an optimal current distribution that minimizes the radiation Q for specified antenna geometry. The optimized Q and the optimal current distribution may be determined by solving a generalized eigenvalue equation obtained from the Rayleigh quotient for the radiation Q.

5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.|$|E

25|$|To solve those problems, Henri Poincaré in 1905 and 1906 {{introduced}} {{some sort}} of pressure ("Poincaré stresses") of non-electromagnetic nature. As required by Abraham, these stresses contribute non-electromagnetic energy to the electrons, amounting to 1/4 of their total energy or to 1/3 of their <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy.</b> So, the Poincaré stresses remove the contradiction in the derivation of the longitudinal electromagnetic mass, they prevent the electron from exploding, they remain unaltered by a Lorentz transformation (i.e. they are Lorentz invariant), and were also thought as a dynamical explanation of length contraction. However, Poincaré still assumed that only the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> contributes to {{the mass of the}} bodies.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} from {{ambient vibration}} is an emerging and promising {{solution to the}} power supply problem associated with autonomous sensors. This article proposes a novel strategy of harvesting damping energy from vibration control devices. A novel system, termed <b>electromagnetic</b> damper cum <b>energy</b> harvester, is employed to fulfill both vibration damping and <b>energy</b> harvesting functions. <b>Electromagnetic</b> damper cum <b>energy</b> harvester is essentially an electromagnetic device connected to a specially designed energy harvesting circuit, which is a buck-boost converter operating in a discontinuous conduction mode. The energy harvesting circuit can achieve satisfactory efficiency without any feedback loop. The effectiveness of the dual-function <b>electromagnetic</b> damper cum <b>energy</b> harvester is demonstrated through a numerical case study of bridge stay cables under wind excitations, in which the major parameters of <b>electromagnetic</b> damper cum <b>energy</b> harvester are determined through a simple design approach. Simulation results project average output power ranging from 82. 5 to 2396. 8 mW at a wind speed of 9 - 15 m/s, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 42. 3 %. The dual-function <b>electromagnetic</b> damper cum <b>energy</b> harvester also exhibits vibration control performance comparable to an optimally designed viscous fluid damper.

25|$|Two common albedos {{that are}} used in {{astronomy}} are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> reflected).

25|$|Like others before, Poincaré (1900) {{discovered}} a relation between mass and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy.</b> While studying {{the conflict between}} the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{discharges}} {{are considered}} to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; lightning channels behave like huge antennas that radiate <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> at frequencies below about 100kHz. These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth–ionosphere waveguide behaves like a resonator at ELF frequencies and amplifies the spectral signals from lightning at the resonance frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Colour {{therapy is}} a {{vibrational}} medicine based on Einsteinian and Quantum Physics theories using colour vibrational energies to rebalance the body’s subtle energies to create states of holistic well-being. It {{is thought that}} vibrational medicines affect the resonation of the body’s cells and organs through the body’s ability to absorb and emit <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energies</b> through the skin. In epidemiological studies {{the effects of these}} invisible <b>energies,</b> environmental <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energies</b> and nutritional and chemical changes in the body and are of particular research interest (Gerber 1). Positive energies are considered to work in harmony with the body. However there are harmful energies, or negative energies that create imbalances which are thought to result in physical illness. Also when the body is subjected to prolonged and excessive amounts of a frequency it is thought to eventual act as a negative energy (a type of electromagnetic pollution) first affecting psychological and emotional health followed by physical illness or disease (dis-ease). The application of coloured fabrics to the skin is a method used to allow the body to absorb the required frequency to rebalance the energy system. Given that the colour frequencies of fabrics can be used to alter energies to heal the body then it must be possible for the reverse to happen.
