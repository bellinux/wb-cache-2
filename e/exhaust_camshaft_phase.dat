50|$|For twin cam or DOHC engines, VCT {{was used}} {{on either the}} intake or <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> (Engines that have VCT on both {{camshafts}} are now designated as Ti-VCT.) The use of variable camshaft timing on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> is for improved emissions, and vehicles with VCT on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> do not require exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as retarding the exhaust cam timing achieves the same result. VCT on the intake camshaft is used primarily for increasing engine power and torque as the PCM is able to optimize {{the opening of the}} intake valves to match the engine conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{variable}} valve timing (VANOS) is a continuously variable design and is present on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts.</b> The VANOS units were designed as integral components of the chain drive, and the adjustment ranges are 63 degrees for the intake camshaft and 60 degrees for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The redline for the N73 is 6500 rpm.|$|R

50|$|MIVEC (Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing Electronic Control system) is {{the brand}} name of a {{variable}} valve timing (VVT) engine technology developed by Mitsubishi Motors. MIVEC, as with other similar systems, varies {{the timing of the}} intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> which increases the power and torque output over a broad engine speed range while also being able to help spool a turbocharger more quickly and accurately.|$|R
50|$|VVT-iE (Variable Valve Timing - {{intelligent}} by Electric motor) is {{a version}} of Dual VVT-i that uses an electrically operated actuator to adjust and maintain intake <b>camshaft</b> timing. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing is still controlled using a hydraulic actuator. This form of variable valve timing technology was developed initially for Lexus vehicles. This system was first introduced on the 2007MY Lexus LS 460 as 1UR engine.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{players can}} modify {{any part of}} their vehicle using a dynamic garage system. Like the cars, the parts are fictional, and are {{supplied}} by the game's fictional parts developer SL Tuners.

Parts can be mixed and matched to create unique engines.|$|R
50|$|The Series 2 Interceptor {{engine was}} a major {{redesign}} of the Series 1A engine. It included a wet sump engine to improve oil flow to the crankshaft. The CB points were moved {{to the end of}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> and the timing cover was redesigned accordingly. This engine was used on the Interceptor until the end of production in 1970. This engine was later used on Rickman Interceptor and Clymer Enfields.|$|R
50|$|Continuous VVT {{was adopted}} {{for the first}} time. Featured on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts,</b> each can be varied through a range of 40 degrees. The twin spark plug system was {{replaced}} by a regular single spark plug per cylinder. New electronic coolant flow control has replaced the mechanical thermostat for improved engine warm-up and optimum control of engine temperature. Also tumble flaps are used to improve output at low engine speeds.|$|R
50|$|Honda i-VTEC (intelligent-VTEC) has VTC {{continuously}} variable timing of <b>camshaft</b> <b>phasing</b> on the intake camshaft of DOHC VTEC engines. The technology {{first appeared on}} Honda's K-series four-cylinder engine family in 2001 (In the United States, the technology debuted on the 2002 Honda CR-V).|$|R
50|$|A single {{timing belt}} drives the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{along with the}} oil and water pumps. The cam journal is {{supported}} on 5 points between the valve lifters of each cylinder and {{on the front of}} the cylinder head. The cam journals are lubricated by oiler port located in the middle of the camshaft. To adjust the valve clearance in the first two generations, a shim over bucket system is employed. In the following generations a shim under bucket system is used.|$|R
50|$|These {{engines are}} a distant {{relative}} to the F-series engines found in the mid 1990s Honda Accord and Prelude. To get most out of the compact sized engine, Honda engineers utilized technology derived from Honda's racing engines. The F20C and F22C1 have two overhead cams with roller followers, a ladder-frame main bearing stiffener, a VTEC system for both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft,</b> Fiber-Reinforced Metal cylinder liners (FRM), molybdenum disulfide-coated piston skirts for reduced friction, and use a timing chain.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mercedes-Benz built a 3.5-litre M-291 flat-12 engine for {{endurance}} racing. This engine employed a clever cylinder-head design with exhaust ports where the intake ports {{would normally be}} (on top of the engine, pointing upwards). The intake ports are between the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts,</b> just above the spark-plugs, pointing at an outward angle from the vertical. Putting the exhaust system on top, rather than underneath, allowed the engine to ride much lower in the engine-bay of the C-291 (and later C-292).|$|R
50|$|Honda i-VTEC is {{a system}} for fuel economy(intelligent-VTEC) has VTC {{continuously}} variable timing of <b>camshaft</b> <b>phasing</b> on the intake camshaft of DOHC VTEC engines.

50|$|The OM 668 {{makes use}} of the common rail system. Compared to the otto engine M 166 it has four valves per {{cylinder}} instead of two. Two chain driven overhead camshafts are used. The intake camshaft is driven by a chain, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{is connected to the}} intake camshaft with a gear. Another chain drives the oil pump from the crankshaft. All engines have a turbocharger and all engines with more than 44 kW power also have an intercooler. In 1997 the OM 668 was the smallest diesel engine by Mercedes-Benz.|$|R
50|$|The 2.0L Zetec Inline-4 {{used in the}} 1998-2003 Ford Escort ZX2, Ford Contour, and 99-02 Mercury Cougar used VCT on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The 2002-2004 SVT Focus (ST170 in Europe) also {{featured}} VCT, but on the intake camshaft of its {{modified version of the}} 2.0L Zetec engine. In addition, the 1.7L Zetec-S engine found in the European Ford Puma was equipped with variable camshaft timing. The 6.2L V8 introduced in the 2010 SVT Raptor also uses VCT. That motor has a single cam per bank, so it is dual-equal variable cam timing.|$|R
