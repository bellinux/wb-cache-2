5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to <b>deductions</b> for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules).

This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian {{increased}} basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive.

Moreover, most of the advantages of partial <b>deduction,</b> e. g. lower complexity and a more detailed understanding of control issues, are preserved. We build on well-defined concepts in partial <b>deduction</b> and present a conceptual embedding of folding into partial <b>deduction,</b> called conjunctive partial <b>deduction.</b> Two minimal extensions to partial <b>deduction</b> are proposed: using conjunctions of atoms instead of atoms as the principle specialisation entity and also renaming conjunctions of atoms instead of individual atoms. Correctness results for the extended framework (with respect to computed answer semantics and finite failure semantics) are given.
