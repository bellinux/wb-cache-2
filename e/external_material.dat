500|$|In 1906, Queene Ferry Coonley, wife {{of wealthy}} Riverside {{industrialist}} and publisher Avery Coonley, {{decided to start}} a kindergarten program to allow children younger than five years old to attend. Queene Coonley was trained {{as a social worker}} and kindergarten teacher at the Detroit Normal School (now Wayne State University) and was impressed by the theories of Friedrich Fröbel, who believed children's early education should be an extension of their lives at home. Fröbel's theories captured the three main principles of what John Dewey would later call the [...] "kindergarten attitude", which applied not just to kindergartners but to children of all ages. Dewey wrote that the primary role of the school is to train children in cooperative living, the root of all learning is the activity of the child and not <b>external</b> <b>material,</b> and directing children's spontaneous impulses towards maintaining the collective life of the school is how they become prepared for adult life. Convinced of these principles, Coonley sought to enroll her four-year-old daughter in the Riverside School, one of the few public kindergartens in the area, but was disappointed when the child was not eligible because she had not yet turned five.|$|E

60|$|Secondly, {{the other}} {{fountain}} from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,--the {{perception of the}} operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;--which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, {{which could not be}} had from things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds;--which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called INTERNAL SENSE. But as I call the other Sensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz. <b>external</b> <b>material</b> things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the operations of our own minds within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings. The term OPERATIONS here I use in a large sense, as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.|$|E

Using the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) method to image the global vector field, our new algorithm allows the user to introduce colored "dye" into the vector field to highlight local flow features.

In addition, we introduce volume rendering methods that can map the LIC texture on any contour surface and/or translucent region defined by additional scalar quantities, and can follow the advection of colored dye throughout the volume. 1 Introduction Visualizing vector field data is challenging because no existing natural representation can visually convey large amounts of three-dimensional directional information.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{structure}} of composite power plane with a spiral electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) and an <b>external</b> magnetic <b>material</b> is {{proposed for the}} suppression of simultaneous switching noise (SSN) in the mixed-signal systems.

The new structure is relatively simple to fabricate and cost effective because the <b>external</b> magnetic <b>material</b> is partially placed {{on the top of}} perforated spiral-bridged EBG plane. The EBG bandgap is shifted to lower frequencies by the real part of the permeability (µ′r), and the power plane Q-factor is also decreased by the imaginary part of the permeability (µ′′r) associated with the magnetic loss. It is expected the reduction of a circuit size and an improvement of the power integrity with the mixed-signal systems in the given new structure. 1...|$|R

In the first realistic stage, children are restricted by <b>external</b> <b>material</b> forces. Upon reaching the stage of youth, they begin to learn how to overcome these restrictions by what Stirner calls the [...] "self-discovery of mind". However, in the idealistic stage, a youth now becomes enslaved by internal forces such as conscience, reason and other 'spooks' or 'fixed ideas' of the mind (including religion, nationalism and other ideologies). The final stage, 'egoism' sees the now adult individual freed from all internal and external constraints, attaining individual autonomy.|$|E

But the internal potency is the Lord's personal energy and stands over the other two.So jivatma, living being is never equal to Supreme Godhead and also always subordinate to Him.
