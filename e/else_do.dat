Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E

500|$|The {{voice of}} SpongeBob was {{originally}} used by Kenny for a minor background character in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he}} was coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny do the voice, he said, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody <b>else</b> <b>do</b> the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] He said that to Nickelodeon; however, the network said, [...] "Well, let's just listen to 100 more people."

500|$|Tom Rothman, {{chairman}} of the film's co-financier Fox Filmed Entertainment, described the film's marketing strategy thus: [...] "How are we marketing it? It's Cruise and Spielberg. What <b>else</b> <b>do</b> we need to do?" [...] The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise's resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues. With their combined 30% take of the film's box office though, sources such as BusinessWeek's Ron Grover predicted the studios {{would have a hard}} time making the money needed to break even. Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film. Entertainment Weekly projected the film would gross $40 million domestic in its opening weekend, and Variety predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a [...] "commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run." ...|$|E

Later in hospital, {{it was announced that}} Ratzenberger had {{died as a result of}} his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard.

500|$|Kenny voices SpongeBob SquarePants and {{a variety}} of other characters, {{including}} SpongeBob's pet snail Gary and the French narrator. He also physically portrays Patchy the Pirate in live-action segments of most special episodes. Kenny previously worked with Stephen Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life and, when Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he approached Kenny to voice the main character. Kenny originally used the voice of SpongeBob for a minor character on Rocko. He forgot how to perform the voice initially and did not intend to use it afterwards. Hillenburg, however, used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny perform the voice, he immediately knew he wanted it for his character. He said to Nickelodeon executives, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody <b>else</b> <b>do</b> the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] The network insisted on auditioning more actors, but Hillenburg turned them down; in the words of Tom Kenny, [...] "one of the advantages of having a strong creator is that the creator can say, 'No, I like that—I don't care about celebrities.'" [...] While Kenny was developing SpongeBob's voice, the show's casting crew wanted him to have a unique, high-pitched laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E

[...] A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a [...] "fresh take on a New Edition classic" [...] and concluded that it was a [...] "lot more simple than it sounds."

[...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat!

[...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition's [...] "If It Isn't Love" [...] but added that when the song's key changes start, [...] "Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit brassier and fancier".
