5|$|In college, Harris was a five-time All-American, while {{earning the}} two {{individual}} (2002 indoor and outdoor) National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships. He also represented Team USA at one World University Games. He {{is both the}} Ivy League indoor and outdoor <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> record holder and Princeton's only two-time NCAA individual event track and field champion. He is an eight-time individual Ivy League/Heptagonal champion, winning the indoor and outdoor <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> championships four times each.|$|E
5|$|Ward was the Michigan High School Athlete of the Year, {{after setting}} a {{national}} prep {{record in the}} <b>high</b> <b>jump.</b> At the University of Michigan, he was a collegiate champion in the <b>high</b> <b>jump,</b> the long jump, the 100-yard dash, and the 440-yard dash, and {{finished second in the}} voting for the Associated Press Big Ten Athlete of the Year award in 1933. In track and field he was a three-time All-American and eight-time Big Ten champion.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's floor events in artistic gymnastics, {{there was a}} tie for the gold medal and no silver was awarded. There were also ties for the silver medal in men's 200 metres breaststroke in swimming, men's pole vault in athletics, and men's doubles in bowling. Thus, no bronzes were awarded in these events. Lastly, ties for third in both canoeing’s men's K1 1000 metres and athletics’ women’s <b>high</b> <b>jump,</b> {{as well as a}} three-way tie for third in athletics’ men’s <b>high</b> <b>jump,</b> meant that multiple bronze medals were awarded for these events.|$|E

5|$|During his {{freshman}} year at USC, he became an All-American by placing 8th in the year-end National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) outdoor championships. During the subsequent summer he became the U.S. Junior National <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> Champion and {{won a gold medal}} at the 2015 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships. He won the 2016 NCAA outdoor championships as a sophomore and was an All-American as a junior.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and <b>high</b> <b>jump.</b> The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the four}} athletes {{advanced}} past the qualifying stages, and thus did not win any medals. Evans ranked thirtieth overall in the qualifying round for javelin; Johnson also ranked thirtieth overall in the pole vault qualifying round; and Spencer ranked twenty-seventh in the qualifying round for <b>high</b> <b>jump.</b> Additionally, Beaubrun ranked forty-second in the swimming qualifying stages.|$|E
50|$|He began {{experimenting with}} his own {{versions}} of trick shots, and eventually developed many new concepts, such as ball jumping, massé-ing with multiple cues simultaneously, executing jump and massé shots on moving balls, and executing very <b>high</b> <b>jumps.</b> He has set a record for <b>highest</b> <b>jump</b> shot on a moving ball, at 23 inches.|$|R

5|$|Eleven {{male athletes}} competed {{in track and}} field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4×400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4×400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an {{individual}} event and the 4×400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, 110 meters hurdles, and <b>high</b> <b>jump).</b> The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men {{in track and field}} events (4×400 meters relay and triple jump).|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E

5|$|Equestrian {{sports are}} among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when {{competitions}} in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, mail coach driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types of jumping (<b>high</b> <b>jump,</b> long jump and show-jumping) were held. Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping. Competitors in the modern pentathlon event also have to complete an equestrian show-jumping course, {{but this is not}} part of the equestrian events.|$|E
5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court. The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's <b>High</b> <b>Jump</b> F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E
5|$|Jumping {{technique}} {{has played a}} significant part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This {{technique has}} become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E

5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's <b>high</b> <b>jump,</b> and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was {{the captain}} of the U.S. {{national}} basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but Russell prevailed. He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> if he had been snubbed by the basketball team. Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.|$|E

5|$|Born in Birmingham, Alabama, {{he moved}} {{with his family to}} Decatur, Illinois at age11. Prior to his senior year in high school, his family moved to Detroit. In 1945, {{following}} Fonville's lone track season at Detroit's Miller High School, he was named Michigan High School Track & Field Athlete of the Year for his first-place performance at the Detroit City League Meet. Fonville's winning effort in the shot put was five feet better than that of the state champion. Later that summer, Charlie Fonville and Jessie Nimmons competed in the Detroit YMCA Track Championship as a two-man team for the St. Antoine YMCA; Fonville won the 100m, 200m, <b>high</b> <b>jump,</b> and shot put. Fonville and Nimmons won the 440yard relay, with each of them running 220yard legs. They were later disqualified for not having four runners. They finished in second place at the meet; their disqualification in the 440 preventing them from winning.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{became the}} 2012 NCAA steeplechase {{champion}} on June 8, 2012, winning by five seconds and capping an undefeated {{season in the}} event. Cabral is Princeton's first individual track event NCAA champion since William Bonthron's 1934 championship in the mile run in 1934. This does excludes field event champions such as Tora Harris (2002 <b>high</b> <b>jump)</b> who had been Princeton's last NCAA Outdoor Track and Field champion. When combined with the men's squash team and epeeist Jonathan Yergler, it marked the first academic year that Princeton had three national champions since 2003. Harris had also been the last track and field Olympian, although no Princeton distance runner had qualified for the Olympics since class of 1906 Princetonian John Eisele earned a silver medal in the steeplechase and a bronze medal in the three-mile at the 1908 Summer Olympics. No Princeton runner had made the Olympics since Bill Stevenson went to the 1924 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's <b>high</b> <b>jump</b> event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
