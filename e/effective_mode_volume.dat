40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{study of the}} effects of structural disorder on LN photonic crystal slab cavities, ranging from short to long length scales (N= 3 - 29), employing a fully three-dimensional Bloch mode expansion technique. We compute the optical density of states (DOS), quality factors and <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> of the cavity modes and compare with the localized modes of a corresponding disordered photonic crystal waveguide. We show that the quality factors and <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> saturate at a specific cavity length and become bounded by the corresponding values of the Anderson modes appearing in the disordered waveguide. We also show that the field confinement in the LN cavities is mainly determined by Anderson localization as long as the confinement region is far enough from the cavity mirrors and if the <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> localization length is much smaller than the cavity length. Surprisingly, we find that the Anderson-localized modes do not appear as new disorder-induced resonances in the main spectral region of the LN cavities and, moreover, the disordered DOS enhancement is largest for the disordered waveguide system with the same length. These results are fundamentally interesting for applications such as lasing and cavity-QED, and provide new insights into the role of the boundary condition (e. g., open versus mirrors) on a finite-size slow-light waveguide. They also point out the clear failure of using models based on the cavity boundaries/mirrors and a single slow-light Bloch mode to describe cavity systems with large N, which has been common practise...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{semiconductor}} lasers have relentlessly followed the path towards miniaturization. Smaller lasers are more energy efficient, are cheaper to make, and open up new applications in sensing and displays, among many other things. Yet, up until recently, there was a fundamental problem with making lasers smaller: purely semiconductor lasers couldn't be made smaller than the diffraction limit of light. In recent years, however, metal-based lasers have been demonstrated in the nanoscale that have shattered the diffraction limit. As optical materials, metals {{can be used to}} either reflect light (metal-optics) or convert light to electrical currents (plasmonics). In both cases, metals have provided ways to squeeze light beyond the diffraction limit. In this dissertation, I experimentally demonstrated one nanolaser based on plasmonic transduction and another laser based on metal-optic reflection. To create coherent plasmons, I designed a nanolaser based on a plasmonic bandgap defect state inside a surface plasmonic crystal. In a one-dimensional periodic semiconductor beam, I was able to confine surface plasmons by interrupting the periodicity of the crystal. These confined surface plasmons then underwent laser oscillations in <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> as small as 0. 007 cubic wavelengths. At this electromagnetic volume, energy was squeezed 10 times smaller than those possible in similar photonic crystals that do not utilize metal. This demonstration should pave the way for achieving engineered nanolasers with deep-subwavelength <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> and enable plasmonic crystals to become attractive platforms for designing plasmons. After achieving large reductions in electromagnetic <b>mode</b> <b>volumes,</b> I switched to a metal-optics-based nanolaser design to further reduce the physical volumes of small light sources. The semiconductor nanopatch laser achieved laser oscillations with subwavelength-scale physical dimensions (0. 019 cubic wavelengths) and <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volumes</b> (0. 0017 cubic wavelengths). The ultra-small laser volume is achieved with the presence of nanoscale metal patches which suppress electromagnetic radiation into free-space and convert a leaky cavity into a highly-confined subwavelength optical resonator. The nanopatch laser, with its world-record-breaking small physical volume, has exciting implications for data storage, biological sensing, on-chip optical communication, and beyond...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{physically}} bending an optical fibre around a cylindrical form is to slightly modify the effective refractive index in the curved region, which locally reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> of the fibre.

2500|$|For a laser in a nanocavity, {{spontaneous}} emission (SE) from the gain medium {{is enhanced by}} the Purcell effect, equal to the quality factor or Q-factor of the cavity divided by the <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> field <b>volume,</b> F = Q/Vmode. Therefore, reducing the volume of an optical cavity can dramatically increase this factor, which can {{have the effect of}} decreasing the input power threshold for lasing.

A laser formed in a nanocavity therefore may be modulated via its pump source at very high speeds. Spontaneous emission rate increases of over 70 times modern semiconductor laser devices have been demonstrated, with theoretical laser modulation speeds exceeding 100GHz, an order of magnitude higher than modern semiconductor lasers, and higher than most digital oscilloscopes.

30|$|However, as {{the three}} pairs of air holes near the PC L 3 nanocavity center are further moved outward, the nanocavity mode is {{confined}} inside the nanocavity more and more gently [25], as shown in Figure[*] 1 b.

40|$|Chip-scale {{photonic}} {{devices such}} as microdisks, photonic crystal cavities and slow-light photonic crystal waveguides possess strong light localization and long photon lifetime, which will significantly enhance the light-matter interactions {{and can be used}} to implement new functionalities for both classical and quantum information processing, optical computation and optical communication in integrated nanophotonic circuits. This thesis will focus on three topics about light matter interactions and quantum information processing with chip-scale photonic devices, including 1) Design and characterization of asymmetric resonate cavity with radiation directionality and air-slot photonic crystal cavity with ultrasmall <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume,</b> 2) Exciton-photon interactions between quantum dots and photonic crystal devices and non-classical photon source from a single quantum dot, and 3) Quantum controlled phase gate and phase switching based on quantum dots and photonic crystal waveguide. The first topic is engineered control of radiation directionality and <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> for optical mode in chip-scale silicon micro-/nano-cavities. High quality factor (Q), subwavelength mode volume (V) and controllable radiation directionality are the major properties for optical cavities designs. In Chapter 2, asymmetric resonant cavities with rational caustics are proposed and interior whispering gallery modes in monolithic silicon mesoscopic microcavities are experimentally demonstrated. These microcavities possess unique robustness of cavity quality factor against roughness Rayleigh scattering. In Chapter 3, air-slot mode-gap photonic crystal cavities with quality factor of 10 ^ 4 and <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> ~ 0. 02 cubic wavelengths are experimentally demonstrated. The origin of the high Q air-slot cavity mode is the mode-gap effect from the slotted photonic crystal waveguide mode with negative dispersion. The second topic is exciton-photon coupling between quantum dots and twodimensional photonic crystal nanocavities and waveguide localized modes, including Purcell effect in weak coupling regime and vacuum Rabi splitting in strong coupling regime. In Chapter 4, micro-photoluminescence measurements of PbS quantum dots coupled to air-slot mode-gap photonic crystal cavities with potentially high qualify factor and small <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> are presented. Purcell factor due to ultrahigh Q/V ratios are critical for applications in non-classical photon sources, cavity QED, nonlinear optics and sensing. In Chapter 5, the observation of subpoisson photon statistics from a single InAs quantum dot emission is presented from both continuous wave and pulsed Hanbury Brown and Twiss measurement. Furthermore, strong coupling between single quantum dot exciton line and photonic crystal waveguide localized mode is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically analyzed with master equations, which {{can be used as a}} great implementation platform for realizing future solid-state quantum computation. The third topic is quantum controlled phase gate and phase switching operations based on quantum dots and photonic crystal slow-light waveguide. In Chapter 6, we propose a scheme to realize controlled phase gate between two single photons through a single quantum dot embedded in a photonic crystal waveguide. Enhanced Purcell factor and large Î² factor lead to high gate fidelity over broadband frequencies compared to cavity-assisted system. The excellent physical integration of this photonic crystal waveguide system provides tremendous potential for large-scale quantum information processing. In Chapter 7, dipole induced transparency can be achieved in a system which consists of two quantum dots properly located in silicon photonic crystal waveguide.

40|$|Powerlaws {{have long}} been used to {{describe}} the spectral dependence of aerosol extinction, and the wavelength exponent of the aerosol extinction powerlaw is commonly referred to as the Angstrom exponent. The Angstrom exponent is often used as a qualitative indicator of aerosol particle size, with values greater than two indicating small particles associated with combustion byproducts, and values less than one indicating large particles like sea salt and dust. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the Angstrom exponent and the mode parameters of bimodal aerosol size distributions using Mie theory calculations and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals. We find that Angstrom exponents based upon seven wavelengths (0. 34, 0. 38, 0. 44, 0. 5, 0. 67, 0. 87, and 1. 02 micrometers) are sensitive to the volume fraction of aerosols with radii less then 0. 6 micrometers, but not to the fine <b>mode</b> <b>effective</b> radius. The Angstrom exponent is also known to vary with wavelength, which is commonly referred to as curvature; we show how the spectral curvature can provide additional information about aerosol size distributions for intermediate values of the Angstrom exponent. Curvature also has a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn about two-wavelength Angstrom exponents; long wavelengths (0. 67, 0. 87 micrometers) are sensitive to fine <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> fraction of aerosols but not fine <b>mode</b> <b>effective</b> radius, while short wavelengths (0. 38, 0. 44 micrometers) are sensitive to the fine <b>mode</b> <b>effective</b> radius but not the fine <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> fraction...|$|R

This can greatly improve the efficiency of photonic devices as well as lead to novel physical phenomena. While {{over the past several years}} resonators have improved to confine photons for longer periods of time, the volume in which light can be confined has remained relatively stagnant on the order of a cubic half-wavelength which has been thought to be the fundamental limit. In this dissertation we demonstrate that the <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> of optical resonant cavities can be reduced below a cubic half-wavelength. We develop novel tools to characterize these highly confined optical modes, and utilize this light confinement to achieve efficient light-matter interaction in photonic devices. Finally we present novel physical phenomena which result from this nanoscale light confinement. The dissertation is organized into six chapters. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to photonics and the reasons for pursuing nanoscale light confinement. In Chapter 2 we define the <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> <b>volume</b> and discuss its theoretical limit. We show with analytical and numerical calculations that contrary to previous assumptions sub-wavelength-sized dielectric structures can enable mode volumes smaller than a cubic half-wavelength.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic cavity modes in {{photonic}} and plasmonic resonators offer {{rich and}} attractive regimes for tailoring {{the properties of}} light−matter interactions, {{yet there is a}} disturbing lack of a precise definition for what constitutes a cavity mode, and as a result their mathematical properties remain largely unspecified. The lack of a definition is evidenced in part by the diverse nomenclature at use, “resonance”, “leaky mode”, and “quasimode”, to name but a few, suggesting that the dissipative nature of cavity modes somehow makes them different from other modes, but an explicit distinction is rarely made. This Perspective aims to introduce the reader to some of the subtleties and working definitions that can be rigorously applied when describing the modal properties of leaky optical cavities and plasmonic nanoresonators.
