It was six feet high on the side facing the water, with two embrasures for the guns, four feet high on the sides covered by the chevaux de frise. The front face was twenty-five feet in length, the sides forty. Morning was breaking as the work was finished, and bread and cold meat were served out, with a <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> of grog.

60|$|Now, necessity, in such matters, {{is clearly}} the primary law. If a country cannot exist without a large {{standing}} army, and the men {{are not to be}} had by voluntary enlistments, a draft is probably the wisest and best regulation for its security. But, taking this principle as the basis of the national defence, a just and a paternal government would occupy itself in equalizing the effects of the burden, as far as circumstances would in any manner admit. The most obvious and efficient means would be by raising the rate of pay to the level, at least, of a scale that should admit of substitutes being obtained at reasonable rates. This is done with us, where a soldier receives a <b>full</b> <b>ration,</b> all his clothes, and sixty dollars a year.[10] It is true, that this would make an army very costly, and, to bear the charge, it might be necessary to curtail some of the useless magnificence and prodigality of the other branches of the government; and herein is just the point of difference between the expenditures of America and those of France. It must be remembered, too, that a really free government, by enlisting the popular feeling in its behalf through its justice, escapes all the charges that are incident to the necessity of maintaining power by force, wanting soldiers for its enemies without, and not for its enemies within. We have no need of a large standing army, on account of our geographical position, it is true; but had we the government of France, we should not find that our geographical position exempted us from the charge.|$|E

5000|$|One {{deprivation}} {{suffered by}} the prisoners was a poor diet, although again this must be seen in context: {{as a result of}} the economic blockade of Germany, little food was available locally even for the civilian population. Prisoners were able to supplement their diet with the contents of parcels sent by their families at home, and by the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations. As a result, they were often better fed than the Germans. Prisoners were often able to use items of food to bribe their guards in return for lenient treatment or contraband equipment; while at other times they made a point of taunting their captors with the superiority of their material welfare, for example by drawing their <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> of German black bread only to burn it. Before the prisoners finally left the camp in December 1918, they made a bonfire of the furniture and everything else combustible: [...] "it was a splendid sight and the Germans could only stand by helplessly, condemning the waste".|$|E
5000|$|The 1941 Clipper was {{the widest}} {{production}} {{car in the}} industry and first to be wider than it was tall—a foot wider to be exact. The body from cowl to deck was {{a single piece of}} steel—largest in the industry, and the floor pan had only one welded seam from end to end. Single pieces of sheet metal comprised the rear quarters and hood. The hood could be lifted from either side of the car or removed entirely by throwing two levers. Instead of the traditional third side window, ventipanes were incorporated in the rear doors, providing controllable flow-through ventilation. The battery made its first move from under the seat to under the hood, where it stayed warmer and was more accessible. There was a [...] "Ventalarm" [...] whistle to warn when the tank was within a gallon of being full, and an accelerator-activated starter button, so the act of starting simultaneously set the automatic choke. Reithard's beautiful symmetrical dashboard contained a <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> of instruments, including an electric oil pressure gauge adapted from the One Sixty. Options included Packard's Electromatic clutch, which let the driver ignore the clutch pedal in ordinary driving; [...] "Aerodrive" [...] (overdrive); an effective auxiliary under-seat heater, leather upholstery, fender skirts, and, for $275, air conditioning—a Packard first, introduced on all eight-cylinder 1940 models.|$|E

50|$|General Townshend sent {{reports about}} his {{supplies}} to his commander General Nixon (now back in Basra) to induce immediate reinforcement from the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force's base there, which were exaggerated {{to the point}} of being misleading. He indicated that he only had supplies for a month at <b>full</b> <b>ration,</b> however, in reality, his troops finally ran out of supplies near the end of April 1916, almost five months later. This led the British Government, under pressure from the London press's portrayal of Townshend as a hero once again surrounded by Oriental hordes in desperate circumstances (as he had been during the Siege of Chitral 21 years before), to order the hasty dispatch of a military relief force from Basra, which was defeated on arrival at Kut by the unexpectedly strong Ottoman defences under the direction of the newly arrived Prussian Field Marshal Colmar von der Goltz. Townshend's distorted reports about the food situation, claiming he had only enough food to last until 17 February led Sir Fenton Aylmer to make series of desperate attacks to break the siege in January 1916. Aylmer's troops were at the end of such badly stretched supply lines that he had a serious shortage of artillery shells and all of Aylmer's attempts to break the siege ended in failure. Aylmer later wrote that if he knew that Townshend had enough food to last until April that he would never had launched his premature attacks in January and would have waited until he had stockpiled enough artillery shells for an offensive. The heavy rains that started after Christmas 1915 further added to the discomfort of both besieged and besiegers as the ground turned into mud. Shortages of firewood in Kut meant that a fire to warm one's bones became a luxury amid the heavy rains.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of feed on {{two groups of}} Merino hamels which were given different quantities of lucerne, mealies, oats, and saltbush was studied. The body weights of the sheep were reduced by 15. 8 per cent when the feed was reduced. The sheep that were kept on a <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> gained 10. 8 per cent on their initial weights. When the sheep were kept on a reduced ration for nine month and then placed on a <b>full</b> <b>ration,</b> their weights gained by 39. 1 per cent. Underfeeding reduced the scoured fleece weights by 31. 8 per cent. As regards fibre thickness the underfed group produced a considerably finer wool. The initial fibre fineness of 17. 9 µ was reduced to 14. 3 µ, a reduction of 36 per cent in cross sectional area. The latter fibre thickness was restored to the initial stage by good feeding.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the influence of pre-slaughter feeding-fasting history of cultured fish on quality traits of raw fillets. Short pre-slaughter fasting periods (3 - 9 days) led to slight changes in Salmonid fillet quality, whereas longer starvation (35 days) resulted in improved pre-slaughter resistance to stress and delayed rigor (Lòpez-Luna et al., 2014; Bermejo-Poza et al., 2015; Mørkøre et al., 2008). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of a 3 -week pre-slaughter fasting or feed restriction period on the evolution of post mortem quality traits of fillet of large rainbow trout (O. mykiss).

There is evidence with some bacterial fish pathogens that feed withdrawal can signicantly reduce mortality (Damsgård et al., 1998; Wise and Johnson, 1998).

40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference of the Colloquium of Organic Researchers (COR). Under EU organic livestock regulations introduced in 2000, new restrictions were placed on the use of bought-in feedstuffs in hill systems. These reduced the non-organic annual percentage previously allowed in LFAs from 20 % to 10 % of annual dry matter intake. A further stepping down of these allowances may be introduced ahead of a complete ban in 2005. Bought-in feed supplements must therefore, be used strategically and offer “best value for money” in terms of ewe performance and lamb growth. The economic cost of supplementing the diet of twin-rearing ewes post lambing with either an approved non-organic feed block + half ration of commercial concentrate mix (B+CCM) or <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> commercial concentrate mix (CCM) was investigated. Lambs reared by ewes receiving the B+CCM diet had a greater liveweight gain than those reared by ewes receiving the CCM diet per kg of ewe supplementary feed. The costs in terms of kg lamb liveweight were lower for the B+CCM ewes than the CCM ewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{household}} budget surveys in Poland conducted annually by the Central Statisti- cal Office (CSO) are primarily {{used for the}} analysis of relative differentiation and structure of households’ incomes, expenditures and consumption according to socio-demographic traits. The results of observation of individual households are particularly rich sources of data. This paper is an attempt to evaluate the differences in quantitative food consumption in 2008. The food selected by households largely determines their diets. This is important in terms of bene- ficial or adverse effects on human health. Using data from household budget surveys makes it possible to assess the diet of the population in Poland based on a representative sample of households, comprising nearly 38 thousand observations. The starting point for the research is a nutritional standard (taking into account {{the number of people in}} the family, their age and sex), which was the basis for each household consumption pattern. This pattern was developed for several distinguished groups of foodstuffs and for the <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> of food products. The model of conformity of households’ consumption patterns and em- pirical consumption was carried out in cross section of regions and class of locality. The obtained results may give rise to conducting a broader analysis of cross sections of various socio-economic characteristics of households...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{ascertain}} the different fatty acid (FA) descriptors linking dietary and muscle FA composition in one-year-old gilthead sea bream. For that purpose, our own published data along with additional data {{from the present study}} were compiled and analysed. High linear correlations (r 2 = 0. 90, P < 0. 001) between dietary and muscle fatty acid composition were reported for monoenes, C 18 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and long-chain PUFA. Prediction deviations due to changes in muscle fatness were analyzed in an independent trial with two different feeding levels (<b>full</b> <b>ration</b> size, 30 % restriction ration). Regardless of feeding regimen, predicted values for muscle FA at low concentrations deviated (P < 0. 001) from observed values, but good predictions with less than 6 % deviations were found for abundant fatty acids (16 : 1 n- 7, 18 : 1 n- 9, 18 : 2 n- 6, 18 : 3 n- 3, 20 : 4 n- 6, 20 : 5 n- 3, 22 : 6 n- 3).

40|$|A {{deterministic}} bio-economic {{model was}} developed to support breeding of indigenous chicken and used to evaluate biological and economic variables that characterise indigenous chicken (Gallus domesticus) production systems in Kenya. The systems were defined {{on the basis of}} the feeding regime, level of confinement and healthcare provided and included; confined <b>full</b> <b>ration</b> system, where the chicken are confined all the time and provided with commercial feed and proper healthcare; semi-intensive system, where the chicken are confined part of the time and given crop residues and kitchen waste, with no healthcare; and free range system, where the chicken are left to roam around the homestead picking whatever feed resource they get and without healthcare. The input parameters are divided into four categories: biological variables which include animal traits, managemental variables, nutritional variables and economic variables. These parameters assume typical indigenous chicken production in Kenya. However, the input parameters may be adjusted to suit specific situations and also assess the biological and economic performance of various production systems of other domestic avian species. The model`s ability to simulate live weight changes, feed intake of various chicken categories, revenues, cost and profitability of the three production systems is illustrated. The bio-economic models can be used to develop breeding goals and estimate economic values for the genetic improvement of indigenous chicken...|$|E
