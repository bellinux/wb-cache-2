5|$|When Ruffles Reedy, {{a trumpet}} player, falls dead from rat poisoning, {{a series of}} events ensue. Director Walt Jr. is hanged (the mysterious killer makes <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suicide), and his father, the General, has the Chicago Police Department (CPD) get {{involved}} to solve the murder mysteries as the nightly radio performance continues. Herman Katzenback is then killed after attempting to fix the main stage when the machinery malfunctions. Penny is appointed both stage manager and director due to Walt Jr. and Katzenback's deaths. Writer Roger Henderson tries to solve the killings, much to the annoyance of the police, led by Lieutenant Cross.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|When Ra.One {{undergoes}} final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but {{chooses to}} ignore them. When {{the game is}} officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> car accident.|$|E

He stops Zoe from leaving to study in New York City, resorting to stealing her passport and breaking her hand. He spies on her via web-cam, and drugs her, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suicide attempt. When Zoe discovers that Will has been spying on her, he ties her up on the college roof and confesses his love for her. Will eventually lets Zoe go and is arrested. A traumatised Zoe leaves {{to stay with her}} parents.|$|E
5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> murder-suicide.|$|E

25|$|Confronted {{with this}} evidence, Wanderer confessed. He {{told the police}} that he murdered his wife and the {{stranger}} to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> robbery. After he found out Ruth was pregnant, Wanderer hired a vagrant {{as part of a}} bizarre scheme. Wanderer told the man that his relationship with his wife was deteriorating, and he wanted to stage a fight to prove himself a hero to Ruth. When Watson showed up at the apartment, however, Wanderer shot both him and his wife with the two Colts and staged it so that Ruth's mother would think Watson had killed Ruth.|$|E
25|$|I Confess was {{followed}} by three popular colour films starring Grace Kelly. Dial M for Murder (1954) was adapted from the stage play by Frederick Knott. Ray Milland plays the scheming villain, an ex-tennis pro who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> premeditated murder by his wife. Her lover Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) and Police Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) work urgently to save her from execution. With Dial M, Hitchcock experimented with 3D cinematography, with the film now being available in the 3D format on Blu-ray.|$|E

The Crown put forward that Bain shot to death his mother, two sisters and brother in {{undetermined}} order before going on his morning paper run. On his return he waited for his father to come in from the caravan and go into the lounge to pray and then shot him from behind the computer alcove curtain, typed the message on the computer, arranged the scene to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suicide, and called 111. The defence submitted that Robin Bain killed the other family members, typed the message and shot himself while David was out on his paper round.|$|E
25|$|Sean escapes after {{staging a}} riot, and retreats to Castor's headquarters. There, Sean meets Sasha (Gina Gershon), {{the sister of}} Castor's primary drug kingpin, and her son Adam who reminds Sean of Michael. Sean learns that Adam is Castor's son, whom he once had planned to put under foster care. Castor learns of Sean's escape and hastily assembles a team to raid his headquarters. The raid quickly turns into a bloodbath, killing {{numerous}} FBI agents and several members of Castor's gang, including Pollux; Sean, Sasha, and Adam are able to escape. Sean's supervisor, Director Victor Lazarro (Harve Presnell) blames Castor for the numerous slayings. Castor, furious over Pollux's death, kills Victor and makes <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> heart attack. Castor-as-Sean is promoted to Acting Director as plans are made for Lazarro's funeral.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{mountain}} is extremely characteristic. Only from northwest does <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 'tind' a high pointy summit in Norwegian. From the east, from Galdhøpiggen, it shows its steep wall with Nåle balancing on the left flank, {{as seen in the}} table. This wall {{is one of the more}} inaccessible in Jotunheimen and is climbed rarely. The southwest face is less forbidding, and it is possible to find a way up through the partly snow-covered talus slopes. The mountain, as its neighbors, consists of the hard gabbro rock, which withstands erosion better than most other rocks. The orientation of the layers of gabbro in Skarstind is uncommon. Normally they rise from northwest towards southeast, which is why many summits are easiest to reach from the north side. At Skarstind the layers rise from southwest towards northeast. This is easily seen on the photo in the table.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Barnett (c. 1858–1927) was {{a former}} fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and {{separated}} after {{he lost his job}} and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution. Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him. Other acquaintances of Kelly's put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Brady {{completed}} 7 of 8 passes for 54yards on an 82-yard drive. On the last play, he took a snap in shotgun formation with Kevin Faulk to his right, Brady jumped {{in the air with}} his arms raised to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> play used by the Patriots before where Faulk took the direct snap. The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving Wes Welker open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21–14 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver Dennis Northcutt dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a Josh Scobee 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–17. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's Derek Landri was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28–17 lead.|$|E
25|$|Tina McIntyre {{embarked}} on an affair with Peter Barlow after they shared a passionate kiss during Peter and Carla Connor's wedding reception. Peter lies to Tina, telling {{her that he had}} leave Carla and move away with her to Portsmouth when he was actually committing to Carla after they discovered she was pregnant. The affair causes Peter to relapse and start drinking again. Carla's brother Rob Donovan discovers the affair and threatens them both that he will tell Carla if they do not. Tina books a taxi for her and Peter but cannot find Peter so she heads to the Rovers Return to find him and Carla celebrating Carla's pregnancy. Feeling crushed, Tina heads back to her flat and is pursued by Peter. They argue and Tina threatens Peter that she's going to reveal all about their affair to Carla, causing Peter to leave her flat and tell a heartbroken Carla about the affair before she does. Peter accidentally leaves Tina's flat door open whilst leaving and Rob notices and enters Tina's flat to confront her about her affair. Rob and Tina argue about her telling Carla about the affair, forcing them both onto her balcony outside. But when Tina threatens Rob about reporting his dodgy dealing at his pawn shop to the police, Rob pushes Tina from the balcony and she plummets to the ground. Rob frantically destroys Tina's flat in an attempt to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> burglary and wipes his fingerprints off of everything he has touched. He heads outside to see a motionless Tina lying on the cobbles, he starts to call for an ambulance when Tina manages to get back to her feet. Rob tries backtracking his actions and tells Tina that she slipped but Tina goads Rob by saying she will report him for attempted murder as well as him selling illegal goods. Rob takes desperate measures to shut Tina up so he grabs a lead pipe from a van outside the builder's yard and bludgeons Tina to death. After Peter's confession, a furious Carla heads on the war path and goes in search of Tina. She notices Tina's door to her flat is open and heads inside to have it out with her. She enters the ransacked flat but does not find Tina anywhere, she heads out onto the balcony and looks over to discover Tina's body on the floor below. Tina dies a week later from her injuries.|$|E
