40|$|Literature {{pertaining}} to the â€œliability of newnessâ€ contends that newer firms face particular difficulties and {{a greater risk of}} failure. This article seeks to determine if â€œnewnessâ€ is also a disadvantage in the acquisition of debt capital. Results indicate that newer firms were significantly less likely to have lines of credit and were also significantly {{more likely to have been}} turned down for their most recent loan. Even when we control for length of relationship with the primary financial services provider, personal <b>guarantees,</b> <b>and</b> <b>collateral,</b> younger firms were still more likely to be turned down for loans. Small firms are an essential part of the United States economy. According to the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA), there were 22. 9 million small firms, defined as firms having 500 or fewer employees, in the United States in 2002 (Small Business by the Numbers, 2002). In fact, small firms represent 99 percent of all firms in this country. They provide approximately half of Gross Domestic Product as well as the majority of new jobs. Small firms are also an important source of innovation in the development of new products, services, and technologies. Given the role played by small firms, it is in our interest to identify factors that contribute to their likely success. In keeping with that, studies of small firm survival and failure have repeatedly identified difficulties with financial management and an inability to secure adequate sources of capital as major contributors to dissolution (Gaskill et al., 1993), Lussier, 1996; Watson et al., 1998). Many small firms are launched with inadequate financial resources. To compound this problem, small firms, unlike larger, publicly-held firms, are unable to raise capital in the public debt and equity markets (Ang, 1991). Alternatively, they are restricted to sources of capital that include the ownerâ€™s savings, loans from family and friends, trade credit, and loans from banks and other financial service providers (Berger 2 ̆ 6 Udell, 1998; Bitler et al., 2001). Even in the case of bank loans, however, small firms are more likely to be denied than larger, more established firms. As noted above, the inability to secure external sources of capital raises the risk of firm failure. On a slightly less dire note, inadequate capital may also restrict the firmâ€™s ability to grow, to hire employees, or to introduce new products and services thus impairing profitability and growth in the long term...|$|E
40|$|The rise of {{non-bank}} {{trade finance}} {{has been especially}} noticeable in the last decade. Many commodity and e-commerce companies are rapidly entering this arena as sovereign <b>guarantees</b> <b>and</b> <b>collaterals</b> take a backseat {{making it harder for}} banks to apply traditional models while lending to businesses. Non-banks which are more nimble occupy space vacated by banks. Increasingly, though, banks have begun to collaborate with non-banks, particularly fintech companies for rapid processing of transactions. Besides, trade finance field is itself developing its own specialised areas such as commodity finance, power generation and financial services. Growth in each field depends on the extent of specialised knowledge, developments in capital markets, innovations by technological service providers permitting new collaborations and a dynamic regulatory framework including self-regulation for assessing and disclosing emerging risks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{burst of}} the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis affected {{on a large scale}} the Italian real estate industry. The Italian real estate market underwent and is still undergoing a severe stagnancy due to the credit crunch worsened by the banking system and the resulting lack of liquidity. In financing real estate property investments, security packages play an extremely important role <b>and</b> <b>guarantees</b> have become a major tool for risk management and financial innovation in order to facilitate credit enhancement and hedging of risks. In this context the evaluation of <b>guarantees</b> <b>and</b> <b>collaterals</b> becomes extremely important. A robust measure of the value of collaterals is more than a key issue in times of financial crisis, when the value of the guarantees is questioned.

50|$|Through {{feedback}} from nonprofit customers, Davis {{became aware that}} many nonprofits struggled to obtain credit from traditional lenders. Many lenders required personal <b>guarantees</b> or <b>collateral,</b> <b>and</b> many did not offer nonprofits small working capital loans. In order to better understand nonprofits' credit needs and the feasibility of offering small working capital loans, Davis created the NIAC Member Loan Fund, a pilot program that makes 1-year working capital loans of up to $50,000 to NIAC insurance customers. These loans have no personal <b>guarantee</b> or <b>collateral</b> requirements <b>and</b> take {{less than a month}} for review and approval. NIAC is using data from the loan fund to develop risk models specific to nonprofit borrowers. These models allow NIAC and other lenders to underwrite these loans more easily and offer them at a larger scale.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{access to}} {{external}} funding sources is hindered by the lower availability of explicit <b>guarantees</b> (<b>collateral)</b> <b>and</b> implicit <b>guarantees</b> (cash flow {{expected from the}} project) for small innovative firms compared to traditional firms. Regarding the explicit guarantees, small innovative firms are characterized by {{a high incidence of}} intangible and firm-specific assets, which increase the risk for the potential financier (Hall 2002; Gompers 1995). The immateriality of capital does not allow the firm to provide innovative inside collateral which is able to reduce the cost of failure, while specificity in the use of intangible assets makes the decision to invest irreversibly. Regarding implied warranties, at least in the early stages, small innovative firms are not able to generate positive cash flows required for debt service (pledgeable income). This prevents lenders from possibly having guarantees in the short term about the return of debt using operating cash flow.|$|R

Totally four relational networks, i. e., the networks for medicinal attributes and functions, for chemical composition <b>and</b> meridians <b>and</b> <b>collaterals,</b> for meridians <b>and</b> <b>collaterals</b> <b>and</b> medicinal functions, and for meridians <b>and</b> <b>collaterals</b> were constructed based on the significant point correlations. Network analysis indicated that the former three ones are scale-free complex networks {{and the last one}} tends to be a random network. Node degrees of the four networks follow power-law distribution. Detailed between-attribute relationships and medicinal mechanisms were revealed. For example, concerning chemical composition categories, alkaloids and amines have positive correlation / correspondence. More alkaloids correspond to more amines. Alkaloids negatively correlate with volatile oils / ordinary oils, carbohydrates / starch, ketones / flavonoids, and olefins. Alkaloids mainly function in decrease internal heat, dry dampness, etc. Organic acids and alkaloids have negative correlation. More organic acids mean the less alkaloids.

40|$|In the United States, small {{businesses}} represent 99. 7 % of firms that provide employment and account for over 50 % of all private sector employment. Nevertheless, the rationing {{of small business}} borrowing is an indicative of acute credit constraints emanating from poverty, lack of collateral, lack of cosigners for bank loans, high administrative fees associated with processing credit loans, and information asymmetry along with other socioeconomic factors. In a 4 -year study from 2004 â?? 2008, {{it was determined that}} {{small businesses}} suffer tremendously from credit rationing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the induced effect of loan <b>guarantee</b> scheme, <b>collateral,</b> <b>and</b> leverage on credit rationing. The seminal work of Stiglitz and Weiss served as a framework for the study. The research questions were developed to inquire the relationship (influence) of loan guarantee scheme on credit rationing while controlling for <b>collateral</b> <b>and</b> leverage. Data on small businesses were collected from the Small Business Administration and the National Survey of Small Business Finances websites. Collected data (n = 1, 072) of small business firms in Florida for 2015 were analyzed through applying multiple regression methodology. The study results indicated that small business participation in loan guarantee scheme had a significant influence on credit rationing when the confounding effects of <b>collateral</b> <b>and</b> leverage were statistically controlled. The findings of this research could lead to positive social change by providing small businesses with loan guarantee scheme, a government subsidy that eliminates the need for credit rationing...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{models of}} {{bankruptcy}} <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> rely on incomplete asset markets. In fact, bankruptcy <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> add contingencies to asset markets.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} the combined assessment of reflow <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> blood flow by myocardial contrast echocardiography after myocardial infarction.  DESIGN—Myocardial contrast echocardiography {{was performed in}} patients with acute myocardial infarction shortly after successful coronary reperfusion (TIMI 3  patency) by direct angioplasty. Collateral flow was assessed before coronary angioplasty, and contrast reflow was evaluated 15  minutes after reperfusion. The presence of contractile reserve was assessed by low dose dobutamine echocardiography (5  to 15  µg/kg/min) at (mean (SD)) 3  (2) days after myocardial infarction. Recovery of segmental function (myocardial viability) was evaluated by resting echocardiography at a two month follow up. The study was prospective.  PATIENTS— 35 consecutive patients referred for acute transmural myocardial infarction.  RESULTS—Contrast reflow was observed in 20  patients (57 %) <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> flow in 14  (40 %). Contrast reflow <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> contrast flow were both correlated with reversible dysfunction on initial dobutamine echocardiography and at follow up (p <  0. 05). The presence of reflow or collateral flow on myocardial contrast echocardiography was a highly sensitive (100 %) but weakly specific (60 %) indicator of segmental dysfunction recovery. Simultaneous presence of contrast reflow <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> flow was more specific of reversible dysfunction than reflow alone (90 % v 60 %).  CONCLUSIONS—Combined assessment of reflow <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> blood flow enhanced the sensitivity of myocardial contrast echocardiography in predicting myocardial viability after acute, reperfused myocardial infarction. The simultaneous presence of reflow <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> blood flow was highly specific of recovery of segmental dysfunction.    Keywords: contrast echocardiography; coronary reflow; collateral blood flow; dobutamine echocardiography; myocardial dysfunctio...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we derive an {{explicit}} {{solution for the}} expected loss of a collateralized loan, focusing on the negative correlation between default intensity <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> value. Three requirements for the default intensity <b>and</b> the <b>collateral</b> value are imposed. First, the default event can happen at any time until loan maturity according to an exogenous stochastic process of default intensity. Second, default intensity <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> value are negatively correlated. Third, the default intensity <b>and</b> <b>collateral</b> value are non-negative. To develop {{an explicit}} solution, we propose a square-root process for default intensity and an affine diffusion process for collateral value. Given these settings, we derive an explicit solution for the integrand of the expected recovery value within an extended affine model. From the derived solution, we find the expected recovery value is given by a Stieltjes integral with a measure-changed survival probability. stochastic recovery, default intensity model, affine diffusion, extended affine, survival probability, measure change...|$|R
