40|$|AbstractAtomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{was used}} for studying gene transfection mediated by cationic liposomes which contain a cationic cholesterol derivative with a different spacer arm. Cationic liposomes were made by a mixture of one of eight cationic cholesterol derivatives and 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidyl ethanolamine (<b>DOPE).</b> AFM <b>images</b> showed that vesicles made of the liposome/DNA complex had various diameters depending on each cationic cholesterol derivative with a different spacer arm. The {{results showed that the}} diameter of the liposome/DNA complex was well related to the transfection activity of plasmid pSV 2 CAT DNA to a cultured cell line (NIH 3 T 3). From the results {{it was found that the}} vesicles with moderate diameters (from 0. 4 to 1. 4 μm) were moste effective for gene transfection of plasmid pSV 2 CAT DNA into the target cell. Neither smaller vesicles (1. 4 μm) were adequate for gene transfection. As the gene transfection by the cationic liposomes was mostly inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of endocytosis, it is suggested that the vesicles with moderate diameters were useful for gene transfection by endocytosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pure and Aluminium-doped ZnO (Zn 1 -xAlxO) x = 0 to 5 wt % {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} onto glass substrate by sol-gel spin coating method. The influence of various aluminium concentration in ZnO thin films on the structural, surface, optical and photoconducting properties were investigated. The GIXRD studies confirmed the polycrystalline nature with wurtzite structure of pure and Al doped ZnO films. Films with 1. 5 % concentration of aluminium showed maximum absorption and transmission in the UV and visible regions respectively. The FESEM images showed crack free films with increasing grain boundaries upon doping. The {{average grain size}} is found to decrease due to aluminium <b>doping.</b> AFM <b>images</b> showed <b>doped</b> films with 1. 5 % have better smoothness than other films. The photoconductivity measurements reveal that there is increase in the photocurrent compared to dark current for the Al doped ZnO. The photocurrent reaches its maximum value for ZnO: Al- 1. 5 % and then decreases upon increase in Al concentration. The photoresponse has slightly degraded upon aluminium doping onto ZnO. Temperature dependent conductivity shows that the thermal activation energy for the film decreases up to 1. 5 % aluminium concentration and then increases for other concentrations in the temperature range 308 to 375 K...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} {{years there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} for zinc oxide semiconductor, mainly triggered by its prospects in optoelectronic applications. In particular, zinc oxide thin films are being widely used for photovoltaic applications, in which the determination of the electrical conductivity is of great importance. Being an intrinsically doped material, the quantification of its doping concentration has always been challenging. Here we show how to probe the charge carrier density of zinc oxide thin films by Scanning Kelvin ProbeMicroscopy, a technique that allowsmeasuring the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample surface with high spatial resolution. A simple electronic energymodel is used for correlating the contact potential difference with the doping concentration in thematerial. Limitations of this technique are discussed in details and some experimental solutions are proposed. Two-dimensional <b>doping</b> concentration <b>images</b> acquired on radio frequency-sputtered intrinsic zinc oxide thin films with different thickness and deposited under different conditions are reported. We show that results inferred with this technique are in accordance with carrier concentration expected for zinc oxide thin films deposited under different conditions and obtained from resistivity and mobility measurements. I n the last century, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) attracted interest within the scientific community. Defined as the futur...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen-doped {{epitaxial}} graphene {{grown on}} SiC(000 ? 1) was prepared by exposing {{the surface to}} an atomic nitrogen flux. Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Spectroscopy (STS), supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the simple substitution of carbon by nitrogen atoms {{has been identified as}} the most common <b>doping</b> configuration. High-resolution <b>images</b> reveal a reduction of local charge density on top of the nitrogen atoms, indicating a charge transfer to the neighboring carbon atoms. For the first time, local STS spectra clearly evidenced the energy levels associated with the chemical doping by nitrogen, localized in the conduction band. Various other nitrogen-related defects have been observed. The bias dependence of their topographic signatures demonstrates the presence of structural configurations more complex than substitution as well as hole-doping.

We have systematically examined the photoluminescence properties for a fixed composition of alloy with varying amount of Ag doping concentration. Doping concentration significantly improved the emission intensity corresponding to the dopant ion up to an optimum concentration. X-ray diffraction and UV–Vis absorption spectra show the increase in particle size with increasing <b>doping</b> concentration. HRTEM <b>image</b> reveals the crystalline nature of the particle having cubic structure with average grain size less than 5 nm. Absorption and Raman investigation confirms the formation of alloy nanocrystals. For the fixed Ag ion doping concentration, the PL spectra of the samples show the emission tunability in full visible range with the change in composition of the alloys {{and can be used}} for the white light generation.|$|R

The results arising from interferance of scattered light {{on the surface and}} incoming polarized pulsed laser beams were demonstrated with poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyimides, polysulfones, polystyene and <b>doped</b> polyimides films. <b>Images</b> of polymer periodic structures were transferred to silicon surfaces by series of reactive ion etchings. Si patterns with 100 nm line and spacing with vertical wall profile were fabricated in a large area. On such Si surfaces diamond crystals were deposited from polymer plumes generated by ArF excimer laser irradiated in 193 nm on poly(methyl methacrylate).

40|$|Electrically {{conducting}} polymers {{have been}} most widely accomplished using chemical and electrochemical processing techniques. The present article aims at reporting the synthesis of polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticles dispersed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films using radiation technique. The PANI nanoparticles were obtained by irradiating solvent casting PVA/aniline hydrochloride (AniHCl) blend films with gamma rays under ambient conditions. The formation of PANI nanoparticles has been seen by the color change from white to dark green following radiation <b>doping.</b> The SEM <b>images</b> exhibit spherical aggregates of PAni nanoparticles about 50 - 100 nm in diameter randomly distributed in the films. The UV-Visible spectrophotometer measurement revealed that the absorption band at 790 nm increases with dose owing {{to the formation of}} PANI with green color that increases with increasing dose. The conductivity measurement shows that the initially electrically insulating PVA/AniHCl blend has been remarkably transformed into the electrically conducting PVA/PANI nanocomposites where the conductivity increases by 5 orders of magnitude after exposure to 50 kGy...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} dopant, Os(VIII) {{on the growth}} process, {{crystalline}} perfection and properties of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) single crystals grown by a slow evaporation solution growth technique has been investigated. The XRD analysis of black-colored doped specimen reveals slight structural changes {{as a result of}} <b>doping.</b> The SEM <b>images</b> exhibit defect centers and crystal voids. The complex formation of KHP with Os(VIII) is evidenced by the considerable shift in kmax of the doped specimen and enhanced fluorescence intensity is observed by doping. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and TG-DTA studies reveal the purity of the sample and no decomposition is observed up to the melting point. The high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) studies used to evaluate the crystalline perfection reveal some features on the capability of accommodating the dopant in the crystalline matrix. The diffraction curve (DC) patterns indicate that the high valence transition metal predominantly occupies the interstitial positions and the doping depresses the second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency owing to the deterioration of crystalline perfection disturbing the charge transfer and nonlinearity...|$|R
40|$|There {{a number}} of factors effecting consumers' {{purchase}} behavior. It is believed that celebrities can effect selling positively by transferring their popular image to the endorsed product. But, it is heard lots about excommunicate behaviors in the sport world today. Disclosure of the recent doping affairs relating to Lance Armstrong's seven wins in Tour De France is just one among many spectacular and also negative cases. The main aim of the present paper was to explore the effect of doping phenomenon on sport marketing. Depth interviews data were analyzed in three phases: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. 297 open codes were achieved by 18 interviews. Grouping axial codes in each case and comparing, all gained codes can be divided in five groups: brand image (athlete and endorsed product brands images), moral reasoning (moral coupling, moral decoupling, and moral rationalization), consumer behavioral consequences (word of mouth, purchasing intention, and brand loyalty), attitude change (attitudes change toward athlete and brand), and moral emotions (moral evaluation, contempt, anger, disgust, and sympathy).   The proposed qualitative model for the effect of doping phenomenon on sport marketing in Iran illustrated that moral emotions and product brand image affected by the <b>doped</b> athlete brand <b>image</b> and it resulted in attitudes change toward endorser athlete and endorsed brand and negative consumer behavioral consequences, however, moral reasoning strategies emerged by cognitive dissonance might protect consumers behavior from negative effects. </span...|$|R
