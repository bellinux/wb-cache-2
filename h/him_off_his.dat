5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Loxton top-scored with 39 as Australia batted first and were bowled out for 204 after the first day was washed out. He then took 0/18 from eight overs and made 52 in the second innings before being run out while batting with Harvey as the match ended in a draw. In the second innings, Loxton attempted to attack the bowling of Malcolm Hilton—who had troubled Bradman in the first innings—in an attempt to throw <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> game. However, Hilton had the last laugh and removed Bradman for the second time.|$|E
5|$|The {{long march}} from Seminary Ridge had left {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.|$|E
5|$|With Marengo {{damaged and}} Rainier {{actively}} hunting for his squadron, Linois {{withdrew from the}} Bay of Bengal and returned to Isle de France. Rainier knew that his chances of discovering Linois in the open Indian Ocean were insignificant, and instead decided to keep watch for <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> principal base at Port Napoleon. A squadron was detached to the port, but Linois's scouts discovered the blockade before he arrived {{and he was able}} to safely reach Grand Port instead on 31 October. Entering over the reefs that protected the anchorage, Marengos deeper keel scraped on the coral. The ship's hull was badly damaged and her rudder torn off, requiring extensive repairs. Linois was later joined by Captain Bruilhac in Belle Poule, who had captured a valuable merchant ship on his individual cruise in the Bay of Bengal.|$|E

While waiting, he {{surprised}} a passing British lieutenant, pulled <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> horse and {{had the opportunity to}} capture or kill him. He refrained from doing so in order to avoid drawing suspicion on Anna by leaving the impression that Brewster and his men were thieves.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, several {{individuals}} claimed {{personal responsibility}} for the killing, including White Bull of the Miniconjous, Rain-in-the-Face, Flat Lip, and Brave Bear. In June 2005, at a public meeting, Northern Cheyenne storytellers said that according to their oral tradition, Buffalo Calf Road Woman, a Northern Cheyenne heroine of the Battle of the Rosebud, struck the final blow against Custer, which knocked <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> horse before he died.|$|E

25|$|Gallagher married Patsy Kensit on 7 April 1997. However, the {{marriage}} {{got off to}} a rocky start due to various incidents reported in the tabloids. Gallagher made headlines after an incident of road rage. He allegedly leaned out of his car window, grabbed a cyclist and threw <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> bike. The cyclist was not injured and Gallagher was given a caution. On 26 March 1998, Lisa Moorish bore Gallagher a daughter, Molly, who was conceived during an affair in Los Angeles in June 1997, {{just a couple of months}} after he and Kensit got married. Gallagher and Kensit's son Lennon was born on 13 September 1999. The couple divorced a year later. Gallagher's second son, Gene Gallagher, was born to Nicole Appleton on 2 July 2001.|$|E
25|$|That Dragon, Cancer {{bore out}} from {{experiences}} that Ryan and Amy Green had after their third child Joel {{was diagnosed with}} an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor at twelve months of age, around November 2010. The doctors had only given the child about four months to live, but despite developing seven additional tumors, Joel continued to live for four more years. Joel's condition left him mentally underdeveloped, being unable to speak even by age 2, and he required additional parental care and supervision, alongside numerous visits to doctors and hospitals for palliative care and chemotherapy treatment. In early 2014, Joel's condition worsened, and the Greens temporarily moved from Colorado to San Francisco {{to take part in}} an experimental drug trial. The new drug failed to relieve any of the new symptoms. Ryan and Amy, following the advice of the hospice, decided to take <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> feeding tube, and he died on March 13, 2014 at the age of five.|$|E
25|$|Hakim and Bet-Zuri {{ran out of}} the yard, {{jumped on}} their rented bicycles, and began {{pedaling}} down the street away from the scene. Major Hughes-Onslow rushed to the sentry box and raised the alarm. Hearing it, Hakim and Bet-Zuri turned onto a side street. They had very nearly gotten away when an Egyptian motorcycle policeman, El-Amin Mahomed Abdullah, caught up to them. Hakim and Bet-Zuri were determined not to injure any Egyptians in their operation, and so did not attempt to shoot <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> motorcycle. Rather, Bet-Zuri fired a volley of warning shots in his direction, which he ignored. Abdullah then dismounted and ordered him to drop his weapon. Bet-Zuri attempted to shoot out the motorcycle's tires, but found that his pistol had run out of ammunition, and as he attempted to reload it, Abdullah fired, hitting Bet-Zuri in the chest. Hearing the commotion, Hakim turned back to help Bet-Zuri, and within minutes, another policeman appeared, and the two were placed under arrest.|$|E

25|$|To {{defend a}} territory, the male {{exhibits}} perching behaviour {{starting in the}} mid- to late afternoon until dusk. Some individuals are able to reclaim the same territory several afternoons in a row. The longest period of time recorded in which one male defended the same territory was three days. The males choose sunny spots on hilltops, through which females are likely to travel. If no hilltops are available, the males wait in channels in the vegetation that would funnel wandering females towards them. The perching male sits and waits, scanning the sky for any moving object. Periodically, he executes a patrol flight {{to get a better}} picture of the surrounding area. When the male spots a moving flying object, he flies directly towards it. If it is a male, the resident male chases <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> territory. If it is a female, the male chases the female, more slowly and less aggressively than with an intruding male, away from the perch site. The pair lands and copulates, which can last more than an hour.|$|E
25|$|On Friday morning, February 23, 1945, {{four days}} after the Marines landed at Iwo Jima, Rosenthal was making his daily visit to the island on a Marine landing craft when he heard that an American flag was being raised atop Mount Suribachi, a volcano at the {{southern}} tip of the island. Upon landing, Rosenthal hurried toward Suribachi, lugging along his bulky Speed Graphic camera, the standard for press photographers at the time. Together with Marine combat still photographer Pvt. Bob Campbell and Marine color movie photographer Sgt. Bill Genaust, he began the climb up to the summit of Mount Suribachi. When they got about halfway up, they met Staff Sgt. Louis Lowery, a photographer with the Marine publication “Leatherneck” who was coming down the volcano after an enemy grenade explosion on top had knocked <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> feet and broke his camera. Lowery told them that the flag had already been raised at 10:40 am, and he had gotten photos of the flag on the summit. Lowery told them the view was good from the summit, and Rosenthal convinced Genaust and Campbell to continue {{to take him to the}} top with them since they were armed.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} return to racing in the UK at the Revolution22 event in Manchester in December. He {{received}} a standing ovation from the Manchester faithful {{at the start of}} the event when he was introduced to the crowd. At this event Hoy won both the Sprint and Keirin competitions, defeating likes of Jason Kenny, Jamie Staff, Ross Edgar, Matthew Crampton and Teun Mulder along the way. Hoy competed in the World Cup Classics series' final event in Copenhagen, Denmark in February, helping his team to a gold medal in the team sprint event. However, he crashed out during the men's Keirin final and was forced to miss the final day of competition, including the men's sprint. Although at first, his injury seemed minor, he returned to Manchester where, following a scan, he was diagnosed with a serious de-gloving injury which finished his season and kept <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> bike for almost 3 months. He was unable to compete as planned at the Revolution 24 event in Manchester the following weekend, he did however make an appearance at the event. He has had to pull out of the World Championships in Poland at the end of March, where he would have attempted to defend 2 World titles, because of the hip injury.|$|E

Later, Goblin confronts Tombstone and steals a jump drive he is carrying, declaring that he can take it back from him later that night before he sails off on his glider.

500|$|A Bolshevik Centre {{was set up}} in Kuokkala, Grand Duchy of Finland, {{which was}} then a {{semi-autonomous}} part of the Empire, before the 5th RSDLP Congress was held in London in May 1907, where the Bolsheviks regained dominance within the party. However, as the Tsarist government disbanded the Second Duma and the Okhrana cracked down on revolutionaries, Lenin decided to flee Finland for Sweden, undertaking much of the journey by foot. From there, he made it to Switzerland. Alexander Bogdanov and other prominent Bolsheviks decided to relocate the Bolshevik Centre to Paris, France; although Lenin disagreed, he moved to the city in December 1908. Lenin disliked Paris, lambasting it as [...] "a foul hole", and sued a motorist who knocked <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> bike while there.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Bogdanov {{and other}} {{prominent}} Bolsheviks decided to relocate the Bolshevik Centre to Paris; although Lenin disagreed, {{he moved to}} the city in December 1908. Lenin disliked Paris, lambasting it as [...] "a foul hole", and while there he sued a motorist who knocked <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> bike. Lenin became very critical of Bogdanov's view that Russia's proletariat had to develop a socialist culture in order to become a successful revolutionary vehicle. Instead, Lenin favoured a vanguard of socialist intelligentsia who would lead the working-classes in revolution. Furthermore, Bogdanov– influenced by Ernest Mach– believed that all concepts of the world were relative, whereas Lenin stuck to the orthodox Marxist view that there was an objective reality independent of human observation. Bogdanov and Lenin holidayed together at Maxim Gorky's villa in Capri in April 1908; on returning to Paris, Lenin encouraged a split within the Bolshevik faction between his and Bogdanov's followers, accusing the latter of deviating from Marxism.|$|E

500|$|Francis Mackey, an {{experienced}} harbour pilot, had boarded Mont-Blanc {{on the evening}} of 5 December 1917; he had asked about [...] "special protections" [...] such as a guard ship, given the Mont-Blanc's cargo, but no protections were put in place. Mont-Blanc started moving at 7:30am on 6 December, heading towards Bedford Basin. Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted Imo when she was about [...] away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship's starboard side, as if to cut <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> own course. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship's signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way, but was met with two short blasts from Imo, indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position. The captain ordered Mont-Blanc to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard, but was again met with a double-blast in negation.|$|E
500|$|The most {{influential}} {{of the contemporary}} reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year. Boullemer claimed {{to be among the}} few surviving eyewitnesses: [...] "there arrived from all exits of the city, five to six thousand peasants, women and children, armed [...] guns, scythes, knives, shovels and pikes. [...] They shouted, running the streets: peace! [...] peace!" [...] Boullemer's account continues: they descended on Machecoul, confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy. One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them. Louis-Charles-César Maupassant, a farmer, merchant and a deputy to the Convention, tried to harangue the attackers into quiescence, but could not be heard above the din. [...] Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered [...] before the threatening crowd. [...] According to Louis Mortimer-Ternaux, another eye-witness, only three officers and five or six gendarmes remained at their posts. [...] At that time, according to him, some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants, pursued, and finally brought down by the crowd {{at the feet of the}} deputy, Maupassant. [...] The crowd then pulled <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel.|$|E
500|$|In {{what was}} billed as the [...] "biggest main event in sports entertainment," [...] the match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan {{defending}} the title against André the Giant (with Bobby Heenan). Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest time keeper, Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart. The fans booed André heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately two minutes into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam André, but {{he was unable to}} lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, André gave Hogan an Irish whip {{to the far side of}} the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give André a clothesline to take <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> feet for the first time in the match.
