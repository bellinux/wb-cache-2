5|$|Symantec {{announced}} a Professional Edition on November 19, 2002. <b>Data</b> <b>recovery</b> tools in this version allow users to recover deleted or malware-damaged files. The {{inclusion of a}} data erasure tool allows users to delete files while minimizing the chance of recovery. Web Cleanup removes browser cache files, history, and cookies. To maintain dial-up connections, Connection Keep Alive simulates online activity during periods of user inactivity. Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups. When used with the User Access Manager, multiple filtering profiles can be created, assigned to different users.|$|E
25|$|In Windows 2000, {{the local}} {{administrator}} is the default <b>Data</b> <b>Recovery</b> Agent, capable of decrypting all files encrypted with EFS by any local user.|$|E
25|$|Anyone who {{can gain}} Administrators access can overwrite, {{override}} {{or change the}} <b>Data</b> <b>Recovery</b> Agent configuration. This {{is a very serious}} issue, since an attacker can for example hack the Administrator account (using third-party tools), set whatever DRA certificate they want as the <b>Data</b> <b>Recovery</b> Agent and wait. This is sometimes referred to as a two-stage attack, which is a significantly different scenario than the risk due to a lost or stolen PC, but which highlights the risk due to malicious insiders.|$|E

25|$|Current {{versions}} of Btrieve support system transactions and user transactions, where system transactions are {{a bundle of}} non-transactional operations and/or user transactions, whereas user transactions are transactions that work on actual data in the database. System transactions were developed to allow multiple transactions {{to be done in}} a batch and to make <b>data</b> <b>recovery</b> easier.|$|E

5000|$|An {{application}} used {{to create}} recovery discs or flash drive is sometimes offered {{in order to allow}} a backup of the <b>recovery</b> <b>data.</b> [...] <b>Recovery</b> CDs can also sometimes be ordered directly from the OEM. For some computers, they can also recreate the recovery partition. Other recovery systems, such as those included with recent Apple Macintosh models, permit users to download the recovery partition over an internet connection, enabling successful recovery even if the hard disk fails or is replaced.|$|R
25|$|In Windows XP and later, {{there is}} no default local <b>Data</b> <b>Recovery</b> Agent and no {{requirement}} to have one. Setting SYSKEY to mode 2 or 3 (syskey typed in during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate the risk of unauthorized decryption through the local Administrator account. This is because the local user's password hashes, stored in the SAM file, are encrypted with the Syskey, and the Syskey value is not available to an offline attacker who does not possess the Syskey passphrase/floppy.|$|E
25|$|A {{preliminary}} hearing began on March 11, 2013. The evidence presented {{is subject to}} a publication ban. Magnotta's defence team requested {{the media and the}} public be barred entirely from the hearing; this was declined the next day. Lin Jun's father, Lin Diran, travelled from China to attend the hearing. On March 13, one of Magnotta's lawyers resigned, due to a possible conflict of interest. Expert witnesses testified, including a forensic pathologist, a forensic toxicologist, a forensic odontologist, a bloodstain analyst, <b>data</b> <b>recovery</b> specialists and an Internet investigations officer. The prosecution also displayed video evidence. Both Magnotta and Lin physically collapsed at separate times during the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|When {{the logic}} board {{of a hard}} disk fails, the drive can often be {{restored}} to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required. For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including fsck on UNIX-like systems and CHKDSK on Windows, {{can be used for}} <b>data</b> <b>recovery.</b> Recovery from logical damage can require file carving.|$|E

The creep data are fitted to Eq.  2, while <b>recovery</b> <b>data</b> are fitted to Eq.  3. All the coefficients {{can be obtained}} by “Nonlinear curve fit” of Origin 8.5. The results are shown in Table  4.|$|R
5000|$|In serial {{communication}} of digital <b>data,</b> clock <b>recovery</b> {{is the process}} of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode the transmitted symbols. Clock <b>recovery</b> from the <b>data</b> stream is expedited by modifying the transmitted data. Where ever a {{serial communication}} channel does not transmit the clock signal along with the data stream, the clock must be regenerated at the receiver, using the timing information from the <b>data</b> stream. Clock <b>recovery</b> is a common component of systems communicating over wires, optical fibers, or by radio.|$|R
500|$|Prior to {{agreeing to}} create XIVs score, Uematsu had already planned to compose [...] "Kimi ga Iru Kara", {{the theme song}} for Final Fantasy XIII. Wanting him to fully focus on XIV, Square Enix asked XIIIs main {{composer}} Masashi Hamauzu to write the song instead. Thus, XIII was the first main-series Final Fantasy game soundtrack to not include Uematsu's work. Despite XIV being an MMO and thus a new genre for him, Uematsu treated it as any other video game project. Compared to his previous work within the series, Uematsu had considerable creative freedom while composing the soundtrack, because {{the rest of the}} production team did not fully envision beforehand how the soundtrack would sound or fit into the game. Uematsu created a mixture of orchestral and rock pieces for the game's battle themes. There was a momentary crisis when he lost most of the data for his completed tracks and needed to hire a <b>data</b> <b>recovery</b> service. He worked as a freelance composer during the project for Square Enix, also composing the music for The Last Story, a game from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The game's theme song, [...] "Answers", was sung by Susan Calloway. She was chosen by Uematsu, who had worked with her during the first Distant Worlds concert and was impressed by her singing abilities.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{distributed}} systems are very attractive for {{the execution of}} parallel applications requiring a huge computing power. However, their high probability of site failure is unacceptable, especially for long time running applications. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a checkpointing mechanism relying on a recoverable distributed shared memory (DSM) in order to tolerate single node failures. Although most recoverable DSMs require specific hardware to store <b>recovery</b> <b>data,</b> our scheme uses standard memories to store both current and <b>recovery</b> <b>data.</b> Moreover, the management of <b>recovery</b> <b>data</b> is merged with the management of current data by extending the DSM's coherence protocol. This approach {{takes advantage of the}} data replication provided by a DSM in order to limit the amount of transferred pages during the checkpointing. The paper also presents an implementation and a preliminary performance evaluation of our recoverable DSM on a 56 nodes Intel Paragon. 1 Introducti [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Brownie tag-recapture model {{analyses}} multi-year tag <b>recovery</b> <b>data</b> {{to derive}} estimates {{of natural and}} fishing mortality {{that can be used}} to estimate population abundance. However, it makes several assumptions about the behaviour of tagged fish, tagging-induced mortality, tag retention, emigration, tag reporting, and timing of the fishery. I evaluate performance of the Brownie model when individual assumptions are violated, using Monte Carlo simulations over a suite of scenarios with known “true” parameter values chosen to mimic British Columbia sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). Bias and precision are quantified by comparing parameter estimates with their known “true” values and by the spread in estimates from 500 Monte Carlo trials, respectively. Assumptions about uniform mixing, timing of the fishery, and emigration had the greatest effects on bias of estimates of fishing mortality and abundance. Combining fishery-independent survey CPUE <b>data</b> with tag <b>recovery</b> <b>data</b> did not substantially improve bias or precision of parameter estimates...|$|R

However, when multi-state joint recapture and <b>recovery</b> <b>data</b> are modelled, {{it is likely that}} dependence on age and time will both be potentially of interest and therefore the most useful model formulation will incorporate both of these parameter structures. Within this article the likelihood function required for such a model is derived in terms of a set of sufficient statistics...|$|R
