40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{management and}} costs of dialysis in the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Information on ef®cacy and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) based on the existing literature also is presented. The clinical differences between the dialysis modalities seem {{to be related to}} their appropriateness to speci®c patient groups. Ef®cacy rates are similar and the only differences are in complications and HRQOL. Traditional haemodialysis (THD) can be done by Italian patients in <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> or in hospital. High-¯ux haemodialysis (HFHD) is generally only done in hospital. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is usually done at home. The cost analysis was performed on a sample of Italian <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> and hospitals, according to the full cost method. As expected, HFHD was more expensive than THD and PD, but no marked differences emerged among the different HFHD modalities. THD modalities in <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> were less costly than in hospitals. Automated PD (APD) was much more expensive (almost twice) than continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD), the cheapest method in absolute terms. This study con®rms that dialysis is costly and that it is very dif®cult to assess the cost-effectiveness of the different approaches. Although this study has limits, it should provide suf®cient analytical information to local healthcare managers for more rational allocation of ®nancial resources to dialysis services...|$|R

40|$|This {{observational}} study describes {{the characteristics of}} the education programmes used in Italian PD-centres, evaluating a possible relationship between programmes and peritonitis rates. The survey involved 150 non-paediatric public <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> in Italy. The data were collected by a questionnaire and evaluated with SPSS software. Descriptive statistics of synthesis were calculated, Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon's test were used to verify the differences in the replies, and association between variables was tested with Pearson correlation and Pearson's chi 2 test. 120 <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> took part in the survey and reported a median incidence of peritonitis of 1 / 29 months. Training occurs in all the centres, while pre-dialysis education, home visits and re-training take place in 38. 3 %, 50 % and 44. 2 % respectively. A lower peritonitis rates proves to be correlated to these activities rather than to presence of specialised personnel, to ratio nurses-patients or training time...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{was to examine}} the {{lifestyle}} and life quality of chronically dialysed patients. I described this wide topic {{from the point of view}} of patients, with whom I conducted interviews according to prepared questions, i. e. qualitative research. For healthcare staff providing immediate professional care in <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> I used quantitative research by means of questionnaires. I processed 71 questionnaires and spoke to 12 patients in total. I found the sources in seven healthcare facilities in South and central Bohemian regions. The aim of the thesis was met. The decisive and related aspects linked to the lifestyle and life quality of chronically dialysed patients were described. During preparation of the thesis I met new aspects like the extraordinary demandingness of the work of the healthcare staff, the important influence of science on medical procedures and psychical demandingness and patience of treated patients. The research questions were answered and in the instance of ambiguousness they were deduced and statistically substantiated. Two hypotheses, namely H 1 : Nurses in <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> educate dialysed patients about the limitations linked to lifestyle quality and H 2 : Nurses in <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> adhere to the principles of specific (structured) communication have been confirmed. My work involved a proposal of an informative brochure for chronically dialysed patients, which sets the goal to inform dialysed patients optimistically, with certain hyperbole, however realistically on the endless possibilities how to use free time in the form of topics, on self-confidence strengthening and effective communication with healthcare staff...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: despite {{improvements}} in dialysis technology, publications around 1990 showed increasing mortality rates in dialysis patients. The Dialysis Group of the Netherlands initiated the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD) {{to investigate the}} association of patient and therapy characteristics with outcome. METHODS: 250 patients were included in this prospective multicentre study 3 months {{after the start of}} dialysis. We used Cox regression to predict mortality and technique failure and repeated measures analysis of variance to study the time course of continuous parameters. RESULTS: there were considerable differences in patient populations among <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres.</b> Patient survival was 76 % at 2 years. Technique survival was higher in haemodialysis. Hospitalisation decreased from 25 days between 3 and 12 months to 19 days per patient year in the third year. Residual renal function decreased at a similar rate in both modalities, but blood pressure tended to increase in females receiving peritoneal dialysis. Outcome was predominantly dependent on patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of the increasing age of patients starting dialysis, increasing mortality can be expected. Furthermore, if outcome is {{to play a role in}} the quality assessment of <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres,</b> it is essential to know the characteristics of their patient population...|$|R
40|$|Background: The National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) {{guidelines}} and the Renal Association recommend {{the use of}} either Kt/V or Urea Reduction Ratio (URR) to measure haemodialysis adequacy. Objectives: To determine the methods used to measure paediatric haemodialysis adequacy and to assess consistency between calculations of spKt/V and URR. Design: A service evaluation was conducted to establish current practices in measuring dialysis adequacy. A prospective longitudinal {{study was conducted to}} compare spKt/V and URR. Participants: Thirty two children were recruited consisting of 13 males and 19 females in five paediatric <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres.</b> Results: Inconsistencies were reported of the method of post urea sampling with four of the ten centres using the K/DOQI recommended sampling method. Five <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> reported using URR and five reported using spKt/V. There were substantial differences between the two measures. Using URR suggested that up to 44 % of children did not receive adequate dialysis whereas measurement by spKt/V suggested no more than 6 % of the same dialysis sessions were not adequate. Conclusion: One standard measure should be used to assess dialysis adequacy in paediatric centres in England. KDOQI guidelines were not consistently followed in obtaining a post urea blood sample and this procedure should be standardised...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{extent and}} the {{distribution}} of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in Libya have not been reported despite provision of dialysis over 4 decades. The aim of this thesis is to develop the first comprehensive description of the epidemiology of dialysis-treated ESKD in adults in Libya as well as to assess the outcomes of this treatment. Methods: A structured interview regarding dialysis provision and infection control measures was conducted with the medical directors of all 40 <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> and 28 centres were visited. In the same time demographic and clinical data were obtained regarding all adult patients treated at all maintenance dialysis facilities in Libya from May to August 2009. Additional information about the patterns of vascular access used for haemodialysis (HD) as well as prevalence and incidence of hepatitis Band/or C infection was collected and analysed. Subsequently data were collected prospectively from September 2009 to August 2010. Results: There were 40 functioning maintenance <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> in Libya (one of them was serving children only). The total number of adult patients was 2417. The prevalence rate of ESKD treated by dialysis was 624 per million population. Most dialysis units were located {{in the northern part of}} the country and only 12. 5...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use of home {{dialysis}} {{has been}} declining in Australia, despite the considerable advantages for patients. Little {{is known about the}} factors that contribute to the successful uptake of home dialysis, although increased utility costs have been identified as one possible factor affecting the decision to take up home dialysis. Objectives: This Australian multicentre observational study will identify factors that either facilitate or inhibit the uptake of home dialysis from patients' perspectives, including the evaluation of whether the current levels of financial support impacts on their decision. Design: Factors influencing decisions about home or hospital dialysis will be explored from the patients' perspective through survey and interviews. Initially, participants will be recruited from participating <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> and invited to complete a survey. Staff will collect clinical data for all those participating. A subsection of patients will be invited to participate in an individual interview or focus group to gather more information. Participants: Participants will be recruited from <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> affiliated with the HOME Network, a national initiative to engage health care professionals in the field of home dialysis. Measurements: Combining the analysis of individual and group data that is both reported and observed will offer an in-depth understanding of patients' perception of home dialysis that will inform policy and practice at both participating centres and in the broader clinical community. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background. The aims of {{this study}} were (i) to {{investigate}} the prevalence of Behçet’s disease (BD) among dialysis patients in Turkey, (ii) to report the clinical characteristics of patients with BD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), (iii) to evaluate the effect of ESRD on course and activity of BD and (iv) to analyse the published data about BD and renal failure. Methods. A questionnaire investigating BD among dialysis patients was submitted to 350 <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres</b> and we obtained the data for 20 596 patients from 331 <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres.</b> We submitted a second questionnaire regarding clinical characteristics of the patients with BD and ESRD. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were used for the analysis of BD and renal failure. Results. Fourteen patients with BD were determined and the prevalence of BD was 0. 07 % among 20 596 dialysis patients in Turkey. None of the patients has had a new manifestation of BD after initiation of haemodialysis treatment. The analysis of previous data about renalBDdemonstrated 67 patientswith renal failure. Conclusions. The most common cause of renal failure in BD is amyloidosis. Routine urine analysis and mea-surement of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are needed for early diagnosis. Vascular access-related problems are common and the activity of BD appears to decrease in patients with ESRD after initiation of haemodialysis...|$|R

40|$|Background. A patent {{vascular}} {{access is}} crucial for hemodialysis patients. Stenosis and thrombosis lead to access failure. Endothelial injury via angiotensin II may mediate a hyperplastic and prothrombotic response. Thus angiotensin II inhibition with angio-tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may pro-long vascular access patency. This study determines the impact of ACEI use on access patency in both polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) grafts and fistulas. Methods. Demographics, access history and medica-tion use were reviewed in 266 accesses from four <b>dialysis</b> <b>centres.</b> Primary patency, date of surgery to date of first access failure, was determined.
