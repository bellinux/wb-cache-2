Most of the developments are driven by the fast evolution of embedded systems for the acquisition, perception and communication modules. However, the fast growing of the automated vehicle market demands modern tools for validation, integration and testing of these new embedded functionalities, specially related to Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this paper, a testing methodology for validation of path planning and control algorithms for current and future automated vehicles is presented. A high degree of modularity and adaptability have been considered {{in the design of}} the proposed method. It is based on a software tool for vehicle modeling, called Dynacar, which allows a good trajectory definition, cooperative maneuvers interaction and virtual validation. Different types of vehicles, scenarios (i. e. : urban, interurban, highways under different environmental conditions) and controllers can be tested. Moreover, Hardware-In-the-Loop configuration (i. e. electronic control units) can be also tested. Simulation results show a good performance in the implementation and configuration of urban scenarios, using different controllers in the proposed framework.

40|$|Background. Lower {{levels of}} <b>driving</b> <b>capacity</b> in older persons are {{typically}} attributed to cognitive, visual, and/or physical impairments, with sleep disturbances rarely considered. This {{is in contrast}} to the general adult population for whom sleep disturbances are established risk factors for crashes. We thus set out to determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances in the form of insomnia symptoms, daytime drowsiness, and sleep apnea risk in a cohort of older drivers and to assess how these relate to self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>capacity.</b> Methods. Participants included 430 active drivers aged 70 years. Questionnaires measured self-reported insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), drowsiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), apnea risk (Sleep Apnea Clinical Score [SACS]), driving mileage, driver self-ratings (overall and nighttime), and prior adverse driving events. Results. Mean age was 78. 5 years, with 85 % being male. Overall, 64 % were dissatisfied with sleep patterns and 26 % had an abnormal ISI (8). A large proportion (60 %) reported a moderate-to-high chance of dozing in the afternoon, and 19 % had an abnormal ESS (10). Habitual snoring was noted by 43 %, with 20 % at risk for sleep apnea (SACS. 15). Regarding driving, the most consistent finding was for lower levels of nighttime driver self-ratings in participants with insomnia symptoms or drowsiness. Lower levels of driving mileage were also noted but only with difficulty falling asleep. Otherwise, sleep disturbances were not associated with prior adverse driving events. Conclusion. In our cohort of older drivers, insomnia symptoms and daytime drowsiness were prevalent and associated with lower levels of nighttime driver self-ratings. Although sleep apnea risk was also prevalent, it was not associated with self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>capacity.</b> These preliminary findings suggest that insomnia symptoms and drowsiness merit continued consideration as risk factors for lower levels of <b>driving</b> <b>capacity</b> in older persons, particularly given that effective interventions are available...|$|E

40|$|Background: Excessive daytime {{sleepiness}} (EDS) {{is considered}} to be responsible for increased collision rate and impaired driving simulator performance in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients. Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) patients also frequently report EDS and may also have impaired driving capacities. Methods: PLMD patients (n = 16), OSAS patients (n = 18), and controls (n = 16) performed a monotonous 25 -min driving simulation task. Parameters for <b>driving</b> <b>capacity</b> were the slope of the standard deviation of the lane position, lapses of attention (LOA), and structural deviations. The severity of sleep disruption and the degree of subjective sleepiness were measured. Results: Slope and LOA were significantly higher in patients than controls, pointing to a decreased driving performance. At start patients and controls had similar <b>driving</b> <b>capacity.</b> The PLMD and OSAS groups did not differ on any scale or simulation performance, although OSAS patients generally performed worse. Subjective sleepiness was higher in patients than controls, and correlated positively with driving simulator parameters. Severity of the disorder and performance were uncorrelated. Conclusion: PLMD and OSAS patients showed impaired performance in a simulated monotonous driving task. At start, patients and controls performed similarly, but patient performance decreased clearly with time, suggesting that decreased vigilance as a result of disturbed sleep is an important component of deteriorated simulated and, possibly, real driving performance.

40|$|In Parkinson’s disease, visual {{dysfunction}} is prominent. Visual hallucinations {{can be a}} major {{hallmark of}} late stage disease, but numerous visual deficits also occur in early stage Parkinson’s disease. Specific retinopathy, deficits in the primary visual pathway and the secondary ventral and dorsal pathways, as well as dysfunction of the attention pathways have all been posited as causes of hallucinations in Parkinson’s disease. We present data from patients with Parkinson’s disease that contrast with a known neuro-ophthalmological syndrome, termed ‘blindsight’. In this syndrome, there is an absence of conscious object identification, but preserved ‘guess’ of {{the location of a}} stimulus, preserved reflexive saccades and motion perception and preserved autonomical and expressive reactions to negative emotional facial expressions. We propose that patients with Parkinson’s disease have the converse of blindsight, being ‘blind to blindsight’. As such they preserve conscious vision, but show erroneous ‘guess’ localization of visual stimuli, poor saccades and motion perception, and poor emotional face perception with blunted autonomic reaction. Although a large data set on these deficits in Parkinson’s disease has been accumulated, consolidation into one specific syndrome has not been proposed. Focusing on neuropathological and physiological data from two phylogenetically old and subconscious pathways, the retino-colliculo-thalamo-amygdala and the retino-geniculo-extrastriate pathways, we propose that aberrant function of these systems, including pathologically inhibited superior colliculus activity, deficient corollary discharges to the frontal eye fields, dysfunctional pulvinar, claustrum and amygdaloid subnuclei of the amygdala, the latter progressively burdened with Lewy bodies, underlie this syndrome. These network impairments are further corroborated by the concept of the ‘silent amygdala’. Functionally being ‘blind to blindsight’ may facilitate the highly distinctive ‘presence’ or ‘passage’ hallucinations of Parkinson’s disease and can help to explain handicaps in <b>driving</b> <b>capacities</b> and dysfunctional ‘theory of mind’. We propose this synthesis to prompt refined neuropathological and neuroimaging studies on the pivotal nuclei in these pathways in order to better understand the networks underpinning this newly conceptualized syndrome in Parkinson’s disease...|$|R

In this study, private and professional drivers were evaluated {{by means of a}} paper-based questionnaire, including Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin Questionnaire, and additional questions to sleepiness-related accidents, near-miss accidents, health issues, and demographic data. Of the 435 distributed questionnaires, 128 completed were returned. The response rate was 29 %. The mean age of the investigated drivers was 42. 5 years (20 - 85 years). According to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 9 % of the participants are likely to suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness. An equal percentage has a high risk for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome based on the Berlin Questionnaire. 16 % admitted an involuntary nodding off while driving a motor vehicle. This subset of the participants scored statistically significant higher on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p =  0. 036). 8 % of the participants already suffered an accident because of being sleepy while driving.
