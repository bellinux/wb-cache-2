40|$|Background: There {{continues}} to be considerable interest {{in the use of}} decompressive craniectomy in the management of neurological emergencies. The procedure is technically straightforward; however, it is becoming increasingly apparent that it is associated with significant complications. One complication that has received relatively little attention is the neurological dysfunction that can occur due to the absence of the bone flap and the subsequent distortion of the brain under the scalp as cerebral swelling subsides. The aim of this narrative review was to examine the literature available regarding the clinical features described, outline the proposed pathophysiology for these clinical manifestations and highlight the implications that this may have for rehabilitation of patients with a large skull defect. Methods: A literature search was performed in the MEDLINE database (1966 to June 2012). The following keywords were used: Hemicraniectomy, decompressive craniectomy, complications, syndrome of the trephined, syndrome of the sinking scalp <b>flap,</b> <b>motor</b> trephined syndrome. The bibliographies of retrieved reports were searched for additional references. Results: Various terms have been used to describe the different neurological signs and symptoms with which patients with a skull defect can present. These include; syndrome of the trephined, posttraumatic syndrome, syndrome of the sinking scalp flap, and motor trephined syndrome. There is, however, considerable overlap between the conditions described and a patient′s individual clinical presentation. Conclusion: It is becoming increasingly apparent that certain patients are particularly susceptible to the presence of a large skull defect. The term "Neurological Susceptibility to a Skull Defect" (NSSD) is therefore suggested as a blanket term to describe any neurological change attributable to the absence of cranial coverage...|$|E

40|$|Miniature {{flapping}} flight systems hold great promise in matching the agility of their natural counterparts, bees, flies, and hummingbirds. Characterized by reciprocating wing motion, unsteady aerodynamics, {{and the ability}} to hover, insect-like {{flapping flight}} presents an interesting locomotion strategy capable of functioning at small size scales and is still a current focus of research. A vehicle with the capabilities of a fly would have potential use as miniature nodes in sensor networks, near invisible surveillance platforms, and mobile vehicles in search and rescue. Designing and constructing such systems, however, is difficult. Beyond the limits of battery capacity and the difficulties of miniature sensor design, simply producing enough lift for liftoff is a challenge. A balance must be maintained between mechanical complexity, controllability, and weight. While more actuators generally lead to more controllable degrees of freedom, they also contribute significantly to system mass. In light of these constraints, we choose to utilize passive behavior and mechanical resonance when possible. We develop platforms utilizing passive wing rotation, where the wing leading edge is driven and the trailing edge is allowed to rotate based on elastic energy storage, wing aerodynamics, and inertial effects. Wing flapping motion is allowed to resonate through the choice of cantilever actuator or added elastic element. Systems are constructed at two different size scales, using piezoelectric actuators and motors to drive the wing leading edge. In this work the design of several controllable flapping flight micro aerial vehicles is discussed and platform underactuation, control development, and active and passive stability is examined. At under one gram, both a 700 mg and 160 mg system are constructed with a single piezoelectric actuator driving each wing. Design considerations including structure rigidity, controllability and mass centralization are considered, with body finite element analysis and wing coupling tests performed. The constructed 160 mg prototype is shown to achieve a lift-to-weight ratio of 3 / 8. With an actuator driving each wing, the system is capable of producing altitude controlling forces as well as pitch and roll torques with a change in wing flapping amplitude. An alternative means of generating wing asymmetry for lift control is proposed and implemented with a shape memory based flexural hinge. Lift control is demonstrated on a modified flapping platform with an application of heat. At a larger 3 and 7 grams, a two and four wing motor-driven flapping platform is designed and constructed. With the use of an elastic element in parallel with the <b>flapping</b> motion, the <b>motor</b> driven design is able to resonate, resulting in a novel and simple liftoff capable system. <b>Motor,</b> <b>flapping</b> frequency, and wing size are chosen based on impedance matching criteria, and further experimentally optimized. Control of both piezo and motor-driven platforms is demonstrated in both simulation and in limited control experiments with a developed robust and linear controller respectively...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The rat is {{probably}} the animal species most widely used in experimental studies on nerve repair. The aim of this work was {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the morphology and blood supply of the rat brachial plexus. Material and Methods: Thirty adult rats were studied regarding brachial plexus morphology and blood supply. Intravascular injection and dissection under an operating microscope, as well as light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to define the microanatomy of the rat brachial plexus and its vessels. Results: The rat brachial plexus was slightly different from the human brachial plexus. The arterial and venous supply to the brachial plexus plexus was derived directly or indirectly from neighboring vessels. These vessels formed dense and interconnected plexuses in the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium. Several brachial plexus components were accompanied for a relatively long portion of their length by large and constant blood vessels that supplied their epineural plexus, making it possible to raise these nerves as flaps. Discussion: The blood supply to the rat brachial plexus is not very different from that reported in humans, making the rat a useful animal model for the experimental study of peripheral nerve pathophysiology and treatment. Conclusion: Our results support the homology between the rat and the human brachial plexus in terms of morphology and blood supply. This work suggests that several components of the rat brachial plexus can be used as nerve <b>flaps,</b> including predominantly <b>motor,</b> sensory or mixed nerve fibers. This information may facilitate new experimental procedures in this animal model...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} robots {{are highly}} demanded in environmental monitoring, intelligent collection, and deep water exploration. Aquatic animals (e. g., fishes, whales, rays, etc.) are ultimate examples of superior swimmers {{as a result}} of millions of years of evolution, endowed with a variety of morphological and structural features for moving through water with speed, agility, and efficiency. Recent years have also witnessed significant effort in development of bio-inspired underwater robots to mimic aquatic animals, such as robotic fish, robotic jelly fish, and robotic manta ray. In most of these robots, traditional electric motors were used to generate rotation motions. However, since flapping motions are normally adapted by aquatic animals for maneuvering and propulsion, power transmissions are needed to translate rotation to <b>flapping.</b> These electric <b>motors</b> and power transmissions are too bulky to be embedded into small scale bio-inspired robots. Novel actuating materials, which are light, soft, and capable of generating large flapping motion under electrical stimuli, are desirable to build energy efficient and highly maneuverable bio-inspired underwater robots. Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are emerging smart materials that generate large deformations under electrical stimuli. EAPs have different configurations. Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites are important category of EAPs, which can generate large bending motion under low actuation voltages. IPMCs are ideal artificial muscles in small scale bio-inspired robots. A systems perspective is taken in this research, from modeling, control, and bio-inspired design. This presentation will be organized as follows. First, a physics-based and control oriented model of IPMC actuator will be discussed. Second, a bio-inspired robotic fish propelled by IPMC caudal fin will be presented and a steady-state speed model of the fish will be developed. Third, a bio-inspired robotic manta ray propelled by two IPMC pectoral fins will be demonstrated. Fourth, a buoyancy control device powered by IPMC enhanced electrolysis will be discussed. Last, advantages and challenges of using IPMC artificial muscles in bio-inspired robots will be concluded...|$|R
40|$|Small scale {{unmanned}} aircraft, such as quadrotors, {{that are}} quickly emerging as versatile tools {{for a wide}} range of applications including search and rescue, hazardous environment exploration, or just shooting great video, are known as micro air vehicles (MAVs). However, for millimeter scale vehicles with weights under 10 grams, conventional flight technologies become greatly inefficient and instead inspiration is drawn from biology. Flapping wing MAVs (FWMAVs) have been created based on insects and hummingbirds in an effort to emulate their extreme agility and ability to hover in place. FWMAVs possess unique capabilities in terms of maneuverability, small size, and ability to operate in dynamic environments that make them particularly well suited for environmental monitoring and swarm applications such as artificial crop pollination. Despite their advantages, significant challenges in fabrication, power, and control must be overcome in order to make FWMAVs a reliable platform. Current designs suffer from high mechanical complexity and often rely on off-board power, sensing, and control, which compromises their autonomy and limits practical applications. The goal of my research is to develop a simple FWMAV design that provides high efficiency and controllability. An efficient, simple, and controllable vehicle design is developed utilizing the principles of resonance, emulation of biological flight control, and under-actuation. A highly efficient, resonant actuator is achieved by attaching a spring in parallel to the output shaft of a commercial geared DC micro-motor. This actuator directly drives the wings of the vehicle, allowing them to be controlled precisely and independently. This direct control strategy emulates biology and differs from other FWMAV designs that utilize complicated transmissions to generate <b>flapping</b> from rotary <b>motor</b> output. Direct control of the wings allows for emulation of biological wing kinematics, resulting in control based on wing motion alone. Furthermore, under-actuation is employed to mimic the rotational motion of insect wings. A rotational joint is added between the motor and wing membrane such that the wing rotates passively in response to aerodynamic forces that are generated as the wing is driven. This design is realized in several stages, initial prototyping, simulation and development of the actuator and wings, then finally a control system is developed. First the system was modeled and improved experimentally in order to achieve lift off. Improvements to the actuator were realized through component variation and custom fabrication increasing torque and power density by 161. 1 % and 666. 8 % respectively compared to the gearmotor alone and increased the resonant operating frequency of the vehicle from 4 Hz to 23 Hz. Advances in wing fabrication allowed for flexible wings that increased translational lift production by 35. 3 %, aerodynamic efficiency by 41. 3 %, and the effective lift coefficient by 63. 7 % with dynamic twisting. A robust control architecture was then developed iteratively based on a date driven system model in order to increase flight time from 1 second (10 wing strokes) to over 10 seconds (230 wing strokes). The resulting design improves lift to weight by 166 %, allowing for a payload capacity of approximately 8. 7 g and offers the potential for fully autonomous operation with all necessary components included on-board. A thermal model for micro-motors was developed and tuned to accurately predict an upper limit of system operation of 41 seconds as well as to optimize a heatsink that increases operating time by 102. 4 %...|$|R
