5|$|Remaining {{in such a}} {{position}} would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the 1936 season. Although the chassis of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened {{the season with a}} win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a <b>failed</b> <b>fuel</b> pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang's car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.|$|E
25|$|As {{night fell}} on the circuit, Toyota's lead {{extended}} to over a minute from the two remaining Audi entrants, while the OAK Ligier took over the LMP2 lead and ran away to nearly three minutes over the duelling Race Performance Oreca and Signatech Alpine. LMGTE Pro {{continued to be a}} close battle between Giancarlo Fisichella in the No. 51 Ferrari, Darren Turner's No. 97 Aston Martin, and No. 74 Corvette driven by Richard Westbrook, with the trio following one another nose to tail for a multitude of laps. The second Corvette dropped off the leading pace after problems with the car's air jack system required a lengthy pit stop. The No. 98 and No. 95 Aston Martin vehicles continued to hold sway over the LMGTE Am class, but around midnight Pedro Lamy relinquished the lead the No. 98 car had held for 86 consecutive laps {{when he came to the}} pit lane with smoke from the bonnet as the power steering system on the car failed. The No. 1 Audi of Kristensen was forced to the garage to replace <b>failed</b> <b>fuel</b> injectors after the race passed half distance, while Lieb Porsche's No. 14 car was forced to return to the pit lane on solely electrical power after suffering a second fuel pressure problem. As Nakajima drove the No. 7 Toyota into its ninth hour in the race lead, the car lost drive shortly after the Arnage corner and came to a stop alongside the barriers. An FIA-mandated piece of monitoring equipment had failed within the car and melted a wiring loom and was not able to be repaired by Nakajima, forcing Toyota to abandon the former race-leading car. The No. 2 Audi became the new leader ahead of the No. 20 Porsche and the recovering No. 1 Audi by three laps.|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{cladding}} {{is one of}} the {{key components}} in a fission reactor that confines radioactive materials inside a fuel tube. During reactor operation, however, cladding is sometimes breached, and radioactive materials leak from the fuel pellet into the coolant water through the breach. The primary coolant water is therefore monitored so that any leak is quickly detected; coolant water is periodically sampled, and the concentration of radioactive iodine 131 (I- 131), for example, is measured. Depending on the measured leakage concentration, the faulty fuel assembly with leaking rod is removed from the reactor and replaced immediately or at the next refueling. In the present study, an effort has been made to develop a methodology to optimize the management for replacement of faulty fuel assemblies due to cladding failures using measured leakage concentration. A model numerical equation is proposed to describe the time evolution of an increase in I- 131 concentration due to cladding failures and is then solved using the Monte Carlo method as a function of sampling rate. Our results indicate that, to achieve rationalized management of <b>failed</b> <b>fuels,</b> higher resolution to detect a small amount of I- 131 is not necessarily required, but more frequent sampling is favorable...|$|R

50|$|Trace {{evidence}} is sometimes {{an important factor}} in reconstructing the sequence of events in an accident.

When a product fails for no obvious reason, SEM and Energy-dispersive X&#8209;ray spectroscopy (EDX) performed in the microscope can reveal the presence of aggressive chemicals that have left traces on the fracture or adjacent surfaces. Thus an acetal resin water pipe joint suddenly failed and caused substantial damages to a building in which it was situated. Analysis of the joint showed traces of chlorine, indicating a stress corrosion cracking failure mode. The <b>failed</b> <b>fuel</b> pipe junction mentioned above showed traces of sulfur on the fracture surface from the sulfuric acid, which had initiated the crack.|$|E

40|$|<b>Failed</b> <b>fuel</b> {{refers to}} the breach in the fuel-clad of an {{irradiated}} fuel assembly in a nuclear reactor. Neutron detection or gamma detection is commonly used in <b>Failed</b> <b>Fuel</b> Detection and Locating (FFDL) system to monitor {{the activity of the}} coolant. Though these methods offer specific advantages under different conditions of the coolant, providing both types of detectors in FFDL system is impractical. This limitation is the motivation for the detector system developed in the present work. In the present work, effort has been made for realising a detector system for simultaneous measurement of neutron and gamma activity of the coolant, thus offering a two-parameter basis for <b>failed</b> <b>fuel</b> detection. NE 213 liquid scintillator was chosen for this work as it has good detection capability for both neutrons and gammas. Additionally, the neutrons and gammas interacting with NE 213 detector can be separated based on pulse shape discrimination. The work reported in this thesis includes fabrication details and different steps followed in assembling the NE 213 detector. Details of experimental set-up developed for pulse height analysis and pulse shape analysis are covered. Results of experiments carried out to study the response of the NE 213 detector to gamma and neutron sources using pulse height analyser are presented. The absolute gamma efficiency and relative gamma efficiency of NE 213 detector are calculated. Neutron–gamma separation capability of NE 213 detector based pulse shape analysis system is reported. Application of the developed detector system to analyse the coolant activity in FFDL system in a reactor is described. Response of the detector is compared with the existing FFDL system at different power levels of the reactor. Since <b>failed</b> <b>fuel</b> is a rare event, it was simulated using neutron and gamma sources.
