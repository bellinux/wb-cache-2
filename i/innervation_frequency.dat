40|$|Single fibre {{electromyography}} {{has been}} performed {{in patients with}} partial nerve lesions, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive spinal muscle atrophy, muscular dystrophy, and distal hereditary myopathy. The recorded action potentials were often more complex than in the normal muscle due to increased fibre density in the motor unit and the individual spike components showed a large jitter and occasional blockings. Sometimes two or more spikes in a complex disappeared and reappeared simultaneously upon successive discharges. This phenomenon, called `paired blocking', has been further investigated. The jitter of the blocking potentials {{in relation to the}} rest of the complex was large, up to 500 Î¼sec. The degree of blocking increased with increasing <b>innervation</b> <b>frequency</b> until it eventually proceeded to total block during continuous activity. Sometimes a slight effect on blocking was seen after edrophonium. This type of block is probably localized in the terminal nerve twigs, perhaps in newly formed sprouts. The phenomenon of neurogenic blocking may contribute to the fatigue clinically experienced in different denervation-reinnervation cases...|$|E
40|$|There {{are only}} a few studies on the {{innervation}} of the human parathyroid glands and the content of neurotransmitters. We therefore studied the occurrence and distribution of peptide-containing and adrenergic nerve fibres and the coexistence pattern of neuromessengers by immunocytochemistry in normal (unaffected) and adenomatous parathyroid glands from patients undergoing surgery for parathyroid adenoma. The unaffected parathyroid glands had a moderate-to-rich supply of nerve fibres and terminals containing two general neuronal markers, protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) and synaptophysin, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). They were seen close to blood vessels and, occasionally, among the endocrine cells. Only a few nerves contained calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P (SP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP). The general density of innervation, using PGP 9. 5 and synaptophysin as markers, varied greatly among the different adenomas examined. This applied also to the density of fibres and terminals containing specific types of messengers. Some of the tumours had a rich supply of TH- and NPY-containing nerve fibres, while others contained only few scattered fibres. The CGRP-containing fibres varied from moderate in number to no detectable fibres. The PACAP-, SP- and VIP-containing fibres were always very few or not detectable. It is not inconceivable that the wide variation in general density of the <b>innervation</b> and <b>frequency</b> of peptide-containing nerves among individual parathyroid adenomas is of significance for their hormone secretory behaviour...|$|R
