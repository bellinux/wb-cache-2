40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the need and}} solution for minimizing EVA airlock time and <b>depress</b> <b>gas</b> losses using a new method that minimizes EVA out-the-door time for a suited astronaut and reclaims most of the airlock <b>depress</b> <b>gas.</b> This method consists {{of one or more}} related concepts that use an evacuated reservoir tank to store and reclaim the airlock <b>depress</b> <b>gas.</b> The evacuated tank can be an inflatable tank, a spent fuel tank from a lunar lander descent stage, or a backup airlock. During EVA airlock operations, the airlock and reservoir would be equalized at some low pressure, and through proper selection of reservoir size, most of the <b>depress</b> <b>gas</b> would be stored in the reservoir for later reclamation. The benefit of this method is directly applicable to long duration lunar and Mars missions that require multiple EVA missions (up to 100, two-person lunar EVAs) and conservation of consumables, including depress pump power and <b>depress</b> <b>gas.</b> The current ISS airlock gas reclamation method requires approximately 45 minutes of the astronaut s time in the airlock and 1 KW in electrical power. The proposed method would decrease the astronaut s time in the airlock because the <b>depress</b> <b>gas</b> is being temporarily stored in a reservoir tank for later recovery. Once the EVA crew is conducting the EVA, the volume in the reservoir would be pumped back to the cabin at a slow rate. Various trades were conducted to optimize this method, which include time to equalize the airlock with the evacuated reservoir versus reservoir size, pump power to reclaim <b>depress</b> <b>gas</b> versus time allotted, inflatable reservoir pros and cons (weight, volume, complexity), and feasibility of spent lunar nitrogen and oxygen tanks as reservoirs...|$|R

In experiment 1, fermentative gas production was measured in vitro to determine the impact of increasing amounts of ractopamine- HCl added to rumen fluid. Ractopamine-HCl increased gas production when added to rumen fluid up to 10 times the assumed physiological dosage of 200 mg per head/day, but <b>depressed</b> <b>gas</b> production at 100 times the physiological dose. Experiment 2 and 3 evaluated the effects of ractopamine-HCl on production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by ruminal microbes. In vitro experiments revealed no effect of ractopamine on volatile fatty acid production, but VFA levels in rumen fluid of cattle 23 hours after feeding were lower for cattle fed Optaflexx then for controls (P = 0. 01). Results of these studies indicate that ractopamine-HCl has a direct influence on fermentation by rumen microflora...|$|R
40|$|The {{outlook for}} {{increased}} gas cooling use {{has not only}} improved because the residential air conditioning market in general has grown but also {{because many of the}} factors that <b>depressed</b> <b>gas</b> air conditioner sales earlier have been eliminated. First, the gas cooling equipment available today is more reliable and durable than before. During the 1960 s, deficiencies in the gas absorption air conditioner caused an annual failure rate of about 8 percent. It is now less than 1 percent due to a number of improvements implemented by Arkla Industries during the 1970 s. For example, the stainless steel generators in the units were improved with chrome plating, which prolongs the system life of the units. The quality of the steel in the restrictors, burner tubes, and evaporator coils was also improved. Residential gas air conditioners now carry a ten-year warranty on all defects in material and workmanship on the sealed refrigeration unit, while a compressor in an electric air conditioner normally has only a one- to five-year warranty. ...|$|R

40|$|Surface active agents <b>depress</b> <b>gas</b> {{transfer}} at gas-liquid interfaces. They {{are present}} as measurable trace contaminants at all environmental and at most industrial interfaces. An experimental apparatus to concurrently measure dynamic surface tension and mass transfer was constructed and tested for single-bubble and multi-bubble experiments. In this work, the parameters describing time-dependent bubble surface contamination were characterized. The {{application of a}} Ward-Tordai transient model and of a Langmuir saturation model showed that for fine-bubbles in low molecular weight surfactant solutions the interfacial surfactant accumulation equilibrates before bubble detachment. This {{is reflected in the}} bubbles behaving as solid-spheres, which is shown in our dimensionless results. For a given contamination, interfaces with higher renewal rates have higher mass transfer. At higher renewal rates, the variation due to different contamination is smaller than the variation at lower renewal rates, concluding that higher interfacial flow regimes can offset contamination. Our experimental evidence shows a gas transfer reduction of 30 - 70 % of pure water values in surfactant solutions, which confirms full-scale field measurements. Results are consistent with expectations and correct previous Frossling-like dimensionless correlations for pure water systems. Our results offer a tool for mass transfer prediction from flow regime and surfactant properties. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Compared with the control conditions, Cd decreased plant biomass, damaged the photosynthetic apparatus, visible as a decreased maximum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII; F(v) /F(m)) and effective quantum yield of PSII (Yield), <b>depressed</b> <b>gas</b> exchange capacity, and induced oxidative stress, visible as the disruption of antioxidative enzymes and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in both sexes. On the other hand, Cd toxicity was mitigated by the recovery of gas exchange capacity, a decrease in ROS, and improvement of the redox imbalance in both sexes when N deposition was applied. However, males showed a higher gas exchange capacity, lower enzyme inhibition and ROS accumulation, stronger abilities to maintain cellular redox homeostasis, and a better maintenance of chloroplast ultrastructure than did females when exposed to Cd stress alone. Although males exhibited a higher Cd content in leaves than did females, males also accumulated higher levels of non-protein thiols (NP-SHs) and free amino acids (FAAs) for detoxification than did females. Sexual differences induced by Cd, visible, for example, in F(v) /F(m), Yield, net photosynthesis rate (A), and stomatal conductance (g(s)), decreased under N deposition, as {{no significant differences between}} the sexes existed in these parameters under the combined treatment. The results indicated that females are more sensitive to Cd stress and suffer more injuries than do males. Moreover, N deposition can mitigate Cd toxicity and decrease sexual differences in Cd sensitivity. National Natural Science Foundation of China[30930075...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of the gas}} bladder {{and associated}} structures in sea catfishes (Siluriformes: Ariidae) is studied. The most simple gas bladder, exclusive to Galeichthys Valenciennes, is apple-shaped with weakly developed internal trabeculae, has smooth walls externally and a short Mullerian window associated with a broad, short Mullerian ramus that is firmly attached to Baudelot`s ligament and supracleithrum. Most genera of Ariidae have a cordiform bladder with well-developed trabeculae, smooth walls externally, an elongate Mullerian window and an elongate Mullerian ramus with an acute tip that is free from the Baudelot`s ligament and supracleithrum. Sciades proops (Valenciennes) and S. parkeri (Traill) have a similar gas bladder but with a well-developed secondary chamber. Other genera of Ariidae also have a cordiform bladder with well-developed trabeculae and elongate Mullerian window, but with lateral diverticula present as shallow rounded bulges or blister-like swellings along the peripheral margins of the bladder. The degree of development of lateral diverticula varies among and within species, with Osteogeneiosus Bleeker having the most highly-developed diverticula. Bagre pinnimaculatus (Steindachner) and Bagre bagre (Linnaeus) have unusual <b>depressed</b> <b>gas</b> bladders with complex network of internal trabeculae.

40|$|Introduction] Some {{explanations}} are deep and powerful: Newton’s {{explanation of the}} tides, Maxwell’s explanation of the propagation of light, Einstein’s explanation of the advance of the perihelion of Mercury.

We take this intuition to be very natural and widely shared. Yet in the vast philosophical literature on explanation, there have been precious few attempts to give any systematic account of this notion of explanatory depth.

40|$|A {{consensus}} is emerging that interacting galaxies show <b>depressed</b> nuclear <b>gas</b> metallicities compared to isolated star-forming galaxies. Simulations {{suggest that this}} nuclear underabundance is caused by interaction-induced inflow of metal-poor gas, and that this inflow concurrently flattens the radial metallicity gradients in strongly interacting galaxies. We present metallicities of over 300 H II regions {{in a sample of}} 16 spirals that are members of strongly interacting galaxy pairs with mass ratio near unity. The deprojected radial gradients in these galaxies are about half of those in a control sample of isolated, late-type spirals. Detailed comparison of the gradients with simulations show remarkable agreement in gradient distributions, the relationship between gradients and nuclear underabundances, and the shape of profile deviations from a straight line. Taken together, this evidence conclusively demonstrates that strongly interacting galaxies at the present day undergo nuclear metal dilution due to gas inflow, as well as significant flattening of their gas-phase metallicity gradients, and that current simulations can robustly reproduce this behavior at a statistical level...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{markets are}} {{characterized}} by large uncertainties and risks. The annual volatility of the Brent oil price is 28 %, meaning {{that there is a}} 1 -in- 3 chance that next year's oil price will be more than 28 % higher or lower than this year's price. Similarly, the annual volatility of gas prices for domestic consumers in Belgium/Brussels is 14 %. The uncertainty is much larger than in many other goods and services, such as cars, housing, or travel, to name but a few household spending categories. This phenomenon is all the more important since energy is an essential input to many production processes and consumption patterns. The risk in energy markets has several underlying causes: technical, such as the recent application of new techniques that allow for the extraction of ‘shale gas’, which has <b>depressed</b> <b>gas</b> prices in the US; macroeconomic, such as the drop in oil demand following the 2008 / 2009 global economic crisis, which roughly halved oil prices; and political, such as the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis in 2006 and 2009, or the first oil shock in the 1970 s. Part I of this thesis deals with political risk, and analyzes decisions of resource-rich countries that affect the allocation of energy-related rents. Chapter 2 studies the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis and how it impacts European import strategies. Chapter 3 investigates the taxation of resource extraction in petroleum-producing countries. Chapter 4 also studies taxation, but focuses on a resource that is mostly exploited in Western countries, namely nuclear power. Chapter 5 also deals with Western countries and explores the possible outcome of potential international negotiations on the distribution of rents arising from a trans-European CO 2 pipeline network for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Part II of this thesis investigates how firms can protect themselves against the risks in energy supply, by hedging their exposure. The main challenge in hedging is that energy markets are typically very incomplete, in that not enough different contracts (such as options) exist to enable firms to hedge their exposure completely. Chapter 6 analyzes the effect of market incompleteness on welfare and investment incentives in the specific case of an electricity market with demand uncertainty. Chapter 7 provides a generalization of the theory for a generic market structure with non-specified uncertainty. JRC. F. 6 -Energy systems evaluatio...|$|R

The principal metabolic products were butyric, acetic, and lactic acids, H 2, and CO 2. 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy identified glycerol as a previously unknown major product of D-[1 - 13 C]glucose fermentation by this protozoan. Metabolite formation rates were clearly influenced by the headspace gas composition. In the presence of 1 to 3 microM O 2, acetate, H 2, and CO 2 formation was partially <b>depressed.</b> A <b>gas</b> headspace with a high CO 2 content (66 kPa) was found to suppress hydrogenosomal pathways and to favor butyrate accumulation.

40|$|Numerous {{top-down}} resource estimates {{have indicated}} that shale deposits hold enormous volumes of methane globally. Until recently detailed delineations of shale gas resources and their production have occurred exclusively in North America. The driving forces and enabling conditions behind the rapid exploitation of shale gas resources in North America are assessed to determine if these are transferable {{to the rest of}} world. No two shale deposits are created equal and the mere existence of shale does not guarantee gas production. A formation may hold too little oil or gas - or it may not be brittle enough for fracking to work effectively. The challenge is to find so-called "sweet spots", i. e., plays with high flow rates, once stimulated. The amount of shale gas that can be commercially produced under current and future market conditions is determined by the quantity and thermal maturity of a shale's organic content, by regional technology cost and by regional gas price levels. The shale gas rushes in North America have caused a precipitous drop in North American natural gas wellhead prices - from some 11 $/GJ to, temporarily, less than 3 $/GJ. A review of the economics of shale gas production indicates that (a) the resource appraisal process for conventional gas resources is unsuitable for unconventional gas resources, (b) field development requires continuous (on-the-go) investment in fracking to stimulate well pressure, and (c) <b>depressed</b> US <b>gas</b> prices currently fail to cover full finding and development costs. Unless well technology improves and completion costs decline rapidly, the maturation speed of technically recoverable shale gas resources to proved reserves will be further delayed.

40|$|Introduction. The energy sector, {{especially}} with regard to the gas trade, {{is one of the key}} areas of co-operation between the EU and Russia. However, the form this co-operation has taken has been giving rise to some concern, both in Brussels and in the EU member states. Questions arise as to whether the EU has not become excessively dependent on Russia for energy, and whether the presence of the Russian gas monopoly in the EU does not enable Russian interference with the development of EU energy policy. The objective of this series of OSW reports (for the previous edition,see Gazprom’s expansion in the EU: co-operation or domination? April 2008 – pdf 1. 2 MB) is to provide facts which will permit an accurat answer to these questions to be formulated. Over the course of last year, two new factors strongly affected Gazprom’s capability to operate on the EU market. One was the ongoing global economic crisis, which has <b>depressed</b> demand for <b>gas</b> both in Russia and in Europe. Gazprom has cut both its own production and the quantities of gas it purchases from the Central Asian states, and the decrease in export revenues has forced the company to modify some of its current investment plans. Less demand for gas and the need to reduce production are also having a positive impact – the Russian company is likely to avoid the difficulties in meeting all of its export commitments which, only a year or so ago, it was expected to experience. The other factor affecting Gazprom’s expansion in Europe is the observed radicalisation of the rhetoric and actions of both the company itself and of the Russian authorities with regard to the gas sector as broadly understood. The gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine in January 2009, which resulted in a two-week interruption of gas supplies from Russia to Europe via Ukraine, was the most prominent example of this radicalisation. The hardening of rhetoric in the ongoing energy talks with the EU and other actors, and increased political and business activities designed to promote Russian gas interests in Europe, in particular the lobbying for the Nord Stream and South Stream projects, are further signs of this shift in tone. These issues raise the question of whether, and to what extent, the current condition of Gazprom’s finance will permit the company to implement the infrastructural projects it has been endorsing and its other investment plans in Europe. Another important question is whether the currently observed changes in how Gazprom operates will take on a more permanent character, and what consequences this will have for the European Union. The first part of this report discusses Gazprom’s production and export potential. The second comprehensively presents the scope and nature of Gazprom’s economic presence in the EU member states. Finally, the third part presents the Russian company’s methods of operation on foreign markets. The data presented in the report come mainly from the statistics of the International Energy Agency, the European Commission and Gazprom, as well as the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian Statistical Office. The figures presented here also include proprietary calculations by the OSW based on figures disclosed by energy companies and reports by professional press and news agencies...|$|R
