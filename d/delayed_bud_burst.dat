40|$|Warmer spring temperatures, as {{caused by}} climate warming, {{led to an}} earlier bud burst in spring and an {{extended}} growing season in many temperate and boreal tree species. But to which extent will the phenology of these species keep tracking rising temperatures in future? Temperature, photoperiod and degree of winter chilling are the main environmental factors controlling tree spring phenology. Contrary to the high inter-annual variation of spring temperatures, photoperiod is an astronomical, weather independent environmental cue for the progression of the season. Photoperiodic control of spring development prevents trees from flushing too early under mild winter and early spring temperatures, before the period of potentially fatal freezing damage is over. Photoperiod sensitive species are therefore likely to stop tracking climate warming the closer the temperature modulated bud break is shifted toward the genetically fixed photoperiod threshold. I assessed the photoperiod sensitivity of spring bud swelling and bud burst in several common temperate tree species using growth chamber experiments with variable photoperiod × temperature interaction and evaluated commonly used phenological models to represent these interactions. Short photoperiods <b>delayed</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in late successional species to various degrees, whereas no distinct photoperiod sensitivity of bud burst was observed in early successional and exotic (ornamental) species, which are thus mostly temperature controlled. Climate warming will thus not necessarily lead to progressively longer growing seasons in late successional species, as is often assumed...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{elevated}} CO 2, clone {{and plant}} nutrition on bud dormancy of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) were examined. Sitka spruce seedlings were fumigated with ambient or elevated (ambient + 350 µmol mol– 1) concentrations of CO 2 in open-top chambers for three growing seasons. In 1991 and 1992, elevated CO 2 <b>delayed</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> {{in the spring}} and advanced bud set in the autumn. The effect of the open-top chamber on the thermal requirement for bud burst was greater than the effect of elevated CO 2 (50 and 30 day degrees (Dd), respectively). In a second study, four clones of Sitka spruce taken from two provenances, at 43 and 54 ° N, were fumigated with ambient or elevated CO 2. There was a large natural variation in the timing of bud burst and bud set among the clones. Elevated CO 2 had no effect on bud dormancy of the Skidegate a clone, but it reduced the growing season of the North Bend b clone by 20 days. In a third study, Sitka spruce seedlings growing in ambient or elevated CO 2, were supplied with one of three nutrient regimes, low (0. 1 x potential), medium (0. 5 x potential) or high (2. 0 x potential), using a method and solution based on the Ingestad technique. Elevated CO 2 did not affect bud dormancy in the high-nutrient treatment, but it reduced the growing season of plants in the low-nutrient treatment by 22 days. Increasing plant nutrient supply lengthened the growing season, plants flushed earlier {{in the spring and}} set bud later in the autumn. The effects of elevated CO 2 plus a 0, 2 or 4 °C climatic warming on the timing of bud burst and the subsequent risk of frost damage were assessed using a simulation model and meteorological data from three sites, Edinburgh, Braemar and Masset. The model predicted that (i) doubling the CO 2 concentration in the absence of climatic warming, will delay the onset of bud burst at all three sites, (ii) climatic warming in ambient CO 2 will hasten bud burst and (iii) climatic warming in elevated CO 2 will hasten bud burst at Edinburgh and Braemar but to a lesser extent than climatic warming alone. At Masset, a 4 °C warming was required to advance the date of bud burst of seedlings in the elevated CO 2 treatment. At all three sites, elevated CO 2 and climatic warming increased the mean daily temperature on the date of bud burst, thus reducing the risk of subsequent frost damage. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of different chilling treatments during the dormant season upon growth of Douglas-fir seedlings 0 In addition it was planned to determine whether seedlings native to various geographic areas differ in their chilling requirements 0 The hypotheses were advanced, based on previous studies, that chilling at near L& 00 F. was more effective in satisfying the chilling requirement of plants than chilling at temperatures near 32 °F., or 50 °F., and that plants native to areas of low elevation, characterized by mild winters, require less chilling than plants native to areas of high elevation characterized by long and severe winters. Verification or rejection of these hypotheses was undertaken by subjecting dormant seedlings of Douglas-fir, native to several geographic areas, to chilling under different temperature treatments for different lengths of time. Experiment I was designed to compare the effects of chilling for three, six, and twelve weeks at various temperatures (32, L& 0, 50, and 60 °F., and out-of-doors) on two-year-old seedlings from eight geographic areas. After chilling, they were moved to a warm greenhouse and exposed to short days (nine hours). The effectiveness of the treatments in breaking dormancy was expressed in number of days from end of treatment to bud burst, percentage of plants which broke dormancy, and amount of shoot elongation. In general 40 °F. was the most effective treatment followed by 32 °F., out-of-doors, 50, and 60 °F., in that order. The latter temperature had little or no effect in breaking dormancy compared with the other treatments. Twelve weeks of chilling were more effective than chilling for shorter periods at all temperatures except 60 °F. At six weeks 40 °F. was the most effective treatment, 32 °F. was less effective, while 50, 60 °F., and out-of- doors treatments were ineffective in breaking dormancy. Four weeks of chilling were ineffective regardless of the chilling treatment. Genetic differences were observed among the plants from the eight areas chilled at 40 °F. for twelve weeks. Plants native to the highest areas represented in the experiment resumed growth earlier than those from the lower elevations. Experiments II and III differed from Experiment I since the dormant seedlings had germinated and grown only about three months prior to chilling. In these experiments plants were chilled for four, eight, and twelve weeks. After the chilling period half of the plants were grown under long days (normal days plus two hours of artificial light) while the other half were maintained on short days (nine hours). The results of Experiment II were similar to those of Experiment I with respect to the greater effectiveness of 40 °F. compared with the other temperature 8. Long days seemed to compensate for lack of adequate chilling except in plants chilled for twelve weeks at 40 °F., indicating that the chilling requirements of these plants had been more adequately satisfied than by any of the other treatments. Experiment III was designed to compare the effectiveness of chilling under fluctuating day and night temperatures with that of chilling at a constant temperature. Fluctuating day and night temperatures of 40 / 32 °F. (40 °F. day, 32 'F. night) were about as effective as continuous chilling at 32 °F. or 40 °F. Fluctuating temperatures of 50 / 32 °F., and 50 / 40 °F. appeared to be about as effective as continuous chilling at 50 °F. Chilling at 50 °F. during the day, irrespective of the temperature during night, <b>delayed</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in comparison with chilling at 32, 40, or 40 / 32 °F. Genetic differences were observed among the plants from the different areas in Experiments II and 1110 Plants native to high elevations (6000 ' elev.) resumed growth in lower percentages, resumed growth later, and grew less than plants from tower elevations (3000 ' and 3600 ' elev.).

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the role of}} the circadian clock in the seasonal growth cycle of trees: growth cessation, bud set, freezing tolerance, and <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides (Ptt) LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (PttLHY 1), PttLHY 2, and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 constitute regulatory clock components because down-regulation by RNA interference of these genes leads to altered phase and period of clock-controlled gene expression as compared to the wild type. Also, both RNA interference lines show about 1 -h-shorter critical daylength for growth cessation as compared to the wild type, extending their period of growth. During winter dormancy, when the diurnal variation in clock gene expression stops altogether, down-regulation of PttLHY 1 and PttLHY 2 expression compromises freezing tolerance and the expression of C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR 1, suggesting a role of these genes in cold hardiness. Moreover, down-regulation of PttLHY 1 and PttLHY 2 causes a <b>delay</b> in <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> This evidence shows that in addition to a role in daylength-controlled processes, PttLHY plays a role in the temperature-dependent processes of dormancy in Populus such as cold hardiness and <b>bud</b> <b>burst...</b>|$|R

This architecture can be modulated by environmental conditions, particularly in the horticulture {{context in which the}} possibilities to control growing conditions are numerous. The objectives of the study were to determine, ill young rose bushes, (1) whether short periods of nitrogen deficiency affect branching and (2) whether this effect is sufficient to modify the visual quality of the plant in a sustainable manner. Between vegetative <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and the petal colour visible stage of the generated primary branch, young rooted cuttings of bush rose (cv Radrazz) were subjected to one of three nitrogen regimes: (1) no nitrogen deficiency, (2) continuous nitrogen deficiency, i. e. 35 days of N deficiency, and (3) nitrogen deficiency restricted to the flowering stages, i. e. 18 days of N deficiency. After the petal colour visible stage, all three groups of plants were supplied continuously with nitrogen. We observed the morphology of the axes and the kinetics of axillary <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Twelve weeks after the petal colour visible stage, the visual quality of the rose bushes was evaluated by an expert jury. We found that nitrogen deficiencies (1) increased <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> ratios in the medial and basal zones of the primary branch, (2) <b>delayed</b> the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in the apical zone of the primary branch and (3) had long-term effects on plant visual quality. The continuous nitrogen deficiency regime produced flatter, more asymmetric and less vigorous rose bushes than the no nitrogen deficiency regime. By contrast, nitrogen deficiency during the flowering stages only resulted in more symmetric, taller and more vigorous rose bushes than the no nitrogen deficiency regime. Based on these results, the role of nitrogen on <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was discussed and candidate processes at the origin of the visual quality modification were suggested. This new approach combining ecophysiology and sensory assessment of ornamental plants enabled the identification of some early architecture components to be correlated with later visual quality characteristics and then to better target the physiological processes of interest.

Although the large interannual variations in dates of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and growth termination have been widely discussed, little is known about the genotypic and spatial variations in phenology and how these sources of variation are related to temporal variation. We measured <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of eight white birch (Betula pendula Roth) clones in two field experiments daily over 6 years, and deter-mined the termination of growth for the same clones over 2 years.

Al-though interannual variations in date of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> {{have been widely}} discussed, {{little is known about}} within-population vari-ation, the key determinants for this variation and the effects of this variation on estimates of trends in <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date. Over a period of nine years, we monitored timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> daily in 30 mature white birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees in a natu-rally regenerated stand. Our results revealed not only large interannual variation but also considerable intraannual varia-tion among individual trees in date of <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> the maximum within-population variation being four weeks. <b>Bud</b> <b>burst</b> can be accurately predicted by the date when a threshold value of tem-perature sum in spring is reached (base temperature + 5 °C).

Geostatistical approach was used to describe the spatial variation in <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> percentage within the vineyard.

40|$|Young {{seedlings}} of the conifer Norway spruce exhibit short day (SD) -induced {{cessation of}} apical growth and bud set. Although different, constant temperatures under SD {{are known to}} modulate timing of bud set and depth of dormancy with development of deeper dormancy under higher compared to lower temperature, systematic studies of effects of alternating day (DT) and night temperatures (NT) are limited. To shed light on this, seedlings of different provenances of Norway spruce were exposed {{to a wide range}} of DT-NT combinations during bud development, followed by transfer to forcing conditions of long days (LD) and 18 °C, directly or after different periods of chilling. Although no specific effect of alternating DT/NT was found, the results demonstrate that the effects of DT under SD on bud set and subsequent bud break are significantly modified by NT in a complex way. The effects on bud break persisted after chilling. Since time to bud set correlated with the daily mean temperature under SD at DTs of 18 and 21 °C, but not a DT of 15 °C, time to bud set apparently also depend on the specific DT, implying that the effect of NT depends on the actual DT. Although higher temperature under SD generally results in later bud break after transfer to forcing conditions, the fastest bud flush was observed at intermediate NTs. This might be due to a bud break-hastening chilling effect of intermediate compared to higher temperatures, and <b>delayed</b> <b>bud</b> development to a stage where <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> can occur, under lower temperatures. Also, time to <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in un-chilled seedlings decreased with increasing SD-duration, suggesting that bud development must reach a certain stage before the processes leading to <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> are initiated.

Two-year-old seedlings were grown for 2. 5 years in semi-closed, sunlit chambers at either ambient or elevated (ambient + » 4 °C) air {{temperature in the}} presence of an ambient or elevated (ambient + » 200 ppm) CO 2 concentration. The elevated temperature treatment delayed needle cold hardening in the autumn and slowed dehardening in the spring. At maximum hardiness, trees in the elevated temperature treatment were less hardy by about 7 °C than trees in the ambient temperature treatment. In gen-eral, trees exposed to elevated CO 2 were slightly less hardy during hardening and dehardening than trees exposed to ambi-ent CO 2. For trees in the elevated temperature treatments, date to 30 % burst of branch terminal buds was advanced by about 6 and 15 days {{in the presence of}} elevated CO 2 and ambient CO 2, respectively. After <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> started, however, the rate of in-crease in % <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was slower in the elevated temperature treatments than in the ambient temperature treatments.

40|$|Summary According to {{prevailing}} theory, {{air temperature}} {{is the main}} environmental factor regulating the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of boreal and temperate trees. Air temperature has a dual role in this regulation. First, after the cessation of growth in au-tumn, prolonged exposure to chilling causes rest completion, i. e., removes the physiological growth-arresting conditions in-side the bud. After rest completion, prolonged exposure to warm conditions causes ontogenetic development leading to <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> or flowering. During the past three decades, several simulation models based on chilling and forcing have been de-veloped and tested. In recent modeling studies of the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in mature trees, the simpler thermal-time models that assume forcing starts on a fixed date in the spring have outper-formed the chilling-forcing models. We hypothesize that this discrepancy {{may be due to}} some element missing from the chilling-forcing models. We tested two new model formulations by introducing re-versing, temperature-driven elements that precede forcing and by fitting the models to seven historical time series of data of flowering and leaf <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of common boreal tree species. In these tests, both of the new models were generally more accu-rate in predicting the timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> than a classical chill-ing-forcing model, but less accurate than the simple thermal-time model. We therefore conclude that besides chilling, other environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the tim-ing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Further work is needed to determine if the regulatory factors derive from air temperature or from some other environmental condition such as changes in light condi-tions, like day length or night length...|$|R

Therefore, several ex situ clone collections were established throughout Europe for breeding and conservation purposes. This thesis was carried out within the RESGEN CT 96 - 78 project, which launched the EU-coordinated evaluation of these collections. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the variation in <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date and to acquire basic knowledge on the environmental control of this adaptive trait with regard to DED susceptibility. <b>Bud</b> <b>burst</b> date variation observed among collections and years in European elms was explained by a phenological model based on an inverse exponential relationship between thermal time and chilling to <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> According to the fitted curves, European elms have low dormancy and short chilling requirement for dormancy release. <b>Bud</b> <b>burst</b> date in U. minor was directly related to latitude and elevation. The order of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was stable among years. The observed geographic trends were largely determined by difference in chilling requirement for dormancy release which increased with latitude and elevation. The effects of photoperiod and temperature on dormancy release in clones of European and Asian species were studied in partially controlled conditions in Italy.

To gain insight into how light induces <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> we investigated whether its inductive effect in rose was related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. In axillary buds of beheaded plants subject to light, the expression of two GA biosynthesis genes (RoGA 20 ox and RoGA 3 ox) was promptly and strongly induced, while that of a GA-catabolism genes (RoGA 2 ox) was reduced. By contrast, lower expression levels of these two GA biosynthesis genes were found in darkness, and correlated with a total inhibition of <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> This effect was dependent on both light intensity and quality. In in vitro cultured buds, the inductive effect {{of light on the}} growth of preformed leaves and SAM organogenic activity was inhibited by ancymidol and paclobutrazol, two effectors of GA biosynthesis. This effect was concentration-dependent, and negated by GA(3). However, GA(3) alone could not rescue <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in the dark. GA biosynthesis was also required for the expression and activity of a vacuolar invertase, and therefore for light-induced sugar metabolism within buds. These findings are evidence that GA biosynthesis contributes to the light effect on <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and lay the foundations of a better understanding of its exact role in plant branching...|$|R

40|$|European elms (Ulmus glabra Huds., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Ulmus minor Mill.) {{have been}} {{severely}} damaged {{and are still}} endangered by an alien hypervirulent pathogen, Ophiostoma ulmi s. l., agent of the Dutch elm disease (DED). Consequently, several ex situ clone collections have been established throughout Europe for elm breeding and conservation. In this paper we summarise the studies carried out within the EU project RESGEN CT 96 - 78, which launched the EU-coordinated evaluation of these collections. Our aim was to analyse the variation in timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and to acquire basic knowledge on the environmental control of this adaptive trait in European elms, under the hypothesis that DED susceptibility is related to spring phenology. The variation in the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date of European elms among collections and years was explained by a phenological model assuming that the thermal time required for <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> decreases exponentially with increasing chilling during winter down to a level where chilling requirement is fully met. According to the fitted curves, European elms have low dormancy and short chilling requirement for dormancy release. Although no simulation was performed, {{on the basis of}} the model applied we can hypothesise that under climate warming elms would flush earlier in most of Europe. The <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date was directly related to latitude and elevation in U. minor. The order of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of clones from different origins was stable among years. The observed geographic trends were largely determined by differences in chilling requirements that increased with latitude and elevation. Susceptibility to DED varied greatly within U. minor and was directly correlated with geographic origin and <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> date, southern and early flushing clones showing the least symptoms. Our results suggest that early flushing represents a mechanism of disease avoidance owing to asynchrony between host&# 8217;s susceptible period and time of natural infection by DED vectors (Scolytus). This escape mechanism, combined with true resistance and avoidance owing to unattractiveness for the vector&# 8217;s feeding, might be exploited for breeding DED-resistant clones of indigenous species...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} <b>Bud</b> <b>burst</b> is {{a crucial}} factor in plant architecture and is strongly induced by light. In Rosa sp., this light effect was correlated {{with the growth of}} axillary buds and RwMAX 1 and RwMAX 2 expression within buds. In this paper, we investigated whether strigolactone pathway is involved in the regulation of axillary bud in response to light intensity. Hence, young roses were subjected to two contrasting light intensity regimes: high/high and high/low. The phenotype was characterized in both conditions and the expression of RwMAX 1 and RwMAX 2 genes was measured in the basal, middle and apical parts of rose primary branch. Light treatments showed a strong impact on axillary bud. The percentage of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was severely reduced in the treatment high/low compared to the treatment high/high in all branch parts. In addition, the expression of RwMAX 1 and RwMAX 2 was strongly inhibited by high/high light regime and was conversely correlated with the rate of <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> In in vitro-grown axillary buds supplied with sucrose, glucose and fructose, RwMAX 1 expression was significantly stimulated whereas that of RwMAX 2 was significantly inhibited.

We therefore studied the impact of temporary water restriction or light limitation on the branching and development of rose bush axes. Rooted cuttings of Rosa hybrida ‘Radrazz’ were grown until the secondary axes had ceased to elongate, in a greenhouse for water experiment and in growth chambers for light experiment. During the water experiment, the irrigation threshold was maintained at − 8 kPa to ensure that water was not limiting until the primary axis reached the floral bud visible stage. Plants were then subjected to water restriction for 0, 7, 14, 21 or 35 days, with an irrigation threshold of − 26 kPa. They were then returned to the initial conditions and grown without water constraint until the end of the experiment. During the light experiment, plants subjected to light limitation were illuminated with low-intensity light (91 μmol m− 2 s− 1) from cutting <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> until the floral bud visible stage (16 days), or to the petal color visible stage (27 days). Plants were then placed at high light intensity (580 μmol m− 2 s− 1). Control plants were maintained continuously in high-light intensity conditions. We found that, during constraint, a similar number (water restriction) or fewer (light limitation) <b>buds</b> <b>burst</b> than in control plants. When constraints were released, <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> rapidly increased to levels + 41 – 54 % higher than those of control plants for water-restricted plants and + 34 – 45 % higher than those of control plants for light-limited plants.

Water limitation did not increase the number of flowering shoots despite the increase in <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> it induced, due to an increase in the number of blind shoots. Overall, our findings show, for the first time, that temporary water or light restrictions promote the branching and development of rose bush axes.

40|$|Key message: In mature black spruce, <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> {{process is}} {{anticipated}} by soil warming, while delayed by foliar applications of nitrogen; however, the effects depend on growth {{conditions at the}} site. Abstract: The observation of phenological events {{can be used as}} biological indicator of environmental changes, especially from the perspective of climate change. In boreal forests, the onset of the <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> is a key factor in the length of the growing season. With current climate change, the major factors limiting the growth of boreal trees (i. e., temperature and nitrogen availability) are changing and studies on mature trees are limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of soil warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition on <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> of mature black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP]. From 2008 onwards, an experimental manipulation of these environmental growth conditions was conducted in two stands (BER and SIM) at different altitudes in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. An increase in soil temperature (H treatment) and a canopy application of artificial rain enriched with nitrogen (N treatment) were performed. Observations of bud phenology were made during May–July 2012 and 2013. In BER, H treatment caused an anticipation (estimated as 1 – 3 days); while N treatment, a delay (estimated as 1 – 2 days but only in 2012) in <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> No treatments effect was significant in SIM.

Branches of the cultivars Aurora 1, Chimarrita, Chiripá, Coral, Eldorado, Granada, Leonense, Maciel, Marli, Premier, and Vanguard were collected between May and August 2008 at two locations: Curitiba and Lapa. The evaluation of dormancy was performed using a biological test of single node cuttings through the parameters: average time for <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> velocity of <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> final rate of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and rate of vigorous <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> For the tetrazolium test, 300 mg of buds was used and the color intensity readings were obtained using a spectrophotometer.

The most intense endodormancy cultivars found were: Chiripá, Leonense and Eldorado cultivars, and the weaker cultivars found were: Aurora 1 and Maciel. The tetrazolium test was efficient at estimating the intensity of dormancy in peach trees when the occurrence of cold was suitable for installation endodormancy.

40|$|Main {{conclusion}} Epigenetic memory {{affects the}} timing of <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> phenology and the expression of bud burstrelated genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes in a manner usually associated with ecotypes. In Norway spruce, a temperature-dependent epigenetic memory established during embryogenesis affects {{the timing of}} <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and <b>bud</b> set in a reproducible and predictable manner. We hypothesize that the clinal variation in these phenological traits, which is associated with adaptation to growth under frost-free conditions, has an epigenetic component. In Norway spruce, dehydrins (DHNs) {{have been associated with}} extreme frost tolerance. DHN transcript levels decrease gradually prior to flushing, a time when trees are highly sensitive to frost. Furthermore, EARLY BUD BREAK 1 genes (EBB 1) and the FT-TFL 1 - LIKE 2 -gene (PaFTL 2) were previously suggested to be implied in control of bud phenology. Here we report an analysis of transcript levels of 12 DHNs, 3 EBB 1 genes and FTL 2 in epitypes of the same genotype generated at different epitype-inducing temperatures, before and during spring <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Earlier flushing of epitypes originating from embryos developed at 18 C as compared to 28 C, was associated with differential expression of these genes between epitypes and between buds and last year’s needles. The majority of these genes showed significantly different expressions between epitypes in at least one time point. The general trend in DHN expression pattern in buds showed the expected reduction in transcript levels when approaching flushing, whereas, surprisingly, transcript levels peaked later in needles, mainly at the moment of <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Collectively, our results demonstrate that the epigenetic memory of temperature during embryogenesis affects <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> phenology and expression of the bud burst-related DHN, EBB 1 and FTL 2 genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes...|$|R

Resistant mature trees had a higher radial growth rate than susceptible trees, especially during periods of budworm defoliation.

Half-sib seedling progeny from resistant trees had larger stem diameter, height, and total biomass than progeny from susceptible trees.
