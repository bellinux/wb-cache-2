6000|$|Now, my dear friends, {{let me ask}} you as {{reasonable}} beings, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> hearing me or any man preach, {{can save}} your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sitting over a book for an hour a day, or all day long, will save your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins are washed away in Christ's blood, when they are there still, and you are committing them?

My object is to marry you, and I don't care twopence for the bridesmaids." [...] There was {{something}} so near to a compliment in this, that she was obliged to accept it. And she had, too, begun to perceive that Lord Llwddythlw was a man not easily made to change his mind. She was quite prepared for this in reference to her future life. A woman, she thought, might be saved much trouble by having a husband whom she was bound to obey. But in this matter of her marriage ceremony,--this last affair in which she might be presumed {{to act as a}} free woman,--she did think it hard that she might not be allowed to have her own way. The bridegroom, however, was firm. If Thursday, the 13th, did not suit her, he would be quite ready on Thursday, the 20th.

There's a coterie of German Jews in Paris living entirely upon consuls." [...] He hesitated for the fraction of a second, and resumed: [...] "Yes, monsieur; if you have papers that fit you, you can try six or seven consuls in a single town. You must know a language or two; {{but most of these}} gentlemen are not too well up in the tongues of the country they represent. Obtaining money under false pretences? Well, it is. But what's the difference at bottom between all this honourable crowd of directors, fashionable physicians, employers of labour, ferry-builders, military men, country priests, and consuls themselves perhaps, who take money and give no value for it, and poor devils who do the same at far greater risk? Necessity makes the law. If those gentlemen were in my position, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would hesitate?" ...|$|E

6000|$|And {{not only}} in the {{material}} and in the course, but yet more earnestly in the spirit of it, let a girl's education be as serious as a boy's. You bring up your girls as if they were meant for sideboard ornaments, and then complain of their frivolity. Give them the same advantages that you give their brothers--appeal to the same grand instincts of virtue in them; teach THEM, also, that courage and truth are the pillars of their being:- <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not answer that appeal, brave and true as they are even now, when you know that there is hardly a girls' school in this Christian kingdom where the children's courage or sincerity would be thought of half so much importance as their way of coming in at a door; and when the whole system of society, as respects the mode of establishing them in life, is one rotten plague of cowardice and imposture--cowardice, in not daring to let them live, or love, except as their neighbours choose; and imposture, in bringing, for the purposes of our own pride, the full glow of the world's worst vanity upon a girl's eyes, at the very period when the whole happiness of her future existence depends upon her remaining undazzled? ...|$|E
60|$|My Lords, I {{have one}} farther remark to make upon these accounts. The cabooleats, or {{agreements}} for the payments of these bribes, amount, {{in the three}} specified provinces, to 95,000l. Do you believe that these provinces were thus particularly favored? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were chosen as a little demesne for Mr. Hastings? {{that they were the}} only provinces honored with his protection, so far as to take bribes from them? Do you perceive anything in their local situation that should distinguish them from other provinces of Bengal? What is the reason why Dinagepore, Patna, Nuddea, should have the post of honor assigned them? What reason can be given for not taking bribes also from Burdwan, from Bissunpore, in short, from all the sixty-eight collections which comprise the revenues of Bengal, and for selecting only three? How came he, I say, to be so wicked a servant, that, out of sixty-eight divisions, he chose only three to supply the exigencies of the Company? He did not do his duty in making this distinction, if he thought that bribery was the best way of supplying the Company's treasury, and that it formed the most useful and effectual resource for them,--which he has declared over and over again. Was it right to lay the whole weight of bribery, extortion, and oppression upon those three provinces, and neglect the rest? No: you know, and must know, that he who extorts from three provinces will extort from twenty, if there are twenty. You have a standard, a measure of extortion, and that is all: ex pede Herculem: guess from thence what was extorted from all Bengal. Do you believe he could be so cruel to these provinces, so partial to the rest, as to charge them with that load, with 95,000l., knowing the heavy oppression they were sinking under, and leave all the rest untouched? You will judge of what is concealed from us by what we have discovered through various means that have occurred, in consequence both of the guilty conscience of the person who confesses the fact with respect to these provinces, and of the vigor, perseverance and sagacity of those who have forced from him that discovery. It is not, therefore, for me to say that the 100,000l. and 95,000l. only were taken. Where the circumstances entitle me to go on, I must not be stopped, but at the boundary where human nature has fixed a barrier.|$|E

5000|$|On April 26, 2006, Viswanathan {{appeared}} on NBC's The Today Show with Katie Couric. Viswanathan maintained her innocence, saying that {{any and all}} similarities were [...] "completely unconscious and unintentional" [...] and that she must have [...] "internalized McCafferty's words," [...] never deliberately meaning to [...] "take any." [...] She maintained, [...] "as I was writing, I genuinely believed that every single word I wrote was my own. I was so surprised and horrified when I found these similarities, when I heard about them over this weekend." [...] Asked about the plot similarities between Opal Mehta and McCafferty's novels, Viswanathan told Couric, “I wrote about what I knew, my personal experiences. I’m an Indian-American girl who got good grades, from New Jersey, who {{wanted to go to}} an Ivy League school, and I drew upon my own experiences, upon quirks of the people around me and my culture, to create my character Opal Mehta.” Viswanathan stated her intention to put an acknowledgement to McCafferty in the foreword of future printings of Opal Mehta, and said of McCafferty [...] "I hope that she can forgive me for whatever distress I’ve caused her." [...] Couric then asked, [...] "Do you think that's realistic ... given all the controversy surrounding James Frey and his book ... Or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>they</b> can forgive and forget?" [...] Viswanathan responded, [...] "I mean, that's what I'd hope that people can do. I hope that people who know me will believe that I'm telling the truth, that I've never been anything less than honest in my entire life, that I'm so horribly sorry for this mistake. But that's all it was, a completely unintentional mistake." ...|$|E

Could they even {{have the potential to}} reduce isolation and passivity and promote health and well-being for some of us? This anthology, the eighth in the Series from the Centre for Music and Health, presents a compilation of articles that explore the many intersections of music, health, technology and design. The first and largest part of the book includes articles deriving from the multidisciplinary research project called RHYME (www. rhyme. no). They engage with the study of the design, development, and use of digital and musical ‘co-creative tangibles’ for the potential health benefit of families with a child having physical or mental needs. Well-known international researchers broaden the picture on the book’s topic in the second part. They ask: How can video-based visualisation techniques of music-related body motion diagnose health problems? How can music therapy practice profit by digitalised improvisation analysis? What are the implications of gender and age in music technology for therapists and the people with whom they work? All together, this book supplies a broad perspective on its topic, which should be of interest to a wider audience. The Centre for Music and Health at the Norwegian Academy of Music was established in 2008. The centre conducts research and dissemination. Its goal is to develop knowledge about the connections between music and healt...|$|E
