30|$|Eastern {{white pine}} (Pinus strobus L.) is an ecologically and {{economically}} important softwood species that occurs {{throughout much of}} eastern North America (Wendel and Smith 1990). White pine was a dominant component of pre-settlement forests of eastern North America that is highly valued for its exceptional wood properties. The effects of large-scale <b>exploitive</b> <b>logging</b> and catastrophic fire in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, coupled with more recent institutional fire suppression and damage and mortality from {{white pine blister rust}} (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.), white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi (Peck)), and root rot fungi (Armillaria mellea (Vahl) P. Kumm) have dramatically reduced the abundance of white pine on the landscape (Abrams et al. 2000).|$|E
