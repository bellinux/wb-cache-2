40|$|In this paper, a self-adaptive flange is {{proposed}} for the wind turbine shrouded by a flanged diffuser to reduce the wind loads acting on the <b>flanged</b> diffuser <b>at</b> high wind velocities. The self-adaptive flange can maintain {{the advantages of the}} <b>flanged</b> diffuser <b>at</b> wind velocities lower than the rated velocity and reduce the wind loads acting on the diffuser and blades at higher wind velocities. Numerical analyses of fluid-structure interactions are carried out to investigate the flow field around the diffuser with a self-adaptive flange and the variation of wind load acting on the diffuser due to the reconfiguration of the self-adaptive flange at various wind velocities. Numerical results show that the wind load acting on the total flanged diffuser can be reduced by about 35 % at 60 m/s due to the reconfiguration of the self-adaptive flange. wind turbine; self-adaptive flange; diffuser; drag reduction; fluid-structure interactio...|$|R

500|$|... "A Forest" [...] is {{performed}} in the key of A minor. Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed {{by the introduction of}} the bass guitar and a second guitar part. The song initially follows an Am–C–F–Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains a B–C–F#m–C–B–C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word [...] "again", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a pentatonic manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at 4.46". The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s. Mike Hedges favored the use of <b>flanging</b> <b>at</b> the time, and he estimated that there were seven flanger devices used on [...] "A Forest". Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in [...] "A Forest" [...] "almost became a Smith trademark for a while". Simon Gallup said that his playing on the track was intended to be reminiscent of the bass work in the music of The Stranglers, whose bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel was a major influence on him.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHole flanges are {{important}} functional elements in many {{sheet metal parts}}. They provide stiffness, allow for positioning and fixation, they guide cables etc. Hole flanging operations in sheet metal parts are typically performed using dedicated tooling. Recent publications proved that hole flanging by incremental sheet forming (i. e. incremental hole flanging) is an interesting alternative to the traditional operations with dedicated tools. In incremental hole flanging, limit hole expansion ratios of up to 4 were observed which are {{much larger than the}} typical expansion ratios of around 2. In addition, the high flexibility of the incremental sheet forming process is maintained, i. e. flanges can be formed using a universal CNC-driven forming tool without dedicated tooling. However, deficits in terms of process time and geometric accuracy still limit the industrial application. This paper investigates the process limits of incremental hole flanging and proposes two new approaches aiming to reduce current deficits. The first one is an adaptive blank holder that acts {{in the vicinity of the}} forming tool and reduces unwanted secondary deformation that would lead to deviations from the target geometry. The second one is a new process set-up that makes it possible to perform incremental hole <b>flanging</b> operations <b>at</b> high speed. Using these approaches, the flexibility of incremental forming and its advantages regarding high formability can be exploited, while the typical disadvantages such as geometric inaccuracies and long process times can be minimized...|$|R

Knott also purchased this efficient and unique rail vehicle, the RGS Motor #3, which soldiers on at the GT&C on quieter days during the off-season - serving its original purpose when patronage does not justify hostling a steam engine to pull an entire train. It is [...] "kitbashed" [...] from its original Pierce-Arrow limousine frame, engine, radiator, cowling and body which was converted to rail use by replacing the front axle with a four-wheel bogie truck and fitting the rear axle with <b>flanged</b> wheels <b>at</b> first, then a bogie truck which linked the powered axle to its mate with a chain drive. A RGS shop-built freight box (converted with trolley seats for passenger service in 1950) articulates on the kingpin over the chain driven center truck. The wooden limousine sedan body was replaced after World War II with a 1939 Wayne military-surplus bus body with both left and right doors. Its Pierce-Arrow gasoline engine has been replaced, first with a war-surplus GMC gasoline engine at the RGS, then at Knott's with first a war-surplus in-line 6 cylinder Diamond-Reo gasoline engine, and since 1997 with a Cummins Diesel engine supported with an I-beam frame extension salvaged from the demolished Windjammer Surf Racers roller coaster.|$|R
50|$|After the 1962 {{closure of}} the {{southern}} portion of the line, a Mr. Charles Ashby purchased Droxford station {{and the right to}} run trains over the railway. He used it for testing a design of railbus that he had developed called the Sadler Rail Coach or 'Pacerailer'. Like the similarly named British Rail 'Pacer' of later years, this was essentially a bus-style vehicle. Unlike the later BR types, the Sadler Rail Coach used road-vehicle style pneumatic tyres on its drive wheels and <b>flanged</b> steel wheels <b>at</b> each end to guide it along the track. As well as the MVR itself, a special steep-gradient section of track was built for testing at Droxford. A company called Sadler Vectrail Ltd was established in 1966 to re-open the Ryde to Cowes railway on the Isle of Wight using Sadler Rail Coaches and the prototype vehicle appeared briefly at an Island Industries Fair but the scheme was unsuccessful.|$|R
40|$|Background: Oncologists {{today are}} greatly {{concerned}} about the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute leukemia. FLANG regimen, combination of novantron, cytarabine, fludarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, {{has been used in}} treatment of refractory/relapsed acute leukemia since 1990 s. The present study has evaluated mortality and response rate of this regimen. Materials and Methods: In this study, 25 patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia aged 15 - 55 years underwent <b>FLANG</b> regimen <b>at</b> Seyed-Al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan, Iran during 2008 - 2009. One month later, bone marrow samples were taken to evaluate the responsiveness to treatment. Participants were followed for a year. The data was analyzed by student-t and chi-square tests, logistic, and Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier curves in SPSS 19. Results: Out of the 25 patients, 8 patients (32 %) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5 refractory and 3 relapsed cases) and 17 subjects had acute myeloid leukemia (7 refractory and 10 relapsed cases). According to the bone marrow biopsies taken one month after FLANG regimen, 10 patients (40 %) had responded to treatment. Five patients of the 10 responders underwent successful bone marrow transplantation (BMT). On the other hand, 13 patients (52 %), who had not entered the CR period, died during the follow-up. Logistic regression analysis did not reveal any significant associations between disease type and responsiveness to treatment. Conclusion: This study indicated higher rates of unresponsiveness to treatment while its mortality rate was comparable with other studies. Overall, according to limitations for BMT (as the only chance for cure) in Iran, it seems that FLANG therapy is an acceptable choice for these patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] A cascade {{is defined}} as an {{infinite}} row of equidis-tant similarly aerofoil bodies. The cascade is used to divert a flow stream with a minimal loss. The flow over an axial cascade pre-sents a complicated intra blade fluid dynamic interaction that causes the flow to behave differently than the flow over a single aerofoil blade. A cascade tunnel in which different shapes of cas-cades could be tested for performance evaluation has been build. An axial flat plate cascade of 70 mm chord, 215 mm span and 0. 55 pitch chord ratio has been tested in this tunnel for evaluat-ing its aerodynamic performance. The distortion in the flow ahead of the cascade row was artificially created by using dis-torters of the outer size same as the {{cross section of the}} cascade tunnel and were fixed with the help of air tight <b>flanged</b> connec-tions <b>at</b> a location which was four chords ahead of the cascade. The distorters were made from honey comb sheets and were formed into cutouts of four shapes. The present study aims to investigate the effect of inlet flow distortion on the performance of an axial two dimensional cascade. The results depict that the Reynolds number, incidence and blade angle of the cascade con-trol the aerodynamic performance of the axial cascade. Further the experimental values of lift coefficient are less than that ob-tained using theory and the drag coefficients are more than the theoretical values. The aerodynamic parameters of the cascade, deflection, deviation, loss coefficients etc, have been found to depend on both the Reynolds number and the type of distortion.

40|$|Top of rail Friction Modifiers are {{designed}} to control frictional characteristics at the wheel-rail interface that influence noise, corrugations, and lateral forces. Key characteristics of the resulting thin film are 1) controlled intermediate coefficient of friction and 2) positive friction, to reduce roll-slip oscillations related to both curve squeal noise and short pitch corrugation development. Practical results are presented {{on the effect of}} friction modifiers on curve squeal and <b>flanging</b> noise generation <b>at</b> a range of European mass transit sites. Noise reductions ranging from 6. 3 to 22. 8 dBA were recorded, with an average reduction across the different test sites of 12. 0 dBA. Both top of rail squeal and flanging components of noise were reduced. The effect of friction modifier on short pitch corrugation development was evaluated over several years at two curves at Metro Bilbao. Under conditions where corrugations grew from 0. 01 mm to 0. 05 mm in eighteen months under baseline conditions, with application of friction modifier essentially no corrugation growth occurred in an equivalent time period. 1...|$|R

The swan-neck presternal catheter has a coiled intra-abdominal segment with a bead and a <b>flanged</b> cuff <b>at</b> the peritoneum; a titanium adapter joins the ab-dominal segment {{to the upper}} segment. The upper segment has two cuffs, one {{on either side of}} the presternal swan-neck segment. The present study evaluated the survival of Missouri presternal swan-neck PD catheters implanted at the University of Missouri–Columbia and followed at Dialysis Clin-ics, Inc., through 2006. Catheter type and inser-tion date were prospectively recorded. Survival was defined as the interval from insertion date to date of removal, censoring, or analysis. Catheters were censored for transplant, death, or transfer to an-other unit. A total of 131 presternal catheters were im-planted in 129 patients. Mean patient age was 60. 9 ± 16. 3 years. No catheters were removed during the first 3 months for either infection or technical prob-lems. One catheter was removed at 6 months for mal-position and another at 2 years for an external leak; all other catheter losses were attributable to perito-nitis. Cumulative catheter survival was 93. 5 %, 82. 5 %, 63. 9 %, and 60. 0 % at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years respectively. The mean observation period was 19. 7 ± 17. 8 months, and the longest catheter sur-vival was 87. 5 months. New episodes of peritonitis were 91 in number, a rate of 1 episode per 28 patient– months.

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} model, using the STAR-CD software, has been developed to simulate fluid flow in a commonly used <b>flanged</b> ball valve <b>at</b> different partially open settings. The Reynolds number (Re) range for the flow simulations was varied between 105 and 106 to simulate a variety of flow conditions. Each flow Re number is studied with three open positions for the valve, i. e., fully open, two-thirds open, and one-third open. The simulation was used to calculate two important parameters used in characterizing the flow properties in a typical valve namely the loss coefficient, K, and the flow coefficient, Cv. An attempt was also made to compare some of the simulation results with experimental data and available American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) data on valves. The simulations agree reasonably well with recently published experimental results and indicate that {{in most cases the}} K factor is independent of Re. The ASHRAE data for K factor values showed similar trends to the simulation but with lower values as it was only reported for gates valves.
