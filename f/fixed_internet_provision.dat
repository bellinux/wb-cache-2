40|$|As the <b>fixed</b> {{and mobile}} <b>Internet</b> are converging, the {{question}} emerges whether consumers expect mobile Internet services to replicate services they {{know from the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>Internet.</b> Literature on reinforcement and displacement suggests {{that the use of}} new media depends on whether users are inclined to replace or reinforce their existing media use on a new device. This paper analyzes whether the importance that users attribute to using similar services on their mobile phone as on the <b>fixed</b> <b>Internet</b> can explain the intention to adopt mobile services. Specifically, we investigate if such fixed-mobile reinforcement could mediate the impact of personal innovativeness and several dimensions of context. We compare basic Internet services, entertainment services and transaction services. We find that especially the intention to adopt basic Internet services largely depends on the importance of using similar services in the mobile domain as on the <b>fixed</b> <b>Internet.</b> Several context-of-use predictors are partially or even fully mediated by fixed-mobile reinforcement. The results convey a positive message to operators that are betting on converged multimedia services that can be accessed from any device and from any fixed or mobile networ...|$|R

High-bandwidth Internet will be provided through a national broadband network to be rolled out gradually and which began in 2011. The framework is based around four key aspects: (1) identifying provision of the national broadband network as an intervention, (2) specifi cation of important outcomes, (3) understanding the behavioural link between intervention and outcomes and (4) conduct of high-quality population-based empirical research. The framework is suffi ciently fl exible {{that it can be}} adapted and applied to various regions of Australia and, depending on the appropriate focus, to the conduct of different types of studies. It is hoped that, by focusing attention on the human behav- ioural link between high-bandwidth <b>Internet</b> <b>provision</b> and individual outcomes in the general community, {{we will be able to}} identify ways of promoting social inclusion and other benefi ts through appropriate use of the national broadband network...|$|R

40|$|Mobile devices {{facilitate}} {{the use of}} mobile services {{that are similar to}} services used via <b>fixed</b> <b>Internet</b> connections. The objective {{of this article is to}} assess displacement effects between <b>fixed</b> and mobile <b>Internet</b> services, and to research the role of technical capabilities of mobile handsets and demographics as moderators. This study is based on a sample of 628 respondents who have access to <b>fixed</b> and mobile <b>Internet</b> services. The respondents' usage of services was analyzed. An online questionnaire was used to collect data on the use of information, communication, entertainment, and transaction services. Mobile Internet reinforces, rather than replaces, Internet usage. When people possess an iPhone® or (mobile) laptop, this reinforcement effect is present for entertainment services. With respect to transaction services, the Blackberry® makes a stronger case. With the exception of gender, demographic characteristics do not have a moderating effect. Women display a stronger reinforcement effect than men in relation to transaction services. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the displacement effects of <b>fixed</b> <b>Internet</b> services by the mobile handset. This empirical study contributes to the literature regarding the displacement effects of mobile Internet service...|$|R
