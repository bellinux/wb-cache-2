40|$|Shareholders in {{corporations}} face {{two very}} different types of governance problems: <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> controlling shareholders or managers; and <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> greedy rulers or, more generally, by the state. The {{problem is that the}} more successful investors are in protecting their capital from the grabbing hand of the state, the less they are able to call upon the state to protect it from the grabbing hand of corporate insiders. Conversely, the more investors are able to call upon government to restrain insiders, the more they are vulnerable to <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> the state. Although the terms of this tradeoff have changed over time as modern democratic polities replaced absolutist monarchies, both types of threats are still very much with us. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of law on foreign direct {{investment}} outflows with a specific interest in the relationship between international investment law and domestic private property laws. Our results indicate that FDI investor is indifferent to host country property rights, hence shareholder protection by law is not a significant determinant of FDI outflows. We argue that FDI, in contrast with other types of capital flows, can effectively mitigate the agency problem through majority ownership and control, hence reduce exposure to ex-post <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> the affiliate. On the other hand, FDI investor remains exposed to risk of <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> the host government and is strongly sensitive to the enforcement of law in the host country. In contrast with recent literature we conclude that there are no causal relationship between bilateral investment treaties and FDI...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new measure of legal {{protection}} of minority shareholders against <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> corporate insiders: the anti-self-dealing index. Assembled {{with the help}} of Lex Mundi law firms, the index is calculated for 72 countries based on legal rules prevailing in 2003, and focuses on private enforcement mechanisms, such as disclosure, approval, and litigation, governing a specific self-dealing transaction. This theoretically-grounded index predicts a variety of stock market outcomes, and generally works better than the commonly used index of anti-director rights. ...|$|R

25|$|Differences in {{property}} {{rights have been}} cited as a possible cause of the Great Divergence. This view states that Asian merchants could not develop and accumulate capital {{because of the risk}} of state expropriation and claims from fellow kinsmen, which made property rights very insecure compared to those of Europe. However, others counter that many European merchants were de facto expropriated through defaults on government debt, and that the threat of <b>expropriation</b> <b>by</b> Asian states was not much greater than in Europe, except in Japan.|$|R
