40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of soft tissue composition on dose distribution and spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) characteristics in proton therapy. Subjects and Methods: Proton beams with nominal energies of 70, 120 and 210 MeV were considered. The soft tissues and tissue <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> implemented in this study are: 9 -component soft tissue, 4 -component soft tissue, adipose tissue, muscle (skeletal), lung tissue, breast tissue, A- 150 tissue equivalent plastic, perspex and water. Each material was separately defined inside a 20 cm × 20 cm × 40 cm phantom. A multilayer phantom was evaluated as well. The effect of tissue composition on the relative dose in SOBP region (relative to the dose in SOBP region in water), range of SOBP, length of SOBP, and uniformity index of SOBP was evaluated. Results: Various soft tissues and tissue <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> have shown different dose level in SOBPs, ranges of SOBPs, lengths of SOBPs and uniformity indices. Conclusions: Based on the obtained results, various soft tissues and tissue <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> have quite different SOBP characteristics. Since in clinical practice with proton therapy, only the range of SOBP is corrected for various tissues, omission of the above effects may result in major discrepancies in proton beam radiotherapy.

Variation in value of EABF was due to dominance of different interaction processes in different energy regions. Bee Wax has the maximum EABF and EBF at 0. 08 MeV and all the samples except Vitamin A 1 have maximum EBF at 0. 1 MeV.

5000|$|A Wolter {{telescope}} is a telescope for X-rays using only grazing incidence optics. Visible light telescopes are built with either lenses or parabolic mirrors at nearly normal incidence (that is, a nearly perpendicular angle of reflection). Neither {{works well for}} X-rays. Lenses for visible light are made of a transparent material with an index of refraction substantially different from one, {{but there is no}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>material</b> for x-rays. Conventional mirror telescopes work poorly in the X-rays as well, since the light hits the mirrors at near-normal incidence, where the X-rays are transmitted or absorbed, not reflected.X-rays mirrors can be built, but only if the angle from the plane of reflection is very low (typically 10 arc-minutes to 2 degrees). [...] These are called glancing (or grazing) incidence mirrors. In 1952, Hans Wolter outlined three ways a telescope could be built using only this kind of mirror. [...] These are called Wolter telescopes of type I, II, and III. Each has different advantages and disadvantages.Wolter's key discovery was that by using two mirrors it is possible to create a telescope with a usably wide field of view.

5000|$|Production of Benjarong is {{a process}} known to only small {{communities}} of Thai artists which have passed down the knowledge from generation to generation. The artisan who makes Benjarong {{has to be very}} skillful and careful. The production process is needs a skilled labor. How the Benjarong is made and how the patterns are painted, are glamorous and all considered as the masterpieces. In the porcelain selection, only white porcelain (Bone China and Royal Porcelain) which had been fired at the proper temperature (1150-1280 degree Celsius) for many hours, are selected. White ware must not have any flaw. After we get all required white wares, cleaning is the next process. During this process, it is necessary to avoid oily surface from sweaty and dirty hand. In drawing process, we use hypodermic syringe or paint brush to draw line. The process begins with drawing the circular guide lines on the Thai porcelain on a turning wheel, which is manually controlled. While drawing on the design, the artist will keep the sample pattern in front of him so he can draw the pattern correctly. The initial pattern drawing is very crucial to how the design will turn out, so it will be done by the well-experienced artist (usually drawn by a master craftsman). This is the reason why the pattern is drawn in very fine lines on each Benjarong. In painting process, there are various colors of paint but basically we use five main colors (black, green, yellow, red and white). The specialized paint for Benjarong needs a skillful painter. The paint is made from mineral colors and must be well crushed and mixed with water in proper ratio. The crushing equipment is ceramic or <b>equivalent</b> <b>material</b> mortar. The paint should not be too thick or thin. If the paint is too thick, it will not be completely fired and the color will not be shown as expected. If the paint is too thin, the color will fade. Also, the paint must not overlap with any line of the other color. At the final stage of painting, the 18 karat gold might be added to the rims {{in order to make it}} look glamorous. The next step after painting is firing. Painted wares will be put in the kiln. The spaces between them are 0.5 - 1 cm unless you want the painted wares to touch each other and might get damaged to pattern that painted after firing. The temperature in the kiln is controlled between 800 to 1000◦C and takes about 10 hours firing time. The Benjarong must be put in the kiln five times. After finished firing, the Benjarong will be cooled down; then take it off from the kiln. Once the Benjarong has been fired, it can be seen as three dimensional bubble of paint on the surface, which is the reason why Benjarong is unique. At the end of production, there will a quality control. The slightest mistake in any process would ruin the design and fame of Benjarong. Any mistake is unacceptable. Benjarong supposed to be perfect in every respect. If the mistake is found, it will be sent back to the studio or might throw it away. In fact, this is very rare to happen because during each stage the artists take good care of each individual piece. (Blobiztar Company Limited) ...|$|E
