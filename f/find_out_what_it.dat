Songwriter Thom Yorke began recording The Eraser, his first solo release, with longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich in late 2004, and continued work throughout 2005 between Radiohead sessions.

Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. [...] "Video game journalism is just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover.

In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist, Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists [...] "regurgitating" [...] it.
