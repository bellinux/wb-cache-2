25|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> strongly, {{after my}} {{subcommittee}} has carefully and objectively reviewed this case from both sides, that injustice rather than justice has been served. The Moon case sends a strong signal that if one's views are unpopular enough, {{this country will}} find a way not to tolerate, but to convict. I don't believe that you or I or anyone else, no matter how innocent, could realistically prevail against the combined forces of our Justice Department and judicial branch in a case such as Reverend Moon's.|$|E
500|$|Dixon has {{described}} herself and other celebrities {{as having a}} [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to do good works, when asked by The Observers Elizabeth Day. Speaking in August 2010 to Blues & Soul Dixon said: [...] "Being {{in the entertainment industry}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> I have a responsibility that comes with my fame".|$|E
500|$|I am {{very much}} pleased {{that you like}} that coin. [...] I shall {{have all kinds of}} trouble over it, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> what you say is true: [...] that is, that it is the best coin that has been struck for two {{thousand}} years, and that no matter what is its temporary fate, it will {{serve as a model for}} future coin makers, and that eventually the difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted.|$|E

500|$|We used to {{get more}} {{negative}} reactions when [...] didn't have as loud of stuff. [...] It's just, be super loud and you're all set. [...] (laughs) The rock and roll has been revealed. [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> that that's the message - if there's any message, that's what it is. [...] This is kinda what we do to keep ourselves excited these days. [...] In these days - everyone knows what I'm talking about. (laughs) ...|$|E
500|$|Stoppelman has a {{hands-on}} management style. Instead of a corner office, {{he has a}} desk among his employees. In a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), {{when asked about the}} single most important management technique he'd learned and where, he said [...] "This one I got from PayPal, but I'm a strong believer in doing 1 on 1 meetings with each of my reports every week. Sometimes I feel like the company's psychiatrist, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> like listening to people and hearing about their problems (personal and professional) cleans out the cobwebs and keeps the organization humming.” ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E

500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I still think we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you know, no one really dies in The X-Files [...] But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a laugh or smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk off into the sunset without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was glad we were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> all <b>I</b> {{could to}} make her like me. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> rather like a usurper, you know. I tried {{to make her}} see that I didn't at all want to put on airs.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must speak}} for {{yourself}} about a confession," [...] said Fan. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> {{sorry to see}} how cast down poor Captain Horton looked before going away." ...|$|R

500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E
2500|$|Down manager James McCartan {{paid tribute}} to Cork [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> Cork were deserving winners on the day. We've no qualms about that at all". He also {{expressed}} pride in his own players. Down forward Danny Hughes said: [...] "Well, none {{of us want to}} be one-hit wonders. There are a lot of young lads that came in this year, and there is a great development squad coming through. But we know these days don't happen every year, making All-Ireland finals. Hopefully this will make them hungrier, going forward into next year".|$|E
2500|$|During his {{month in}} jail, Brown {{was allowed to}} send and receive correspondence. One of the letters was from Mahala Doyle, wife and mother of three of Brown's Kansas victims. She wrote [...] "Altho' vengeance is not mine, I confess that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> gratified to hear that you were stopped in your fiendish career at Harper's Ferry ..." [...] In a {{postscript}} she added [...] "My son John Doyle whose life I beged of you is now grown up and is very desirous to be in Charlestown {{on the day of}} your execution." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{then that}} 'apology' you made her. Well, {{you were a}} handful, in all conscience, Anne. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> so puzzled and bewildered how to manage you. Matthew {{understood}} you better." ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Boucher and McComas felt [...] "the {{stories of the}} Viagens Interplanetarias have usually struck us as pretty routine work unworthy of L. Sprague de Camp, but devotees of the series will welcome the {{collected}} volume." [...] Groff Conklin assessed it as a [...] "cream-puff-light book of space opera ... ine stuff for bedtime, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> that the stories were written with the left hind paw of an immensely brilliant fellow who just wasn't trying hard. Perhaps we should call it 'relentlessly light reading!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Until 1936, {{principles}} of staff recruitment, told by Keswick, remained Scottish first, Oxbridge second. [...] "With all due {{deference to the}} 'east coast of England' [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> that men from {{north of the border}} are the most suitable for our routine business... I am very keen on keeping the Scottish entity of the Firm. But I hope I have not conveyed that I have swung against the University man... I merely consider that he must be aided and abettered by the solid, plodding type from Scotland." ...|$|E
2500|$|An won {{his second}} {{national}} title and successfully {{qualified for the}} 2016 Olympics as Korea's half-lightweight representative. He successfully qualified as the number one ranked half-lightweight fighter in both the world and Olympic qualification rankings, and as the national tournament winner. He defeated his opponent in the final with sankaku jime for ippon. Tipped {{to be the one}} to beat for gold at Rio, An has said, “I’m obviously one of the best-ranked judokas in the world... people are expecting a lot of me. I wouldn’t say that I’m not feeling the pressure, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> very proud to be part of the national team.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, Ethel. When you implored {{me to give}} up my Crimean notion, {{to spare}} your father pain, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> for once that you at least thought me of value to some one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew as much! I knew as much! And {{yet he is}} easy, Greenly!--nay, even seems happy. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> {{a little}} hope that this absence from {{suffering}} might be a favourable omen." ...|$|R
2500|$|Beyond the macroscopic, Turner has {{admitted}} that this album is more personal than previous releases. “This record {{is a lot}} more organic [...] to me. It indeed {{is a lot more}} focused {{in a way that it}} is a lot more coherent than Oceanic was. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> that it has a wider emotional feel because it is a lot more personal stuff of myself behind it in the content. I don't really know how this comes across in the music. There is a lot more things in it that I was dealing with while writing the record and since, let's say Celestial for instance. It's hard to say actually.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson dislikes the British car brand Rover, {{the last}} major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view {{stretched}} back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing {{the history of the}} company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated [...] "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many," [...] citing issues with the rack and pinion steering system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the [...] "uncool" [...] brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars. On its demise, Clarkson stated [...] "I cannot even get teary and emotional about the demise of the company itself – though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for the workforce." [...] Clarkson has also expressed hatred for the Toyota Prius.|$|E
2500|$|Promotion on {{the album}} ended soon after its December release and Norwood {{subsequently}} started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with her were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Human collaborator Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with Humans commercial performance, Norwood told Blues & Soul magazine she was [...] "a little disappointed about that" [...] but also felt [...] "pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel they're totally behind. In hindsight <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since Human – and hopefully they're changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep stuff off my chest, I'm now able to really tap into the fun part of music again [...] it's exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Good sailor!” {{he replied}} {{in answer to}} a mild young man’s envious query; “well, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> a little queer once, I confess. It was off Cape Horn. The vessel was wrecked the next morning.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in this weather, surely," [...] {{retorted}} Macnab, [...] "and if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> coldish in the circumstances, couldn't I borrow Spooner's blanket-capote? {{it might}} fit me then, for I'd {{probably be a}} few sizes smaller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rube laughed. 'I am {{big enough}} {{to get out of}} it if it does, Seth; but you know <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> {{uncommon}} soft toward Pepita, and really thought of marrying and taking her back to Missouri.' ...|$|R
