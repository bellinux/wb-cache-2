In this paper, the {{deformation}} behaviour of a Ti 3 Al-based <b>intermetallic</b> <b>alloy</b> in laser bending was investigated for the first time. Experimental findings revealed that due to differential thermal expansion of the <b>intermetallic</b> <b>alloy</b> across the thickness, it could be deformed by a CO 2 laser.

40|$|FeAl based <b>intermetallic</b> <b>alloys</b> {{are being}} {{proposed}} as engineering materials for high temperature applications {{due to their}} low density, low materials cost, low content of strategic elements and oxidation resistance. These <b>intermetallic</b> <b>alloys</b> are suitable for applications in aggressive and corrosive environments up to 900 °C. However they may fail through loss of strength or gradually deteriorate through reaction with the surrounding atmosphere when exposed to temperature higher than 900 °C.

In this research, the FeAl alloys were produced by using powder metallurgy route which consisted of mechanical alloying process, cold compaction. sintering, hot compaction and surface treatment via ion implantation. The addition of reactive elements or their oxides such as Y, Y 20 3 and Ce 02 by mechanical alloying or ion implantation method may improve their oxidation resistance through the enhancement of the alumina scale adhesion to the underlying alloys.
