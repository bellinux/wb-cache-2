5|$|On November 24, 1835, Blackburn {{married his}} distant cousin, Ella Gist Boswell. Boswell's father, Dr. Joseph Boswell, {{had died in}} the Lexington cholera {{epidemic}} a year earlier. The couple's only child, son Cary Bell Blackburn, was born in 1837. Just before Cary's birth, Blackburn invested heavily in the <b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> and bagging industry and suffered a significant financial loss when the business venture subsequently failed. In 1843, Blackburn was elected as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives and served a single, undistinguished term. He did not seek re-election, and in 1844, he and his younger brother opened a medical practice in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Strict discipline: While marching {{about the}} countryside, he never let his troops destroy fields or to pillage towns or villages. He made them pay {{a fair price}} for goods and made sure crops {{remained}} intact. A soldier once stole a <b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> from a peasant so he could tie a bale of hay with it. When Yue discovered this, he questioned the soldier and had him executed.|$|E

This site became the new {{headquarters}} of the Messrs Enderby company. There they built a ropewalk and a factory, known as Enderby's <b>Hemp</b> <b>Rope</b> Works, for the production of sail canvas and rope from hemp and flax.|$|E

500|$|After Hart's {{return to}} Lexington, he read law under Henry Clay, passed the bar, {{and set up}} a law {{practice}} in the city. [...] Like his father, he became a successful businessman, a ropewalk (<b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> factory) in the city being among his ventures. Hemp was a commodity crop of central Kentucky. [...] In April 1809, Hart married Anna Edward Gist, the stepdaughter of General Charles Scott, governor of Kentucky, and daughter of Judith Cary Gist Scott and her late husband General Nathaniel Gist. [...] Hart and Anna had two sons, Thomas Hart Jr. and Henry Clay Hart. [...] On January 7, 1812, Hart duelled with Samuel E. Watson at a location on the Indiana side of the Ohio River, near where Silver Creek emptied into the river. This was the site where Henry Clay had duelled with fellow state legislator Humphrey Marshall in 1809.|$|E
500|$|The first railway ('The Commercial Railway') to be built, in 1840, was a {{passenger}} service based on cable haulage by stationary steam engines {{that ran the}} [...] from Minories to Blackwall {{on a pair of}} tracks. It required [...] of <b>hemp</b> <b>rope,</b> and 'dropped' carriages as it arrived at stations, which were reattached to the cable for the return journey, and the train 'reassembling' itself at the terminus. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1859, and steam locomotives adopted. The building of London termini at Fenchurch Street (1841), and Bishopsgate (1840) provided access to new suburbs across the River Lea, again resulting in the destruction of housing and increased overcrowding in the slums. [...] After the opening of Liverpool Street station (1874), Bishopsgate railway station became a goods yard, in 1881, to bring imports from Eastern ports. With the introduction of containerisation, the station declined, suffered a fire in 1964 that destroyed the station buildings, and it was finally demolished in 2004 for the extension of the East London Line. In the 19th century, the area north of Bow Road became a major railway centre for the North London Railway, with marshalling yards and a maintenance depot serving both the City and the West India docks. Nearby Bow railway station opened in 1850 and was rebuilt in 1870 in a grand style, featuring a concert hall. The line and yards closed in 1944, after severe bomb damage, and never reopened, as goods became less significant, and cheaper facilities were concentrated in Essex.|$|E
5000|$|Cable Street {{started as}} a {{straight}} path along which <b>hemp</b> <b>ropes</b> were twisted into ships cables (i.e. ropes). These supplied the many ships that would anchor in the nearby Pool of London, between London Bridge and Wapping and Rotherhithe.

2500|$|<b>Hemp</b> <b>rope</b> {{was used}} in the age of sailing ships, though the rope had to be {{protected}} by tarring, since <b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> has a propensity for breaking from rot, as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior, while seeming dry from the outside. Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname [...] "Jack Tar". <b>Hemp</b> <b>rope</b> was phased out when Manila, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as Manila hemp, but is not related to hemp; it is abacá, a species of banana.|$|E
2500|$|The railway's first steam {{locomotive}} arrived in 1841 {{in the shape}} of [...] Peak, built by Robert Stephenson and Company. By 1860 the line had six more locomotives gradually displacing the horses. Because the inclines were too steep for adhesion traction by these early locomotives, they were hauled up and down the inclines, along with their trains, by static steam engines. <b>Hemp</b> <b>rope</b> or chain, initially used for hauling trains, was later replaced by steel cables.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{important}} {{changes were made}} to the railroad. [...] When originally built in 1829, iron chains were used to move the cars up and down the planes. [...] Frequently the chains broke with catastrophic effect, so blacksmith forges were maintained beside the planes in order to facilitate repairs. [...] It was soon found that <b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> performed better than the chains, and all planes were converted to rope. [...] In 1858, the hemp ropes were replaced with wire rope that had been manufactured by the Roebling company. [...] Also during those improvements the strap iron rails were replaced with T rail.|$|E
50|$|The Mooloolaba and Aztlan were moored on the Richmond River, {{although}} {{they began to}} break apart as the <b>hemp</b> <b>ropes</b> disintegrated. As crew and supporters returning to re-tie them, {{it was discovered that}} Mooloolaba had largely disintegrated, with her mast, sail and many of her logs having floated away. the Aztlan was secured, and given a place on dry land a few months later by the Ballina Shire Council.|$|R

2500|$|Roebling began {{producing}} {{wire rope}} at Saxonburg in 1841. At that time canal boats from Philadelphia were transported over the Allegheny Mountains on railroad cars {{in order to}} access waterways {{on the other side}} of the mountains, so that the boats could continue to Pittsburgh. The system of inclines and levels that moved the boats and [...] conventional railroad cars was a state-owned enterprise, the Allegheny Portage Railroad. The railroad cars were pulled up and down the inclines by a long loop of thick <b>hemp</b> <b>rope,</b> up to 7centimeters thick. The hemp ropes were expensive and had to be replaced frequently. Roebling remembered an article he had read about wire ropes. Soon after, he started developing a 7-strand wire rope at a ropewalk that he built on his farm.|$|E
2500|$|Penn 's {{commanding}} officer, Commander J.H. Swain RN, offered Captain Mason a tow {{with a heavy}} 10-inch manila <b>hemp</b> <b>rope.</b> With the {{tow line}} in place, Penn moved ahead, straining its engines to the limit; Ohio continued to list to port. The two ships were not making any progress, even drifting backwards due to the easterly wind. Now both ships were sitting ducks, and as another serious attack developed, the destroyer went to full speed to part the tow. A German bomber dived on the tanker and was shot down by Ohio 's gunners, but just before its demise, the aircraft's crew released its cargo. A bomb hit the tanker just where the initial torpedo had hit her, effectively breaking her back, just as night was setting in. The ship was abandoned for the night. The day after, Penn was joined by the minesweeper [...] The two ships towed the tanker and succeeded in making up to five knots, overcoming the tendency to swing to port. Another attack blasted the group of ships, snapping the tow lines and immobilising Ohios rudder. Another bomb hit the fore end of the front deck, forcing the engineers out of the engine room. Once more, Mason gave the order to abandon ship, as two more air attacks narrowly missed the tanker. A superficial examination showed that the rent that had developed in the amidships section had widened and that the ship had indeed almost certainly broken her back.|$|E

He knew that his master was slow to forgive those whose carelessness thwarted any plan, and that, while taking the easier way over instead of crawling round a ledge, he had probably alarmed the fugitive. He reached {{the foot of the}} ladder. Climbing up in a desperate hurry, he cast loose the end of the tackle by means of which the cable was set up taut, but neglected in his haste to take a turn with the <b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> about a post, which would have eased him of most of the strain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} built in 1889 by George Grant Mackay, a Scottish civil engineer and park commissioner for Vancouver.

60|$|Lister agreed. The thick <b>hemp</b> <b>rope</b> {{stretched}} and absorbed the strain; the wire was less elastic. They were approaching Carmel Point, and Holyhead was not far, {{but they must}} front the gale when they got round the corner. In the meantime, the engines were running smoothly, and Lister smoked and waited while the sea got worse. Flashing lights ahead and the violent lurching indicated that they crept round the point. Then Terrier plunged into a white sea and deck and bulwarks vanished. Her bows swung out of the foam and Lister ran to the door. He felt the tug leap forward and knew the rope had gone.|$|E
