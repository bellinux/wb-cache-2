5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing <b>field</b> <b>will</b> tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|While the Sounders {{currently}} play on FieldTurf, CenturyLink Field {{has previously}} had temporary natural grass installed for international soccer events. In 2012, an updated FieldTurf surface was installed and certified by FIFA with a 2-star quality rating, {{the highest possible}} rating. If an MLS rule change requires natural grass playing surfaces, the <b>field</b> <b>will</b> be permanently replaced with natural grass.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer <b>field</b> <b>will</b> be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E

50|$|Holography is the {{two-step process}} of {{recording}} a diffracted light field scattered from an object, and performing image rendering. This {{process can be}} achieved with traditional photographic plates or with a digital sensor array, in digital holography. If the recorded field is superimposed on the 'live field' scattered from the object, the two <b>fields</b> <b>will</b> be identical. If, however, a small deformation {{is applied to the}} object, the relative phases of the two light <b>fields</b> <b>will</b> alter, and it is possible to observe interference. This technique is known as live holographic interferometry.|$|R
25|$|Club cricket {{is played}} {{extensively}} in cricketing nations, {{and also by}} immigrants from cricketing nations. Club cricket most often takes place on a natural grass wicket, often maintained by the players themselves, although at a lower level it may take place on an artificial turf pitch, though the rest of actual <b>field</b> <b>will</b> be natural grass.|$|E
25|$|Curie's law {{is valid}} under the {{commonly}} encountered conditions of low magnetization (μBH ≲ kBT), {{but does not}} apply in the high-field/low-temperature regime where saturation of magnetization occurs (μBH ≳ kBT) and magnetic dipoles are all aligned with the applied field. When the dipoles are aligned, increasing the external <b>field</b> <b>will</b> not increase the total magnetization since {{there can be no}} further alignment.|$|E
25|$|From the {{perspective}} of an onboard observer, the crew will feel a gravitational field opposite the engine's acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear to fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As part of this, distances between objects {{in the direction of}} the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational <b>field</b> <b>will</b> be reversed.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrostatic}} {{electron spectrometer}} uses the electric field, which cause electrons to move along field gradients, whereas magnetic devices cause electrons {{to move at}} right angles to the <b>field.</b> Magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>will</b> act in a direction perpendicular to the electron propagation, thereby conserving velocity, whereas electrostatic <b>fields</b> <b>will</b> cause electrons to move along the field gradient, which may change electron energies if the component of the direction of propagation and field gradients are not perpendicular. Owing to these effects, sector based designs are commonly used in electron spectrometers.|$|R

25|$|A {{star with}} a {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> <b>will</b> generate a magnetosphere that extends outward {{into the surrounding}} space. Field lines from this field originate at one magnetic pole on the star then end at the other pole, forming a closed loop. The magnetosphere contains charged particles that are trapped from the stellar wind, which then move along these field lines. As the star rotates, the magnetosphere rotates with it, dragging along the charged particles.|$|E
25|$|The {{progressive}} {{nature of}} {{and lack of}} a definitive cure for Retinitis Pigmentosa contribute to the inevitably discouraging outlook for patients with this disease. While complete blindness is rare, the patient's visual acuity and visual <b>field</b> <b>will</b> continue to decline as initial rod photoreceptor and later cone photoreceptor degradation proceeds. Possible treatments remain in the research and clinical trial stages; however, treatment studies concerning visual restoration in Retinitis Pigmentosa prove promising for the future.|$|E
25|$|When the {{electric}} current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic <b>field</b> <b>will</b> experience {{this change in}} magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, d ΦB / d t. Therefore, an electromotive force is {{set up in the}} second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.|$|E

25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic <b>field</b> <b>will</b> separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the <b>field</b> <b>will</b> appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E
25|$|Z-pinch {{is based}} on the fact that plasmas are {{electrically}} conducting. Running a current through the plasma, will generate a magnetic field around the plasma. This <b>field</b> <b>will,</b> according to Lenz's law, create an inward directed force that causes the plasma to collapse inward, raising its density. Denser plasmas generate denser magnetic fields, increasing the inward force, leading to a chain reaction. If the conditions are correct, this can lead to the densities and temperatures needed for fusion. The difficulty is getting the current into the plasma, which would normally melt any sort of mechanical electrode. A solution emerges again because of the conducting nature of the plasma; by placing the plasma in the middle of an electromagnet, induction can be used to generate the current.|$|E
