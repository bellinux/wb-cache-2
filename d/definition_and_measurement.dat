A multidisciplinary scientific literature review was conducted to collect <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> operations of data accuracy. These <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> operations were analysed and coded by a content analysis. It was found that there is a reasonable consensus that data accuracy, for both a single data item and multiple data items, is related to one specific notion, namely the magnitude of an error. This study adds to the knowledge base by identifying a notion of data accuracy that is considerably well-agreed upon, such that it can serve as a foundation for a precise <b>definition</b> of <b>and</b> a justification for a measure of data accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Despite all the {{developments}} {{and changes in}} the conceptualization of social competence throughout the 20th century, there was still a general lack of agreement about the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> of social competence during the 1980s.

40|$|Aims In {{order to}} measure the {{effectiveness}} of interventions claiming to improve adherence in diabetes, valid measurement of adherence is necessary. Any measurement must first {{be based on a}} definition. This study aimed to identify <b>and</b> categorize <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurements</b> of adherence in living with diabetes, from a review of the literature. Methods Publications were identified from the MEDLINE database. Adherence, compliance and concordance were used as terms in the search algorithm, along with diabetes, diabetes mellitus and treatment. Two hundred and ninety-three papers were identified. Abstracts of these papers were read by two researchers independently. Two hundred and thirty-nine papers did not contain definitions or measures of adherence and were discarded. Of the remaining 54 papers, 26 included <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> 46 described <b>measurements</b> of adherence. Results <b>Definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurements</b> fell into five categories: coincidence of behaviour with professional advice, relationship as {{part of the process of}} care, outcome and process targets, taking the medication as prescribed and others. No single definition of adherence emerged. Many authors did not provide definitions of adherence. Glycated haemoglobin was the most common measurement of adherence, although this can raise problems. Conclusion Research which claims to show an intervention has, or has not, improved adherence must be interpreted cautiously. Interventions which appear to fail may actually succeed in aspects of adherence which were not defined or measured in the study. Clinicians and researchers could use clear <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurements,</b> such as the ones presented in this review. ...|$|R
50|$|Double-entry {{bookkeeping}} conventions {{are employed}} {{as well for}} the National Accounts, so the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> of important economic concepts, such as national product, aggregate income, investment and savings, {{as well as the}} balance of payments and balance of trade, involve accounting identities. At base, the application of double-entry bookkeeping conventions to the problems of measuring aggregate economic activity derives from the recognition that every purchase is also a sale, every payment made is also income received, and every act of lending also an act of borrowing.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{capability}} approach claims that development {{should be considered}} a process of expanding freedoms or removing the major sources of unfreedom rather than a focus on narrower measurements such as growth of gross national product, per capita income, or industrialization. According to kos basic needs approach (which in most aspects is quite like {{the capability}} approach), the objective of development should be to provide all humans with the opportunity to a full life, which goes beyond abstractions such as money, income, or employment. Therefore, the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> of poverty in general must extend beyond measurements like per capita GDP, which tools such as the Human Development Index attempt to accomplish.|$|E

Its <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> are often discussed in UPS literature (Needs definition of UPS), for example As the vacuum level is a property of the electron and free space, it is often used {{as the level of}} alignment for the energy levels of two different materials. The vacuum level alignment approach may or may not hold due to details of the interface. It is particularly important in the design of vacuum device components such as cathodes.|$|E

[...] He remained the Director of Psychiatric Research until entering private practice in 1967. [...] Critical of psychiatry for its emphasis on psychosomatic psychoanalysis and for what he considered a lack of adequate <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement,</b> Hoffer felt that biochemistry and human physiology may be used instead. He hypothesised that schizophrenics may lack the ability to remove the hallucinogenic catecholamine metabolite adrenochrome from their brains.

50|$|Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a {{therapeutic}} method {{that refers to}} the development of a written follow-up guide between the client and the counselor used for monitoring client progress. GAS was first developed by Thomas Kiresuk and Robert Sherman in response to the wide variety of evaluation models regarding mental illness and treatment. With the advent of GAS, Kiresuk and Sherman sought to create an evaluation program that could measure effectiveness across several different modalities and justify economic and labor resources based on effectiveness. Evaluation practices are important for justification and support for services, especially in mental health. The existing evaluation procedures had problems in <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement,</b> and each mental health center used its own definitions and measurements to evaluate. This created unspecified and informal evaluations. The variety of evaluation methods also made comparisons impossible. Thus, evaluation reform was needed.|$|E

5000|$|Central to {{her most}} recent (2012) view on animal welfare is scepticism about whether science can {{establish}} that animals have consciousness and therefore its role in <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> of animal welfare and suffering. Instead, her view is that good animal welfare rests on determining the needs and wants of animals, which do not require that they are conscious. These theses are presented in her book Why Animals Matter: Animal Consciousness, Animal Welfare, and Human Well-being (2012). [...] Her views on animal consciousness have been criticised by evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, who argues that she too readily rejects anthropomorphic research on animals. She responded to the criticism by stating her position as [...] "wrongly interpreted", and says that [...] "my concern {{is to make the}} case for animal emotions as watertight as possible and thereby to strengthen it.
