5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> always say, 'Man, if I could meet her!' So I worked with her, then Pharrell hooked it up for me {{to work with her}} again this time.|$|E
5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E
5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E

5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

5|$|Suzy and Doc are {{attracted}} to each other; she has in fact been quietly tidying his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens ("The Man <b>I</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Be"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains {{that she wants to}} get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once You Love Her"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.|$|E

25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously.
