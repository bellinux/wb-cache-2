In the episode, Homer buys a {{computer}} and creates his own website to spread gossip. However, when Homer starts writing conspiracy theories about flu shots, he gets sent to an island where people who <b>know</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> are imprisoned.|$|E
500|$|Other {{unusual and}} offbeat {{subject matter is}} raised on the album. [...] "Cactus" [...] is narrated by a prison inmate who {{requests}} his girlfriend smear her dress with blood and mail it to him. [...] "Gigantic" [...] is an [...] "unabashed praisesong to a well-endowed black man," [...] and borrows from the 1986 film Crimes of the Heart, in which a married woman {{falls in love with}} a teenager. Francis was inspired to write [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] after scuba diving in the Caribbean. He later said he had [...] "this very small fish trying to chase me. I don't know why—I don't <b>know</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about fish behavior." ...|$|E
500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi {{likened the}} {{development}} of Chrono Trigger to [...] "play around with Toriyama's universe," [...] citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game {{that would have been}} [...] "impossible with something like Final Fantasy." [...] When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game's testers had previously complained that Chrono Trigger was too difficult; as Horii explained, [...] "It's because we <b>know</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily." [...] Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or [...] "travel through time again" [...] as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: [...] "Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details... I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest." [...] The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the investigation, the {{prevailing}} {{theory was that}} the bomber was a former Con Edison employee with a grudge against the company. [...] Con Edison employment records were reviewed, but {{there were hundreds of}} other leads, tips and crank letters to be followed up on. [...] Detectives ranged far and wide, checking lawsuit records, mental hospital admissions, vocational schools where bomb parts might be made. [...] Citizens turned in neighbors who behaved oddly, and co-workers who seemed to <b>know</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about bombs. [...] A new group, the Bomb Investigation Unit, was formed to work on nothing but bomber leads.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Intersope Records {{signed the}} Pussycat Dolls, a sextet spun {{off from the}} burlesque group which was created by Robin Antin. After Universal Records dropped Almaze, the label was still very much {{interested}} in [...] "Don’t Cha". Doug Morris—then chairman of Universal Music Group—suggested that [...] "Don't Cha" [...] {{should be given to}} the Pussycat Dolls as the label was trying to reinvent the girl group. Initially Green was skeptical saying, [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about them , but when I found out that [...] Interscope Records was involved, that was an alliance I didn't hesitate to make." [...] The Pussycat Dolls version was recorded around March adding two verses from rapper Busta Rhymes. Lead singer Nicole Scherzinger admitted that two records sounded identical. [...] "I had [...] version as a guide. But ours is just a bit fresher." [...] This song was initially offered to both Sugababes and Paris Hilton, but both declined. In 2006, Hilton claimed that she was presented with the track, but was not impressed with it, commenting. [...] "I think I did hear the song, but not in the format that we all came to know and love. If I'd heard that, of course I'd have jumped at the chance".|$|E
