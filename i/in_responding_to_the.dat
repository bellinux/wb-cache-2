5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. <b>In</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E

The country now faces the challenge of scaling up these programmes and of convincing {{all levels of government}} to implement these innovative strategies and policies.

In addition there was a single DC-4 Strikemaster fitted out as an EW and ELINT aircraft flying over the SWA/Namibia border with Angola. The purpose of this latter aircraft was to both intercept all Angolan, Cuban and SWAPO radio transmissions, before jamming their communications networks at the appropriate time. The successful jamming of the SWAPO, Angolan and Cuban communications network {{is one of the reasons}} for the late reaction by either of the latter two <b>in</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, rebels {{seeking a}} more {{democratic}} Canada fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River. The rebels, led by William Lyon Mackenzie, found sympathy with Americans across the river in New York. These Americans carried supplies to the rebels aboard the steamship Caroline. In retaliation, a group of British and Canadian loyalists crossed the river, loosed the Caroline and set her on fire, then {{put her in the}} river's current, sending her over Niagara Falls. The Caroline affair provoked anger and anti-British sentiment in the United States. It was upon this subject that Menefee made his most notable speech in the House. He urged restraint <b>in</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British and proclaimed that he saw no great principles involved in the affair.|$|E

25|$|The United States Army {{was slow}} <b>in</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> situation, having closed all {{military}} posts in Arizona the same year, {{with the exception}} of Fort Huachuca. Fort Huachuca, which is relatively close to Naco, sent two companies of Buffalo Soldiers to occupy Naco, Arizona, and prevent the fighting from spreading into American territory. The commander of the detachment positioned his men along the border and had them prepare to attack at a moment's notice while he crossed the border and demanded that the rebel commanders stop dropping bombs on the Arizona side. By this time, however, the rebels were already defeated, and so the Buffalo Soldiers never had to engage. A squadron of eighteen warplanes was also dispatched from somewhere in Texas to shoot down any plane violating American airspace, but it never went into action either, and was withdrawn sometime later without incident.|$|E

500|$|Ethan Gutmann, a {{journalist}} reporting on China {{since the early}} 1990s, has attempted to explain the apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, [...] "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum," [...] according to Gutmann. This, coupled with western skepticism of persecuted refugees, {{has resulted in a}} perception that Falun Gong practitioners tended to exaggerate, or [...] "spout slogans rather than facts." [...] Gutmann also observes that Falun Gong also lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom: liberals are wary of Falun Gong's conservative morality, Christian conservatives don't accord the practice the same space as persecuted Christians, and the political center is wary of disrupting commercial and political relations with the Chinese government. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources <b>in</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> persecution.|$|E
