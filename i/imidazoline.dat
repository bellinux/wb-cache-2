25|$|Clonidine {{and other}} <b>imidazoline</b> {{compounds}} {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel) -dependent and -independent signaling to the insulinotropic characteristics of <b>imidazolines</b> was explored using perifused mouse islets and -cells. Up to {{a concentration of}} 100 5 M efaroxan had no insulinotropic effect {{in the presence of}} a basal glucose concentration, but enhanced the effect of a stimulatory concentration of glucose or nonglucidic nutrients (ketoisocaproate plus glutamine). The secretion by a non-nutrient (40 mM KCl) was not enhanced. At 500 5 M, efaroxan stimulated insulin secretion when glucose was basal. Likewise, at 0. 1 to 10 5 M RX 871024 [2 -(imidazolin- 2 -yl) - 1 -phenylindole] showed a purely enhancing effect, but at 100 5 M it elicited a strong KCl-like secretory response in the presence of basal glucose. At 0. 1 and 1 5 M RX 871024 did not significantly depolarize the -cell membrane. However, at a purely enhancing drug concentration (10 5 M RX 871024 or 100 5 M efaroxan) KATP channel activity was strongly reduced, the membrane was depolarized, and the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration was elevated in the presence of basal glucose. Insulin secretion by sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 knockout (KO) islets, which have no functional KATP channels, was not increased by efaroxan (100 or 500 5 M) or by 10 5 M RX 871024 but was increased by 100 5 M RX 871024. The <b>imidazolines</b> phentolamine and alinidine (100 5 M) were also ineffective on SUR 1 KO islets. It is concluded that a significant KATP channel block is compatible with a purely enhancing effect of the <b>imidazolines</b> on nutrient-induced insulin secretion. Only RX 871024 has an additional, nondepolarizing effect, which at a high drug concentration is able to elicit a KATP channel-independent secretion...|$|R
