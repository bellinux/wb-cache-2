5000|$|Liquid ink {{electrostatic}} printers use {{a chemical}} coated paper, which is {{charged by the}} print head according {{to the image of}} the document. The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image. This process was developed from the process of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copying.</b> Color reproduction is very accurate, and because there is no heating the scale distortion is less than ±0.1%. (All laser printers have an accuracy of ±1%.) ...|$|R
25|$|Carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> is an {{alternative}} to carbon paper, {{used to make a}} copy of an original, handwritten document without the use of any electronics. Carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> was invented by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green, working for the NCR Corporation, as a biodegradable, stain-free alternative to carbon paper.|$|R
50|$|In a 1997 study, the University of Florida {{found that}} a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of {{carbonless}} <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> were used had significant levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The {{study also found that}} there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper.</b> Another study, which was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.|$|R

5000|$|Carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> (CCP), non-carbon <b>copy</b> <b>paper,</b> or NCR paper (No Carbon Required, {{taken from}} the {{initials}} of its creator, National Cash Register) {{is a type of}} coated paper designed to transfer information written on the front onto sheets beneath.

50|$|Until the 1970s, {{when the}} use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned due to health and {{environmental}} concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper.</b> PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, {{and it is difficult}} to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water. In Japan, carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.|$|R
50|$|Carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> {{was first}} {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the <b>copy.</b> Carbonless <b>paper</b> was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The <b>copies</b> were often <b>paper</b> of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.|$|R
40|$|In print forensics, <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> brand source {{identification}} {{can be used}} to expose the <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> source of the forged contracts or official documents. In this study, a novel method for identifying the <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> brand is proposed for forensics application using only a commodity scanner and without modifying the document. The scanned document image margin is cut into image blocks. After the image preprocessing, 114 -D texture features are extracted from these image blocks including Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GCM) features and Fourier spectrum features. The decision for each piece of paper is given by voting the decision results of the image blocks. The experimental results are provided finally to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R
5000|$|Applied to {{animation}} by Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney studio {{during the}} late 1950s, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copying</b> technique called xerography allowed the drawings to be copied directly onto the cels, eliminating much of the [...] "inking" [...] portion of the ink-and-paint process. This saved time and money, and it also {{made it possible to}} put in more details and to control the size of the xeroxed objects and characters (this replaced the little known, and seldom used, photographic lines technique at Disney, used {{to reduce the size of}} animation when needed). At first, it resulted in a more sketchy look, but the technique was improved upon over time.|$|R

50|$|Exposure {{to certain}} types of {{carbonless}} <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> or its components has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract.

In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.|$|R

[...] It was a significant advance as no chemicals were required, other than those contained in the <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> itself. A thin sheet of heat sensitive <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> was placed on the original document to be copied, and exposed to infrared energy. Wherever the image on the original paper contained carbon, the image absorbed the infrared energy when heated. The heated image then transferred the heat to the heat sensitive paper producing a blackened copy image of the original.|$|R
