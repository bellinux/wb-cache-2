He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer. [...] "I don't know much about computers, but I have the desire to learn and I have a computer and a modem, so I go for it. Banging my head sometimes, but continuing on." ...|$|E

He {{would say that it}} was next door to treason to imagine such things, and that if men were to act upon such fancies as these, they would be fit only for {{hospitals}} for the insane. Moreover he would say that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> evidence, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> something to show that treachery was meant, he would still, in the interest of France, stay at his post of duty." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{that was}} your considerateness. You didn't want to give trouble, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to {{sacrifice}} your principles. But it's all right now. You {{are going to have}} your vegetables." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A. DROP ME A LINE, PETE, <b>EVEN</b> <b>IF</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>HAVE</b> {{to write}} {{with your left}} hand. Address X. Y. Z., General Postoffice, Washington. From YOU KNOW WHO." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{are half}} French, mamma. Not legally, {{but it has}} been home to us, since we were born and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not been French, we ought to fight for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to try," [...] {{answered}} Mary, [...] "and <b>if</b> I fail, <b>you</b> must run off with me, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to do it right}} before your mother's eyes." ...|$|R
