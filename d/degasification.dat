After chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of the UASB reactor became stable, D-CH 4 discharged from the UASB reactor was collected. Under 35 °C and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 h, average D-CH 4 concentration could be reduced from 63 mg COD L– 1 to 15 mg COD L– 1; this, in turn, resulted in an increase in total methane (CH 4) recovery efficiency from 89 % to 97 %. Furthermore, {{we investigated}} the effects of temperature and HRT of the UASB reactor on <b>degasification</b> efficiency. Average D-CH 4 concentration was as high as 104 mg COD L– 1 at 15 °C because of the higher solubility of CH 4 gas in liquid; the average D-CH 4 concentration was reduced to 14 mg COD L– 1 by <b>degasification.</b> Accordingly, total CH 4 recovery efficiency increased from 71 % to 97 % at 15 °C as a result of <b>degasification.</b> Moreover, <b>degasification</b> tended to cause an increase in particulate COD removal efficiency.

Although average D-CH 4 concentration in the UASB reactor was almost unchanged (ca. 70 mg COD L– 1) regardless of the HRT value, the CH 4 discharge rate from the UASB reactor increased because of an increase in the wastewater feed rate. Because the D-CH 4 concentration could be reduced down to 12 ± 1 mg COD L– 1 by <b>degasification</b> at an HRT of 6. 7 h, the 3 CH 4 recovery rate was 1. 5 times higher under <b>degasification</b> than under normal operation...|$|E

Since ventilation alone may {{not be sufficient to}} control the methane levels on a longwall operation, gob vent boreholes (GVB), horizontal and vertical drainage boreholes, and their combinations are drilled and used as supplementary methane control measures in many mines.

40|$|Coal seam <b>degasification</b> and {{its success}} are {{important}} for controlling methane, and thus for {{the health and safety}} of coal miners. During the course of <b>degasification,</b> properties of coal seams change. Thus, the changes in coal reservoir conditions and in-place gas content as well as methane emission potential into mines should be evaluated by examining time-dependent changes and the presence of major heterogeneities and geological discontinuities in the field. In this work, time-lapsed reservoir and fluid storage properties of the New Castle coal seam, Mary Lee/Blue Creek seam, and Jagger seam of Black Warrior Basin, Alabama, were determined from gas and water production history matching and production forecasting of vertical <b>degasification</b> wellbores. These properties were combined with isotherm and other important data to compute gas-in-place (GIP) and its change with time at borehole locations. Time-lapsed training images (TIs) of GIP and GIP difference corresponding to each coal and date were generated by using these point-wise data and Voronoi decomposition on the TI grid, which included faults as discontinuities for expansion of Voronoi regions. Filter-based multiple-point geostatistical simulations, which were preferred in this study due to anisotropies and discontinuities in the area, were used to predict time-lapsed GIP distributions within the study area. Performed simulations were used for mapping spatial time-lapsed methane quantities as well as their uncertainties within the study area. The systematic approach presented in this paper is the first time in literature that history matching, TIs of GIPs and filter simulations are used for <b>degasification</b> performance evaluation and for assessing GIP for mining safety. Results from this study showed that using production history matching of coalbed methane wells to determine time-lapsed reservoir data could be used to compute spatial GIP and representative GIP TIs generated through Voronoi decomposition. Furthermore, performing filter simulations using point-wise data and TIs could be used to predict methane quantity in coal seams subjected to <b>degasification.</b> During the course of the study, it was shown that the material balance of gas produced by wellbores and the GIP reductions in coal seams predicted using filter simulations compared very well, showing the success of filter simulations for continuous variables in this case study. Quantitative results from filter simulations of GIP within the studied area briefly showed that GIP was reduced from an initial ~ 73 Bcf (median) to ~ 46 Bcf (2011), representing a 37 % decrease and varying spatially through <b>degasification.</b> It is forecasted that there will be an additional ~ 2 Bcf reduction in methane quantity between 2011 and 2015.

Increased face advance rates, increased productivities, increased panel sizes, and more extensive gate road developments have challenged existing designs for controlling methane on longwalls. Methane control research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently examined a number of practices designed to maintain concentrations in mine air within statutory limits and consistently below the lower explosive limit. These included a reservoir modeling approach to predict methane inflows in gate road entries. The outputs sug 2 that emission rates in the gate roads decreased {{with the use of}} shielding boreholes and increased <b>degasification</b> time. Also, mining perpendicular to the face cleats liberated more gas into the mine workings, emissions were almost a linear function of Langmuir pressure and volume, and emissions were inversely related to sorption time constant. Subsequent simulations predicted changes in methane drainage using in-seam boreholes. The results showed that longer <b>degasification</b> times resulted in lower face emission rates. Premining <b>degasification</b> produced more methane than that produced during panel extraction, a fact attributed to the already decreased methane content of the coalbed.

An in situ gas pressure hole 199 feet long, and seven <b>degasification</b> holes ranging in depth from 500 to 850 feet (average 618 feet) were drilled in an 8 -foot-thick virgin Pittsburgh coalbed from the enlarged (14 -foot diameter) bottom of this borehole. The in situ pressure at the back end of the hole and the range of gas and water flows from <b>degasification</b> holes as they were completed and closed off were 203 psi, 79, 000 to 257, 000 cfd (average 160, 000 cfd), and 5 to 8 gpm per hole (average 6. 8 Gpm), respectively. Twenty-four hours after the seven holes were connected through individual water traps to a common collector for natural venting of the gas through pipes to the atmosphere, the total gas and water flows and the in situ pressure dropped, respectively, to 971, 000 cfd, 1. 3 Gpm, and 18 psi. Eighty days later the corresponding values dropped to 529, 000 cfd, 0. 50 Gpm, and 13 psi. After 180 days of <b>degasification,</b> 91 million cubic feet of gas had been removed from the affected virgin area. This represents 60 to 70 percent of the gas calculated to be contained in the area of coal affected by the holes.
