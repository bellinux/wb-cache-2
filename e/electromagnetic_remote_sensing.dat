40|$|Abstract—The {{analytical}} {{expression of}} scattering field from a conductor elliptic cylinder is presented, as the electromagnetic wave propagating vertical to {{the axis of}} an elliptic cylinder with arbitrary incident angle and polarization. The obtained result is in agreement with that in the reference when we use this analytical expression to calculate the scattering field from a cylinder. Simulations show that the vertical size of the elliptic cylinder greatly affects the scattering field when we observe it in the direction perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} incident wave. The scattering field is strong as the polarization direction of incident wave parallel to the axis of the elliptic cylinder. The algorithm used in the article is valid to investigate the scattering characteristics of other elliptic cylinders.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{advantages of}} ultra-wideband <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> (UWB radar) {{make it a}} particularly attractive technique for biomedical applications. We partially review our activities in utilizing this novel approach {{for the benefit of}} high and ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other applications, e. g., for intensive care medicine and biomedical research. We could show that our approach is beneficial for applications like motion tracking for high resolution brain imaging due to the non-contact acquisition of involuntary head motions with high spatial resolution, navigation for cardiac MRI due to our interpretation of the detected physiological mechanical contraction of the heart muscle and for MR safety, since we have investigated the influence of high static magnetic fields on myocardial mechanics. From our findings we could conclude, that UWB radar can serve as a navigator technique for high and ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging and can be beneficial preserving the high resolution capability of this imaging modality. Furthermore it can potentially be used to support standard ECG analysis by complementary information where sole ECG analysis fails. Further analytical investigations have proven the feasibility of this method for intracranial displacements detection and the rendition of a tumour’s contrast agent based perfusion dynamic. Beside these analytical approaches we have carried out FDTD simulations of a complex arrangement mimicking the illumination of a human torso model incorporating the geometry of the antennas applied...|$|E

As {{an extension of the}} real-valued neural networks, the complex-valued system with complex-valued states, activation functions and connection weights possesses more complicated and abundant properties than real-valued one. Moreover, they can be used to solve many complicated real-life problems that the real-valued model cannot do, such as the speed and direction in wind profile model [31]. So far, effective achievements on the dynamical behaviors of complex-valued neural networks have emerged in large numbers [32 – 39]. Moreover, for memristor-based complex-valued neural networks, abundant relevant results have also been achieved [40 – 46]. However, {{there are only a few}} results focusing on the state estimation problem for complex-valued networks [47 – 49]. Moreover, there is still no information published about the state estimation problem for memristor-based complex-valued neural networks. This situation prompts our current research.|$|R
40|$|Radiative Transfer (RT) {{theory has}} {{established}} {{itself as an}} important tool for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> in parallel plane geometries with random distributions of scatterers, and most recently {{it has also been}} proposed {{as a model for the}} propagation of elastic waves in layered ocean sediments. In this work the capabilities of this model are illustrated, as the RT method is used to predict backscattering strength from laboratory models of random media. The RT model is characterized by its flexibility on accommodating scatterers in a broad variety of sizes, shapes, and acoustic contrast relative to the background media. Additionally, this formulation is easily expandable to include multiple layering and elastic effects. In this paper, a comparison between the RT model and the results from two laboratory experiments in the optics and the Mie regime are presented. The experiments were designed to measure volume scattering at high frequencies between 280 kHz and 400 kHz in monostatic configuration. The first experiment used large aluminum spheres suspended with thin filaments, and it serves as a benchmark for testing the RT formulation due to its high signal-to-noise ratio, and the absence of reflective boundaries or background attenuation. Measurements of frequency dependent backscattering at normal incidence angle are shown for two fractional volumes. For the second experiment, the scattering media is a well characterized slab of a lossy resin background containing a uniform distribution of glass beads, and angle- and frequency-dependent measurements are presented. The levels of volume scattering from both experiments are found in agreement with predictions from the steady state RT model...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{knowledge}} of the dielectric properties of natural snow, firn and ice are essential for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> of the cryosphere. In glaciological applications, the vertical distribution of dielectric properties {{can be obtained from}} ice core measurements by means of dielectric profiling (DEP), nowadays routinely used in polar drillings. Dielectric profiles allow to link ice core properties with coherent reflections seen in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) by means of forward modeling GPR signals. However, as DEP operates at a few 100 kHz, the results have to be transferred to radio frequencies in the MHz-range. Here we investigate the dielectric properties of ice cores recently drilled at two cold glaciers in the European Alps, Col du Dome, Mont Blanc and Colle Gnifetti, Monte Rosa. Although limited to roughly 100 m in thickness, these glaciers comprise strong gradients in ice characteristics, such as impurity content and crystal orientation fabric, as well as a comparatively large depth-fraction of firn. We applied, for the first time, DEP to these Alpine ice cores. With respect to what is known from polar sites, dielectric profiles at 250 kHz are compared to density, impurity and electrical conductivity measurements. This is to obtain a comprehensive picture on the DEP signals in view of the strong variability in physical properties, and the potential for obtaining DEP-based age information from annual cycles and signatures of volcanic eruptions. Complementary to DEP, we used a coaxial cell setup to measure dielectric properties of selected firn samples directly at radio frequencies from 1 MHz to 1. 5 GHz. This combined approach allows us to study the dielectric properties of natural samples over a broad frequency range and to assess the transfer of DEP results to radio frequencies. Finally we include a comparison of forward modeled and measured GPR signals aimed at an improved understanding of englacial reflections at these cold-ice mountain drilling sites...|$|E

The increase in satellite-based radar backscattering values following a large precipitation event (34 mm on 17 – 18 January 2010) was used to identify water-bearing features, here interpreted as preferred pathways for surface water infiltration. Findings include: (1) spatial analysis in a GIS environment revealed that the distribution of the water-bearing features (conductive features) corresponds to that of fractures, faults, shear zones, dike swarms, and wadi networks; (2) using VLF (43 profiles), magnetic (7 profiles) techniques, and field observations, the majority (85 %) of the investigated conductive features were determined to be preferred pathways for groundwater flow; (3) northwest–southeast- to north–south-trending conductive features that intersect the groundwater flow (southeast to northwest) at low angles capture groundwater flow, whereas northeast–southwest to east–west features that intersect the flow at high angles impound groundwater upstream and could provide potential productive well locations; and (4) similar findings are observed in central Sinai: east–west-trending dextral shear zones (Themed and Sinai Hinge Belt) impede south to north groundwater flow as evidenced by the significant drop in hydraulic head (from 467 to 248 m above mean sea level) across shear zones and by reorientation of regional flow (south–north to southwest–northeast).
