40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of four papers {{entitled}} 'The Stokes structure in asymptotic analysis'. They introduce a methodology for the asymptotic analysis of differential equations with polynomial coefficients which also provides a further insight into the Stokes' Phenomenon. This approach consists of a chain of steps based on the concept of the Stokes Structure an algebraic-analytic structure, the idea of which emerges naturally from the monodromic properties of the Gauss hypergeometric function, and which can be treated independently of the differential equations, and Fourier-like transforms adjusted to this Stokes Structure. Every step of this approach, together with all its exigencies, is illustrated by means of the non-trivial treatment of Bessel's and Weber's differential equations. It will be the aim of our future series of papers to extend this approach to matrix differential equations.

That year, he was approached by a baker named Fernando Pavarotti who {{wanted to know whether}} the tenor voice of his 19-year-old son, Luciano, was good enough for training as a professional opera singer. Pola later reported that he knew, after an approximately 15-minute audition, that he was standing against a superb talent. He spontaneously decided to help the boy and his family, who didn't have much money, by giving Luciano daily voice lessons free of charge. For the next three years, Luciano studied with Pola almost every day. Pavarotti later said, [...] "Were it not for my <b>dear</b> <b>teacher</b> Arrigo Pola, I would not be what I am today."

He accepted the offer, and moved to Japan after securing Pavarotti's further training with Ettore Campogalliani. Pavarotti continued to be mentored by Pola, through visits to Tokyo, while studying with Campogalliani. Pola eventually became the Dean of the Department of European Voice at Tokyo University.

40|$|FINGER-pointing is {{a gesture}} {{generally}} discouraged in polite society. Having someone point {{a finger at}} you can be jarring or unsettling. However, if the finger belongs to one’s parent or to a <b>dear</b> and respected <b>teacher,</b> accompanied by an attentive gaze and direct vocative address, the experience can be powerfully awakening. According to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, such was {{the experience of a}} young man whose father-turned-guru spoke to him directly and particularly with the words tattvamasi, Śvetaketo, “Thou art that, O Śvetaketu. ” 2 The intimacy of this encounter between father and son is easily overlooked, despite its familiarity to those who study Vedānta. As {{one of only a handful}} of mahāvākyāni, or “great sentences,” the significance of the text all too often overshadows the specific context of its utterance. In part, this is because we tend to experience the text as a text, which is to say as “scripture” or sacred writing. The reading context differs substantially from the literary context, meaning that the words on the page are read and absorbed in a very different context than that between father and son, teacher and student. Nine times in the Chāndogya, Uddālaka concludes his teachings about Brahman by addressing his son directly in the vocative: “Thou art that, O Śvetaketu. ” Grammatically, the words “that” and “thou” (tat and tvam) are indexicals. As such, their meaning changes according to context. In the context of the intimate exchange between Uddālaka and Śvetaketu, the word “that” (tat) unambiguously refers to Brahman as Brahman has been described in each of the nine teachings. When this same intimate exchange is encountered as a written text, the indexicality of the word “that” remains unambiguous. Much like the index at the end of a book, the word “that” points to another part of the text, i. e., the teaching that immediately precedes it. The referential meaning of the word does not change when the spoken word is recorded in a text...|$|R
40|$|Like {{a lot of}} people, I {{was first}} {{introduced}} to Crane {{in a high school}} English class, but since the book was The Red Badge of Courage, and hence about war, I paid little attention. I did not care about war or about Henry Fleming at that point; I cared about characters named Tess Durbeyfield and Carrie Meeber, after finding Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Dreiser's Sister Carrie in a bin of marked-down books, books so cheap that the covers fell off and scattered the green newsprint pages until I rubber-banded them back together for a second reading. We were taught that Stephen Crane had an important place in literature because he used symbolism, a term <b>dear</b> to my <b>teacher's</b> heart. She explained that "The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer" referred to a communion wafer, whereas I, as an inveterate reader of Victorian fiction and the language of sealing wax and correspondence, thought a wafer was simply something used to seal a letter. But reading Maggie: A Girl of the Streets for the first time revealed an entirely different Stephen Crane. Here was Maggie Johnson, a character worthy to stand beside Tess and Carrie, a girl whose environment stacked the cards against her in some almost unbearable ways yet who tried as best she could to escape her fate and to create meaning and beauty from the life she'd been given. This kind of courage interested me as Henry Fleming's never had, as in this passage from chapter 6 : 1. "She spent some of her week's pay in the purchase of flowered cretonne for a lambrequin. She made it with infinite care and hung it to the slightly-careening mantel, over the stove, in the kitchen. "Campbell, Donna. Reflections on Stephen Crane.

60|$|It is yet {{too early}} to {{speculate}} with much confidence on the remote consequences of the war. One of its more immediate results has already been to disabuse the Southern mind {{of some of its}} most fatal misconceptions as to Northern character. They thought us a trading people, incapable of lofty sentiment, ready to sacrifice everything for commercial advantage,--a heterogeneous rabble, fit only to be ruled by a superior race. They are not likely to make that mistake again, and must have learned by this time that the best blood is that which has in it most of the iron of purpose and constancy. War, the sternest and <b>dearest</b> of <b>teachers,</b> has already made us a soberer and older people on both sides. It has brought questions of government and policy home to us as never before, and has made us feel that citizenship is a duty to whose level we must rise, and not a privilege to which we are born. The great principles of humanity and politics, which had faded into the distance of abstraction and history, have been for four years the theme of earnest thought and discussion at every fireside and wherever two men met together. They have again become living and operative in the heart and mind of the nation. What was before a mighty population is grown a great country, united in one hope, inspired by one thought, and welded into one power. But have not the same influences produced the same result in the South, and created there also a nation hopelessly alien and hostile? To a certain extent this is true, but not in the unlimited way in which it is stated by enemies in England, or politicians at home, who would gladly put the people out of heart, because they themselves are out of office. With the destruction of slavery, the one object of the war will have been lost by the Rebels, and its one great advantage gained by the government. Slavery is by no means dead as yet, whether socially in its relation of man to man, or morally in its hold on public opinion and its strength as a political superstition. But there is no party at the North, considerable in numbers or influence, which could come into power on the platform of making peace with the Rebels on their own terms. No party can get possession of the government which is not in sympathy with the temper of the people, and the people, forced into war against their will by the unprovoked attack of pro-slavery bigotry, are resolved on pushing it to its legitimate conclusion. War means now, consciously with many, unconsciously with most, but inevitably, abolition. Nothing can save slavery but peace. Let its doom be once accomplished, or its reconstruction (for reconstruction means nothing more) clearly seen to be an impossibility, and the bond between the men at the South who were willing to destroy the Union, and those at the North who only wish to save it, for the sake of slavery, will be broken. The ambitious in both sections will prefer their chances as members of a mighty empire to what would always be secondary places in two rival and hostile nations, powerless to command respect abroad or secure prosperity at home. The masses of the Southern people will not feel too keenly the loss of a kind of property in which they had no share, while it made them underlings, nor will they find it hard to reconcile themselves with a government from which they had no real cause of estrangement. If the war be waged manfully, as becomes a thoughtful people, without insult or childish triumph in success, if we meet opinion with wiser opinion, waste no time in badgering prejudice till it become hostility, and attack slavery as a crime against the nation, and not as individual sin, it will end, we believe, in making us the most powerful and prosperous community the world ever saw. Our example and our ideas will react more powerfully than ever on the Old World, and the consequence of a rebellion, aimed at the natural equality of all men, will be to hasten incalculably the progress of equalization over the whole earth. Above all, Freedom will become the one absorbing interest of the whole people, making us a nation alive from sea to sea with the consciousness of a great purpose and a noble destiny, and uniting us as slavery has hitherto combined and made powerful the most hateful aristocracy known to man.|$|R
