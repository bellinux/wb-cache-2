Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{describes}} Buffalo as [...] "one of Australia's pioneering heavy rock outfits ...

(June 1972), Volcanic Rock (July 1973), Only Want You <b>for</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Body</b> (June 1974) and Mother's Choice (March 1976). He also appeared on three tracks of their posthumous album, Average Rock 'n' Roller (July 1977). As a member of Buffalo Wells co-wrote the album tracks: [...] "Leader" [...] (1972), [...] "Pound of Flesh" [...] (1973), [...] "On My Way" [...] and [...] "Essukay" [...] (both 1976).|$|E

Then had you showed yourselves men to my liking; whereas, by what you have done, you have made me half afraid--I say, half afraid--that when they and we shall come to push a pike, I shall find you want courage to stand it out any longer. Wherefore have I commanded a watch, and that you should double your guards at the gates? Wherefore have I endeavoured to make you as hard as iron, and your hearts as a piece of the nether millstone? Was it, think you, that you might show yourselves women, and that you might go out like a company of innocents to gaze on your mortal foes? Fie, fie! put yourselves into a posture of defence, beat up the drum, gather together in warlike manner, that our foes may know that, before they shall conquer this corporation, there are valiant men in the town of Mansoul.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{continues}} that Abraham {{compiled a}} group of monks, priests and elders. He told them to all stay in the church for three days for a penance. On {{the morning of the}} third day, Abraham was praying in the Hanging Church, when he saw Mary, mother of Jesus. The Holy Virgin told him to go to the great market. She said to him, [...] "There thou wilt find a one-eyed man carrying on his shoulder a jar full of water; seize him, for he it is at whose hands this miracle shall be manifested.” Abraham listened to Mary and went to the market where he met the man the Holy Virgin spoke of. The man was Simon the tanner, who had plucked out his eye because of a passage from the Bible: [...] "If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of <b>your</b> <b>body</b> than <b>for</b> <b>your</b> whole <b>body</b> to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away.

6000|$|And when Antony {{had spoken}} thus, all rejoiced; {{and in one}} the love of virtue was increased, in another {{negligence}} stirred up, and in others conceit stopped, while all were persuaded to despise the plots of the devil, wondering at the grace which {{had been given to}} Antony by the Lord for the discernment of spirits. So the cells in the mountains were like tents filled with divine choirs, singing, discoursing, fasting, praying, rejoicing over the hope of the future, working that they might give alms thereof, and having love and concord with each other. And there was really to be seen, as it were, a land by itself, of piety and justice; for there was none there who did wrong, or suffered wrong: no blame from any talebearer: but a multitude of men training themselves, and in all of them a mind set on virtue. So that any one seeing the cells, and such an array of monks, would have cried out, and said, [...] "How fair are thy dwellings, O Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel; like shady groves and like parks beside a river, and like tents which the Lord hath pitched, and like cedars by the waters." [...] He himself, meanwhile, withdrawing, according to his custom, alone to his own cell, increased the severity of his training. And he groaned daily, considering the mansions in heaven, and setting his longing on them, and looking at the ephemeral life of man. For even when he was going to eat or sleep, he was ashamed, when he considered the rational element of his soul; so that often, when he was about to eat with many other monks, he remembered the spiritual food, and declined, and went far away from them; thinking that he should blush if he was seen by others eating. He ate, nevertheless, by himself, on account of the necessities of the body; and often, too, with the brethren, being bashful with regard to them, but plucking up heart for the sake of saying something that might be useful; and used to tell them that they ought to give all their leisure rather to the soul than to the body; and that they should grant a very little time to the body, for mere necessity's sake: but that their whole leisure should be rather given to the soul, and should seek her profit, that she may not be drawn down by the pleasures of the body, but rather the body be led captive by her. For this (he said) was what was spoken by the Saviour, [...] "Be not anxious for your soul, what ye shall eat; nor <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> what ye shall put on. And seek not what ye shall eat, nor what ye shall drink, neither let your minds be in suspense: for after all these things {{the nations of the world}} seek: but your Father knoweth that ye need all these things. Rather seek first his kingdom; and all these things shall be added unto you." ...|$|E

60|$|Do {{you doubt}} my words? At all events you confess that the cure of all {{diseases}} comes from Christ. Then consider, I beseech you, {{how many more}} diseases are cured now than were formerly. One may say that the knowledge of medicine is not one hundred years old. Nothing, my friends, makes me feel more strongly what a wonderful and blessed time we live in, and how Christ is showing forth mighty works among us, than this same sudden miraculous improvement {{in the art of}} healing, which has taken place within the memory of man. Any country doctor now knows more, thank God, or ought to know, than the greatest London physicians did two generations ago. New cures for deafness, blindness, lameness, every disease that flesh is heir to, are being discovered year by year. Oh, my friends! you little know what Christ is doing among you, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>bodies</b> as well as <b>for</b> <b>your</b> souls. There is not a parish in England now in which the poorest as well as the richest are not cured yearly of diseases, which, if they had lived a hundred years ago, would have killed them without hope or help. And then, when one looks at these great and blessed plans for what is called sanitary reform, at the sickness and the misery which has been done away with already by attending to them, even though they have only just begun to be put in practice--our hearts must be hard indeed if we do not feel that Christ is revealing to us the gifts of healing far more bountifully and mercifully than even He did to the first apostles.|$|R
