5000|$|Section 114 {{provides}} that the Commonwealth cannot tax state property, nor States tax Commonwealth property, {{without the consent}} of the other. The entity that is claiming the exemption must actually be a State or the Commonwealth and an entity that is controlled by a State will not be covered. For example, a building society controlled by a State has been determined not to be the State, as it was only controlled by state laws relating to building societies. The courts have dealt with cases as to whether a tax is levied on property or something else. For example, a fringe benefits tax (FBT) is not a tax on property; it is a transaction affected by FBT which can result in a State being liable for FBT. Similarly, the Commonwealth can impose a tax on a state employee. The Commonwealth is exempt from some state taxes, such as land taxes and stamp duties, being taxes on property. In the case of local council rates, the Commonwealth claims exemption from rates, but [...] "contributes" [...] to local government in the form of grants to at least cover services provided, such as electricity, sewerage, rubbish disposal and the like, but not for road works, parks, <b>general</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>expenses,</b> etc.|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} facing brewery {{companies}} {{is the growing}} trend of input costs which erodes business profit and as such leads to constant shut down of brewery factories in Nigeria. Given the important contributions of the brewery sector to the Nigerian economy, this research deems it necessary to evaluate the effect of input costs on the profitability of brewing firms in Nigeria. A cross sectional data was gathered for the analysis from the annual reports of the sampled brewery firms {{for a period of}} 1999 to 2010. Measures of profitability are examined and related to proxies for the inputs cost assumed by brewers. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) stated {{in the form of a}} multiple regression model was applied in the analysis.

40|$|Firm’s {{financial}} information {{is essential to}} stakeholders’ decision making. Although not always financial statements show the firm’s real image. This study examines listed firms from Portugal and UK. Firms have different purposes to manipulate earnings: some strive for influencing investors’ perception about a particular company, some try to provide better position for gaining finance from credit institutions or paying less tax to tax authorities. Usually, this behaviour is induced when firms have financial problems. Consequently, the study also aims to see the impact of financial crisis on earnings management. We try to answer question how does extent of firms’ involvement in earnings management change when the world undergoes financial crisis. Furthermore, we also compare two countries with different legal forces in terms of quality of accounting to see the main differences. We used a panel data methodology to analyse financial data from 2004 till 2014 of listed firms from Portugal and UK. Beneish (1999) model was applied to categorize manipulator and non-manipulator firms. Analysing accounting information according to Beneish’s ratios, findings suggest that financial crisis had certain impact on firms’ tendency to manipulate financial results in UK {{although it is not}} statistically significant. Moreover, besides the differences between Portugal and UK, results contradict the common view of legal systems’ quality, as UK firms tend to apply more accounting techniques for manipulation than the Portuguese ones. Our main results also confirm that some UK firms manipulate ratios of receivables’ days, asset quality index, depreciation index, leverage, sales and <b>general</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>expenses</b> whereas Portuguese firms manipulate only receivables’ days. Finally, we also find that the main reason to manipulate results is not to influence the cost of obtained funds neither to minimize tax burden since net profit does not explain the ratios used in the Beneish model. Results suggest that the main concern to listed firms manipulate results is to influence financial investors perception...|$|E

To estimate efficiency using DEA, we treat employees, total earning assets (that includes property, plant and equipment and current assets), inventory and selling, <b>general</b> and <b>administrative</b> <b>expenses</b> as inputs and sales, income before extraordinary items and stock market values as outputs.

40|$|This paper {{tests for}} changes in {{investment}} and employment following changes in capital gains and dividend taxes. We show that firms with less elastic demand for equity capital will expand operations less than other firms following shareholder tax cuts. Since financial constraint is a factor that diminishes a firm’s demand elasticity for capital, we predict that financially constrained firms expand less than other companies following shareholder tax reductions. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that financially constrained companies increased their capital expenditures, research and development, selling, <b>general</b> and <b>administrative</b> <b>expenses,</b> acquisitions, and hiring less than other firms did, following the two most recent U.
