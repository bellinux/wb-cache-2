25|$|Koichi Shido {{is the son}} of Ichiro Shido, a politician. In the manga, when Koichi's mother dies, {{he becomes}} a teacher at Tokonosu where his father is a director, but his father reveals he has an illegitimate son, and forces him to work in the shady family business. One of the {{dealings}} involves stopping Rei’s father from investigating the Shido family’s funding; Shido arranges for Rei to be held back a year. When Rei threatens to kill Shido with her bayonet, Shido dares <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but she cannot, as he is not worth the trouble. Soichiro orders Shido and his student followers to leave, and he complies, but a high-altitude nuclear explosion causes both the bus and nearby forklift with a concrete barrier to stall and they collide. He recovers consciousness {{in time to see the}} undead horde that advances through the gap in the barrier.|$|E
500|$|Christensen {{believed}} that Odinism was the ideal {{tool for the}} advancement of Aryan racial consciousness, expressing her opinion that the Jewish-controlled establishment would not permit <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> a more explicit way, stating that [...] "You cannot repeat the mistake that Hitler made ... Everybody knows that the Jews rule the whole damned world, so you cannot fight their combined power. You need to watch your step." [...] A number of The Odinists readers wrote letters to the magazine expressing disapproval of what they perceived as the editors' support of Nazism, to which Christensen publicly responded that such accusations were [...] "the cheapest of all shots that can be aimed against anyone who finds something positive to say about... National Socialism... or who merely desires some degree of objectivity in dealing with this grossly maligned movement." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics show Madonna's {{interest}} in her Roman Catholic upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who admits to her father that she is pregnant and refuses {{to have an abortion}} or give up the baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third and final chorus. At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking him to talk to her as an adult, [...] "You should know by now that I'm not a baby". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word [...] "Please". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main hook in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that Hispanic music had on Madonna's musical style.|$|E
60|$|I knew wot it was. It was {{the handle}} of that umberella 'ammering on the gate. I went cold all over, and then when I thought that the pot-man was most likely {{encouraging}} <b>'er</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> I began <b>to</b> boil.|$|R
60|$|Fan was discouraged, {{but there}} was nothing else for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>it</b> was hard for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> give up this one chance.|$|R
60|$|CARMODY. You'd better not. Leave her alone. She'll {{not wish}} you mixin' {{in with her}} work and tellin' <b>her</b> how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
500|$|A {{key element}} of Simpson's {{promotion}} was The Ashlee Simpson Show, which debuted on June 16, 2004, and ran for eight episodes, achieving high ratings for cable television. Jessica's reality show, , had debuted in 2003 and had proved highly successful, being credited with reviving her flagging music career; reality television proved similarly effective in helping launch Simpson's music career. It {{has been said that}} Simpson's father and manager Joe Simpson [...] "redefined how you sell records" [...] through his use of reality television to promote his daughters. Simpson said that she initially did not want to do the reality show but that her father persuaded <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because it would be about the production of her album: [...] "...I thought that was kind of cool. You're actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made." [...] She also thought the show, by showcasing her own personality, would help to distinguish her from Jessica.|$|E
60|$|Now, if Mr. Ludlow knew, {{he would}} surely despise her, and {{she wished she}} were dead indeed: {{not so much because}} she had boxed Dickerson's ears as because she had done what obliged <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Lydia {{will never}} be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with so little expense or {{inconvenience}} to her family as under the present circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall you?" [...] said Rex, {{who had not}} {{believed}} in <b>her</b> intending <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if the elders objected, but confided in her having good reasons.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tolbridge {{was glad}} to talk; it suited her much better at this time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the talking than for <b>her</b> {{companion}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and she proceeded quite volubly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very glad for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. <b>It</b> {{is just getting}} cool and {{pleasant}} for walking, and half {{an hour in the}} fresh air will do her good." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. P.--Not the darling's fault. It was to {{help her}} poor father in prison. It was I who forced <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Oh! don't, don't, dear Lady Kicklebury, take the bread out of the mouths of these poor orphans! [Crying.] ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{very few}} days Topsy {{had learned how to}} do Miss Ophelia's room perfectly, for she was very quick and clever. But if Miss Ophelia ever left <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> by herself there was sure to be dreadful confusion.|$|E
60|$|Should she {{unlock the}} door, and fling herself wildly into his arms? Her {{instinct}} told <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but she faltered and hesitated. A drunkard! a drunkard! Oh no! she could not. The evil genius conquered the good, and {{she checked the}} impulse that alone could have saved her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nat'rally, sense {{she married}} of him, an' fit all <b>her</b> fambily <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> An' the Cap'n were thet proud o' her thet {{he thought the}} world lay in her sweet eyes." ...|$|R
50|$|She is {{best known}} for {{presenting}} the Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen in 1964, a position for which she says she was chosen over her peers because of <b>her</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. You gave <b>her</b> {{the money}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> {{which is the}} same thing.|$|R
60|$|No {{more was}} said then, for Aunt Plenty called {{them down and}} the day's duties began. But that brief talk showed Rose {{what to do and}} fitted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> for it set her to {{thinking}} of the duty one owes one's self in loving as in all the other great passions or experiences which make or mar a life.|$|E
60|$|Of course, if Prissy {{had had a}} {{spark of}} spirit she wouldn't have given in. But she hadn't a mite; I believe she would have cut off her nose if Emmeline had ordered <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> She was just her mother over again. If ever a girl belied her name, Prissy Strong did. There wasn't {{anything}} strong about her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say what}} I should do {{in such a}} case; but it always {{seemed to me that}} a man should have energy enough to save himself, and not expect the 'weaker vessel,' as he calls <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for him," [...] {{answered}} Christie, with a conscious look, for Mr. Fletcher's face made her feel as if something was going to happen.|$|E
60|$|She {{wished the}} ordeal {{could have been}} postponed: she had fully made up <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the deed, but she had not made up <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> this very day; and now she felt ill at ease, astray, and in difficulty.|$|R
60|$|She {{was going}} to write a {{telegram}} that she knew would bring Crappen headlong--to disinherit her absolutely. And--it suddenly struck her--her husband had trusted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> write it. She was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what he had trusted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do....</b> But <b>it</b> was absurd.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't think, then," [...] Lady Mary gasped, [...] "that {{there is}} any chance--of getting <b>her</b> <b>to</b> confess--that she <b>did</b> <b>it</b> herself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} she thinks so long as she obeys. Tell <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for my sake, and she will find it the best joke she ever saw. I expect to {{have a tough time}} of it, but we'll win yet," [...] said the Doctor, as he marched upstairs with the book in his hand, and an odd smile on his face.|$|E
6000|$|HE. Yes, I do mean it, and a {{lot more}} too. I asked Mrs Bompas to walk out of the house with me--to leave you--to get {{divorced}} from you and marry me. I begged and implored <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> this very night. It was her refusal that ended everything between us. [Looking very disparagingly at him] What she can see in you, goodness only knows! ...|$|E
60|$|But it was {{so sweet}} and {{satisfying}} lying there talking desultorily with her. It was sweeter than sunshine, and not so evanescent. It was even irritating the way the church-clock kept on chiming: there seemed no space between the hours, just a moment, golden and still, whilst she traced his features with her finger-tips, utterly careless and happy, and he loved <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mishio is an {{orphaned}} girl under Yumina's care. She is {{very protective}} of who braids her hair, since <b>her</b> mother used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|She then {{runs out}} of the house, but falls and {{fractures}} her elbow, making <b>her</b> unable <b>to</b> fire <b>her</b> gun. At this time, Lucy and Jo return, and Lucy runs over and points a gun at the assailant's head, with the intention of killing him, but Marino and Kay convince <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|Samuel Z. Arkoff {{said the}} film's {{commercial}} reception was {{hurt by the}} refusal of female lead Laura Antonelli <b>to</b> take <b>her</b> clothes off. Arkoff claims she was originally willing to, but then his nephew, Ted Rusoff, who was sent to supervise the film, developed a crush on her and persuaded <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{you have}} to do is think it over. Do you think you can make those greyhounds extend {{themselves}} with the promise of a bite of meat? It's the whip that makes them extend.--Look over there at Billy Green. There ain't another way to teach that dog that trick. You can't love her into doing it. You can't pay <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There's only one way, and that's make her." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Margery had {{recovered}} her equanimity, and {{gathered up the}} broken cheese. But she could by no means account for the handwriting. Jim was {{just the sort of}} fellow to play her such a trick at ordinary times, but she imagined him to be far too incensed against <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> now; and she suddenly wondered if it were any sort of signal from the Baron himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the true}} view," [...] said his wife; [...] "and, after all, the poor King of France is much worse off than we are. However, I cannot now buy the Duchesse of Sevres' lace, which I had promised <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> is rather awkward. However, the best way always is to speak the truth. I must tell the duchess I am powerless, {{and that we are}} the victims of a revolution, like herself." ...|$|E
50|$|The prince {{declared}} {{he would}} marry {{the woman whose}} foot the shoe matched, {{and one of her}} stepsisters hacked off part of <b>her</b> foot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but the blood gave her away. Then no one had failed to try except Rushen Coatie, so the prince insisted on her trying it, and they married.|$|R
60|$|As The Vengeance descends from <b>her</b> {{elevation}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> the tumbrils {{begin to}} discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted {{their eyes to}} look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.|$|R
50|$|Dan {{has moved}} to a diner, and reappears again when Quinn visits him <b>to</b> help <b>her</b> <b>to</b> kill Katie Ryan, and he convinces <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> In the finale, Nathan visits him and gives him a photo of Lydia and a {{baseball}} from Jamie's first game and Dan thinks {{that there is a}} chance for forgiveness.|$|R
