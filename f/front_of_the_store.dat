5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some fire {{experts have}} {{questioned}} why the exterior front windows {{were taken out}} by firefighters while crews were committed inside, an action that could have increased the amount of oxygen being fed to the fire and drawn flames to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> Assistant Fire Chief Larry Garvin stated that fire blew out the windows, at which time firefighters broke open more windows to allow firefighters to escape.|$|E
25|$|Retail {{designers}} {{pay close}} attention to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> which is known as the decompression zone. This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, {{the side of the road}} cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.|$|E

2500|$|The new [...] "Horizon" [...] stores {{abandoned}} the original showroom experience for a brighter, more-open sales-floor format with open ceilings, low fixtures, and wood-floor aisles to allow customers to browse the merchandise easily. The format allowed putting all {{products on the}} sales floor, except those that were too large for customers to carry themselves. Shopping carts were added for the expanded assortment of grab-and-go merchandise. A row of registers was located at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> {{for the first time}} for quick checkout. Previously, the stores only had registers located within each department since the salespeople were on commission. Even though the new format had commissioned sales people, it was becoming very similar to Best Buy.|$|E
2500|$|The first actual {{demonstration}} {{of opposition to}} the Union occurred in Denver on April 24, 1861 {{just a few days}} after the bombardment of Fort Sumter. Denver awakened to find the [...] "Stars and Bars" [...] had been raised over the Wallingford & Murphy store on Larimer Street. A turbulent pro-Union crowd soon gathered in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> and demanded that the flag be taken down. The southern adherents were equally determined that the flag should stay. A young man in the crowd, Samuel M. Logan, later a Captain in the First Colorado Volunteers, climbed to the roof of the store to remove the flag. There are conflicting reports as to what happened next; some say a compromise was reached and the flag was permitted to remain for one day, while others state the flag was removed.|$|E

2500|$|American Fare was a {{chain of}} hypermarkets that opened in January 1989. American Fare was {{a joint venture between}} Kmart (which owned 51 percent), and Birmingham, Alabama-based Bruno's Supermarkets. The first store opened near Atlanta, Georgia. American Fare's [...] of retail space {{included}} [...] of groceries, [...] of general merchandise, and [...] of clothing (including apparel, footwear, and accessories). [...] An area in the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> housed a music and video store, a food court, bank, hair salon, pharmacy and a card store. Charlotte, North Carolina, was home to the second American Fare, which opened in late 1989 with [...] of retail space. A third and final store opened in Jackson, Mississippi. In June 1992, Bruno's announced that its partnership with the Kmart Corporation was being terminated, and that Kmart would assume ownership of the three stores. The Charlotte, NC store was converted to Super Kmart and then closed in 2002. The American Fare brand is used on some Kmart store brand consumable products.|$|E
2500|$|In 1854, Bean courted a young woman, who was {{subsequently}} kidnapped {{and forced to}} marry a Mexican officer. Bean challenged the groom to a duel and killed him. Six of the dead man's friends put Bean on a horse and tied a noose around his neck, then left him to hang. The horse did not bolt, and after the men left, the bride, who had been hiding behind a tree, cut the rope. Bean was left with a permanent rope burn on his neck and a permanent stiff neck. Shortly after that, Bean chose to leave California and migrated to New Mexico to live with Sam. The latter had been elected the first sheriff of Doña Ana County. [...] In 1861 Samuel G. and Roy Bean operated a store and saloon on Main Street in Pinos Altos (just north of Silver City) in present-day Grant County, New Mexico. It advertised liquor and [...] "a fine billiard table." [...] A cannon belonging to Roy Bean sat in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> for show. It was used to repel an Apache assault on the town.|$|E
2500|$|... 7:32p.m. – A {{firefighter}} inside calls [...] "Mayday!" [...] {{over his}} radio. Soon after, another {{voice on the}} radio is heard to say [...] "Car One (Chief Thomas). Please tell my wife that ... 'I love you.'" [...] Another firefighter inside is {{heard on the radio}} saying [...] "...in Jesus's name, amen." [...] Chief Thomas orders his commanders to account for their crews and is told that some firefighters remain inside. One firefighter attempting to escape is trapped behind the large glass in front of the showroom, and is freed when someone smashes it as other crews prepare to enter the building to rescue firefighters in distress. An emergency alert is activated on the radio of Ladder 5's engineer, who is inside, but calls to that radio go unanswered. Several PASS devices worn by firefighters are heard, meaning that firefighters in distress have manually activated them or have been motionless for at least 30 seconds. Firefighters begin smashing all of the glass in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to allow escaping firefighters out and rescuing firefighters in, but this allows large amounts of oxygen to reach the fire, which quickly begins to grow in intensity.|$|E

2500|$|The Paris omnibus {{was created}} by a {{businessman}} named Stanislas Baudry, who had started the first omnibus company in Nantes in 1823. The name was said {{to come from the}} station of the first line in Nantes, in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> of a hat-maker named Omnes, who had a large sign on his building with a pun on his name, [...] "Omnes Omnibus" [...] ("All for everyone" [...] in Latin). [...] Following his success in Nantes, Baudry moved to Paris and founded the Enterprise des Omnibus, with headquarters on rue de Lancre, and with workshops on the quai de Jemmapes. [...] The omnibus service was an immediate popular success, with more than two and a half million passengers in the first six months. [...] However, [...] there was no reliable way to collect money from the passengers, or the fare collectors kept much of the money for themselves; [...] In its first years the company was continually on the verge of bankruptcy, and in despair, Baudry committed suicide in February 1830 [...] Baudry's partners reorganized the company and managed to keep it in business.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Wilson [...] Swan {{was born}} in 1828 at Pallion Hall in Pallion in the Parish of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, County Durham. His parents were John Swan and Isabella Cameron. He {{was said to have}} had an enquiring mind even as a child. He {{augmented}} his education with a fascination of his surroundings, the industry of the area and reading. He attended lectures at the Sunderland Atheneum. He later became a partner in Mawson's, a firm of manufacturing chemists in Newcastle upon Tyne, started by John Mawson (9 Sep 1819 – 17 December 1867) the husband of his sister, Elizabeth Swan (22 Nov 1822 – 2 August 1905). This company existed as Mawson, Swan and Morgan until 1973, formerly located on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne near Grey's Monument. The premises are now occupied by hamburger chain Byron and can be identified by a line of Victorian-style electric street lamps in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> on Grey Street. Swan lived at Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, a large house on Kells Lane North, where he conducted most of his experiments in the large conservatory. The house was later converted into a private fee paying, grant aided co-educational grammar school named Beaconsfield School. Here, students could still find examples of Swan's original electrical fittings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which the walls of a Home Depot {{collapsed}} in Joplin after being hit by an EF5 tornado, The Kansas City Star, citing engineers, criticized Home Depot's practice of using tilt-up construction in hundreds of its big-box stores (other nearby big-box stores in Joplin, including a Walmart and Academy Sports, which had concrete block construction, lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In tilt-up construction the concrete is poured onsite, lifted into place, and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star that the practice, while normally safe and efficient, is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect. [...] Seven people were killed in the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> when the 100,000-pound walls collapsed on them, while 28 people {{in the back of the}} store survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast, 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete block construction fails, structural elements break in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. [...] Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the engineers quoted by the Star and said it would use tilt-up construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store.|$|E
