25|$|In 1936 Ladd {{played an}} {{unbilled}} role in Pigskin Parade. He had short term stints at MGM and RKO, but only got regular professional acting work {{when he turned}} to radio. Ladd's rich, deep voice was ideal for that medium and in 1936 he ended up being signed by station KFWB as their sole radio actor. He stayed for three years at KFWB <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> to 20 shows a week.|$|E

500|$|Following {{commercial}} success in Italy, the band did a six-week tour {{there at the}} start of 1972. The band were apprehensive about touring there, concerned they might be playing to half empty venues, but they were all shocked by the sheer volume of the crowds that came to see them. [...] "Pawn Hearts was seen as the ultimate album by the ultimate band," [...] said Jackson, who at times found it difficult to walk down the street in parts of Italy without being recognised. [...] "The tour was like the prophets have landed... you couldn't go anywhere without this lunatic 'Generator Mania' breaking out." [...] After the tour, the group was immediately offered another Italian tour, this time <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> to three shows a day. In between the tours, the band made an appearance on Belgian television performing [...] "Theme One" [...] and [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers". Since the studio recording of [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was a collage of multiple recordings, impossible to reproduce live in one setting, the band simply filmed individual sections of the song and spliced them together in the editing suite. It was the only live performance of the song until 2013.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield hailed Veedon Fleece as [...] "the culmination of everything Van was <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> to that point, all Celtic mystic tumult in the vocals and pastoral {{beauty in the}} music" [...] and ranked it among [...] "his most majestic music". Allmusic critics [...] Jason Ankenny and Thom Jurek called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and commented that [...] "With its elegiac tone and deeply autobiographical lyrics, this was a Morrison who didn't so readily associate himself with the feel-good, peace, love, and rhythm & blues sound American audiences were used to." [...] John Kennedy from PopMatters felt it is beautiful in the sense defined by French poet Charles Baudelaire, [...] "a poet's album, a jazz lover's album, a masterpiece of soul-singing, a blue and green journey into the places of the heart that were first opened up for dowsing [...] with Astral Weeks." [...] Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine believed it is astonishing, [...] "so frothy and thick, that requires silence when it's over ... To me that's the better explanation for Morrison's three-year absence. He'd just finished Veedon Fleece." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and said it is Morrison's most shamelessly cathartic work since Astral Weeks, [...] "soothing, evocative late-night music", but suffers from his long-windedness and a second side highlighted only by [...] "Bulbs".|$|E

2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E
