5|$|Filmed in {{and around}} Chennai, Kanchipuram, Courtallam, and Srinagar for 70 days, Rudraveena was {{produced}} on a budget of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988 to critical acclaim, the film was a commercial failure, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 0.6 million. It gained cult status later and {{is considered one of}} the best films made by Balachander. The film won three National Film Awards: Best Feature Film on National Integration, Best Music Direction, and Best Male Playback Singer (for S. P. Balasubrahmanyam).

Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from the feed was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was also}} reported in Sinaloa on the Mexican mainland. The remnants of Ignacio produced thunderstorm activity in high terrain areas of central interior California.

5|$|In 2009 {{there were}} 2,340 armed forces {{personnel}} stationed in Dorset including the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington, Royal Signals at Blandford and the Royal Marines at Poole.

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success in leading the Hokies to a bowl game win, Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team. Vick finished the game having completed 10 of 18 passes for 205 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Vick also ran the ball nine times for a gain of 21 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked twice, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> two yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Clemson wide receiver Rod Gardner was named the MVP of the losing team. He caught seven passes for 94 yards and a touchdown during the game.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure would result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 34-yard line, and the Hokies began another drive. Two rushing plays resulted in a first down for the Hokies at their 49-yard line. The Hokies were unable to enter Florida State's half of the field, however, as two incomplete passes and a running play resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> yardage.

5|$|Desert Strike was {{followed}} by four sequels Jungle Strike, Urban Strike, Soviet Strike, and Nuclear Strike that expanded on the basic gameplay it established. The design staff made efforts to retain game mechanics they felt embodied {{the core of the}} original. They believed removing those elements would result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> focus of what attracted fans. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development. Jungle Strike and Urban Strike, both released for the Genesis, featured additional vehicles and locations. Soviet Strike, released for the original PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996, featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. A fifth sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
5|$|During 2006, Teaneck {{underwent}} a revaluation of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically by the state. This revaluation adjusted property values to market prices, ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck was assessed at approximately $417,900, {{an increase of}} 132.1% from the prior year's average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 tax year. In {{the wake of the}} revaluation implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals hit the township, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> about $110 million in ratables and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 tax year. The township agreed to complete a revaluation by October 2014 that would go into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary home visits and determine property values.|$|E
5|$|September 27, 1985– Hurricane Gloria {{parallels}} the New Jersey coastline just offshore as a Category2 hurricane. Its arrival forces 95,000citizens to evacuate, while eleven casinos in Atlantic City are closed, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> $7million (1985USD). Dubbed {{by some as}} the storm of the century, the hurricane is expected {{to become the first}} hurricane to hit the New Jersey coastline since the hurricane in 1903, though a last minute turn spares the state. While passing by the state, Gloria caused a storm surge of 4.6feet (1.4m) in Ventnor City and a wind gust of 80mph (129km) in Ocean City. Despite coming within miles of the coast, the storm caused only light rainfall along the shoreline, though further inland there were reports of over 5inches (13cm). Strong winds down trees and power lines, leaving 237,000 without power after the storm. Overall, damage is minor, and some were even disappointed at the lack of damage from the proclaimed storm of the century.|$|E
