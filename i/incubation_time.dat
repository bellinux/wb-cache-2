5|$|While no {{evidence}} indicates Diplodocus nesting habits, other sauropods, {{such as the}} titanosaurian Saltasaurus, {{have been associated with}} nesting sites. The titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that they may have laid their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits, each covered with vegetation. Diplodocus may have done the same. The documentary Walking with Dinosaurs portrayed a mother Diplodocus using an ovipositor to lay eggs, but it was pure speculation {{on the part of the}} documentary author. For Diplodocus and other sauropods, the size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals. This appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures, as large eggs would require greater <b>incubation</b> <b>time</b> and thus would be at greater risk.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The <b>incubation</b> <b>time</b> is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The <b>incubation</b> <b>time</b> (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the most}} {{important}} requisite is to calibrate the <b>incubation</b> <b>time</b> of the assay both to the model cell and the ligand to be evaluated.

However, in these models, CMS penetrated into viable skin layers after prolonged <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> of 24 or 6  h, respectively [8]. It seems likely that overhydration of the skin barrier in the Franz cell setup due to the long contact to the water of the acceptor compartment may have increased permeability in that study and contributed to this divergence.

40|$|Prion {{replication}} {{is believed}} to consist of two components, a growth or elongation of infectious isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) particles and their fragmentation, a process that provides new replication centers. The current study introduced an experimental approach that employs Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification with beads (PMCAb) and relies {{on a series of}} kinetic experiments for assessing elongation rates of PrP(Sc) particles. Four prion strains including two strains with short <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> to disease (263 K and Hyper) and two strains with very long <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> (SSLOW and LOTSS) were tested. The elongation rate of brain-derived PrP(Sc) was found to be strain-specific. Strains with short <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> had higher rates than strains with long <b>incubation</b> <b>times.</b> Surprisingly, the strain-specific elongation rates increased substantially for all four strains after they were subjected to six rounds of serial PMCAb. In parallel to an increase in elongation rates, the percentages of diglycosylated PrP glycoforms increased in PMCAb-derived PrP(Sc) comparing to those of brain-derived PrP(Sc). These results suggest that PMCAb selects the same molecular features regardless of strain initial characteristics and that convergent evolution of PrP(Sc) properties occurred during in vitro amplification. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that each prion strain is comprised of a variety of conformers or 'quasi-species' and that change in the prion replication environment gives selective advantage to those conformers that replicate most effectively under specific environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of fast, narrow-size/chirality nucleation of thin single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at low, device-tolerant process temperatures in a plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) is demonstrated using multiphase, multiscale numerical experiments. These effects are due to the unique nanoscale reactive plasma chemistry (NRPC) on the surfaces and within Au catalyst nanoparticles. The computed three-dimensional process parameter maps link the nanotube <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> and the relative differences between the <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> of SWCNTs of different sizes/chiralities to the main plasma- and precursor gas-specific parameters and explain recent experimental observations. It is shown that the unique NRPC leads not only to much faster nucleation of thin nanotubes at much lower process temperatures, but also to better selectivity between the <b>incubation</b> <b>times</b> of SWCNTs with different sizes and chiralities, compared to thermal CVD. These results are used to propose a time-programmed kinetic approach based on fast-responding plasmas which control the size-selective, narrow-chirality nucleation and growth of thin SWCNTs.

25|$|Clutch size {{ranges from}} six to eight eggs; <b>incubation</b> <b>time</b> is 25 to 27 days. Greater sage-grouse {{apparently}} have high rates of nest desertion and nest predation.

25|$|Hatch order usually {{follows the}} same {{sequence}} as laying order. Regardless of clutch size, eight is the typical maximum {{size of a}} brood. Egg desertion is a frequent occurrence among coots because females will often deposit more than eight eggs. Brood size limits <b>incubation</b> <b>time,</b> and when {{a certain number of}} chicks have hatched the remaining eggs are abandoned. The mechanism for egg abandonment has not yet been discovered. Food resource constraints may limit the number of eggs parents let hatch, or the remaining eggs may not provide enough visual or tactile stimulation to elicit incubation behavior. An American coot can be forced to hatch more eggs than are normally laid. These additional offspring, however, suffer higher mortality rates due to inadequacy in brooding or feeding ability.|$|E
25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each {{well of the}} plate with some biological entity that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some <b>incubation</b> <b>time</b> has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a single well. A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates {{in the space of}} a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.|$|E

The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12–13 days before the altricial, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15–18 days elapse before they fledge.

Young and embryonic individuals had deep skulls with only slight expansion in the bones that would one day form the crest. Growth was faster than that of an alligator and comparable to ratite growth, for several years, based on the amount of bone growth seen between lines of arrested growth (analogous to growth rings in trees). Research by Lisa Cooper and colleagues on H. stebingeri indicates that this animal may have reached reproductive maturity at the age of 2 to 3years, and reached full size at about 10 to 12years old. The circumference of the thigh bone at postulated reproductive maturity was about 40% that of its circumference at full size. The postulated growth rate of H. stebingeri outpaces those of tyrannosaurids (predators of hypacrosaurs) such as Albertosaurus and Tyrannosaurus; rapidly growing hypacrosaurs would have had a better chance to reach a size large enough to be of defensive value, and beginning reproduction at an early age would also have been advantageous to a prey animal. Secondary cartilage has been found in the skull of a hatchling specimen of H. stebingeri.|$|E

The chick is covered in fluffy black down and its eyes are open and it can stand as soon as it is hatched. Initially weighing about , it grows at the rate of [...] per day. Initially, one or other parents brood it, but as its appetite increases it is left alone for longer periods. Observations of a nest chamber have been made from an underground hide with peephole. It was found that the chick sleeps much of the time between its parents' visits and also involves itself in bouts of exercise. It rearranges its nesting material, picks up and drops small stones, flaps its immature wings, pulls at protruding root ends and pushes and strains against the unyielding wall of the burrow. It makes its way towards the entrance or along a side tunnel to defecate. The growing chick seems to anticipate the arrival of an adult, advancing along the burrow just before it arrives but not emerging into the open air. It retreats to the nest chamber as the adult bird brings in its load of fish.|$|E
