2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> read, [...] "Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, {{murdered by}} pirates {{off the coast}} of Andres, April, 1854, age 30." [...] When I came back Mr. Swales went on, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{ten minutes}} past five, sir. There is a thick mist, {{and it is}} pitch dark. Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> inquire what is going on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t know," [...] ses Bob; [...] "he’s a wunnerful good scholard, and {{he likes}} writin’ letters. He’s going to write another to-morrer, unless <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> stop ’im." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; I was {{thinking}} <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{make a little}} money, {{and then come back}} and ask for her. I have the option of practising for myself after a year.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could only}} {{redirect}} it and {{hand it to}} him in silence. When he {{went out of the}} room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> tried it, and the door was locked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Col. Zane," [...] said Clarke, walking {{beside the}} Colonel up the bank, [...] "I saw Wetzel {{watching}} {{the island in}} a manner that I thought odd, under the circumstances, and I watched too. Presently I saw a dark form dart behind a bush. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> told Wetzel, and he said there were Indians on the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{like her}} to be bored here," [...] {{continued}} Beverdale. [...] "Algy met her at Rome, where she was occupying a palace with her mother--they're very rich, you know. He found she was staying with Lady Minever at Hedham Towers, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> invited her with a little party. She's a Miss Desborough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Sir Wingrave {{is going}} away, and doesn't want me. <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> somewhere, and <b>I</b> thought that <b>I</b> might <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> take rooms near you all. Would {{you care to}} have me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have done}} splendidly, Mrs. Crosse, splendidly!' cried Owen. 'I {{never heard a}} better day's work in my life. Now, if you will give me your cheque and wait here, <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> settle everything.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} waiting for it here, for I myself must go," [...] {{explained}} Babalatchi. [...] "I think <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> see what makes them late. When will you come? The Rajah gives you refuge." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{that was}} not the end of it, as I {{discovered}} when Uncle Dick gave me his confidence. One evening <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and,</b> piloted by the sound of shrieks and laughter, found Uncle Dick careering about the garden, pursued by half a dozen schoolgirls who were pelting him with overblown roses. At sight of the master my pupils instantly became prim and demure and, gathering up their flowery spoil, they beat a hasty retreat down the lane.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Mary Margaret drew a {{long breath}} {{and her eyes were}} starry with tears of happiness. [...] "Oh, I'm so thankful <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over.</b> <b>And</b> I had to tie Nellie in her chair, Mother, there was no other way. Uncle George broke his leg and is very sick this morning, and there's no breakfast ready for anyone and the fire black out ... but that doesn't matter when Father is safe ... and oh, I'm so tired!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{examined}} {{the couch and}} all around it most carefully. When Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck recovered sufficiently, which they did quickly, though Doctor Winchester took longer to come round, we went over it afresh. But all we could find {{was a sort of}} ridge of impalpable dust, which gave out a strange dead odour. On the couch lay the jewel of the disk and plumes which the Queen had worn in her hair, and the Star Jewel which had words to command the Gods.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{remember}} her! ah, well. She was the handsomest girl in Barchester, anyhow. That {{was given}} up to her. Well, I didn't think {{to be talking}} of her again. Thorne, you cannot but expect that <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> see Mary's child?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> there <b>and</b> {{kissed her}} {{and saw a}} man running at us...I {{thought it was a}} jealous husband or boyfriend coming to poke me in the eyes. I looked up and saw he was taking the picture and I kissed her as long as took for him to take it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>go</b> <b>over</b> now," [...] he said. [...] "Your {{lawyers and}} agents can {{look after the}} place a little longer, and I needn't worry if you're content with them. Anyway, all of it {{does not belong to}} me and we will see what we can fix up between us when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> by <b>and</b> by." ...|$|R
6000|$|As he was {{speaking}} there was a soft tapping at the door. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers; the former spoke, [...] "I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for {{him as he was}} not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I've been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been. We'll have to look back, and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went over}} on a bridge," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{took a little}} walk up the road, and pretty soon I came to a bridge which led across the river. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> then walked along the bank on the other side. There was only a narrow space between {{the river and the}} precipice. The ground sloped down from the foot of the precipice to the water. I found several very large springs {{breaking}} out in this ground. One of them was very large. The water that ran from it made a great stream, large enough for a mill. It came up right out of the ground from a great hole all full of stones. The water came up from among the stones." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, lads, I {{congratulate you}} on your escape, which was {{certainly}} a very narrow one. You have, I hope, all written to your friends at home to tell them everything that has taken place. It was most fortunate that your telegram from here arrived the day after we got to England, so that your friends practically received the news that you were missing and that you were safe at the same time. We had delayed sending off letters telling them that you were lost until we could receive an answer to our telegram to the consul. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> saw your mother and sister the same evening, Jack. Of course your mother was in some alarm {{at the thought of}} the danger she pictured to herself that you must have gone through. I told her I expected that when the row began you had hid up somewhere, and that not knowing that matters had quieted down again you had remained there until after we sailed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Chewink nodded. [...] "Of course," [...] said he. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I've got a nest in this very thicket. Mrs. Towhee is on it right now, and I suspect she's {{worrying}} and anxious {{to know what happened}} over here when you warned me about Reddy Fox. I think <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> set her mind at rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{very odd}} that I should like it so much!' said Lucy; 'and now,' turning away as usual from sentiment, 'what shall I say to Mrs. Bostock? What a wretch she will think me! <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> see all those {{children}} once more. I hope I shall have a worthy successor, poor little rogues. I must rouse myself to write!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. You have, no doubt, {{the affairs}} of your Government to look to. We are all so apt to ignore the work of our neighbours! It {{seems to me that}} <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> govern the Mandarins without the {{slightest}} trouble in the world. But no doubt I am mistaken;--just as you are about writing for the newspapers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did--I do," [...] she {{answered}} in a low, sweet voice, but very firmly. [...] "But never avoid precaution. There is nothing that may not happen here. There may be eyes where we least expect--or suspect them." [...] As she spoke the last words solemnly and in a low whisper, she was entering the room. I closed the glass door and bolted it, rolled back the steel grille, and pulled the heavy curtain. Then, when I had lit a candle, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> put a light to the fire. In a few seconds the dry wood had caught, and the flames were beginning to rise and crackle. She had not objected to my closing the window and drawing the curtain; neither did she make any comment on my lighting the fire. She simply acquiesced in it, {{as though it was}} now a matter of course. When I made the pile of cushions before it as on the occasion of her last visit, she sank down on them, and held out her white, trembling hands to the warmth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had to go}} {{over and}} tell Henry Pollack he was dying. Everybody else was afraid to tell him. They {{expected}} he'd take on turrible, for he's been dreadful determined to live, and been making no end of plans for the fall. His wife thought he oughter be told and that I'd be the best one to break it to him that he couldn't get better. Henry and me are old cronies--we sailed in the Gray Gull for years together. Well, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> sat down by Henry's bed and I says to him, says I, jest right out plain and simple, for if a thing's got to be told it may as well be told first as last, says I, 'Mate, I reckon you've got your sailing orders this time,' I was sorter quaking inside, for it's an awful thing to have to tell a man who hain't any idea he's dying that he is. But lo and behold, Mistress Blythe, Henry looks up at me, with those bright old black eyes of his in his wizened face and says, says he, 'Tell me something I don't know, Jim Boyd, if you want to give me information. I've known THAT for a week.' I was too astonished to speak, and Henry, he chuckled. 'To see you coming in here,' says he, 'with your face as solemn as a tombstone and sitting down there with your hands clasped over your stomach, and passing me out a blue-mouldy old item of news like that! It'd make a cat laugh, Jim Boyd,' says he. 'Who told you?' says I, stupid like. 'Nobody,' says he. 'A week ago Tuesday night I was lying here awake--and I jest knew. I'd suspicioned it before, but then I KNEW. I've been keeping up for the wife's sake. And I'd LIKE to have got that barn built, for Eben'll never get it right. But anyhow, now that you've eased your mind, Jim, put on a smile and tell me something interesting,' Well, there it was. They'd been so scared to tell him and he knew it all the time. Strange how nature looks out for us, ain't it, and lets us know what we should know when the time comes? Did I never tell you the yarn about Henry getting the fish hook in his nose, Mistress Blythe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{conversation}} occurred {{the night}} before I went back to town. I settled on the morrow to take a late train, so that I had still my morning to spend at Folkestone, where during {{the greater part of}} it I was out with my mother. Every one in the place was as usual out with some one else, and even had I been free to go and take leave of her I should have been sure that Flora Saunt would not be at home. Just where she was I presently discovered: she was {{at the far end of}} the cliff, the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of Sandgate and Hythe. Her back however was turned to this attraction; it rested with the aid of her elbows, thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears, on the high rail that inclosed the down. Two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn't see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figure-piece submitted to them. I was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person, with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape, with her eternal idleness, her eternal happiness, her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet, which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foreground--I was reminded anew, I say, how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn't explain and that the mention of her lapses didn't affect. Where she was amiss nothing counted, and where she was right everything did. I say she was wanting in mystery, but that after all was her secret. This happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother, who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which, when she should have quitted those she loved, she could still trust to make the world good for them. I wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust Flora Saunt, and then while the chair stood still and she waited <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> asked the girl to come and speak to her. In this way I saw that if one of Flora's attendants was the inevitable young Hammond Synge, master of ceremonies of her regular court, always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar, the other was a personage I had not yet encountered, a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers, whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained. I remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender: I scarcely know why, unless because of the motive I felt in the stare he fixed on me when I asked Miss Saunt to come away. He struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of [...] "impertinence"; but it didn't matter, for Flora came away with alacrity, bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments, as a painter could take heed, strike one always as the same obscure elegance. She seated herself on the floor of my mother's chair, a little too much on her right instep as I afterwards gathered, caressing her stiff hand, smiling up into her cold face, commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt. She told her immediately, as if it were something for her to hold on by, that she was soon to sit to me for a [...] "likeness," [...] and these words gave me a chance to inquire if it would be the fate of the picture, should I finish it, to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers. Her lips, at this, parted in a stare; her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadow-patches on the sea. She showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask, and I remembered for the inconsequence of it what Mrs. Meldrum had said about her sight. I had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her, but that didn't seem exactly kind; so I substituted another question, inquired who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the Hospital, <b>and</b> {{saw these}} unfortunate mothers lying in bed, {{each of them}} with her infant in a cot beside her. Although their {{immediate}} trial was over, these poor girls looked very sad.|$|R
60|$|Then we crept back, {{and once}} more I took the lead to crawl round under the ledge so we could come up about even with them. Here I found the hardest going yet. I came to a wind-worn crack in the thin ledge, and from this I could just see {{the tips of the}} antlers. I beckoned the others. Laboriously they climbed. R.C. <b>went</b> through first. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> next, <b>and</b> then came Teague.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't know. <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> <b>over</b> there <b>and</b> dance {{again as}} I used to, but being sick {{has made me}} ugly, so they won't have me, {{and no one else}} will take me because I have been there once.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... “During the war I got {{interested}} in Europe. Afterward <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{made a lot of}} sketches, especially in France, Italy, and England. More recently we’ve been to Portugal and Ireland.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Rudd toured as {{a member}} of Nick Barker & the Reptiles before joining, Southpoor, with Justin Garner (vocals, guitar) (ex-Nick Costa Band, Nick Barker & the Reptiles), Jad Green (drums), and Bill Rankine (guitar, vocals). On 1 December 2007 Southpoor {{released}} its debut album, What Doesn't Kill Ya..., on Mixmaster Records, with Barker and Mick Wordley co-producing. Rudd described his work outside of Superjesus, [...] "I was doing the Nick Barker tour which was great fun! <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> played some shows with him in Melbourne and also in Adelaide.
