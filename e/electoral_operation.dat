He did however object to the possible use by Kiley of the term Coalition candidate, as he (Cohen) had received no approach from the Whitechapel Liberal and Radical Association about the selection of a candidate.

It does not appear that the exact assurances Beck was demanding were made officially. Collins was never made a minister but he did state publicly in the run-up to the by-election that his sole policy was to give unflinching support to the government in the successful prosecution of the war and that he was willing to defer any matters of party political conflict until after the war.

40|$|The last {{special issue}} of Representation (40 : 2) {{presented}} an important collection of articles monitoring the electoral fortunes of radical right parties in many countries of Western Europe, particularly the role of electoral systems in contributing towards their rise. The opening piece by Elisabeth Carter (2004) provided a comprehensive classification of electoral systems used in 14 Western European nations compared with the mean vote for 33 right-wing extremist parties from 1979 - 2002. The results of Carter’s research {{appeared to be a}} striking refutation of the conventional wisdom: “Contrary to prevalent assumptions, the share of the vote won by the West European parties of the extreme right in the period 1979 - 2002 appears unrelated to the type of <b>electoral</b> system in <b>operation</b> in the various countries. This finding is both intriguing and important. ” (p. 93). Majoritarian electoral rules, it appeared, do not depress popular support for these extremist parties. This study is not the first to make this observation. An earlier book by Herbert Kitschelt (1995) also concluded that countries with PR display starkly contrasting shares of the vote by the radical right, so the basic type of electoral system could not be blamed for their rise: “While electoral laws have a non-negligible impact on party formation and the fragmentation of part...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers a}} survey about the {{political}} life in my home country Lebanon where I have approached the different political parties and the political families that {{were involved in the}} social and political life dating back to the Lebanese independence, in addition to the tight relation between politics and religions, which constitutes the pillars of our political regime. Before getting core of my thesis, I highlighte and the scientific approach among which I tackled the history of the political parties and families My thesis is divided into 3 chapters: Chapter 1 : In the first section, I defined the concept of a party and its creation in the western side of the globe and the Arabic East in addition to the ideological transfer from West to East. I tackled as well the adaptation of the East to this eastern understanding of political parties within its environment and society. The second section tackles the creation of the civil society in the West and its adoption in the eastern region especially in Lebanon, which allows the development of the social life by authorizing the creation of political parties and communities. I discussed as well the creation of the political parties in the West {{and its impact on the}} East and the role of freedom and democracy in allowing the creation of civil and non-political communities. Regarding Chapter 2, I tackled the history of the communities and the political parties in Lebanon stressing on those who had high impact on the national and regional political situation dating back to World War I and passing through the French mandate period and the Lebanese independence until the civil war. I have shown the situation of the Lebanese parties and their division nowadays into 2 blocs inside the community, each founding its principles based on the 18 religions recognized in Lebanon. In this Chapter, there is a clear picture about the tight relation between religion and politics, the latter based on religion instead of citizenship and civil secularism. In the last Chapter, I approached the concept of the Lebanese political families involved in politics and public affairs acquiring official positions in the government but on the other hand offering social, cultural and educational services to their communities. In my country, those services are called clientele services where the family offers its help to the citizens in exchange of their vote during the elections. In this regard, I have mentioned 3 standards political families, their foundation and most important personalities in addition to their roles in politics. I have also tackled the role of the Lebanese political families in the political life and their contribution in reaching our independence in addition to their perseverance in protection our liberty until nowadays despite the hard phases my country have gone through. In the second section from this chapter, I have landed into the history of the foundation of the Lebanese Parliament and its principles, the <b>electoral</b> voting <b>operation</b> of its members upon religious law instead of civil and the development of the electoral law that have differed from a round to another. At the end of the chapter, I have focused on the political families that have founded political parties in order to organize their political activities attracting supporters that follow the same ideas and political ideology. I have also focused on the historical and current role of these parties on the Lebanese scene and their impact on the Lebanese community who majorly belong to the families of those parties. In the conclusion of my thesis, I have recapitulated the 3 chapters with my personal opinion to constitute a Lebanese state based on secularism instead of religion despite the diversified religions inside the Lebanese society...|$|R
