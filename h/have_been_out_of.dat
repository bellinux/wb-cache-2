5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} he seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E
5|$|William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist {{considered}} {{in his day}} the equal of Dickens, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches {{is the only one}} of his 40 novels never to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.|$|E
5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

25|$|After {{independence}} of India, {{there was a}} backlash against Western fashions due to their association with the previous colonialist regime. Instead, professional Indian men began wearing the five button Nehru suit, made from khadi to support the local textile industry. During the 1960s, these suits became fashionable among the British mod subculture due to their use by The Beatles. These made a brief comeback during the mid 2000s, but since 2010 they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion in the West.|$|E

Steve Gatto in The Real Wyatt Earp: A Documentary Biography cites {{evidence that}} Brocius may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the territory {{at the time}} of the supposed death. This is backed by a December 1881 indictment by the Cochise County Grand Jury for theft of 19 cattle on Curly Bill. Further supported by Sheriff John Behan's filing for expenses in February 1882, for his deputies going to El Paso, Texas, after reports that he was seen there.|$|E
25|$|Turkey has a {{moderate}} level of female unemployment {{relative to other}} Muslim countries. In 2008, 11.6% of women were unemployed. By 2010, this number crept up to 13.0%. However, long-term employment is {{a significant portion of}} female unemployment. In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> work for more than one year. Very little data exists on the long-term unemployment rates of women for most nations and for Middle Eastern nations in particular.|$|E
25|$|There {{were serious}} crimes {{committed}} in the islands that would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in the 1930s or 1950’s, including murder, rape and assault, however the numbers were not high and the island police worked with the German military police if a soldier was involved, to apprehend and punish culprits. By 1945 morals had fallen due to hunger, it caused a dramatic rise in crimes of theft of food, {{in the last week}} of April 1945 there were 235 cases of theft reported to the police in Guernsey.|$|E

Until 2006, the effects included a damaged gas tank firing a large flame approximately every 10 minutes, but the gas tank no longer operates because the cylinders that were used to fuel the flame were removed {{to make way for the}} construction of Stealth.

25|$|The Hall of Busts houses marble busts of {{the many}} Presidents of Argentina, made by diverse artists both {{national}} and international.

25|$|The rising tone {{of panic}} in these {{messages}} convinced Broome {{and every other}} recipient that Tirpitz was approaching. Since {{the first of the}} messages was not directly addressed to Broome, he was not immediately aware that the cruisers were withdrawing. In fact, although they should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of the convoy, because of navigational errors they were clearly visible as they worked up to full speed. Convinced that the cruisers were about to engage enemy ships, Broome collected the miscellany of destroyers in EG1 and attached them to the cruisers, while the convoy scattered.|$|E
25|$|Expectations {{created for}} the car during the run up to its {{production}} may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> proportion with its realised success. A 2008 study, by Indian rating agency CRISIL, thought the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%, but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian consumer to the offering; sales {{in the first two}} fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units although Tata appears intent on maintaining a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise.|$|E
25|$|According to Eichar's theory, the {{infrasound}} {{generated by}} the wind as it passed {{over the top of}} the Holatchahl mountain was responsible for causing physical discomfort and mental distress in the hikers. Eichar claims that, because of their panic, the hikers were driven to leave the tent by whatever means necessary, and fled down the slope. By the time they were further down the hill, they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the infrasound's path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would be unable to return to their shelter. The traumatic injuries suffered by three of the victims were the result of their stumbling over the ledge of a ravine in the darkness and landing on the rocks at the bottom.|$|E

25|$|It may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this {{atmosphere}} {{that there was}} formed a tradition which, going underground for centuries and suffering transformations in the process, appeared in the Middle Ages as the Ars Notoria, a magical art of memory attributed to Apollonius or sometimes to Solomon. The practitioner of the Ars Notoria gazed at figures or diagrams curiously marked and called 'notae' whilst reciting magical prayers. He hoped to gain in this way knowledge, or memory, of all the arts and sciences, a different 'nota' being provided for each discipline. The Ars Notoria is perhaps a descendant of the classical art of memory, or of that difficult branch of it which used the shorthand notae. It {{was regarded as a}} particularly black kind of magic and was severely condemned by Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} film, the plot does {{not focus on}} the series' ongoing {{extraterrestrial}} based mytharc themes, but instead works as a standalone thriller horror story, similar {{to many of the}} monster-of-the-week episodes that were frequently seen in the TV series. The story follows Mulder and Scully who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the FBI for several years, with Mulder living in isolation as a fugitive from the organization and Scully having become a doctor at a Catholic-run hospital, where she has formed a friendly relationship with a seriously ill patient. When an FBI agent is mysteriously kidnapped, and a former priest who has been convicted of being a child molester claims to be experiencing psychic visions of the endangered agent, Mulder and Scully reluctantly accept the FBI's request for their particular paranormal expertise on the case.|$|E
25|$|John's {{marriage}} {{was never a}} happy one. Rumors circulated that {{at the age of}} 25 {{he fell in love with}} Eugênia José de Menezes, his wife's chaperone. She became pregnant, and John was suspected of being the father. The case was hushed up, and the young woman was sent to Spain to bear the child. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is unknown. The mother lived the rest of her life in nunneries and John supported her economically. Historians Tobias Monteiro and Patrick Wilcken write that there are indications that John also had a homosexual relationship as a sexual outlet, given his disastrous marriage, in which he lived apart from his wife, with whom he was together only on ceremonial occasions. His partner in this relationship would have been his favorite manservant, Francisco José Rufino de Sousa Lobato, who, according to these historians, may have regularly masturbated his master. While it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sheer malice, a priest named Miguel stated that he once stumbled upon the scene and therefore was deported to Angola, but not before leaving written testimony. Regardless of the truth or falsity of the claim, Rufino de Sousa received a variety of honors, accumulating among others the charges of adviser to the king, secretary of the Casa do Infantado, secretary of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders (Mesa de Consciência e Ordens) and governor of the Santa Cruz fortress. He also received the title of Baron and later Viscount of Vila Nova da Rainha.|$|E
