5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, {{but then in}} electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and eventually pure silver. Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a deterioration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king to respond to this crisis by issuing a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance {{of a change in}} venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{paucity of}} {{published}} data on {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) seroprevalence among migrant workers entering Middle-East particularly Kuwait. We {{took advantage of the}} routine screening of migrants for HIV infection, upon arrival <b>in</b> Kuwait from <b>the</b> areas with high HIV prevalence, to 1) estimate the HIV seroprevalence among migrant workers entering Kuwait and to 2) ascertain if any significant time trend or changes had occurred in HIV seroprevalence among these migrants over the study period. Methods The monthly aggregates of daily number of migrant workers tested and number of HIV seropositive were used to generate <b>the</b> monthly series <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive (per 100, 000) migrants over a period of 120 months from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006. We carried out spectral analysis of these time series data on monthly proportions (per 100, 000) of HIV seropositive migrants. Results Overall HIV seroprevalence (per 100, 000) among the migrants was 21 (494 / 2328582) (95 % CI: 19 - 23), ranging from 11 (95 % CI: 8 – 16) in 2003 to 31 (95 % CI: 24 - 41) in 1998. There was no discernable pattern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year-specific <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive migrants up to 2003; in subsequent years there was a slight but consistent increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive migrants. However, the Mann-Kendall test showed non-significant (P = 0. 741) trend in de-seasonalized data series <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive migrants. The spectral density had a statistically significant (P = 0. 03) peak located at a frequency (radians) 2. 4, which corresponds to a regular cycle of three-month duration in this study. Auto-correlation function did not show any significant seasonality (correlation coefficient at lag 12 = – 0. 025, P = 0. 575). Conclusion During the study period, overall a low HIV seroprevalence (0. 021 %) was recorded. Towards the end of the study, a slight but non-significant upward trend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive migrants was recorded. A significant rhythmic cycle of three-month duration was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive migrants. The underlying factors for a consistent upward trend towards the end of study period and for a significant quarterly cycle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> HIV seropositive migrants merit further investigations. </p...|$|R
