This article makes the case for a multi-dimensional approach to compliance research and provides a cross-national assessment of financial compliance in EU Cohesion policy, employing quantitative and qualitative methods. To account for cross-national variations in the application of <b>financial</b> <b>corrections</b> for non-compliant spending, several factors are explored, focusing on regional autonomy, administrative capacity and goodness-of-fit. The quantitative analysis finds strong support for the impact of administrative capacity on cross-national compliance patterns and some evidence for the role of goodness-of-fit. Contrary to expectations, regional autonomy is not associated with compliance in this critical case of EU multi-level governance. Qualitative analysis reinforces these findings and reveals additional factors of relevance...|$|E

40|$|Investors' {{attitude}} towards risk {{is a key}} factor driving the movement in asset prices. Global reduction in investors' risk appetite has coincided with episodes of global <b>financial</b> market <b>correction.</b> In this paper, we derive a measure for risk appetite based on the methodology of Gai and Vause (2006) for investors in the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, and Hong Kong, {{and use them to}} help assess the issues of financial integration and financial market interdependence. Indicators are constructed to gauge the relationship between the risk appetite and the extent of financial integration between these stock markets. The results from the indicators point to very limited financial integration between these five financial markets. Furthermore, the degree of co-movement between risk appetite measures and the stock and bond market performance is examined using the dynamic conditional correlation. The empirical results reveal that there exists interdependence between the changes in the risk appetite and the stock market returns in the US, Japan and Hong Kong, while the "flight-to-quality" phenomenon is apparent in the bond market of the five economies.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of oil in}} the world economy explains why considerable effort has been devoted to the development of different types of econometric models for oil price forecasting. Several specifications have been proposed in the economic literature. Some are based on financial theory and concentrate on the relationship between spot and futures prices ("financial" models). Others assign a key role to variables explaining the characteristics of the physical oil market ("structural" models). The empirical literature is very far from any consensus about the appropriate model for oil price forecasting that should be implemented. Relative to the previous literature, this paper is novel in several respects. First of all, we test and systematically evaluate the ability of several alternative econometric specifications proposed in the literature to capture the dynamics of oil prices. Second, we analyse the effects of different data frequencies on the coefficient estimates and forecasts obtained using each selected econometric specification. Third, we compare different models at different data frequencies on a common sample and common data. Fourth, we evaluate the forecasting performance of each selected model using static and dynamic forecasts, as well as different measures of forecast errors. Finally, we propose a new class of models which combine the relevant aspects of the financial and structural specifications proposed in the literature ("mixed" models). Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. Financial models in levels do not produce satisfactory forecasts for the WTI spot price. The <b>financial</b> error <b>correction</b> model yields accurate in-sample forecasts. Real and strategic variables alone are insufficient to capture the oil spot price dynamics in the forecasting sample. Our proposed mixed models are statistically adequate and exhibit accurate forecasts. Different data frequencies seem to affect the forecasting ability of the models under analysis...|$|R

I also acknowledge partial financial support from Deakin University’s Faculty of Business and Law Developing Researcher Grant. Financial Development, Shocks and Growth Volatility In this paper, we argue that study {{of the effect of}} financial development and shocks on aggregate growth volatility will not be informative because they affect growth volatility through its different components. Financial development affects only the business cycle component of volatility and therefore, the effect on total volatility is dependent on its share in total volatility. On the contrary, shocks affect total volatility through its both long run and business cycle components. We use spectral method to extract different components of growth volatility. Empirical evidence provides qualified support for both hypotheses. Higher private credit, which is used as proxy of financial development, dampens business cycle volatility but not the long run component of volatility. Shocks as measured by changes in the terms of trade affect both business cycle and long run components of volatility negatively.

40|$|Despite being a {{very hot}} subject in the public debate, the causes behind the {{increase}} in social assistance (SA) in the 1990 s are relatively unknown. In this paper, I try to investigate if the increase is in part {{a result of an}} increase in the propensity to receive SA. Despite what is usually argued in the public debate, I find no evidence of a general increase in the mentioned propensity in Sweden during the period 1990 to 1995. But although {{there is no evidence of}} an increased propensity to receive SA, some behavioural changes seem to have occurred. First, I find evidence that the recipients may be subjected to tougher judgement criteria in 1995 than in the 1990, something that could mask a possible increase in the studied propensity in the empirical analysis. Second, the propensity to become a SA recipient has increased among people with university education. Thirdly the propensity to receive SA among young people seems to be lower in 1995 than in 1990 but this may be due to a tougher attitude shown by the authorities that is particularly affecting this group. 1 I want to thank P.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{studying}} {{the effect of}} financial development and shocks on aggregate growth volatility will not be informative because they affect growth volatility through its different components. Volatility declines either a consequence {{of a change in}} the nature of shocks or a change in how the economy reacts to shocks. If two economies differ only in terms of volatility of shocks experienced, the GDP growth spectrum of one economy will lie proportionately below that of another at all frequency ranges so that both business cycle and long-run variances will be lower. Conversely, if change in volatility is due to propagation mechanism such as financial development, a country having developed financial markets will have disproportionately lower variance at the business cycle than at other frequencies relative to that of a country having less developed financial markets. Therefore, the variance at only the business cycle frequency range will be influenced by financial development. The novelty of this paper is that different components of growth volatility are extracted using spectral method. Empirical evidence provides qualified support for both hypotheses. Higher private credit, which is used as proxy of financial development, dampens business cycle volatility but not the long-run volatility. Shocks, as measured by changes in the terms of trade, affect both business cycle and long-run volatility negatively. These results are robust to alternative market-based measure of <b>financial</b> development, and <b>corrections</b> for reverse causality. These results have important implications for growth theory as they shed lights on the factors causing permanent and transitory deviations from the steady state. ...|$|R

40|$|If {{there was}} a cup given for being the most-talked-about aspect of the weather, the El Niño {{phenomenon}} would win it this year. It {{comes at a time}} when climate change is being seen more and more as part of daily life (see Viewpoint in Spore 74). El Niño is the name given to the warming of the Pacific waters every few years off the west coast of South America, and the phenomenon has been observed for several hundred years. Typically it occurs around Christmas time, hence the name 'El Niño,' Spanish for 'the baby boy'. The cause of El Niño is not fully understood, but the effects are well documented. The main consequence is to cause precipitation patterns around the world (mainly in the tropics) to shift. Regions that are normally quite wet (such as the Indonesian archipelago) experience drought while other places that are normally dry (such as the Galapagos islands) experience unusually wet conditions. The recent El Niño has been blamed for an ever-growing list of calamities: drought and fires in the Philippines, floods in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya; tornadoes in the Caribbean, famine in Papua New Guinea and Sudan. From the slopes of the Andes mountains to Japan, passing through southern Africa, El Niño has upset the seasons. The particularly severe and long-term effects of the latest El Niño winds caused massive problems for farmers, traders, health workers, and consumers across the globe, and more of the same is expected in the future. Countries with weak infrastructure are more affected, as is always the case with natural disasters, but there appears to be some hope for alleviating the worst effects of the adverse weather by good advance planning and the use of forecasting systems. Experts estimate that for this season El Niño has caused billions of dollars worth of damage, the loss of crops, and has led to higher food prices. Its effect on trade has been clear in some countries: heavy rains in Kenya curtailed production of fine beans, a high return export, but Uganda and Bangladesh benefited when importers had to seek alternative supplies. Mango crops were washed away by heavy rains in Central and South America but Puerto Rico in the Caribbean began its harvest six weeks earlier because the warm weather encouraged early flowering and fruit production. South Africa's dry season meant good production and fewer disease problems. The Kenya Tea Development Authority advised farmers to take advantage of the higher returns possible following El Niño rains, which had increased tea production. In many places where the changes brought more water, pests and diseases flourished. Nairobi fly and Rift Valley Fever erupted in parts of East Africa and El Niño was blamed for swarms of locust in Madagascar. The effect on cattle, goats and people in Kenya was severe, with hundreds of deaths reported, after floods isolated a normally accessible arid part of the country. Forewarned is forearmed Better planning can help. Earlier this year, the Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister in South Africa said that he was not overly worried about El Niño but more concerned about whether farmers and the agricultural sector in general were prepared for disasters ? they should not assume that the government had a huge pot of money to bail them out. The correct approach is to plan ahead to meet the disasters, he said, and many farmers had already taken the initiative through careful <b>financial</b> planning, <b>corrections</b> for marketing, appropriate choice of land on which to plant and careful choice of cultivars in consideration of El Niño. A global atlas has been produced by the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI), together with the Government of Japan and the University of Utah, to help identify the agroclimatic conditions appropriate to specific crops. As water becomes more scarce, the IIMI believes the atlas will be of increasing use in identifying appropriate crops for specific areas. Researchers elsewhere, working with farmers in South America using long-term forecasting to help plan crop husbandry activities, have already yielded promising results. El Niño has been blamed for events that are sometimes unrelated anomalies ? its bad behaviour seems to be helping to focus efforts across a wide front of activity, sometimes outside the scope of the phenomenon everyone loves to hate. Maybe the Zimbabwean tease about El Niño ? El Nonsense, they call it ? in some cases, rings true.

40|$|The {{last ten}} years have been {{extremely}} challenging for both researchers in monetary economics and policymakers. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2009, {{in spite of its}} size and severity, was initially widely perceived in the Euro Area (EA) as an imported and transitory crisis: it was frequently predicted that the EA economy would recover once the US and the World Economy rebounded. Instead, after a brief period of recovery, the Euro Area was hit by the Sovereign Debt Crisis of 2011 - 12, a domestic crisis which widened the divide already existing between core and peripheral countries up to the point of threatening a break-up of the euro. Thanks to the bold monetary policy response of the ECB this fear gradually vanished, but the sudden fall in oil price and the uncertain economic outlook led to the low inflation period, particularly severe in the EA, in which inflation, both in terms of headline and core measures, is well below the ECB target of 2 %. This prompted the ECB to launch its Quantitative Easing program, at the beginning of 2015, much later than what the FED implemented to offset the impact of the 2007 - 09 crisis. This dissertation consists of two different but interlinked parts, which contribute to the empirical literature on monetary policy, low inflation and the business cycle. The first part is composed by Chapters I and II, and it is devoted to analyse the EA economy, both before the Global Financial Crisis and during the most recent low inflation period. The second one, composed by Chapters III and IV, focuses on the US economy to evaluate the possible negative consequences of the extraordinary monetary stimulus undertaken by the FED. In particular, we study the risks for both price and financial stability {{of the effects of the}} so called lift-off, i. e. the gradual normalization of monetary stance. In the first Chapter, we provide novel evidence on the different effects of the ECB common monetary policy on euro-area core and peripheral countries even before the eruption of the crisis. We estimate a structural dynamic factor model on a large panel of Euro Area quarterly variables to take into account both the comovement and the heterogeneity in the EA business cycle, and we then simulate the model to investigate the possible existence of asymmetric effects of ECB monetary policy on member states' economies. Data stop before the eruption of the Global Financial Crisis in order to only assess conventional monetary shocks, which are identified by means of sign restrictions. Although the introduction of the euro has changed the monetary transmission mechanism in the individual countries towards a more homogeneous response, we find that differences still remain between North and South Europe in terms of prices and unemployment. These results are the consequence of country-specific structures, rather than of European Central Bank policies. In the second Chapter we use a Bayesian VAR model to analyse the transmission of global and domestic shocks in the euro area, with a particular focus on the drivers of inflation, especiallyin the recent period labeled as low inflation. We identify several shocks by means of sign restrictions, and we account for the role of ECB unconventional monetary policies by using a shadow interest rate. We document that the recent low inflation phase was not entirely attributable to falling oil prices, but also to slack in economic activity and to insufficiently expansionary monetary policy, because of the Zero Lower Bound of interest rates. Interestingly, we show that the launch of the ECB Quantitative Easing turned the monetary stance into more accommodative, preventing deflationary outcomes. In the third Chapter we provide an empirical evaluation of the existence of a "dark side" of monetary policy, i. e. the possibility that credit spreads abruptly rise following a monetary tightening, after being compressed by an extraordinary period of monetary easing. This would create a problematic trade [...] off for the central bank, as temporary monetary expansions might at once stimulate the economy and sow the seeds of abrupt and costly <b>financial</b> market <b>corrections</b> in the future in terms of risks for financial stability (Stein, 2014). We investigate this possibility using data for the US by exploiting non-linear methods to examine the propagation of monetary shocks through US corporate bond markets. Across different methodologies, we find that the transmission of monetary shocks is mostly symmetric. What is asymmetric is instead the impact of macroeconomic data releases: spreads respond more to bad news. Crucially, these responses anticipate economic slowdowns rather than causing them directly. However, empirical evidence points to the possibility of larger effects of expansionary monetary shocks depending on (i) the type of non-linear estimation technique (ii) the identification of the shock and (iii) the inclusion of unconventional measures in the analysis. Finally, in the fourth Chapter, we ask whether the FED has riskily delayed the exit from its large monetary easing, increasing the probability of a future inflationary burst. We do so by means of medium and larger scale Bayesian VAR, which we use for both structural analysis, i. e. the evaluation of monetary policy shocks, and forecasting, i. e. the running of counterfactuals and scenario analysis. We show that expansionary monetary policy did not trigger a large deviation of inflation from its steady state. Furthermore, the FED monetary stance is totally in line with the concurrent macroeconomic dynamics. Last, our model predicts that US core inflation will lie well below its 2 % target in 2017, a finding only recently acknowledged by the FOMC projections.
