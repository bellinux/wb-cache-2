Prior to Nilsen's trial, Dr. Bowden had interviewed the defendant on 16 separate occasions in interviews totalling over 14 hours.

25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in <b>forming</b> <b>relationships</b> or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E

2500|$|As {{they were}} on Suede, {{elements}} of Anderson's lyrics were influenced by his drug use, citing William Blake as a big influence on his writing style. He became fascinated with his use of visions and trance-like states {{as a means of}} creation, claiming that much of the [...] "fragmented imagery" [...] on [...] "Introducing the Band" [...] was the result of letting his subconscious take over. The song was a mantra he wrote after visiting a Buddhist temple in Japan. Lewis Carroll was an influence on the lyrics, who Anderson was reading at the time. There was also an Orwellian tone, which permeated into the second song [...] "We Are the Pigs". Lead single [...] "We Are the Pigs" [...] depicts Anderson's visions of Armageddon and riots in the streets. The song also features horns that are reminiscent of those used in the theme music from Peter Gunn. Anderson's lyrical subjects became exclusively tragic figures, such as the addicted teenager in [...] "Heroine", and James Dean in [...] "Daddy's Speeding". Both songs, according to Anderson, introduce the themes of isolation where the obsession is <b>forming</b> <b>relationships</b> with fantasy figures, as opposed to real people.|$|E
