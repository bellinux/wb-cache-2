5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica {{in his left}} leg, and chronic nausea; {{by the summer of}} 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood. After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell's works and his letters.|$|E
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced {{risk of breast cancer}} for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt {{in a flat}} at 8 Holly Hill, Hampstead, {{which was}} owned by the husband {{of one of her}} OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, {{as well as to the}} British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E

5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E

25|$|The last {{match was}} one of the most enthralling one in tournament so far with Russian Vera Zvonareva taking on Pole Agnieszka Radwańska.

This one would be much different. It took just 35 minutes for the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to win the first set, 6–1; Radwańska, the No.8 seed, retaliated with a 6–2 second set. An aggressive Zvonareva regrouped and got to double match point at 5–3, 40–15 in the third set but missed down-the-lines on both of those, then lost an extended exchange on her third match point in the same game. She would eventually lose to Radwańska for a fourth straight time, 1–6, 6–2 7–5.|$|E

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1844, Brook Farmers {{were offered}} the {{possibility}} of taking over two Associationism-inspired publications, Brisbane's The Phalanx and John Allen's The Social Reformer.

Ultimately, the Brook Farmers published a new journal combining the two, The Harbinger. The journal's first issue was published June 14, 1845, and was continuously printed, originally weekly, until October 1847, when it was relocated to New York City, still under the oversight of George Ripley and fellow Brook Farmer Charles Anderson Dana. Naming the publication, however, {{turned out to be a}} difficult task. Parke Godwin offered advice when it was suggested to keep the name The Phalanx: ...|$|E
500|$|The silky sifaka was {{initially}} described in 1871 by French naturalist Alfred Grandidier in a formally published letter to French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. [...] Grandidier's description {{was based on}} his own observations north of Antongil Bay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1870. [...] He then named the species Propithecus candidus due to its white color, which he likened to that of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), but without the dark fur on its head or the ash-colored spot on the back. [...] The first specimen was obtained in 1872 and provided by a [...] "Monsieur Guinet", a planter from Sambava. [...] The specimen allowed both Grandidier and Milne-Edwards to more thoroughly describe the species based on its skin, coat, and skull. [...] Upon those findings, they changed the name to P.sericeus. Upon further review in 1875, Grandidier demoted the silky sifaka to a variety or [...] "race" [...] of the diademed sifaka. By the time German zoologist Ernst Schwarz standardized lemur taxonomy in 1931, P.sericeus had become a taxonomic synonym for the species, with the original name, Propithecus candidus, taking priority.|$|E
