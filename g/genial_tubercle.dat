40|$|Fractures and {{displacement}} of fragments involving the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> due to trauma are rarely seen {{in patients with}} {{a full complement of}} teeth although spontaneous fractures of the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> in edentulous atrophic mandible are not uncommon. These are usually displaced and may be missed during routine clinical and radiographic examinations owing to superimposition of the features of a fractured mandible. Very few cases have been reported till date. Their implications lie in functional alterations that occur as a consequence of loss of attachment of the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles. There is no universal opinion on the treatment of fractures involving the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles.</b> Possible treatments include no surgical intervention, excision of the avulsed bone fragments, and muscular repositioning. We present a case of mandibular fracture associated with the fracture and {{displacement of}} a fragment involving the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> in a dentate patient where in the finding was incidental and a review of literature...|$|R
40|$|Fracture of the mandibular <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> is an {{uncommon}} pathology affecting edentulous patients with severe maxillary atrophy. Usually occurs spontaneously which complicates the diagnosis. Their importance {{lies in the}} functional alterations, which occur {{as a consequence of}} the disinsertion of the genihyoid and genioglossus muscles. The treatment of fracture of the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> is controversial, including no surgical intervention, excision of the avulsed bone fragments, and muscular repositioning. There have been only 11 cases reported in the literature of this fracture, most of them spontaneous. We present a difficult diagnosis situation of spontaneous fracture of the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> in an 86 -year-old edentulous female with a painful sublingual and submental hematoma and anterior cervical echimosis. Computerized Tomography should be made to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical treatment was not necessary, and follow-up at 6 months revealed complete symptomatic recovery, and full return of function...|$|R
40|$|The lingual foramen in the midline of the {{mandible}} causes {{confusion in}} terminology, incidence of occurrence and contents. A survey of 314 dried mandibles showed the foramen {{to be present}} in 311 specimens (99. 04 %). Sectioning of cadaver specimens illustrated a canal traversing the bone to approximately 50 % of the buccolingual dimension of the mandible. The contents of the foramen were found to be an artery, which was an anastomosis of the sublingual branches of the right and left lingual arteries. Wire markers were placed in the foramen and the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> were covered with lead foil to illustrate the radiographic relationship between them. The radio-opacity peripheral to the foramen as seen on a radiograph is produced by the wall of the canal and not the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> as previously reported. While the foramen is not seen on many radiographs of the lower incisor region, this can be accounted for by a change in orientation of the x-ray beam. A pilot study revealed an incidence of 49 % of the lingual foramen on periapical radiographs of the mandibular incisor region in an adult population, the previous reported incidence being 28 %...|$|R
50|$|Tongue muscles (genioglossus, geniohyoid and others) are {{attached}} to the lower jaw below the teeth. During a genioglossus advancement procedure, the surgeon cuts a small window or bone cut in the front part of the lower jaw (mandible) {{at the level of the}} geniotubercle where the genioglossus muscle attaches. This piece of bone, along with the attachment for the tongue (<b>genial</b> <b>tubercle)</b> is pulled forward and subsequently secured to the lower jaw, usually with a single screw or with a plate and screws.|$|E
5000|$|A mental spine {{is a small}} {{projection}} of bone on the posterior aspect of the mandible (lower jaw bone) in the midline. The adjective [...] in this instance is used in its [...] "chin-related" [...] sense (from Latin mentum) rather than its more common [...] "mind-related" [...] sense (from Latin mens). There are usually four mental spines: two superior and two inferior. Collectively they are {{also known as the}} <b>genial</b> <b>tubercle,</b> genial apophysis and the Latin name spinae mentalis. The inferior mental spines are the points of origin of the geniohyoid muscle, one of the suprahyoid muscles and the superior mental spines are the origin of the genioglossus muscle, one of the muscles of the tongue.|$|E

40|$|The medial {{cortical}} {{surface of the}} mandible can be involved by tumour infiltration {{from the floor of}} the mouth. A detailed study of spread via accessory foramina through the edentulous alveolar crest has been previously undertaken, but no similar study has been carried out for the medial surface. In order to gain further appreciation of the mode of tumour spread, a study of the number and distribution of accessory foramina on the medial mandibular surface was performed on 89 mandibles. The number of foramina varied greatly from specimen to specimen. In the ascending ramus above the inferior dental foramen, 3 mandibles showed no foramina; the condylar section possessed the greatest proportion followed by the sigmoid and the coronoid. On the rest of the medial surface below the inferior dental foramen, all specimens showed at least 1 accessory foramen; the greatest concentration was in the middle third along the path of the inferior dental canal, followed by the upper third and the lower third section. Accessory foramina were repeatedly present at certain dedicated sites. The medial facing wall of the inferior dental foramen was found to be the commonest dedicated site (98. 3 %) followed by foramina {{on either side of the}} <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> (71. 9 %), the digastric fossa (71. 9 %) and the median foramen above the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> (64 %). The findings of this study are in keeping with the current observation that the lower border is least commonly involved in tumour spread. In view of the presence of accessory foramina along the inferior dental canal and especially on the medial facing wall of the inferior dental foramen, it is imperative to preclude tumour spread in this region prior to undertaking the conservative rim resection procedure. Medial to the symphysis the alveolar mucosa dips down almost to the level of the dedicated foramina in the vicinity of the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles.</b> As a general rule the attached muscle forms a barrier to tumour spread except in the later stages, however, in irradiated mandibles resistance to spread has been previously reported to be diminished. Under these circumstances, it is possible that the numerous accessory foramina reported in this study could facilitate a direct pathway into the cancellous bone...|$|R
40|$|The first 25 {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} high occlusal plane angulation, dysfunction, and pain who {{were treated with}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) total joint prostheses and simultaneous maxillomandibular counterclockwise rotation were evaluated before surgery (T 1), immediately after surgery (T 2), and at the longest follow-up (T 3) for surgical movements and long-term stability. Subjective ratings were used for patients' facial pain/headache, TMJ pain, jaw function, diet, and disability, and objective functional changes were determined by measuring maximum incisal opening and lateral excursive movements. Results showed that the areas of greatest surgical change included an average decrease in the occlusal plane of 13. 3 degrees with advancement at point B of 13. 4 mm and at the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles</b> of 16. 3 mm. At longest follow-up, relapse was 0. 7 degrees, 0. 8 mm, and 1. 2 mm, respectively, with no statistically significant changes. Significant subjective pain and dysfunction improvements were observed (P ≤ 0. 001). Maximum incisal opening increased, but lateral excursion decreased. Those who had two or more previous TMJ surgeries showed greater levels of dysfunction at T 1 and T 3 {{than those who had}} one or no previous surgeries, but otherwise patients presented similar amounts of absolute changes. In conclusion, end-stage TMJ patients can achieve significant improvement in their pain, dysfunction, dentofacial deformity, and airway problems in one operation with TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement using TMJ custom-made total joint prostheses and simultaneous maxillary osteotomies for maxillomandibular counter-clockwise rotation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the mandibular lingual foramina (LF) and canals and their anatomic variations using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) technology in a Lebanese population. Materials and Methods: In this study, we analyzed CBCT images of 90 adult Lebanese patients (41 males and 49 females). We assessed the number and location of the LF. In additional, we measured: (a) The distance from both the alveolar crest and the inferior border of the mandible to the LF and (b) the length of the lingual canals (LCs). The data obtained was analyzed statistically using Shapiro–Wilk normality test, t-test, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. Statistical significance was set at 0. 05. Results: In our sample, the LF and canals were present in 93. 33 % of the CBCT analyzed, and the majority (76. 64 %) was located above the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercles.</b> The distance from the foramen of the superior and the inferior LCs to the alveolar crest was 16. 24 ± 2. 82 mm and 25. 49 ± 2. 43 mm, respectively. The distance from the foramen of the superior canal to the inferior border of the mandible was 14 ± 2. 32 mm. The mean length of the superior canal was 5. 81 ± 1. 6 mm and 4. 25 ± 1. 2 mm for the inferior one. There were no gender-related differences in the anatomic characteristics of the LF and canals except for the distance measured from the superior canal foramina to the alveolar crest where the measurement was significantly greater in males compared to females. Neither the number of canals nor the positions of the foramina were different between males and females. Conclusion: Within the limits of this study, we concluded that in our sample of Lebanese adults, there was substantial variability in the LF and canals anatomy and location...|$|R
40|$|Context: It was {{suggested}} that the accessory neurovascular foramina of the mandible might be of significance {{in relation to the}} effectiveness of local anesthesia following the routine inferior alveolar nerve block. Aims: To investigate the incidence of neurovascular foramina over the lingual surface of the mandible in South Indian population. Settings and Design: The study was conducted at the department of anatomy. Materials and Methods: The study included 67 human adult dry mandibles, the exact ages and sexes of which were not known. The location and number of neurovascular foramina were topographically analyzed. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics. Results: The foramina were observed in 64 mandibles (95. 5 %) and were often multiple in most of the cases. They were located between the two medial incisors in 8 mandibles (1. 9 %), between the medial and lateral incisor in 34 mandibles (50. 7 %; 25 -bilateral; 7 -right; 2 -left), between the lateral incisor and canine in 7 mandibles (10. 4 %; 2 -bilateral; 3 -right; 2 -left), between the canine and first premolar in 6 cases (8. 9 %; 3 on each side). Foramina were also present around the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercle</b> in 56 mandibles (83. 6 %). Among them, 52 mandibles showed a single foramen just above the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercle,</b> 34 mandibles had foramina below the tubercles, 13 mandibles had foramina {{on the right side of}} <b>genial</b> <b>tubercle</b> and 17 were having on the left side. Conclusion: Since the anatomical details of these foramina are important to various fields of dentistry and oncology, the present investigation was undertaken. The clinical significance and implications are emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the past}} few decades, {{a number of studies}} have {{reported}} that accessory foramina are located on the internal aspect of the mandible, indicating their potential importance for effective and successful clinical procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate adult, infantile, and fetal human mandibles for occurrence of accessory foramina. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an attempt has been made to examine their particular co-location using a systematic approach and perspective. A total of 397 human mandibles, including 299 adult, 18 infantile, and 80 fetal, were investigated macroscopically for the frequency, position, and diameter of accessory foramina. In 96 % of investigated adult mandibles, at least one accessory foramen was found. Foramina were located either superior or inferior to the <b>genial</b> <b>tubercle,</b> as well as lateral to the tubercle. Bearing in mind their usual location, four different types of coexistence of foramina were dis-tinguished. Accessory foramina were also present in simi-lar locations in infantile and fetal mandibles. Accessory mandibular foramina are constant structures of human mandible. Their frequency, size, and location vary depending on the type of the foramen. Observations on children and fetal mandibles showed no significant differ-ences in evaluation of accessory foramina, with the exception of lower occurrence in this group of subjects...|$|E
40|$|Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) {{can cause}} {{ossification}} of ligaments and may affect the spine. We report a case of obstructive sleep apnea in a patient with significant upper airway narrowing secondary to cervical DISH. This patient had an initial apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 145 events/hour and was treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, <b>genial</b> <b>tubercle</b> advancement, hyoid suspension, septoplasty, inferior turbinoplasties, and radiofrequency ablations to the tongue base which reduced his AHI to 40 events/hour. He redeveloped symptoms, was started on positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, and later underwent a maxillomandibular advancement which improved his AHI to 16. 3 events/hour. A few years later his AHI was 100. 4 events/hour. His disease has gradually progressed over time and he was restarted on PAP therapy. Despite PAP titration, years of using PAP therapy, and being 100 percent compliant {{for the past three}} months (average daily use of 7. 6 hours/night), he has an AHI of 5. 1 events/hour and has persistent hypersomnia with an Epworth Sleep Scale questionnaire score of 18 / 24. At this time he is pending further hypersomnia work-up. DISH patients require prolonged follow-up to monitor the progression of disease, and they may require unconventional measures for adequate treatment of obstructive sleep apnea...|$|E
