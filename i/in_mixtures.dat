25|$|In the laboratory, THF is {{a popular}} solvent when its water {{miscibility}} is not an issue. It is more basic than diethyl ether and forms stronger complexes with Li+, Mg2+, and boranes. It {{is a popular}} solvent for hydroboration reactions and for organometallic compounds such as organolithium and Grignard reagents. Although similar to diethyl ether, THF is a stronger base. Thus, while diethyl ether remains the solvent of choice for some reactions (e.g., Grignard reactions), THF fills that role in many others, where strong coordination is desirable and the precise properties of ethereal solvents such as these (alone and <b>in</b> <b>mixtures</b> and at various temperatures) allows fine-tuning modern chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|Sparkling {{wines are}} served in {{particular}} glasses {{such as the}} flute and the coupe. The flute is the preferred glass for professional tasters: the shape concentrates the aromas to {{the nose of the}} taster and its height allows appreciation of the fine bubbles that rise to the surface. The coupe is not recommended because of its too flared shape: it does not preserve the layer of foam and the gas and aromas escape too fast. According to legend, this type of glass was developed based on the shape of the Breast of the Marquise de Pompadour. The coupe dates from a time when the wines were mostly sweeter and less aromatic. Since the 1930s and with the habit to consume drier sparkling wines, the flute has taken the place of the coupe. The coupe is also used <b>in</b> <b>mixtures</b> which have an olive in a bubbly cocktail and in the spectacular pyramids of glasses that crown festivities.|$|E

40|$|Development {{of theory}} has outpaced {{experimental}} tests for most maintenance of diversity mechanisms. Here we demonstrate how data from biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments {{can be used}} to determine the mechanisms that maintain plant species diversity. We hypothesized that grassland plant diversity is maintained by two classes of mechanisms: (1) equalizing mechanisms, which reduce asymmetric competition by reducing differences in monoculture biomass production among species <b>in</b> <b>mixture,</b> and (2) species interaction mechanisms, which increase overyielding by increasing niche partitioning and facilitation among species <b>in</b> <b>mixture.</b> Specifically, equalizing mechanisms reduce the coefficient of variation in monoculture biomass production among species <b>in</b> <b>mixture.</b> Species interaction mechanisms increase species overyielding <b>in</b> <b>mixture,</b> especially for low-biomass species. We tested these predictions with a seven-year data set from an experiment that varied grassland plant species evenness and richness. We used path analysis to model effects of these mechanisms on annual and multiyear changes in diversity. We found that diversity was frequently maintained by species interaction mechanisms and was infrequently maintained by equalizing mechanisms. Species interaction mechanisms maintained diversity by allowing the species that produced the least biomass in monoculture to benefit the most from species interactions <b>in</b> <b>mixture.</b> Equalizing mechanisms infrequently maintained diversity because asymmetric competition infrequently resulted in competitive exclusion. We propose that this mechanistic framework be used to better understand the specific processes that influence diversity...|$|R

30|$|As {{reported}} by Tuomela et al. (2000), the enzymatic capacity of actinobacteria to attack recalcitrant molecules explains their activity and their proliferation during the maturation stage.

40|$|Non-additive {{effects may}} occur when {{branching}} order-based fine roots decompose <b>in</b> <b>mixture,</b> {{due to their}} distinct chemical composition. However, these effects and how they respond to increased nitrogen (N) availability are poorly known. We conducted a 524 -day field litterbag experiment to examine the potential non-additive effects of order-based fine root decomposition and their responses to different rates of N addition in a Pinus elliottii (slash pine) plantation in China. The intact fine roots of slash pine trees were hierarchically dissected and split into two groups (lower-order roots (the first and second order roots) and higher-order roots (the third to fifth order roots)). The decomposition of these two root groups was monitored either separately or in 1 : 1 mixture. The non-additive effects did not occur when the two root groups decomposed <b>in</b> <b>mixture.</b> However, high rate of N addition shifted the root group interactions from additive to synergistic effects through contrasting effects on individual root group (lower-order roots). High rate of N addition retarded the decomposition of lower-order roots more in isolation than <b>in</b> <b>mixture,</b> due to the decreased binding of acid-unhydrolyzable residue to inorganic N ions <b>in</b> <b>mixture.</b> Therefore, we suggest that although stoichiometric heterogeneity holds within the branching hierarchy of fine roots, the tight coupling of N with acid-unhydrolyzable residue of root tissues may limit N use by microdecomposers, and thereby causing the additive effect. Since the mixing effect of order-based root decomposition is affected by N addition, understanding the chemical heterogeneity within fine root systems and their linkage with ambient N availability during decomposition either in isolation or <b>in</b> <b>mixture</b> may facilitate the accurate prediction of root decomposition responses to N loading...|$|R
