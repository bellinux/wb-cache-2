40|$|Several <b>evidences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{directly}} driven {{aspect of}} magnetospheric substorms are presented by reinterpreting what have been {{thought to be}} supporting <b>evidences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unloading process. It is emphasized {{that some of the}} confusions in substorm studies could be resolved by understanding that the magnetospheric substorm is primarily a directly driven phenomenon, but has a variety of internal processes. A method is suggested <b>for</b> identification of <b>the</b> directly driven and the unloading components. It is also demonstrated that the magnetosphere is intrinsically a nonlinear system and that a quantitative study of magnetospheric substorms is not possible without taking into account this nonlinearity...|$|R

Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. <b>Evidence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E

5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} {{properties}} to lanthanides. The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell is {{filled in the}} lanthanides. The first experimental <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey.

His work led to the discovery of the first <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E
