5|$|The {{provisional}} favourite for the women's {{race was}} Kenyan runner Florence Kiplagat, {{who was the}} fastest entrant in the field through her win at the Lille Half Marathon in September (also her debut for the distance). Her compatriots Peninah Arusei and Sarah Chepchirchir – second and third in Lille – completed the strongest three of the Kenyan women's team, which was considered {{the team to beat}} for the title. The Ethiopians, led by Boston Marathon winner Dire Tune, were their main opposition for the team race, although the nation had sent relatively inexperienced runners to the championships on this occasion. China's leading athlete was Zhu Xiaolin, who despite being an established marathon runner had less experience over the half distance. Although Japan lacked a leading figure individually, their overall consistency (which <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> team medals in the last five editions) demonstrated their team pedigree. Kenya entered the tournament as the reigning team champions.|$|E

As the royals came on board Heimdal they were greeted by prime minister Christian Michelsen and his cabinet. It was when Haakon, Maud and Olav stepped off Heimdal at Vippetangen wharf near Akershus Fortress that the Norwegian people got their first chance to see their new royals. After the new royal family had disembarked the prime minister held a short welcome speech.|$|E
25|$|The Suns {{finished}} 55-27 on the season, {{two games}} behind the Lakers {{who won the}} division. In the opening round of the playoffs, the Suns lost to the Spurs in five games – {{the first time they}} did not advance past the first round in the D'Antoni/ Nash era. Some have attributed this to the midseason acquisition of aging former MVP Shaquille O'Neal for four-time All Star Shawn Marion. Though Shaq was brought in as a physical presence to match with the likes of the Spurs' Tim Duncan, the move all but ended their fast-paced offense which <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> on the cusp of a Finals appearance.|$|E

25|$|In February and March 1981, Channel 7 aired {{a program}} called Gunston's Australia, which {{intended}} to show the Gunston character approaching {{the end of his}} shelf life. In a satirical reference to personalities like former ABC current affairs host Bill Peach, the series parodied the perennial Australian TV practice of hiring celebrities to host magazine-style programs after leaving the show that <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to fame. Wearing a safari jacket and shorts, Gunston travelled around outback Australia, interfering and adventuring in high and low places in his usual cack-handed manner. This series was later screened from February to March 1983 on UK Channel 4 TV.|$|E
25|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, Maximilian I of the House of Habsburg {{had become}} king in 1486. Seven years later, {{he took over}} the {{possessions}} of his cousin Sigismund of Austria, which included Tyrol, uniting all Habsburg possessions in his hands. The general rise of power of the Habsburgs and their dynastic politics <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> in conflict with the French kings. Maximilian's second marriage to Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan in 1493 opposed him directly to the French kings who also claimed the Duchy of Milan; a conflict that would escalate to the Italian Wars. The alpine passes in the southern Grisonsand in particular the Umbrail Pass in Val Müstairhad suddenly become strategically important as a direct route from the Tyrol to northern Italy, and the Habsburgs redoubled their efforts to control that region.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom, Ireland and France {{shared the}} hosting of the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Twickenham was used during pool A England matches. Twickenham was also {{host of the}} 1991 Rugby World Cup Final in which Australia beat England 12-6. For this game, England changed their style of play, opting {{for the sort of}} running game that <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> victory against Ireland in the March 1988 game {{referred}} to above. During this match, with the English facing a 12-3 deficit, David Campese reached one-handed for a ball thrown to England winger, Rory Underwood. He dropped it and the ball rolled forward, gifting England a penalty that proved to be the last score of the game. Some have claimed that Campese's action should have been interpreted as a deliberate professional foul, with possible disciplinary action against the Australian player. However, on the same ground in November 1988, Campese had intercepted a similar pass and run the length of the field to score a try.|$|E

25|$|Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{had been}} in ill health when he stayed at Hugh Paterson’s Bannockburn House and this {{may account for the}} {{questionable}} decisions he made including that to continue the siege of Stirling Castle regardless of the changed conditions that their victory at the Battle of Falkirk <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them.</b> It has been speculated that had they made a sustained pursuit of the defeated British Army at Falkirk that the castle at Stirling might have surrendered anyway being isolated and without any possible hope of relief. Instead on 19 January 1746 Prince Charles left Lord George Murray with the clan regiments in Falkirk and brought the Lowland Jacobites back to Stirling to reinforce the siege of the castle. The castle would certainly have been a major prize for the Jacobites, being at the narrowest point of the British mainland, whether for offensive or defensive purposes, and was at the intersection of the principal axis of Scottish communications from north to south and east to west.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of the initial garda effort to {{disperse}} the protesters, the violence escalated. The Garda Public Order Unit was deployed and stones and metal railings – to be used for renovation work on O'Connell Street – were thrown at gardaí by protesters; as were fireworks, bricks, crude petrol bombs, and other missiles. As the rioting continued, the ranks of the rioters were swelled by many local teenagers who had not taken part in the initial protest. Several barricades were constructed from building materials on the street to impede the march and the gardaí. The march was due to start at 12:30, but as the violence went on the gardaí decided against trying to escort the marchers through O'Connell Street, and at about 13:30 the assembled marchers returned to the coaches that <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to Dublin from Northern Ireland. The three coaches were then driven to Leinster House, where a small parade was carried out, and a letter was handed to Irish Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell. They were then escorted out of the city. One of the coaches was attacked by stone throwers on the way home.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} to the game's cancellation was overwhelmingly negative. Commentators in the industry media felt that the decision was representative of the diminishing relevance of adventure games, with many concluding that LucasArts was moving to maintain its position with low risk Star Wars-themed titles instead of the adventure games that <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> success in earlier years.

However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct.

That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over.

In addition to a petition of 32,000 signatures objecting to the termination of development on Sam & Max: Freelance Police, both Steve Purcell and the media were critical of LucasArts' decision. Purcell stated that he failed to understand quite why the game was cancelled, as he believed the development of the game was proceeding without hindrance, while the media put forward the view that LucasArts was moving to consolidate its position with low business risk Star Wars video games instead of pursuing the adventure games that <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> success in earlier years. The cancellation of Freelance Police is often cited as the culmination in a perceived decline in the overall adventure game genre, and LucasArts later dismissed many of the designers involved with developing their adventure games, effectively ending their adventure game era.|$|E
500|$|Parsons co-founded {{a company}} called Allied Enterprises with Hubbard and Sara, into which Parsons {{invested}} his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money they travel to Miami to purchase three yachts, which they would then sail through the Panama Canal to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends {{thought it was a}} bad idea. Hubbard had secretly requested permission from the U.S. Navy to sail to China and South and Central America on a mission to [...] "collect writing material"; his real plans were for a world cruise. Left [...] "flat broke" [...] by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a [...] "weak fool" [...] and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in County Causeway, Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to shore through a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram containing an astrological, geomantic invocation of Bartzabela vengeful spirit of Mars. Allied Enterprises was dissolved and in a court settlement Hubbard was made to promise to reimburse Parsons. Parsons was discouraged from taking further action by Sara, who threatened to report him for statutory rape since their sexual relationship took place when she was under California's age of consent of 18. Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to Margaret Grubb, bigamously married Sara and went on to found Dianetics and Scientology.|$|E
