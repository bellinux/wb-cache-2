30|$|Studies on {{organizational}} change stress staff’s and clients’ {{resistance to}} change. Employees may fear losing their {{status in the}} organization or missing out on the advantages of change, and they may <b>expect</b> <b>failure</b> or lack trust due to poor information. As a result, {{they may not be}} sufficiently committed to supporting the change process. Low commitment and resistance are often observed among those who feel inadequately informed about goals and change strategies. Poor information may originate from a lack of communication as well as from rumors and speculations. In other words, resistance and distrust can quickly gain traction in a climate of uncertainty, in which actors fear the unknown consequences of change (e.g., Erwin and Garman 2010; Iverson 1996; Oreg 2006; Palmer et al. 2016; Piderit 2000).|$|R
40|$|A {{stochastic}} deterioration {{process for}} corrosion initiation and propagation, and then crack initiation and propagation {{is used to}} examine the effect of cracking, spalling, loss of reinforcement area and reduction of bond on structural strength and reliability. This will enable <b>expected</b> costs of <b>failure</b> for serviceability and ultimate strength limit states to be calculated and compared for different repair strategies and inspection intervals. It was found that, for a typical reinforced concrete slab bridge, the reduction of structural capacity at the time of severe cracking or spalling is relatively modest and causes probabilities of collapse conditional on spalling to increase by about an order of magnitude. Hence, <b>expected</b> costs of <b>failure</b> for serviceability were significantly higher than the <b>expected</b> costs of <b>failure</b> for ultimate strength limit states...|$|R
50|$|The project {{started in}} September 1987 with an advance {{borehole}} using {{state of the}} art technology. The borehole reached its target depth of 4,000 metres in April 1989. The results of this drilling were used as parameters for the main borehole - for example the temperature gradient was higher than originally expected. The main drilling started on 8 September 1990 about 200 metres away from the advance borehole for an envisaged depth of 10,000 metres. The first 7,500 metres were using an automatic vertical drill head so that the lateral deviation could be limited to 12 metres. Due to the <b>expected</b> <b>failure</b> of the electronics below that depth a conventional drill head was used below that point. Due to brittleness and ductility the borehole was deforming multiple times, requiring to backfill the hole and start drilling again from a higher place. These operations continued for the last year of the project - the timing and budget constraints {{put an end to the}} efforts to go deeper. The drilling ended on 12 October 1994 after 1,468 days at a depth of 9,101 metres and about 300 metres lateral deviation showing a temperature of 265 °C. The planned three main experiments were performed until 31 December 1994. The facilities were being partially dismantled until 31 December 1995.|$|E
40|$|A bandit problem {{consisting}} of a sequence of n choices (n→∞) {{from a number of}} infinitely many Bernoulli arms is considered. The parameters of Bernoulli arms are independent and identically distributed random variables from a common distribution F on the interval [0, 1] and F is continuous with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. The goal is to investigate the asymptotic <b>expected</b> <b>failure</b> rates of k-failure strategies, and obtain a lower bound for the <b>expected</b> <b>failure</b> proportion over all strategies presented in Berry et al.

We show that the asymptotic <b>expected</b> <b>failure</b> rates of k-failure strategies when 0 >b≤ 1 and a lower bound can be evaluated if the limit of the ratio F(1) −F(t) versus (1 −t) b exists as t→ 1 − for some b> 0.

40|$|An improtant {{aim of the}} {{environmental}} qualification of a technical product is the assessment of its long-term behaviour. To get a shelf-life-prognosis there are different strategies {{depending on how the}} ageing behaviour is governed by episodical or continuous environmental loads. On the base of cause effect-relations there are eventually ways to compensate the duration by the intensity of an environmental load. Time dilation or accelerated ageing are only possible if the appropriate cause-effect-relation is known. Time laws as Fick's law request an ingenious modelling of dynamic load changes. Another smart time dilation depends on improved measurement methods concerning the material behaviour.

40|$|Failure {{mode and}} effects {{analysis}} (FMEA) {{has been proven}} {{to be an effective}} methodology to improve system design reliability. However, the standard approach reveals some weaknesses when applied to wind turbine systems.

In this paper, we aim to overcome these drawbacks and develop a hybrid cost-FMEA by integrating cost factors to assess the criticality, these costs vary from replacement costs to <b>expected</b> <b>failure</b> costs. Then, a quantitative comparative study is carried out to point out average failure rate, main cause of failure, <b>expected</b> <b>failure</b> costs and failure detection techniques.
