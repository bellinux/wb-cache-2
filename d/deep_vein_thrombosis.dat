5|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>{{thrombosis}},</b> or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having <b>deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are <b>deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which {{are referred to}} collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of <b>deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. In {{patients}} with acute leukemias hemorrhage {{is the most}} frequent problem. Vein thrombotic events may appear rarely but arterial thromboses are exceptionally rare. We present a patient with acute leukemia and bilateral <b>deep</b> leg <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> who developed an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during induction chemotherapy. The etiology and treatment of AMI in {{patients with}} acute leukemia, which is a rare occurrence, is discussed. Case Outline. In April of 2012 a 37 -year-old male presented with bilateral <b>deep</b> leg <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> and malaise. Laboratory data were as follows: Hb 118 g/L, WBC 354 x 109 /L (with 91 % blasts in differential leukocyte count), platelets 60 Ч 109 /L. Bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype revealed the presence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis was as follows: 46,XY,t(4; 11) (q 21 :q 23) [2]/ 62 - 82,XY,t(4; 11) [18]. Molecular analysis showed MLL-AF 4 rearrangement. The patient was on low molecular weight heparin and combined chemotherapy according to protocol HyperCVAD. On day 10 after chemotherapy he got chest pain. Three days later AMI was diagnosed (creatine kinase 66 U/L, CK-MB 13 U/L, troponin 1. 19 μg/L). Electrocardiogram showed the ST elevation in leads D 1, D 2, aVL, V 5 and V 6 and “micro q” in D 1. On echocardiography, hypokinesia of the left ventricle and ejection fraction of 39 % was found. After recovering from AMI and restoring left ventricle ejection fraction to 59 %, second course of HyperCVAD was given. The control bone marrow aspirate showed 88 % of blasts but with monoblastic appearance. Flow cytometry confirmed a lineage switch from lymphoblasts to monoblasts. In further course of the disease he was treated {{with a variety of}} chemotherapeutic combinations without achieving remission. Eventually, palliative chemotherapy was administered to reduce the bulk of blasts. He died five months after the initial diagnosis. Conclusion. AMI in young adults with acute leukemia is a very rare complication which may occur in patients with very high white blood cell count in addition with presence of a CD 56 adhesion molecule and other concomitant thrombophilic factors. The treatment of AMI in patients with acute leukemias should include antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, even with more aggressive methods depending on patient’s age and clinical risk assessment.

40|$|Background. Budd-Chiari {{syndrome}} (BCS) represents partial or total occlusion of the hepatic veins with {{or without}} simultaneous obstruction of vena cava inferior (VCI). The symptoms of BCS are abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, varices of the abdominal wall, sometimes bleeding from {{the upper part of}} gastointestinal tract (GIT), lower limbs swelling and jaundice. Primary BSC is a relatively rare condition occurring in one per 100 000 of the population worldwide. Case report. A male patient, 25 -year-old, facing tooth postextraction complications, was presented with acute BCS. On admission, physical examination revealed pale-grayish complexion, more pronounced veins over the thorax and abdomen, ascites, enlarged liver rising 8 cm below the right costal arch and having a minor pleural effusion by the right side. The patient was submitted to Doppler sonography and computed tomography (CT) that verified the right leg <b>deep</b> <b>veins</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> as well as the presence of a thrombus in the intrahepatic portion of the VCI. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) showed occlusion of hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome) and thrombosis of the VCI in the retrohepatic part 6 cm long. Also, increased values of transaminases and gamma GT and reduced values of albumines and serum ferrum were registered. Molecular examination revealed Factor V Leiden mutation - heterozygote. After preoperative preparations a mesocaval shunt was made using Gore- Tex ring graft of 12 mm. Intraoperatively, the blue enlarged liver was found with almost black zones of tense capsule. After a graft making, liver congestion decreased followed by the change of colour and volume. Within postoperative course metabolic and synthetic liver functions were obvious. Conclusion. In patients with BCS medicamentous treatment does not yield adequate results, but even causes worsening of general condition. Surgical therapy in the presented patient was performed timely regarding the stage of the disease due to which irreversible liver changes were prevented while decompression of the portal system provided time overbridging up to liver transplantation...|$|R
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of <b>deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected <b>deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, <b>deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Etiology of {{thrombosis}} in malignant diseases is multifactorial, {{and mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} thrombosis include release of the procoagulants from tumor cells (PC), factor related to bed rest, infections, as well as oncological therapy - chemotherapy, hormones, radiotherapy and surgical treatment. Thrombocytosis has frequently {{been found to be}} associated with various malignancies. Case report: 53 years old female patient hospitalized because of hypopharingeal cancer with metastasis in the left neck. Her state was complicated with <b>deep</b> leg <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> and pseudomonas infection. Persistent thrombocitosis in laboratory monitoring indicated more adequate diagnostic procedures, which led to discovering of Chorioidal Malignant Mellanoma as a second cancer. She was treated: Surgically, with antibiotics, with anticoagulants and radiotherapy. Patient was discharged from the hospital in good health condition, free of any other symptom of the malignant disease. Conclusion: Presence of thrombocytosis and idiopatic thrombosis can suggest occult malignancy. It would be prudent to further evaluate the relationship of trombotic events, trombocitosis and head and neck tumors. We suggest anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic complications, affect the angiogenesis and prevent development of metastatic disease. It may lead to lower mortality rate...|$|R

5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. <b>Deep</b> <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both.

Postthrombotic symptoms were infrequent and cancer patients had {{a higher risk of}} recurrent VTE. Background There is scant information on the optimal management and clinical outcome of <b>deep</b> and superficial <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> of the upper extremity (UEDVT and UESVT). Objectives To explore treatment strategies and the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), mortality, postthrombotic symptoms, and bleeding in patients with UEDVT and UESVT and to assess the prognosis of cancer patients with UEDVT. Patients/methods Follow-up of patients with UEDVT or UESVT, who were enrolled previously in a diagnostic management study. Results We followed 102 and 55 patients with UEDVT and UESVT, respectively, both for a median of 3. 5 years. Anticoagulant treatment was started in 100 patients with UEDVT (98 %) and in 40 (73 %) with UESVT. Nine patients with UEDVT (9 %) developed recurrent VTE, 26 (26 %) died, 6 (8 %) of 72 patients had moderate postthrombotic symptoms, and 5 (5 %) experienced major bleeding. One patient with UESVT had a recurrent VTE, 18 (33 %) died, none had moderate postthrombotic symptoms, and none had major bleeding. Of the cancer patients with UEDVT, 18 % had recurrent VTE vs. 7. 5 % in non-cancer patients (adjusted hazard ratio 2. 2, 95 %CI 0. 6 - 8. 2).

40|$|Compression {{ultrasound}} (CUS) {{is being}} used by {{an increasing number of}} emergency physicians for patients with suspected symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Both the two-point and three-point CUS examinations are used with excellent sensitivity to rule out DVT.
