25|$|While {{a lot of}} {{high school}} players just accept that this is <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is, some object to this rule. They say that it puts excess stress on them because they start being {{recruited}} in their junior year of high school. If they have a bad season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
500|$|The {{other side}} of creativity/freedom as the {{absolute}} principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations) – each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions {{of the world around}} it. [...] Freedom always exists within limits. [...] But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it.|$|E
