5|$|The postwar <b>drive-in</b> theater boom {{was vital}} to the {{expanding}} independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, {{there were more than}} 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the <b>drive-in</b> movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.|$|E

5|$|Carrols Corporation {{was founded}} in 1960 as a {{franchisee}} of the Tastee Freeze Company's Carrols Restaurants division by Herb Slotnick under the name Carrols <b>Drive-In</b> Restaurants of New York, and by 1968 the company had grown {{to the point where}} it purchased the chain from Tastee Freeze.

5|$|Lucas and {{producer}} Gary Kurtz took the script to American International Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed American Graffiti was not violent or sexual {{enough for the}} studio's standards.

This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene, in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty <b>drive-in</b> cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1950s, {{the greater}} privacy afforded to patrons gave <b>drive-ins</b> a {{reputation}} as immoral, and they were labeled [...] "passion pits" [...] in the media. Beginning in the 1970s, many <b>drive-ins</b> changed from family fare to exploitation films, {{as a way to}} offset declining patronage and revenue. Also, during the 1970s, some <b>drive-ins</b> began to show pornographic movies in less family-centered time slots to bring in extra income. [...] This allowed censored materials to be viewed by a wide audience, some for whom viewing was still illegal in many states, and it was reliant upon the whims of local ordinances controlling such material. It also required a relatively remote location distant from populated areas such as towns and cities.|$|R

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant is a theme {{restaurant}} at Disney's Hollywood Studios, {{one of the}} four main theme parks at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, United States. Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s <b>drive-in</b> theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.|$|E
5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive price cutting by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¬¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The price cutting promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own price cutting program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic <b>Drive-In,</b> Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains.|$|E
