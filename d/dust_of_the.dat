5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century astronomers {{increasingly}} {{turned to}} computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. Recently the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the gold and <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E

In these publications, the four authors proposed that after the dissipation of the gas and <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primordial Solar System disk, the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) were originally found on near-circular orbits between ~5.5 and ~17 astronomical units (AU), much more closely spaced and compact than in the present. A large, dense disk of small, rock and ice planetesimals, their total about 35 Earth masses, extended from the orbit of the outermost giant planet to some 35 AU.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E

On the left are seated bluish glass beings with high male voices; opposite them at the right are similar creatures with dark voices. They all stare at the war toys gliding past and, at intervals, pull toward them one or several of the toys using glass croupier rakes, knocking them down onto a lower conveyor belt moving in the opposite direction. All the while, stock-exchange clocks tally up the wins and losses, as the humming turns into singing.|$|E

500|$|In {{an article}} in the January 2007 issue of Scientific American, Soter cited the definition's {{incorporation}} of current theories of the formation and evolution of the Solar System; that as the earliest protoplanets emerged from the swirling <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protoplanetary disc, some bodies [...] "won" [...] the initial competition for limited material and, as they grew, their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material, and thus grew larger, eventually outstripping the other bodies in the Solar System by a very wide margin. The asteroid belt, disturbed by the gravitational tug of nearby Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt, too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together {{before the end of the}} initial formation period, both failed to win the accretion competition.|$|E

Whilst the majority of sets created for the Martian array had been created for the previous episode, a set was created to appear as an access tube specially for use in [...] "Terra Prime". In order to represent the shuttlecraft entering the comet, rather than using camera movement, the set was placed on rollers and physically moved to appear turbulent. The Martian landscape was inserted using a green screen where the away team enter the array, and the actors had make-up applied to represent the red <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Martian landscape.|$|E

500|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{stated that}} both the honour and {{the very existence of}} Clan MacLeod was thought to have depended upon the preservation of the Fairy Flag. Only the [...] "highest and purest blood of the race" [...] and the most renowned heroes, were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed. These twelve men, with a sword in hand, would stand just behind the chief who was always put in front. One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag; and of this family, only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag. This family was called [...] "Clan Tormad Vic Vurichie" [...] ("the children of Tormod, son of Murchadh"), and was descended from Sìol Torcaill. The 20th century Hebridean author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, when writing of the traditions of the flag, stated that the flag's bearers held lands on Skye near Bracadale for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan, on the island of Iona. The second, and last bearer, was buried at St Clements Church, in Rodel, on the island of Harris. This man's remains were covered by a magnificent monument; the stone coffin in which his body was placed, was six feet deep. A moveable iron grate rested about two feet from the lid, and the man's body rested upon the grate. The man's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin. This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within, the bones and <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below. The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father, the last male of this family was interred this way. The tomb was then sealed by this man's daughter. The c.1800 manuscript also noted that this family, prior to its extinction, became miserably poor.|$|E
