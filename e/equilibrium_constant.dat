5|$|To {{determine}} the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>constant</b> for this reaction, {{in which the}} ligand loses a proton, the pKa of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− can accept four protons; in that case, all pKa values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the pK values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known.|$|E

25|$|In {{each case}} an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>constant</b> can be {{specified}} as a quotient of activities. This <b>equilibrium</b> <b>constant</b> is dimensionless as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>constant</b> is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See equilibrium chemistry#Equilibrium constant for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>constant.</b> For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants {{defined in terms of}} concentrations are not only temperature dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.|$|E
