5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894.

5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One.
