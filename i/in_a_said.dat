40|$|It {{is often}} {{taken for granted}} that {{students}} who are enrolled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>said</b> Bachelor’s Degree course in a university should {{have a much better}} understanding of the said subject then when they were in school. Studies conducted have shown that this may not necessarily be the case. They are often unable to apply the concepts that have been studied in the introductory Physics course to the task of solving related problems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain the level of Newtonian Physics conceptual understanding of university students enrolled in Science Education courses in order to investigate their preparedness in becoming future Physics teachers. This survey-based study involved a sample of 200 third-year B. Sc. Ed students from three universities in Malaysia. Data collected from the Test of Conceptual Understanding of Newtonian Physics was analyzed descriptively and inferentially to determine the level of the students’ Newtonian Physics conceptual understanding. The findings confirmed that generally, undergraduates’ students are still having problems to conceptually understand physics concepts taught at them...|$|E

40|$|CDATA[The {{awareness}} that engineers operate and cooperate in interdisciplinary arenas necessitates {{the understanding of}} the significance of social skills required in the globalizing engineering communities where the members represent different educational backgrounds, cultures, and nationalities. In this light, engineers of the 21 st century need to possess an adequate knowledge and understanding of stakeholders (members of the academic and professional engineering community) perception of effective communicative competence requirements in presentation skills and attributes required in Technical Oral Presentation (TOP). Technical oral presentations are a frequently practiced workplace communicative requirement. The Situated Learning Theory advocates that perceptions of selected stakeholders or participants in a Community of Practice (COP) reflect the participants legitimate peripheral participation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>said</b> discourse community. The study is based upon the final year engineering project (technical presentation) at a Malaysian university, which seeks to identify the presentation skills and attribute requirements as constructed by various selected stakeholders in TOP in engineering education. Both quantitative and qualitative findings are presented and described in the study. The study also discusses the pedagogical implications toward effective participation in the discourse community from an engineering education perspective. ]]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} first {{conjugate}} observations of subauroral ion drifts (SAID) in the magnetosphere (9000 km altitude) and ionosphere and coincident measurements by four ionospheric satellites. The parameters measured include ion drifts, energetic precipitating electrons and ions, and {{the magnetic field}} perturbations associated with field-aligned currents. Observations indicate that SAID are very coherent features that occur simultaneously over a large magnetic local time (MLT) range, from at least 1600 to 2400 MLT. The equatorward extent of SAID, the ion precipitation, and the region 2 field-aligned currents (FAC) flowing into the ionosphere are all shown to be coincident at all MLT locations where SAID are observed. They also appear to be {{closely related to the}} conductivity distribution in the subauroral ionosphere and the midlatitude trough. This is interpreted as an indication that their latitudinal distribution is a consequence of the subauroral conductivity structure and the movement of the plasma sheet ion and electron boundaries. Conjugate measurements at diverse altitudes when mapped along field lines are nearly identical, indicating the absence of significant field-aligned potential drops. Temporally separated SAID measurements in similar MLT regions show a reduction with time in the field-aligned current densities with little reduction in the potential drop across the SAID. We interpret the results as an indication that the magnetosphere acts as a current generator in which large FAC are initially required to support the electric field gradient <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>SAID</b> event. Subsequent evolution in the E and F regions produces large conductivity gradients that are in the right sense to remove the intense FAC requirement but maintain the large subauroral electric fields. The reported potential drops in the subauroral region can be a significant fraction of the total, up to 60 kVor more, and {{must be taken into account}} when deriving any magnetospheric convection pattern. 1...|$|E
40|$|The western {{concepts}} and ideologies that shaped South African cites {{into what they}} are today {{have come at a}} cost to the recipients of colonisation. Communities previously that thrived on kinship systems have now been replaced by groups that coexist in a <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>said</b> context. In traditional African village, each age group had their role within the society, the young adults would go out and work, hunting, farming etc while the elderly became the guardians, the caretakers of the children, and they would provide guidance for the impressionable youth while passing down a great body of knowledge. Within this traditional system the social obligations of the aged were multi dimensional {{in the sense that they}} encompassed religion, education, politics, recreation, economic, and prophetic issues. In those days, people looked forward to getting old. In a sense this can be coined within the bounds of Ubuntu. In these contemporary times, social and economic changes have put into doubt the continued viability of such traditional arrangements for the elderly. Changes like increased emphasis on smaller family units, migration to urban areas, new life styles and changing values all have effects on the traditional forms of care of the elderly. Financial difficulties have made it imperative for many women to now work for pay outside the home and also the issues of education for the young have reduced the caring role of the grandchildren. Within modern society one could also attribute the deterioration of moral fiber to the breakdown of Ubuntu and the rise of individuality. This thesis aims to understand the benefits of the traditional African system for the elderly as a means to develop an appropriate architectural response to the plight of the forgotten aged. In order to contribute towards the creation of a more locally relevant architecture for the aged, this paper proposes the development of a hybrid building prototype that would facilitate the inclusion of the elderly into a community while allowing them to play an important role in the moulding of its yout...|$|E
