5000|$|High is {{my dream}} of an America with great public schools. I {{thought we should}} be {{the envy of the}} world with our public schools. And I went to such a public school. So I knew that such a school was possible. Shortridge High School in Indianapolis {{produced}} not only me, but the head writer on the I LOVE LUCY show (Madelyn Pugh). And, my God, we had a daily paper, we had a debating team, had a fencing team. We had a chorus, a jazz band, a serious orchestra. And all this with a Great Depression going on. And <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> to have such a school.|$|R

If any of you {{say a word about}} me or my father, I'll make it so hot for you that you'll wish you had never been born.

He wouldn't go without taking leave, you don't suppose?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I don't {{feel like}} it's my {{personal}} life. It's written {{for all the}} women, or men, or whoever's gone through any type of relationship. I'm looking at it as the mantra of 'Infinity' is love yourself… loving yourself first to infinity. Then you can love anybody or anything else - your career, your kids, your life, It's like someone emancipating themselves. It's like my re-emancipation of Mimi, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> {{to be able to}} sing along with me. It's a big chorus. I tend to be more private about my personal life anyway, so even if the song were about someone in particular, I would never say that, because that would be like my own private thought.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with PopMatters, Keely described {{the development of the}} Worlds Apart cover art, stating that while he typically incorporates his free time drawings and paintings into the band's albums, this cover collage was more specifically designed. However, Interscope insisted that he cite and clear all sources of his art, much of which was found in museums around the world. Given the improbability of the task, illustrator Cyril Van Der Haegen was hired to paint Keely's design and tweak various elements. Keely also summarized the theme of the collage:"I wanted an allegory depicting the history of human conflict. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> to be fighting, like in Marvel Comics' Secret Wars, where all the superheroes are fighting each other. <b>I</b> actually <b>wanted</b> to sneak in one of the New Mutants." ...|$|R

All these airs in a land where they would as soon expect to leave the soup out {{of the bill of}} fare as the wine!--in a land where wine is nearly as common among all ranks as water! This fellow said: [...] "I am a free-born sovereign, sir, an American, sir, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> to know it!" [...] He did not mention that he was a lineal descendant of Balaam's ass, but everybody knew that without his telling it.|$|E

It was Teeny Weeny the Shrew, also called the Common Shrew, the Long-tailed Shrew and the Shrew Mouse, one of the {{smallest}} animals in all the Great World. He started to dart under another leaf, but Old Mother Nature stopped him. [...] "Sit still," [...] she commanded sharply. [...] "You have nothing to fear. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> to have a good look at you, for it is high time these neighbors of yours should know you.

500|$|In March 2010, {{the case}} was finally heard by a jury. During the trial plaintiffs' {{attorneys}} called witnesses from across county government {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate a countywide policy of discrimination. Jones denied any discrimination against white employees. He testified that [...] "I wanted the best and the brightest. That meant blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, gay, straight, anybody who wanted to work for DeKalb County. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> to have a seat at the table". Other testimony revealed that during {{the first five years of}} Jones' term in office, the number of white senior county managers had dropped from 61 to 57, and the number of African-American senior county managers had risen from 33 to 61.|$|R
5000|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Sullivan disccused the album's title and lyrical themes, stating [...] "I named the album Fearless because I'm just {{not afraid of}} ANYTHING right now. I'm young, I'm 22 years old... And I just feel that, if YOU embrace your uniqueness by not being afraid to take chances and being different, then everybody ELSE will! You know, I definitely did not wanna exclude ANYBODY! So, if you buy my record and think you're gonna get {{just a bunch of}} reggae beats or just a bunch of R&B beats, you'll be wrong! You're gonna get EVERYTHING! I mean, the genres can range from jazz, to gospel, to pop... Because that's who I AM!

60|$|I am very {{objectionable}} myself, I know, when I am {{feeling all}} right. It {{is not enough}} for me that I am not ill. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> to see that I am not ill. It seems to me that I am wasting myself if I don't let every human being in the vessel know that I am not ill. I cannot sit still and be thankful, like you'd imagine a sensible man would. I walk about the ship--smoking, of course--and look at people who are not well with mild but pitying surprise, as if I wondered what it was like and how they did it. It is very foolish of me, I know, but I cannot help it. I suppose it is the human nature that exists in even the best of us that makes us act like this.|$|E

Then he added gravely, [...] "But one of the first and most important of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the place. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> and everything to be happy here, to love and trust, and serve us, as we try to love and trust and serve them faithfully and willingly. I have often said that you were kinder to the animals {{than any of the other}} boys, and Mrs. Bhaer liked that trait in you very much, because she thought it showed a good heart.

5000|$|In 1876 {{the family}} moved to Shuya where Vera Nikolayevna owned a two-story house. At age ten Konstantin joined the local gymnasium, an {{institution}} he later described as [...] "the home of decadence and capitalism, good only at air and water contamination." [...] It was there that he became interested in French and German poetry and started writing himself. His first two poems, though, have been panned by his mother in such a manner that for the next six years he made no attempt at repeating this first poetic venture. At the gymnasium Balmont became involved with a secret circle (formed by students and some teachers) which printed and distributed Narodnaya Volya proclamations. [...] "I was happy and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> to be happy. The fact that only a minority, myself included, were entitled to such happiness, seemed outrageous to me," [...] he later wrote. On 30 June 1886 he was expelled from the Shuia gymnasium for his political activities.|$|R

5000|$|Madonna, who {{was busy}} with True Blue and {{shooting}} for the comedy film Shanghai Surprise, was contacted by Kleinman to ask about her approval of the shot footage. She felt that the video [...] "needed a proper introduction. I asked James Foley darling to shoot me saying something for adding it before the concert starts." [...] Foley, who directed the music video of her song [...] "Live to Tell", shot an introduction which was added {{at the beginning of}} the video. It portrayed Madonna in her first image makeover, with platinum blond curls, and conservative wardrobe. Madonna wanted to include a summation of her biography—which was used at the beginning of The Virgin Tour—to be added with the footage. Hence, with the footage, Madonna's voice was heard, declaring,"I went to New York. I had a dream. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a big star, I didn't know anybody, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to dance, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to sing, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do all those things, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make people happy, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be famous, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> to love me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a star.

The performances of [...] "Angel", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Burning Up" [...] were removed from the track list of the video, as Kleinman believed that Madonna's performance was not her best in them. While shooting the tour on May 25, during the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin", a fan suddenly came up on the stage and tried to get hold of Madonna, but was swiftly whisked away by security. Kleinman decided to keep the shot, as he felt that it illustrated the fanaticism which had grown around Madonna, and her popularity. The live performances of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Dress You Up" [...] were released as music video on MTV to promote the video album. Both videos were nominated for [...] "Best Choreography" [...] at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards.
