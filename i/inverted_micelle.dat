5000|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the translocation {{is based on the}} formation of the inverted micelles. Inverted micelles are aggregates of colloidal surfactants in which the polar groups are concentrated in the interior and the lipophilic groups extend outward into the solvent. According to this model, a penetratin dimer combines with the negatively charged phospholipids, thus generating the formation of an <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> inside of the lipid bilayer. The structure of the inverted micelles permits the peptide to remain in a hydrophilic environment. [...] Nonetheless, this mechanism is still a matter of discussion, because the distribution of the penetratin between the inner and outer membrane is non-symmetric. This non-symmetric distribution produces an electrical field that has been well established. Increasing the amount of peptide on the outer leaflets causes the electric field to reach a critical value that can generate an electroporation-like event.|$|E

Reverse-phase evaporation is based on the creation of <b>inverted</b> <b>micelles.</b> These <b>inverted</b> <b>micelles</b> are shaped upon sonication of a mixture of a buffered aqueous phase, which contains the water-soluble molecules to be encapsulated into the liposomes and an organic phase in which the amphiphilic molecules are solubilized.

However, in this method, {{there are still}} some problems to be circumvented related to protein stabilization. During the <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> phase of protein nanoencapsulation, hydrophobic interfaces are expanded, leading to interfacial adsorption, followed by protein unfolding and aggregation. Here, spectroscopic and immunological techniques were used to ascertain the effects of the Hoffmeister series ions on diphtheria toxoid (Dtxd) stability during the <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> phase. A correlation was established between the salts used in aqueous solutions and the changes in Dtxd solubility and conformation. Dtxd alpha alpha-helical content was quite stable, which led us to conclude that encapsulation occurred without protein aggregation or without exposition of hydrophobic residues. Dtxd aggregation was 98 % avoided by the kosmotropic, PO<SU 2 [...] </SU(4). This ion was used to prepare a stable Dtxd and immunologically recognized REV-Chi-PVA formulation in the presence of 50 mM of PO<SU 2 [...] </SU(4).

Therefore, we could obtain the maximum Dtxd solubility and stability after contact with CH(3) CO(2) C(2) H(5) to begin its nanoencapsulation within ideal conditions. This was a technological breakthrough, because a simple solution, such as salt, addition avoided heterologous protein use. </.

40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} play {{an important}} role in atmospheric processes. These aerosol particles can affect climate through scattering, transmission and absorption of radiation as well as acting as cloud condensation nuclei. It has recently been found that fatty acids reside on the surfaces of marine and continental aerosols. In this research, an attempt has been made to understand the structures and properties of such organic coated aerosols using Molecular Dynamics simulation. The model particle consisted of a water droplet coated with fatty acid. The density profile (using both Coarse-Grained and Atomistic/United atom models) demonstrated that such aerosol particles have an <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> structure consisting of an aqueous core and with the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails exposed to the atmosphere. For smaller chains, with the organic molecules directed radially outwards from the water - organic interface) the normal pressure profile showed that the organic coating is under tension resulting in a 'negative' surface tension. As a result, such particles would have an inverse Kelvin vapor pressure effect and would be able to process water vapor despite the hydrophobic surface. Following the work on surface tension, the rate of water uptake by coated aerosols was computed. It was found that the sticking coefficient of water vapor on such particles was about a sixth of that on pure water droplets. This may seem to imply that the net condensation rate is lower, but we also need to take into account the evaporation of water from such particles. With a significant reduction in the evaporation rate (the coating lends greater stability to the particle resulting in reduced evaporation rate), the equilibrium vapor pressure of water on such particles reduced, resulting in a "net water attractor". Thus if such structures were created in sufficient concentration, they might be important contributors in the cloud condensation process. Next the effect of longer Fatty acid molecules and branched surfactants on the structure and properties of coated particles was studied. It was found that in either case, due to stronger organic - organic interactions, the surfactant molecules tend to align themselves parallel to each other forcing local flattening of the underlying water substrate and consequently such particles behaved in a manner consistent with an "oily" drop, in sharp contrast to the case of shorter chains, where the particle was a "net water attractor". Finally, the effect of organic coating on the Stokes drag of functionalized nanoparticles was studied. This work was motivated by a recent experimental study in which the thickness of Self Assembled Monolayers on Gold nanoparticles was characterized using a measurement process that relies on the determination of the size of a charged particle through knowledge of the drag force. The thickness of the coating was found to ~ 35 % less than that predicted by a rigid core-shell model. This suggests that the functionalized Au-NP would have an <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> structure. The MD simulations showed that the drag on the coated particle was indeed less than that on the corresponding pure particle, consistent with the experimental observation...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} are {{ubiquitous in}} atmospheric aerosols. The morphology {{and structure of}} the organic phase affect the optical properties of the aerosols, their heterogeneous reactivity as well as their ability to nucleate cloud droplets and ice particles. It is commonly assumed that atmospheric oxidative ageing of the organic material, leading to the formation of polar groups such as carbonyl (=O), hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxylic acid (-COOH), will render the aerosol particle surfaces increasingly more hydrophilic, hence, able to take up more water. Field measurements have shown that a large fraction of the organic material found in aerosols are surface active compounds, such as fatty acids and lipids(Tervahattu, 2002 and 2005). An <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> structure, with an aqueous core surrounded by an organic surfactant layer, has thus been proposed for aqueous aerosols, both marine and continental (Donaldson, 2006). While recent experiments suggest the existence of more complex structures, such as organic inclusions and surfactant lenses (Dennis-Smither, 2012), a monolayer (ML) of surface active organics on an aqueous subphase (the so called Langmuir monolayers) represents the basic model system used in laboratory studies aimed at elucidating the effect of oxidative processes on structural properties of organic coatings on aerosol particles. In our previous work, we used molecular dynamics computer simulations to study the structure and stability of oxidized phospholipid MLs (Khabiri, 2012). In this contribution, we employed the molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate – with atomistic resolution – structural changes occuring in a fatty acid ML upon moderate degree of oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} have {{a significant}} organic composition as determined by field measurement studies. This organic material is released to the atmosphere from both natural and anthropogenic sources, such as wind bursting of the ocean surface, car exhausts, and meat cooking, among others. An <b>inverted</b> <b>micelle</b> model has been proposed in order to explain the high concentration of organic compounds in aerosol particles. The model describes an organic film coating the air-liquid interface of an aqueous aerosol core. Chemical processing of this organic film by atmospheric oxidants (such as OH radicals, O 3, and NO 3) through heterogeneous and multiphase reactions can activate the aerosol to participate in atmospheric chemistry. After reaction, the particle has an increased role in the absorption and scattering of incoming solar radiation and cloud formation. Another consequence of this oxidation is the decrease of the atmospheric budget of gas-phase trace species, {{as well as the}} formation of volatile products. Several studies have proposed that the ozonolysis of organic films in aerosols takes place mainly at the surface. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a suitable model system for following the reaction through quantitative changes of a property inherent to the surface. Several attempts were made to examine the ozonolysis of organic monolayers at either solid or liquid surfaces. The studied monolayers contained unsaturated organic compounds as the only component or as part of a binary mixture with saturated compounds. The study of the ozone processing of monolayers deposited on solid substrates revealed information about changes in the hydrophobic character of the surface that occurred because of the reaction. On the other hand, the processing of a monolayer spread on a pendant drop allowed a real-time monitoring of surface pressure changes. This permitted a kinetic study of the reaction that yielded parameters related exclusively to processes taking place at the surface. For instance, the measured reactive uptake coefficient of ozone Þ meas was estimated to be (2. 6 ± 0. 1) { 604 } 10 - 6. The versatility offered by the latter system to the study of heterogeneous chemical reactions taking place at the air-liquid interface is explained as well as possible future directions for its utilization are given...|$|E

The conjugation of the anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor antibody (anti-EGFR) to ALPs induces an EGFR-mediated uptake into the non-small cell lung cancer cell lines but not into NIH- 3 T 3 cells without the receptor.

40|$|Tetraoleoylpyrophosphatidic acid (bis phosphatidic acid), when {{hydrated}} in aqueous buffer, {{was shown}} to form an inverted hexagonal phase using 31 P NMR. Low-angle x-ray diffraction provided verification {{of the formation of}} this phase in dilute aqueous buffer and in 2 M NaCl and permitted comparison of the tube diameter with that of cardiolipin in 2 M NaCl. By using the water cylinder diameters for tetraoleoylpyrophosphatidic acid, bovine cardiolipin, chloroplast monogalactosyl-diglyceride, and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine as a means of estimating the spontaneous curvatures, tetraoleoylpyro-phosphatidic acid {{was shown to}} exhibit the greatest curvature of any of the above lipids, equaled only by the calcium salt of cardiolipin. <b>Inverted</b> <b>micelles</b> of hydrated tetraoleoylpyrophosphatidic acid and of cardiolipin in tetradecane were approximately the diameter of the inverted hexagonal tubes. A rationale is given for the differences...|$|R
40|$|International audience: In this study, {{the direct}} {{translocation}} of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) into large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) {{was shown to}} be rapid for all {{the most commonly used}} CPPs. This translocation led within a few minutes to intravesicular accumulation up to 0. 5 mM, with no need for a transbilayer potential. The accumulation of CPPs inside LUVs was found to depend on CPP sequence, CPP extravesicular concentration and phospholipid (PL) composition, either in binary or ternary mixtures of PLs. More interestingly, the role of anionic phospholipid flip-flopping in the translocation process was ascertained. CPPs enhanced the flipping of PLs, and the intravesicular CPP accumulation directly correlated with the amount of anionic PLs that had been transferred from the external to the internal leaflet of the LUV bilayer, thus demonstrating the transport of peptide/lipid complexes as <b>inverted</b> <b>micelles...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as <b>micelles</b> or <b>inverted</b> <b>micelles.</b> Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, degradable {{polymers}} {{have become}} increasingly researched for their applications in drug delivery systems, adhesives, and tissue engineering. Self-immolative polymers (SIPs) are of particular utility due to predictable end-to-end backbone depolymerization after a stimuli-responsive end-cap cleavage. There are examples of incorporating a hydrophobic SIP into an amphiphilic block-copolymer, followed by self-assembly in aqueous media forming various nanoparticle morphologies. However, their self-assembly behaviour has not been described in detail, {{and there are no}} general synthetic methods that allow for their synthesis with good control over the relative hydrophilic block ratio, the major factor controlling their morphology. This thesis presents the synthesis of a self-immolative poly(carbamate) with a photo-active end-cap linked to a poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) hydrophilic block and an attempt at poly(2 -(N,N-dimethylamine) -ethyl-methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). These copolymers were self-assembled in aqueous media to form vesicles, <b>micelles</b> and <b>inverted</b> <b>micelles.</b> These nanoparticles were loaded with nile red, and their degradation was monitored by the release of the cargo...|$|R
