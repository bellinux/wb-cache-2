5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the <b>fabrications</b> of corrupt court officials or her own possible <b>fabrications</b> to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{optimization}} of <b>fabrication</b> {{process for}} microneedles has been presented. Using {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) etching technology, <b>fabrication</b> of out-of-plane hollow silicon microneedles for blood extraction has been carried out. Sharp tip microneedles with length 1100 µm were designed for <b>fabrication.</b> The <b>fabrication</b> of microneedles was not successful because the lumen section was fabricated first and then hole was created for fluid flow. Previously, using same <b>fabrication</b> method successful <b>fabrication</b> of microneedles was done for drug delivery with length 200 µm. This <b>fabrication</b> method is not suitable for long structure. Thus, the alternative microneedle <b>fabrication</b> steps using ICP etching have been developed and presented in this paper. These steps can be more optimized and suitable for sharp tip, long and hollow structure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Product {{design and}} <b>fabrication</b> {{constitute}} an important business activity in any manufacturing firm. Designing an optimized product <b>fabrication</b> process {{is an important}} problem in itself and is of significant practical and research interest. In this paper, we look into {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) <b>fabrication</b> process and investigate ways in which the <b>fabrication</b> cycle time can be minimized. Single class queueing networks constitute the modelling framework for our study. The model developed in this paper and the analysis experiments carried out are based on extensive data collected on a PCB <b>fabrication</b> company located in Bangalore, India. This is a representative PCB <b>fabrication</b> company involving multiple, concurrent <b>fabrication</b> works with contention for human/technical resources. Our model seeks to capture faithfully the flow of the <b>fabrication</b> process in this company and such other organisations, using queueing networks. Using the model developed, we explore how the cycle times can be reduced using input control, load balancing, and variability reduction. The model presented is sufficiently generic and conceptual; its scope extends beyond that of a PCB <b>fabrication</b> organization...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new class of design and <b>fabrication</b> {{interfaces}} for digitally created objects, which the author terms augmented <b>fabrication</b> machines. By enhancing traditional <b>fabrication</b> machines with rich new input and output capabilities, augmented <b>fabrication</b> machines have the potential to ease design iteration, facilitate the incorporation of outside physical objects, and increase the overall transparency of the design and <b>fabrication</b> process-all of which, the author contends, will encourage and improve individuals' use of <b>fabrication</b> technologies for the creation of personal objects. In addition to introducing the concept of augmented <b>fabrication</b> machines, the second major contribution of this work is its development of Part Preview. Part Preview, in essence, is an augmented <b>fabrication</b> machine application that improves accuracy and usability by incorporating all relevant digital and physical factors such as the toolpath, raw material stock, and machine environment to generate an accurate "preview" of the final object before <b>fabrication</b> takes place. After reviewing modern digital <b>fabrication</b> technology and outlining the traditional digital object design and <b>fabrication</b> workflow, this work identifies several areas for improvement. The author then discuss two earlier augmented <b>fabrication</b> machine projects, Eat Your Face and CopyCAD, aimed at addressing these shortcomings. This work then turns to a comprehensive discussion of Part Preview, examining its underlying principles and technology in detail. Part Preview's improvements to the functionality and usability of <b>fabrication</b> machines are quantified by way of a user study, which both qualitatively and quantitatively compares processes incorporating Part Preview to the existing design and <b>fabrication</b> workflow. by David Carr.

5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When <b>fabrications</b> are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{relationship}} between <b>fabrication</b> pressure and microstructure evolution is proposed.

The <b>fabrication</b> of single-phase Al 2 O 3 is simulated. The mean grain size of simulated microstructure by Monte Carlo Potts model integrated with <b>fabrication</b> pressure increases {{with an increase in}} <b>fabrication</b> pressure, which is consistent with the experiment results. It is shown that Monte Carlo Potts model coupled with <b>fabrication</b> pressure may simulate the microstructure evolution of single-phase ceramic tool materials...|$|R

5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his <b>fabrications</b> in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own <b>fabrications.</b> However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E
5|$|To {{understand}} why the Chinese made such reports, Waley explained that any military action, whether successful or not, {{was followed by a}} scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they had in mind. Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the <b>fabrications,</b> especially since he was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese. This was {{the first in a series}} of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war. The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of hot-press <b>fabrication</b> parameters on mechanical properties of Al 2 O 3 ceramic tool materials, the orthogonal experiment method was used. In the experiments, the three influence {{factors such as the}} <b>fabrication</b> temperature, pressure and duration time are considered. The experimental results are analyzed by a range analysis of orthogonal experiments. It is shown that the most important factor that affects the mechanical properties is the <b>fabrication</b> temperature and the followed factors are the <b>fabrication</b> pressure and the duration time of <b>fabrication.</b> Scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveals that the hot-press <b>fabrication</b> parameters will significantly affect the microstructure of ceramic tool materials, which can govern the mechanical properties. This has been validated by the orthogonal experiments in the present paper...|$|R
