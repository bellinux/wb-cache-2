For geologists, cities {{can also be considered}} as hydrological catchments subjected to biogeochemical cycles of elements, molecules and minerals that are produced, transported and deposited. In this case, most of the transfers are realized at the surface (for stormwater) and underground (for the stormwater and wastewater systems), and can be combined or separative. Materials deposited in sewer networks are considered as an issue for sediment management but, from a paleoenvironemental, they constitute potential archives for the Anthropocene (i. e since AD 1950; Zalasiewicz et al., 2015), allowing an integrated retro-observation of urban metabolism. Similarly, most materials that transit in sewer systems are considered as pollutants, but paleoenvironmentalists could use them as tracers for urban metabolism. Depending on the type of materials preserved in the sedimentary archives (drugs such as analgesics or antibiotics, illict drugs, alcohol residues, pesticides, hydrocarbons, specific molecular biomarkers…), the recent history of a large spectrum of thematics (health, food consumption, biodiversity, transport, energy…) could be reconstructed at the city scale, affording local authorities diagnostic tools for evaluating past public policies. In order to test whether paleoenvironmental approaches could be transposed to urban socio-ecosystems, we have analysed the sediments of short sedimentary cores drilled in a <b>decantation</b> <b>tank</b> located in Orléans (France; Figure 1). This <b>decantation</b> <b>tank</b> was built in 1942, is 17 m deep and is presently saturated in sediments so that it does not properly filter sewer waters that are then directed towards wastewater treatment plants. To this respect, local authorities plan to clean out the tank and are undertaking various improvements. The tank is at the outlet of the sewer network that collects combined stormwater and wastewater over the whole hydrological catchment of Orléans and its suburb. A preliminary drilling afforded sedimentary sequences of maximum 1 m length characterized by coarse grain silicoclastic deposits, sometimes sorted, interspaced with organic-rich layers (Figure 1). Some objects of evident anthropic origin could be distinguished such as a padlock, a coin dated back to 1999, and plastic and metallic residues of various origins. We also indentified in some layers grape and lemon seeds, and plant remains. XRF core scanner analyses performed on the whole cores revealed high levels of Zn, Pu and Cu all over the section, with organic layers being enriched. Ongoing work is focused on the analysis of “natural” and xenobiotic biomarkers that are studied through classical organic geochemistry analyses for natural biomarkers and through standard techniques employed in pollution studies for xenobiotics. The challenge, is off course, to transfer those techniques to a material of unprecented and extreme organic, elemental and mineral complexity. From the combined sedimentological, elemental and organic analyses, accompanied by radioelement dating, we will be able not only to discuss the nature of the materials (source, preservation…), but also the potential for these original archives to record the recent history of urban metabolism...|$|E

O processo de produÃÃo de biodiesel Ã composto das seguintes etapas: preparaÃÃo da matÃria-prima, reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo, separaÃÃo de fases, recuperaÃÃo e desidrataÃÃo do Ãlcool, destilaÃÃo da glicerina e purificaÃÃo desse combustÃvel renovÃvel, tendo como subproduto a glicerina e como resÃduo Ãgua de purificaÃÃo. A Ãgua residuÃria, formada durante a etapa de purificaÃÃo, apresenta alto teor de Ãleos e graxas, tendo potencial para contaminar corpos Ãgua. Uma das propostas de tratamento deste resÃduo Ã a utilizaÃÃo de hidrÃlise enzimÃtica por lipases para remoÃÃo de Ãleos e graxas. Devido Ã especificidade das lipases e sua ampla aplicaÃÃo tecnolÃgica, verifica-se que Ã necessÃrio pesquisar novas cepas de micro-organismos produtores desta enzima, com caracterÃsticas especÃficas do resÃduo em estudo. Deste modo, teve-se por objetivo neste estudo avaliar a biodegradaÃÃo da Ãgua de lavagem (purificaÃÃo) do biodiesel, obtido por transesterificaÃÃo entre Ãleo de soja e metanol, por meio de produÃÃo de lipase, utilizando micro-organismos isolados do prÃprio resÃduo. Para tanto, foram feitas anÃlises das caracterÃsticas fÃsico-quÃmicas iniciais da Ãgua residuÃria da lavagem do biodiesel e a partir desse resÃduo foram isolados e selecionados micro-organismos com potencial de produÃÃo de lipase. Em seguida, foi feito um ensaio de biodegradaÃÃo de gordura, fixando-se as variÃveis: pH (5, 95), temperatura (35 ÂC), rotaÃÃo (180 rpm) e concentraÃÃo de nitrogÃnio (3 g. L- 1) e tendo como variÃveis os micro-organismos prÃ-selecionados e o tempo (24, 48, 72, 96 e 120 h). Com o tempo (48 h) e o micro-organismo Klebsilla oxytoca, iniciou-se o processo de otimizaÃÃo da remoÃÃo de gordura no tratamento da Ãgua residuÃria. Para tal, utilizou-se um Delineamento Composto Central Rotacional (DCCR), tendo como variÃveis independentes pH e concentraÃÃo de nitrogÃnio; as demais variÃveis foram previamente fixadas em: temperatura 35 ÂC, rotaÃÃo 180 rpm e tempo 48 h. Para validaÃÃo experimental do modelo proposto para remoÃÃo de gordura foi realizado, em triplicata, um ensaio de biodegradaÃÃo nas condiÃÃes Ãtimas estabelecidas. Estes resultados, por sua vez, foram comparados com uma cinÃtica realizada nas mesmas condiÃÃes, mas utilizando como inÃculo o produto comercial HÃbil FTW SF. A Ãgua residuÃria de purificaÃÃo do biodiesel apresentou alto potencial de impacto ambiental, tendo uma concentraÃÃo de O&G de 6, 76 g. L- 1. Das seis culturas microbianas isoladas do tanque decantaÃÃo deste efluente, dois micro-organismos (A e B) foram selecionados, apresentando um alto potencial de produÃÃo de lipase, com Ãndice enzimÃtico de 0, 56 e 0, 57, respectivamente. Por meio do DCCR, conclui-se que o ponto Ãtimo para mÃxima eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de O&G da Ãgua residuÃria de purificaÃÃo do biodiesel foi equivalente ao pH 7, 5 e 4, 00 g. L- 1 de nitrogÃnio, obtendo-se uma eficiÃncia de 60 % na remoÃÃo de gordura. O tratamento da Ãgua residuÃria utilizando o micro-organismo isolado Klebsilla oxytoca, a partir do prÃprio efluente, nÃo se diferenciou dos ensaios realizados utilizando o produto comercial HÃbil FTW SF. Biodiesel is a {{derived fuel}} from renewable biomass that can substitute partially or totally the fossil fuel. The production {{process of the}} biodiesel is composed by the following stages: raw material preparation, transesterification reaction, phases separation, alcohol recovery and dehydration, glycerin destillation and purification of the renewable fuel, resulting in glycerin as a by-product and purification wastewater. The formed wastewater during the stage of purification presents high concentration of oils and greases, presenting potential to contaminate bodies of water. One of the treatment proposals of this residue is the enzymatic hydrolysis use by lipases for removal of oils and greases. Due the specificity of lipases and its large technological application, it appears {{that it is necessary}} to search new microorganisms producers of this enzyme, with specific characteristics to the residue in study. Therefore, its objective was to evaluate the biodegradation of the biodiesel washing(purification) water, gotten trough transesterification between soy oil and methanol, by means of production of lipase, using isolated microorganisms from the proper residue. For both, analyses of the initial physicist-chemistries characteristics had been made with the residuary water of the biodiesel washing, then it had been isolated and chosen, by means of determinations of the lipase activity. Following, it was made a test of fat biodegradation, fixing the variables pH (5, 95), temperature (35 ÂC), rotation (180 rpm) and nitrogen concentration (3 g. L- 1) and establishing as variable the two microorganism preselected and the time (24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h). At the time (48 h) and Klebsiella oxytoca microorganism defined, the optimization process of the fat removal in the treatment of the wastewater was initialized. For such, it was used a designed central composite (DCCR), establishing as independent variables pH and nitrogen concentration, the other variable ones had been previously fixed in: temperature 35 ÂC, rotation 180 rpm and 48 hours. For experimental validation of the model considered for fat removal it was carried through, in triplicate copy, a biodegradation test in the excellent established conditions. These results, on the other hand, had been compared to a kinetics one carried through the same conditions, but using as inoculun the commercial product HÃbil FTW SF. The biodiesel purification wastewater had presented high potential of environmental impact, presenting a concentration of O&G of 6, 76 g. L- 1. From the six isolated microbiological cultures in the <b>decantation</b> <b>tank</b> of this effluent one, two microorganisms (A and B) had been selected presenting one high potential of lipase production, with enzymatic index of 0, 56 and 0, 57, respectively. Trough DCCR ways it has been concluded that the best point to the maximum efficiency of removal of O&G from the residuary water of biodiesel purification was equivalents to pH 7, 5 and 4, 00 g. L- 1 of nitrogen, resulting in an efficiency of 60 % in the removal of fat. The treatment of the wastewater using the proper isolated microorganism from the effluent (Klebsiella oxytoca) was not differentiated from the carried through essays using the commercial product HÃbil FTW SF...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} study of the {{reflection}} of water in an interval of length of the wave for the visible in a station of water treatment (CORSAN-RS) in Santa Maria RS, {{with the use of a}} portable spectroradiometer, where were collected spectral data of water from its arrival in a brute state and in the different stages of the treatment, until its effective availability to consumption. The hypothesis found were that the reflection would be different in the several stages of treatment converging to our specific objective which was to study the spectral behavior of the different stages of the water treatment. For such aim, we collected spectral samples of brute water, chloride water and in different sections of <b>decantation</b> <b>tanks,</b> in a total, it was collected 54 samples in the wave strip between 400 nm and 700 nm, which after that were statistically treated. The observed results show that the greater amount of reflection occurs in the brute water, in the chloride water and in the last, in the <b>decantation</b> <b>tanks</b> respectively, being the variables in those <b>tanks</b> of <b>decantation</b> present meaningful differences in this strip of wave length. The study showed that the effectiveness of the analysis of water reflection in the length of the wave for the visible, this way, it is possible to detect different levels of purity. Those data prove the efficiency of the spectroradiometer in the verification of the process of water treatment. Pages: 1151 - 115...|$|R
40|$|There {{are about}} 7500 water {{treatment}} plants in Brazil. The wastes these plants generate in their <b>decantation</b> <b>tanks</b> and filters are discharged {{directly into the}} same brooks and rivers that supply water for treatment. Another serious environmental problem is the unregulated disposal of construction and demolition rubble, which increases the expenditure of public resources by degrading the urban environment and contributing to aggravate flooding {{and the proliferation of}} vectors harmful to public health. In this study, an evaluation was made of the possibility of recycling water treatment sludge in construction and demolition waste recycling plants. The axial compressive strength and water absorption of concretes and mortars produced with the exclusive and joint addition of these two types of waste was also determined. The ecoefficiency of this recycling was evaluated by determining the concentration of aluminum in the leached extract resulting from the solubilization of the recycled products. The production of concretes and mortars with the joint addition of water treatment sludge and recycled concrete rubble aggregates proved to be a viable recycling alternative from the standpoint of axial compression strength, modulus of elasticity, water absorption and tensile strength by the Brazilian test method.

40|$|Adequate {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of protein digestibility in bullfrogs are important for the understanding of nutrient utilization. Therefore, this study evaluated two methods of feces collection: intestinal dissection and fecal <b>decantation,</b> using cylindric-conical <b>tanks.</b> Frogs were fed with a commercial diet (45 % crude protein) which was ground and supplemented with 0. 5 % chromium oxide III. The frogs were fasted 48 h before force-feeding (5 % of the animal's live weight). For the decantation method, the animals were sacrificed 36 h after force-feeding and feces were collected directly from the large intestine. For the sedimentation method, feces were collected when they appeared in the tubes attached to {{the front end of}} the cylindric tanks. No significant difference (P> 0. 05) in the apparent digestibility coefficients of crude protein for dietary was observed between the methods tested (74. 0 % and 76. 4 % for the dissection and decantation methods, respectively). In conclusion, both methods can be used for {{the determination of}} protein digestibility of bullfrog feed...|$|R
