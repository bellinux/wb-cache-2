5|$|In November 1943, it was {{announced}} that Prime Minister John Curtin, with Blamey's approval, had appointed Mackay as <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> to India. Sir Iven and Lady Mackay sailed from Perth, on SS Tanda on 14 February 1944. Their arrival in Delhi marked the beginning of an Australian diplomatic presence in India. When Lieutenant Iven Mackay was liberated, the Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had him brought to Delhi to be reunited with his family. With the war's end, Mackay retired from the army on 27 February 1946, and the post of <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> gradually became a civilian one. India was not yet independent, but was about to become so, and Mackay met with future leaders Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Mackay and the Minister for External Affairs, Dr H. V. Evatt, supported Indian independence, while expressing the hope that India would remain in the British Commonwealth. Mackay also promoted trade between India and Australia, and fostered a plan for Indian students and technicians to study and train in Australia. His term as <b>high</b> <b>commissioner</b> ended in May 1948.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{differences}} in terminology, Commonwealth <b>high</b> <b>commissioners</b> have, since 1948, enjoyed the same diplomatic rank and precedence as ambassadors of foreign heads of state, and in some countries are accorded privileges not enjoyed by foreign ambassadors. For example, the British Sovereign receives <b>high</b> <b>commissioners</b> before ambassadors, and sends a coach and four horses to fetch new <b>high</b> <b>commissioners</b> to the palace, whereas new ambassadors get only two horses. <b>High</b> <b>commissioners</b> also attend important ceremonies of state, such as the annual Remembrance Sunday service at the cenotaph in Whitehall (commemorating Commonwealth war dead) and royal weddings and funerals.|$|R
50|$|As {{diplomatic}} residents (as diplomatic ranks were codified, {{this became}} a lower class than ambassadors and <b>high</b> <b>commissioners)</b> were sometimes appointed to native rulers, <b>high</b> <b>commissioners</b> could likewise be appointed as British agents of indirect rule over native states. Thus <b>high</b> <b>commissioners</b> could {{be charged with}} managing diplomatic relations with native rulers and their states (analogous to the resident minister), and might have under them several resident commissioners or similar agents attached to each state.|$|R
50|$|All Ambassadors and <b>High</b> <b>Commissioners</b> to the United Kingdom are {{formally}} {{received by}} the Court, and all Ambassadors and <b>High</b> <b>Commissioners</b> from the United Kingdom are formally accredited from the Court—not the United Kingdom—as they are representatives of The Crown.|$|R
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as <b>high</b> <b>commissioner</b> in Namibia, but the post was {{downgraded}} and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E
5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E
5|$|From May 1864, George {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the Peloponnese, through Corinth, Argos, Tripolitsa, Sparta, and Kalamata, where he embarked on the frigate Hellas.

5|$|On 21June 1951, White {{resigned}} from parliament to become Australian <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> to the United Kingdom, {{a position he}} held until 1956.

As <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> he advocated continued British migration to Australia and participated in the renewal of the assisted passage scheme {{between the two countries}} in 1954. He suffered from emphysema and on 13October 1957 {{died of a heart attack}} at his home in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. Survived by his wife and four daughters, he was accorded a state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, and interred at Point Lonsdale cemetery. His daughters donated his papers to the National Library of Australia in 1997 and 1998.|$|E

5|$|Spurred by French army {{actions in}} the Ghouta, al-Bakri planned to capture the Citadel of Damascus, where French forces were concentrated, and the Azm Palace, where General Maurice Sarrail, the French <b>high</b> <b>commissioner</b> of Syria, would be {{residing}} on 17–18 October (Sarrail was typically headquartered in Beirut). The <b>high</b> <b>commissioner</b> functioned as the overall administrator of Syria on behalf of France and exercised practically absolute power. The rebel units active in Damascus {{at the time were}} al-Kharrat's ′isabat and a mixed force of Druze fighters and rebels from the al-Midan quarter and the Ghouta. To compensate for the lack of rebel strength, al-Bakri sent a letter to Sultan al-Atrash requesting reinforcements. Al-Atrash replied that he was currently occupied with operations in the Hauran, but would dispatch his entire force to back the Damascus rebels as soon as affairs there were settled. Before he received al-Atrash's reply, al-Bakri decided to move ahead with the operation.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of the {{conflict}} between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, there was a mass migration of Tamils trying to escape the hardships and perils of war. Initially, it was middle class professionals, such as doctors and engineers, who emigrated; they were followed by the poorer segments of the community. The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as internally displaced persons and also overseas, prompting the United Nations <b>High</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify them in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.|$|E
