The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing {{the angle of the}} Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.A microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, {{at the end of the}} record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape.

A biomechanical study by Volpon and colleagues on distal femur fractures indicates that <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> fitted to elastic nails may add to the stability of distal femur fracture fixation [5].

40|$|<b>End</b> <b>caps</b> are {{intended}} to prevent nail migration (push-out) in elastic stable intramedullary nailing. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the force at failure with and without <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> and whether different insertion angles of nails and <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> would alter that force at failure. Simulated oblique fractures of the diaphysis were created in 15 artificial paediatric femurs. Titanium Elastic Nails with <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> were inserted at angles of 45 °, 55 ° and 65 ° in five specimens for each angle to create three study groups. Biomechanical testing was performed with axial compression until failure. An identical fracture was created in four small adult cadaveric femurs harvested from two donors (both female, aged 81 and 85 years, height 149 cm and 156 cm, respectively). All femurs were tested without and subsequently with <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> inserted at 45 °. In the artificial femurs, maximum force was not significantly different between the three groups (p = 0. 613). Push-out force was significantly higher in the cadaveric specimens with the use of <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> by an up to sixfold load increase (830 N, standard deviation (SD) 280 vs 150 N, SD 120, respectively; p = 0. 007).

40|$|Solar Turbines Gas Compressor Engineering Division of San Diego, California {{called upon}} the Mechanical Engineering {{students}} of California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo to provide recommendations for optimization of compressor <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> port design. Various sizes of compressors have <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> with numerous ports that exchange fluids between {{the inside and}} outside of the working fluid pressure vessel. Because so many ports must exist on the <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> unusual flow paths are created to supply the appropriate location within the compressor. These flow paths commonly consist of a drilled inlet hole which intersects with a sudden expansion. The sudden expansion is deemed the “fly cut” because of its semicircular shape. Sudden expansions in general cause very high energy losses in fluid flow. This is one of the primary concerns when designing the compressor <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> port layout. Due to the unusual nature of the fly cuts found in Solar Turbines’ <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> published information on the pressure losses for this particular flow path do not exist. For this reason, Solar Turbines were required to base their port design on the best information available, including: historical compressor design methods, conservative design analysis estimates, and computational fluid mechanics software. Of these options, the computational method could provide the best estimate but only if validated experimentally. In response to this problem, PreFlow Systems was formed and investigated the solution of designing, building, and testing a scaled experimental test apparatus. This report outlines the details involved in every aspect of the project, including: technical specifications and objectives, design conceptualization, engineering analysis, manufacturing, testing, and results.
