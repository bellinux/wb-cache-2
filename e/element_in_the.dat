These included the Agusta scandal and the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> set indexing rows, and every <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum is the 54th most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust and the 25th {{most abundant}} element in its oceans, {{with an average}} of 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E

5|$|Unbinilium, {{also known}} as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table with symbol Ubn and atomic number 120.

In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be an s-block element, an alkaline earth metal, and the second <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth period. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is rare}} on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust, occurring {{only as the}} decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4.

Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E

Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite.

5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human body and the most abundant metal.

Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
