The test results are all within the specifications. The <b>integrated</b> linearized <b>transmitter</b> unit consists of a short TWT (30 dB saturation gain) and an integrated linearizing front end (70 dB gain) with the EPC. The integration of the Linearizing Front End (LFE) ind the EPC reduces the mounting area and increases the efficiency and improves the EMC characteristics.
