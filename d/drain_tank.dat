2500|$|Solid fuel {{nuclear plants}} have an {{additional}} disadvantage; for safety, they must instantly {{shut down in}} a power failure, but for nuclear-physics reasons, they can’t be restarted quickly. For example, during the Northeast Blackout of 2003, nine operating U.S. nuclear units had to shut down and were later restarted. [...] During the first three days, while they were most needed, their output was less than 3% of normal. [...] After twelve days of restart, their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent. Liquid fuel nuclear plants, particularly those with their fuel dissolved in salts, don't have the same downtime issues. Their nuclear fuel goes into a <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> when any failure inside or outside occurs. This happens passively when the freeze plug melts because of the heat created by fission (in operation the freeze plug is actively cooled). The fuel is cooled passively and slowly, so when a restart is requested the fuel salt can simply be pumped back into the reactor core as {{it is still a}} liquid. If the plant was shut down longer, the fuel needs to be reheated electrically and then pumped back. The reason a solid fuel reactor can't be restarted within seconds is because of the buildup of xenon, a radioactive gas that absorbs a lot of neutrons. As it is a gas it simply comes out of solution in a liquid fuel reactor and does not affect the restart process.|$|E

5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{distribution}} calculations {{are performed}} for the ITER-FEAT vacuum vessel, the connected {{pressure suppression pool}} and <b>drain</b> <b>tank.</b> An ex-vessel/first-wall coolant leak without plasma shutdown is simulated. The steam, hydrogen, and air sources for this sequence are taken from best-estimate MELCOR calculations. The time- and space-dependent gas distribution in the system is calculated using the verified three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics code GASFLOW. A new extended version of GASFLOW has been developed to model the ITER-FEAT specific phenomena in adequate detail. During the accident sequence, hydrogen initially appears only in the vacuum vessel due to the steam/beryllium reaction. After failure of the burst membranes, steam and hydrogen flow from the vacuum vessel through the connecting lines to the suppression pool and the <b>drain</b> <b>tank.</b> Because of the ongoing steam condensation occurring in the suppression pool, the pressure there remains permanently at a lower level {{compared to the other}} components, resulting in a continuous flow of steam and noncondensable gases into this volume. Since no steam condensation is modeled in the <b>drain</b> <b>tank,</b> almost all H_ 2 and N_ 2 accumulate in the suppression pool cover gas volume. After 10, 500 s of steam flow, also air starts entering the vacuum vessel, with the basic mechanisms remaining the same. Consequently, an accumulation of N_ 2 and O_ 2 takes place in the suppression pool cover gas. Combustible and explosive H_ 2 -O_ 2 -N_ 2 mixtures exist after 13, 600 s, and at 21, 000 s a stoichiometric H_ 2 /O_ 2 ratio has formed, involving 14 kg of hydrogen.

Heat was transferred from the fuel salt to a coolant salt circuit in the primary heat exchanger. The coolant salt {{was similar to the}} fuel salt, except that it contains only LiF (66 %) and BeF, (34 %). The coolant salt passed from the primary heat exchanger to an air-cooled radiator and a coolant salt pump, and then returned to the primary heat exchanger. Each of the salt loops was provided with drain tanks, located such that the salt could be drained out of either circuit by gravity. A single <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> was provided for the non-radioactive coolant salt. Two drain tanks were provided for the fuel salt.

40|$|AbstractTo get {{an insight}} into the {{operating}} characteristics of the passive residual heat removal system of molten salt reactors, a two-phase natural circulation test facility was constructed. The system consists of a boiling loop absorbing {{the heat from the}} <b>drain</b> <b>tank,</b> a condensing loop consuming the heat, and a steam drum. A steady-state experiment was carried out, in which the thimble temperature ranged from 450 °C to 700 °C and the system pressure was controlled at levels below 150  kPa. When reaching a steady state, the system was operated under saturated conditions. Some important parameters, including heat power, system resistance, and water level in the steam drum and water tank were investigated. The experimental results showed that the natural circulation system is feasible in removing the decay heat, even though some fluctuations may occur in the operation. The uneven temperature distribution in the water tank may be inevitable because convection occurs {{on the outside of the}} condensing tube besides boiling with decreasing the decay power. The instabilities in the natural circulation loop are sensitive to heat flux and system resistance rather than the water level in the steam drum and water tank.
