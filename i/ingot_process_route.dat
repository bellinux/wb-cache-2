40|$|AbstractAs an {{incremental}} forming process of bulk metal, ring rolling provides a cost effective <b>process</b> <b>route</b> to manufacture seamless rings. Applications of ring rolling cover {{a wide range}} of products in aerospace, automotive and civil engineering industries. Under some process conditions, defects such as porosity can sometimes be found in hot rolled rings, which are manufactured from high alloyed steel ingots having macro segregations. For the reduction of the waste of material and improvement of product quality, {{a better understanding of the}} relations between segregation levels in the <b>ingot,</b> <b>process</b> parameters in the hot ring rolling and the occurrence of porosity is needed. In this research, a coupled thermo-mechanical multi-stage finite element model is used to simulate the hot ring rolling process including preform forging. The deformations, stresses and strains from the preforming steps are included as initial conditions for the rolling stage. Subroutines are implemented to represent the control algorithm for the motion of the rolls. A damage indicator is implemented in the material model. Simulations with different feed rate curves are carried out in order to see the influence on the occurrence of porosity. Hot ring rolling experiments in an industrial rolling mill are conducted to validate the numerical study. The results of simulation and experiment show good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> {{selection}} {{is one of}} the main design decisions that needs to be taken during the preliminary stages of chemical plant design and development. A chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> is considered as the raw materials and the sequence of reaction steps that converts them in to desired products. Previously, the most important factor considered in selecting the chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> was plant economics. However, now other issues such as safety, environment and occupational health have also become important considerations. Therefore, at early stages of chemical process plant design and development it is necessary to apply methodologies to identify and assess environmental, occupational health and safety hazards involved in the <b>process</b> <b>routes.</b> This work proposes a methodology for assessing chemical <b>process</b> <b>routes</b> to manufacture a chemical based on inherent environmental, occupational health and safety hazards. The method developed in this work can be used during early design stages of a chemical process plant. The <b>process</b> <b>route</b> {{selection is}} done based on impacts due to emissions from the ongoing operational conditions of the plant. It considers the potential toxicological impacts on the environment, potential impacts on the occupational health due to fugitive emissions and the potential chemical and process safety impacts within the plant. As the outcome of the methodology, an integrated index called “Inherent Chemical <b>Process</b> <b>Route</b> Index” (ICPRI) is proposed which can be used for the selection of the ‘best’ chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> for a chemical process plant, based on inherent environmental hazard, occupational health and safety (IEHS). The lower the ICPRI the more inherently environmentally friendly, inherently occupational healthier and inherently safer the route is. The methodology developed in this work can also rank alternative chemical <b>process</b> <b>routes</b> based on inherent environmental hazard or occupational health hazard and or safety hazard separately. The method was applied on four possible <b>process</b> <b>routes</b> to produce acetone. The propene oxidation route showed the lowest ICPRI value indicating potentially the ‘best’ chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> for acetone manufacturing process based on the IEHS assessment.

40|$|Decision-making for {{sustainable}} design requires {{the evaluation of}} different options considering all sustainability dimensions simultaneously: economic, environmental and social. Each dimension has a specific relative importance, which depends on the process that is being assessed. The determination of the relative importance {{is not a simple}} task, principally, during early design stages when detailed information about the process is scarce, and when core decisions affecting the entire design are made. An example of this kind of decisions during early design stages is the selection of the chemical <b>process</b> <b>route,</b> which, once defined, provides the guidelines for the process design. The present study proposes a multi-criteria analysis based methodology to evaluate different chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> options under sustainability criteria and to guide the selection among them. The methodology uses normalized indicators to assess each sustainability dimension, and a multi-criteria analysis method (MCDA) to calculate the weights and influences between dimensions.

40|$|Introduction Liquid fuels will be {{the fuel}} of choice for air and cargo {{transport}} for the coming decades. Synthetic fuels produced by the power-to-liquid route are a promising alternative to 1. generation biofuels. Sustainable hydrogen can be derived via water electrolysis using renewable power. Sustainable carbon sources are biomass or carbon dioxide taken from air. “Unavoidable” CO 2 from industrial processes like steel or cement production might be considered as reused CO 2 reducing the societies footprint. The combination of renewable syngas production and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is investigated and the efficiency, costs and realistic quantities of synthetic fuels production is compared for different <b>process</b> <b>routes</b> and feedstocks. However, whether the new fuels will prevail on the market depends {{on a variety of}} factors, e. g. total net production costs and availability of feedstocks. Methods Currently, the Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) are intensely discussed. For techno economic assessment of different <b>process</b> <b>routes,</b> production pathways of BtL and PtL fuels have been modeled in flowsheeting software. Furthermore, a combined process concept called Power-Biomass-to-Liquid (PB-t-L) is developed and presented.
