5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of <b>genetic</b> <b>classification</b> include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E
25|$|This has {{obscured}} the historical developments within each language and/or language group, {{and as a}} result, there exist several systems to classify the Turkic languages.

25|$|Nostraticists tend {{to refuse}} to include in their schema {{language}} families for which no proto-language has yet been reconstructed. This approach was criticized by Joseph Greenberg {{on the ground that}} <b>genetic</b> <b>classification</b> is necessarily prior to linguistic reconstruction but this criticism has so far had no effect on Nostraticist theory and practice.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{principles}} in establishing a genetic grouping of languages is that typological traits must be excluded from consideration at the initial stage of establishment; only substantive traits (form-meaning pairings) are relevant. Yet typological evidence is still frequently appealed to in recent discussions of the methodology for establishing <b>genetic</b> <b>classifications</b> and in recent proposals for genetic affiliations. It is suggested that {{this is due to}} a conflation of typological and substantive traits in theoretical discussions of the role of ‘grammar’ and ‘structure’ in establishing <b>genetic</b> <b>classifications</b> of languages...|$|R

40|$|Studies of shore {{lines and}} shore line {{processes}} have neglected {{the development and}} use of descriptive classifications and have emphasized the use of <b>genetic</b> <b>classifications.</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>classifications</b> are theoretical, consequently they change, and perhaps become more complex as more is learned about the subject to be classified. While the genetic systems have served as useful bases for studying processes of shore development, they have, because of their many complexities and theoretical nature, made shore line description exceedingly difficult. There are several distinct classifications, each with its critics and supporters. In this B. uid situation of argument and disputed interpretation even an expert must proceed with caution in applying explanatory-descriptive terms to shores. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to propose a preliminary descriptive classification of shores that, first, will be useful in their description, and second, will be helpful in researc...|$|R

25|$|The Lombardic {{language}} is extinct (unless Cimbrian and Mocheno represent surviving dialects). The Germanic language declined, {{beginning in the}} 7th century, but {{may have been in}} scattered use until as late as about the year 1000. Only fragments of the language have survived, the main evidence being individual words quoted in Latin texts. In the absence of Lombardic texts, {{it is not possible to}} draw any conclusions about the language's morphology and syntax. The <b>genetic</b> <b>classification</b> of the language depends entirely on phonology. Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the High German consonant shift, it is usually classified as an Elbe Germanic or Upper German dialect.|$|E

The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern <b>genetic</b> <b>classifications.</b> Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|R

50|$|Greenberg's {{critics argue}} that the {{comparative}} method has an inherent limit of 6,000 - 10,000 years (depending on the author), and that beyond this too many irregularities of sound change have accumulated for the method to function. Since according to them the identification of regular sound correspondences is necessary to establish genetic relationship, they conclude that genetic relationships older than 10,000 years (or less) cannot be determined. In consequence, {{it is not possible}} to go much beyond those <b>genetic</b> <b>classifications</b> that have already been arrived at (e.g. Ringe 1992:1).|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of neurons in {{encoding}} and transmitting information is a major goal in neuroscience. This requires insight on the data-rich neuronal spiking patterns combined, ideally, with morphology and genetic identity. Electrophysiologists have long experienced the trade-offs between anatomically-accurate single-cell recording techniques and high-density multi-cellular recording methods with poor anatomical correlations. In this study, we present a novel technique that combines large-scale micro-electrode array recordings with genetic identification and the anatomical location of the retinal ganglion cell soma. This was obtained through optogenetic stimulation and subsequent confocal imaging of genetically targeted retinal ganglion cell sub-populations in the mouse. With the many molecular options available for optogenetic gene expression, we view this method as a versatile tool for matching function to <b>genetic</b> <b>classifications,</b> which can be extended to include morphological information if the density of labelled cells is at the correct level...|$|R

There are four basic types of sediment of the sea floor: 1.) [...] "Terrigenous" [...] describes the sediment derived from the materials eroded by rain, rivers, glaciers and that which is blown into the ocean by the wind, such as volcanic ash. 2.) Biogenous material is the sediment {{made up of the}} hard parts of sea animals that accumulate {{on the bottom of the}} ocean. 3.) Hydrogenous sediment is the dissolved material that precipitates in the ocean when oceanic conditions change, and 4.) cosmogenous sediment comes from extraterrestrial sources.
