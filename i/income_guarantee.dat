5000|$|Two {{conditions}} are indispensable {{if we are}} to ensure that the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of <b>income.</b> To <b>guarantee</b> an <b>income</b> at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage.

40|$|Latin American governments {{progressively}} substituted build–operate–and–transfer (BOT) {{contracts for}} government–provided highways during the nineties. Because under BOT a private franchise holder finances and operates {{the road in}} exchange for tolls, it is often claimed that BOT represents a privatization of highways. We argue that, as currently applied, the BOT model is an imperfect and incomplete privatization, because the franchise holders’ budget constraint has been soft, with losses being shifted to tax payers via minimum <b>income</b> <b>guarantees</b> and contract renegotiations. Soft budget constraints are inconsistent with the standard {{arguments in favor of}} BOT contracts and call into question their avowed advantages. Moreover, both renegotiations and minimum <b>income</b> <b>guarantees</b> allow governments to finance current expenditures with future tax receipts, sidestepping the normal budgetary process.  We propose various changes to the current model aimed at correcting its defects. First, franchises should be awarded through Present-Value-of-Revenue auctions rather than fixed-term franchises. Second, the agency in charge of monitoring contract compliance and regulating franchises should differ from the agency that plans and auctions projects. Third, franchises should be subject to hard budget constraints, so that both profits and losses are privatized. Key words: build-operate-and-transfer (BOT), concessions, cost-of-funds, franchising, government subsidies, present-value- of-revenue (PVR), regulation, renegotiation. ...|$|R
