5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical {{model for a}} classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's model described properties of metals {{in terms of a}} gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law. However, despite the success of Drude's <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>model,</b> it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and magnetic properties of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E

50|$|The {{formation}} of a non-crystalline form of a gold-silicon alloy by the method of splat quenching from the melt led to further considerations {{of the influence of}} electronic structure on glass forming ability, based on the properties of the metallic bond. Other work indicates that the mobility of localized electrons is enhanced by the presence of dynamic phonon modes. One claim against such a model is that if chemical bonds are important, the nearly <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>models</b> should not be applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a charge distribution between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to solids.|$|R
25|$|Near-degenerate {{states should}} also be treated in the above manner, since the {{original}} Hamiltonian won't be larger than the perturbation in the near-degenerate subspace. An application {{is found in the}} nearly <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>model,</b> where near-degeneracy treated properly gives rise to an energy gap even for small perturbations. Other eigenstates will only shift the absolute energy of all near-degenerate states simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|Drude's {{classical}} {{model was}} augmented by Wolfgang Pauli, Arnold Sommerfeld, Felix Bloch and other physicists. [...] Pauli {{realized that the}} free electrons in metal must obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics. [...] Using this idea, he developed the theory of paramagnetism in 1926. [...] Shortly after, Sommerfeld incorporated the Fermi–Dirac statistics into the <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>model</b> and made it better able to explain the heat capacity. [...] Two years later, Bloch [...] used quantum mechanics to describe the motion of a quantum electron in a periodic lattice. The mathematics of crystal structures developed by Auguste Bravais, Yevgraf Fyodorov and others was used to classify crystals by their symmetry group, and tables of crystal structures were {{the basis for the}} series International Tables of Crystallography, first published in 1935. Band structure calculations was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley developed the first semiconductor-based transistor, heralding a revolution in electronics.|$|E

In the present work we suggest a minimalistic model for these two bands, based on (nearly) <b>free</b> <b>electrons</b> <b>model</b> (FEM), which correctly describes the symmetry of these bands, their dispersion law and their localization with respect to the graphene plane.

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure {{and stability of}} the XMg 8 clusters (X = Be, B, C, N, O, and F) are studied using first principles theoretical calculations to understand the variation in bonding in heteroatomic clusters which mix simple divalent metals with main group dopants. We examine these progressions with two competing models, {{the first is a}} distorted nearly <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> gas <b>model</b> and the second is a molecular orbital picture examining the orbital overlap between the dopant and the cluster. OMg 8 is found to be the most energetically stable cluster due to strong bonding of O with the Mg 8 cluster. BeMg 8 has the largest HOMO-LUMO gap due to strong hybridization between the Mg 8 and the Be dopant states that form a delocalized pool of 18 valence electrons with a closed electronic shell due to crystal field effects. Be, B, and C are best described by the nearly <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> gas <b>model,</b> while N, O, and F are best described through molecular orbital concepts...|$|R
40|$|Spin-transfer torques {{occur in}} {{magnetic}} heterostructures because the transverse {{component of a}} spin current that flows from a non-magnet into a ferromagnet is absorbed at the interface. We demonstrate this fact explicitly using <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>models</b> and first principles electronic structure calculations for real material interfaces. Three distinct processes contribute to the absorption: (1) spin-dependent reflection and transmission; (2) rotation of reflected and transmitted spins; and (3) spatial precession of spins in the ferromagnet. When summed over all Fermi surface electrons, these processes reduce the transverse component of the transmitted and reflected spin currents to nearly zero for most systems of interest. Therefore, to a good approximation, the torque on the magnetization {{is proportional to the}} transverse piece of the incoming spin current. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|Conventional models use antisymmetrized {{configurations}} of molecular orbitals (MOs) expressed as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAOs) to describe correlation effects. In the <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> (FE) <b>model</b> {{and beyond the}} antisymmetry condition is neglected. This leads to a strong simplification and to physical transparency in describing correlation effects by electron repulsion without losing the essence, determining spectroscopic properties. Examples are studied where the correlation effects in the ground state and in the excited state are not very different (strong absorption band in dyes and polyenes) and examples where {{this is not the}} case (first absorption band in porphyrin, which is diminished in intensity to a tenth by electron correlation, transition into the 2 lAg state in polyenes, which is shifted below the llBu state by electron correlation). The appropriate evaluation of the electron repulsion integral is crucial in quantitative approaches. The evaluation procedures in the FE approach and in conventional models are critically considered.
