2500|$|As of 2014, the First Generation Magnox Storage Pond (FGMSP) {{remains as}} a {{priority}} decommissioning project. As well as nuclear waste, the pond holds about 1,200 cubic metres of radioactive sludge of unknown characteristics and 14,000 cubic metres of contaminated water. [...] Decommissioning initially requires retrieval of the radioactive sludge into a newly built Sludge Packaging Plant 1, as well as fuel and skip retrieval. [...] Completion of this will allow the dewatering and dismantling of the remaining structure. [...] Future work will immobilise the sludge for long-term storage, and process solids through the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Handling</b> Plant for treatment and storage.|$|E

50|$|Although {{much work}} was done on the {{theoretical}} design of the Super V-2 and its <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> systems, the French government expressed little interest in funding practical development. The project was cancelled in 1948 and the development work was refocused towards the much smaller Véronique rocket.

50|$|Many {{portable}} mantle-type fuel lanterns now use {{fuel gases}} that become liquid when compressed, such as propane, either alone or combined with butane. Such lamps usually {{use a small}} disposable steel container to provide the fuel.

50|$|Some SMR {{designs are}} {{intended}} to have lifetime cores so the SMRs do not need refuelling. This improves proliferation resistance by not requiring any on-site nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>handling.</b> But {{it also means that}} there will be large inventories of fissile material within the SMRs to sustain a long lifetime, which could make it a more attractive proliferation target. A 200 MWe 30-year core life light water SMR could contain about 2.5 tonnes of plutonium toward the end of its working life.|$|E

50|$|The {{porosity}} in {{powder metal}} parts becomes a liability when the part must resist a differential pressure. PM applications for compressed air, <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> or hydraulic housings are common and effective; however, {{they must be}} sealed first. The polymer does not add structural strength to the physical part, but it will hold high pressures without creeping. If the wall thickness of the part exceeds 1/4 inch, the leak pressure is typically on the same order of magnitude as the burst pressure of the part.|$|E

Work histories for 91 cases of leukemia and 364 matched controls (4 per case) identified for a cohort of oil distribution workers {{up to the end}} of 1992 were obtained, primarily from personnel records. Information on the distribution sites, more than 90 % of which were closed at the time of data collection, was obtained from site visits and archive material. Industrial hygiene measurements measured under known conditions were assembled for different tasks. These were adjusted for conditions where measured data were not available using variables known to influence exposure, such as temperature, technology, percentage of benzene in <b>fuel</b> <b>handled,</b> products handled, number of loads, and job activity. A quantitative estimate of dermal contact and peak exposure was also made...|$|R
