50|$|The Battle of Saratoga, {{the turning}} point of the Revolutionary War, {{did not take place}} in Saratoga Springs. Rather, the {{battlefield}} is 15 mi to the southeast in the Town of Stillwater. A museum dedicated to the two battles is located on the fields where the battles were fought. The British encampment before the surrender at Saratoga took place 10 mi east of the city, in Schuylerville, where several historical markers delineate points of <b>interest.</b> The <b>surrender</b> of the sword of battle took place where Fort Saratoga had been, south of Schuylerville.|$|R
50|$|This, {{as well as}} the unwearied {{activity}} with which he laboured both for increasing the security and splendour of the city of Athens, gained for him the universal confidence of the people to such a degree, that when Alexander the Great demanded, in 335 BC, among the other opponents of the Macedonian <b>interest,</b> the <b>surrender</b> of Lycurgus also, who had, in conjunction with Demosthenes, exerted himself against the intrigues of Macedonia even as early as the reign of Philip, the people of Athens clung to him, and boldly refused to deliver him up.|$|R
25|$|Lippencott {{performed}} water {{surveys in}} the Owens Valley for the Service while secretly receiving a salary from the City of Los Angeles. He succeeded in persuading Owens Valley farmers and mutual water companies to pool their <b>interests</b> and <b>surrender</b> the water rights to 200,000 acres (800km²) {{of land to}} Fred Eaton, Lippencott's agent and a former mayor of Los Angeles. Lippencott then resigned from the Reclamation Service, took {{a job with the}} Los Angeles Water Department as assistant to Mulholland, and turned over the Reclamation Service maps, field surveys and stream measurements to the city.

This was followed by the announcement of a reduction of Pressed Steel's capital from £1.6 million to £1.2 million. Morris lost the capital he had invested and the right to appoint directors, Pressed Steel was now free to supply other customers.|$|R

25|$|The Egyptian {{commander}} at Port Said, General Salahedin Moguy then {{proposed a}} truce. His offer was taken up, {{and in the}} ensuring meeting with General Butler, Chateau-Jobert and General Massu, was offered the terms of surrendering the city and marching his men to the Gamil airfield to be taken off to prisoner-of-war camps in Cyprus. Moguy had no <b>interest</b> in <b>surrendering</b> and had only made the truce offer to buy time for his men to dig in; when fighting began again vans with loudspeakers traveled through the city encouraging resistance against the invaders, by announcing that London and Paris had been bombed by the Russians and that World War III had started. As the paratroopers alone were not enough, Beaufre and British Admiral Manley Laurence Power urged that the sea-borne landings be accelerated and that Allied forces land the very next day.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the winter}} wore on, rumors reached Camp Robinson that the {{northern}} bands were <b>interested</b> in <b>surrendering.</b> [...] The commanding officer {{sent out a}} peace delegation. About 30 young men, mostly Oglala and Northern Cheyenne, departed from the Red Cloud Agency on January 16, 1877 to make the dangerous journey north. Among the most prominent members of this delegation was a young Oglala named Enemy Bait (better known later as George Sword). He {{was the son of}} the prominent headman Brave Bear. The delegation found Crazy Horse on the Powder River, but found no indication that he was prepared to surrender. Other Oglala camps nearby, however, were more willing to hear the message and to seriously consider surrendering at the agencies. In late February, part of the delegation continued on to find the Northern Cheyenne, where they delivered the same message.|$|R

50|$|Along with {{a number}} of other Cossack commanders, Hosseinpour was a {{founding}} member of the new Imperial Iranian Armed Forces during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He headed the Cavalry Division in the February 21, 1921, coup headed by Reza Shah. He was one of a number of officers who reached and secured Tehran. Tehran was completely surrounded by a huge canal for protection against potential military invasion and robbers. A tall wall also encircled the city, with twelve huge metal gates that were locked at night and protected by military guards. The military force headed by the coup officers left Karaj, a town about 40 km from Tehran, and arrived at the Ghazvin Gate (close to the present Mehrabad International Airport). When Hosseinpour reached the gate, he told the military officers guarding it that all the other gates had already been taken and that it was in their best <b>interests</b> to <b>surrender.</b>|$|R
50|$|Consignment shops {{differ from}} charity or thrift shops {{in which the}} {{original}} owners surrender both physical possession and legal title to the item as a charitable donation, and the seller retains all proceeds from the sale. They also differ from pawn shops in which the original owner can surrender physical possession (but not legal title) of the item {{in exchange for a}} loan and then reclaim the item upon repayment of the loan with <b>interest</b> (or else <b>surrender</b> legal title to the item), or alternatively can surrender both physical possession and legal title for an immediate payment; the pawn shop would retain all proceeds from any subsequent sale.|$|R

50|$|In 1904, {{land was}} {{surrendered}} from the Cote First Nation for the Canadian Northern Railway {{station and the}} town site of Kamsack. Between 1905 and 1907 additional land was allocated, the northern sections of which were returned to reserve status. In 1913 a further two-mile strip of land on the southern boundary was given, but returned in 1915 when it was identified the Cote people had lost too much of their best agricultural land. In 1963, further acres surrendered in 1905 were also reconstituted as reserve land. The <b>interest</b> in and <b>surrender</b> of land from the reserve’s southern boundary—nearest the Kamsack town site—resulted in part from speculation of its value for settlement.|$|R
40|$|POLICY PROCESS archon fung The {{danger of}} modern liberty is that, {{absorbed in the}} {{enjoyment}} of our private independence, and in pursuit of our particular <b>interests,</b> we should <b>surrender</b> our right to share in political power too easily. The holders of authority are only too anxious to encourage us to do so. They are so ready to spare us all sort of troubles, except those of obeying and paying! They will say to us: what, in the end, is the aim of your eVorts, the motive of your labours, the object of all your hopes? Is it not happiness? Well, leave this happiness to us and we shall give it to you. No, Sirs, we must not leave it to them. (Benjamin Constant, 1816) What {{is the role of}} citizen participation and deliberation in modern governance and policy making? The tension between expertise and popular voice in contemporary polities remains unresolved by students of politics, policy, and administration. Direct democracy strikes many as both undesirable and unfeasible. It is not desirable because the public virtues of political engagement have no special place in modern values and conceptions of the good life. 1 Even if it were desirable, it is not feasible This chapter emerged from discussions held in a workshop on novel forms of representation organize...|$|R
6000|$|Agrippina was {{at first}} {{somewhat}} astonished at being summoned at so early an hour to give audience to so formidable a commission; but her proud spirit had become so fierce and desperate under the treatment which she had received from her son, {{that she was very}} slightly sensible to fear. She listened, therefore, to the heavy charge which Burrus brought against her, undismayed; and when he paused to hear her reply, instead of excusing and defending herself, and deprecating the emperor's displeasure, she commenced the most severe and angry invectives against her son, for listening for a moment to calumnies against her so wild and improbable. That Silana, who was, as she said, a dissolute and unprincipled woman, and who, consequently, could have no idea of the strength and the fidelity of maternal affection, should think it possible that a mother could form plots and conspiracies against an only son, was not strange; but that Nero himself, for whom she had made such exertions and incurred such dangers, and to whose <b>interests</b> she had <b>surrendered</b> and sacrificed every thing that could be dear to the heart of a woman--could believe such tales, and actually conceive the design of murdering his mother on the faith of them, was not to be endured. [...] "Does not he know well," [...] said she, in a voice almost inarticulate with excitement and indignation, [...] "that, if by any means, Britannicus, or Plautus, or any other man were to be raised to power, my life would be immediately forfeited in consequence of what I have already done for him? Can he imagine, after the deep and desperate crimes which I have committed for his sake, in order that I might raise him to his present power, that I could seal my own destruction by bringing forward any one of his rivals and enemies to his place? Go back and tell him this, and say, moreover, that I demand an audience of him. I am his mother; and I have a right to expect that he shall see me himself, and hear what I have to say." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Primo de Rivera's {{thinking}} {{the ultimate goal}} of the new political movement was the resurgence of Spain as a major power. Article 1 of the Falangist Manifesto of 1934 reads,We believe in the supreme reality of Spain. To strengthen her, to make her great is the paramount task of every Spaniard. Personal interest, collective or class <b>interests</b> must <b>surrender</b> to the achievement of this goal.The third article states unequivocally,We have the will for empire-building. We affirm that the historical fulfillment of Spain is the empire. We seek for Spain a preeminent place in Europe. We do not tolerate international boycotts or foreign mediation. In regard to the countries of Spanish America we favour the unification of culture, of economic interests and of power. Spain puts forward her pivotal role in the affairs of the Hispanic world as entitlement to occupy a position of dominance in global affairs.Article 7 warns,Human dignity, the spiritual integrity of man and his freedom are eternal, intangible values and rights. But only he who belongs to a strong, free nation is truly free. No one will be allowed to use his liberty to attempt against the unity, the strength or the freedom of the fatherland. Harsh discipline will be directed against every attempt to poison, to divide Spaniards or to distance them from the destiny of the fatherland.Primo de Rivera did not accept the right of any region to self-determination and called for the wholesale eradication of separatists.The creation of great unions like Spain is the result of many generations engrossed in constant effort. The hard-earned glory of such a great task rests on centuries of sacrifice. To unravel it is much easier: simply let primeval, splintering separatism, barbarian at heart, take root in every crevice, and everything comes crashing down.But that happens {{in the absence of the}} resolute decision of a people, already shaped, who wish to remain together at all costs, and from whose youth will come individuals willing to order the shooting from behind, without hesitation, of clusters of traitors.He restated his position forcefully two months later in a letter to General Franco.At the end of my meeting the Minister of the Interior my determination to go out on the streets with a rifle to defend Spain had not cooled, but it was accompanied by the near-certainty that all who went out on the streets were going to play a dignified part in a defeat. Before the likely crafty and able assailants of the Spanish state, the Spanish state, in the hands of amateurs, does not exist.From his jail cell in Madrid two months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War he called on all military officers to take up arms against the government.When your sons inherit the uniforms you now flaunt, they will with them inherit either the shame of hearing it said, [...] "When your father wore this uniform what was once Spain ceased to exist," [...] or the pride of remembering, [...] "Our Spain did not succumb because my father and his brothers-in-arms saved her in the moment of truth." [...] If you do, as the old version of the oath says, [...] "May God reward you," [...] and if you do not, may he call you to account.|$|R
