5|$|<b>GateKeeper</b> is a Wing Coaster model {{manufactured}} by Swiss roller coaster firm Bolliger & Mabillard. It is Cedar Point's third B roller coaster; the park also has Raptor, an inverted roller coaster, and Rougarou, a floorless roller coaster. <b>GateKeeper</b> {{was the fifth}} Wing Coaster {{in the world and}} the third one built in the United States following X-Flight at Six Flags Great America and Wild Eagle at Dollywood.|$|E
5|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} plaza {{is located}} {{along the beach}} {{next to one of}} Wicked Twister's towers. A sculpture with the <b>GateKeeper</b> logo is {{in the center of the}} plaza. The queue runs parallel to the beach, under the lift hill and station. Once under the station, riders can choose which side of the train they would like to ride. <b>GateKeeper</b> uses the Fast Lane queuing system; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to wait in a shorter line.|$|E
5|$|<b>GateKeeper</b> broke several world records. Among Wing Coasters, {{it became}} the longest and fastest, {{featured}} the longest drop, and contained the most inversions. It also set a new record for having the highest inversion of any roller coaster in the world, surpassing Volcano, The Blast Coaster at Cedar Point's sister park, Kings Dominion.|$|E
50|$|The Global Dialing Scheme uses a {{hierarchy}} of <b>gatekeepers</b> to route call set-up information nationally and internationally. National <b>gatekeepers</b> have knowledge of all zones within a country, World <b>gatekeepers</b> have knowledge of all National <b>gatekeepers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{its first}} {{complete}} test, {{the roller coaster}} completed its first full-circuit ride on April 4, 2013. Hundreds of tests were conducted prior to inspections and approval for operation. On April 10, Cedar Point launched an online auction in which bidders could bid {{to become one of}} the first 64 people to ride <b>GateKeeper</b> after it opened to the public. The Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital and United Way of Erie County each had 32 seats available in separate auctions, and proceeds were shared between the organizations. Media day for <b>GateKeeper</b> was held on May 9, and the ride debuted to the public on opening day, May 11.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{the removal of}} Disaster Transport and Space Spiral. Exactly a month later, Cedar Point announced <b>GateKeeper,</b> the longest wing coaster in the world, which opened on May 11, 2013. Along with <b>GateKeeper,</b> a new main entrance plaza was constructed, replacing the entrance that {{was built in the}} 1960s. It features two -tall support columns that the trains go through. Cedar Point is investing $60 million in its hotel resorts over three years, starting in the 2013–2014 offseason. At the end of the 2013 season, John Hildebrandt retired as the park's general manager and was replaced by Jason McClure, the former Vice President and general manager of Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Point {{owns and}} {{operates}} six resorts located either on park grounds or {{less than a mile}} away. Most of the resorts are {{within walking distance of the}} Cedar Point Beach. All facilities are non-smoking, and all Cedar Point Resort guests can enter the park one hour before it opens to the general public. Rides that operate during this early-entry session are: Valravn, Millennium Force, Maverick, <b>GateKeeper,</b> Tiki Twirl, Cadillac Cars, Dodgem, Cedar Downs, Midway Carousel, and Kiddie Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates, in a {{regional}} context, {{the impact of}} <b>gatekeepers</b> {{on the quality of}} inventions at the patent team level based on a social network analysis. Given the lack of consensus in the literature, we explore two definitions of <b>gatekeepers</b> and distinguish their impact from external stars. Our results show that <b>gatekeepers</b> indeed influence the quality of the patents to which they participate. However, the quality of their patents is reduced if <b>gatekeepers</b> and their team members are located in the same region compared to multi-location teams and this holds for both definitions. External stars do not contribute to inventive quality even if they work within multi-location teams. Finally, inventor teams benefit from socially close <b>gatekeepers</b> located within their region, even if they have no <b>gatekeepers</b> within their team...|$|R
40|$|Business {{organizations}} have {{become interested in}} recognizing <b>gatekeepers</b> who may improve business prospects through informal external communication. Past research has identified <b>gatekeepers</b> within organizations, but no technique existed for identifying <b>gatekeepers</b> among groups of people working in an industry, profession, or other external group. This paper develops and tests a simple rule for identifying <b>gatekeepers</b> among members of a profession with a common group of potential interpersonal communication channels. The rule is used to classify <b>gatekeepers</b> among information technology professionals, based on self-reported information dissemination behavior. The rule passes five tests that compare the characteristics and information-seeking strategies of individuals classified using this rule {{with other members of}} the profession. The results of the study confirm that self-reported information dissemination behavior can be used to identify <b>gatekeepers</b> among individuals with diverse information-gathering behaviors, but a common group of potential interpersonal communication channels...|$|R
50|$|The St. Louis <b>GateKeepers</b> {{received}} {{considerable attention}} for their {{performance at the}} 2011 Spring Roll tournament hosted in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Despite being a relatively young team, the <b>GateKeepers</b> were undefeated in the tournament. Notably, the <b>GateKeepers</b> beat the high-ranking Puget Sound Outcasts and broke the 24-game winning streak of the previously undefeated New York Shock Exchange.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, <b>GateKeeper</b> ranked {{third in}} Amusement Todays Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride behind Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City and Iron Rattler at Six Flags Fiesta Texas.

5|$|The Corn Store {{adjacent}} to the Chapel may originally {{have been used as}} accommodation for a <b>gatekeeper</b> or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block.|$|E
5|$|The Kurma Purana goes on {{to state}} that after the {{encounter}} with the sages of the Deodar Forest, Bhikshatana continued to wander, visiting various countries of gods and demons before he finally reached the abode of the god Vishnu. Vishnu's <b>gatekeeper</b> Vishvaksena did not allow him to enter. Angered, Bhikshatana slew Vishvaksena and impaled the corpse on his trident, which added to his sin. This form of Shiva with a corpse on his trident is called Kankala-murti ("One with the skeleton"). Bhikshatana, now as Kankala-murti, entered Vishnu's abode and begged for food. Vishnu offered his own blood as food in one version. In another version, Vishnu cut an artery on Bhikshatana's forehead; a stream of blood spurts into his begging bowl as his food. Vishnu then directed Bhikshatana to visit the sacred city of Varanasi, where his sin would be expiated. The encounter with Vishnu's <b>gatekeeper</b> is also retold with some variation in the Vamana Purana and the Matsya Purana.|$|E
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that certain boundary spanning individuals, labelled <b>gatekeepers,</b> {{can be an}} important linking mechanism between organizations and their external environments. This study investigates the role of <b>gatekeepers</b> in the transfer of information in a single R&D setting by comparing directly the performance of project groups with and without <b>gatekeepers.</b> Results indicate that <b>gatekeepers</b> perform a linking role only for projects performing tasks that are locally oriented, while universally oriented tasks were most effectively linked to external areas by direct project member communication. Evidence also suggests that <b>gatekeepers</b> do more than mediate external information; they appear to facilitate the external communication of their more local project colleagues. Direct contact and contact mediated by <b>gatekeepers,</b> then, are two contrasting ways to link project groups with their external areas. The relative effectiveness of these linking mechanisms is contingent {{on the nature of the}} project's work. communications, organizational studies: behavior, research and development...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{effectiveness}} of internal <b>gatekeepers</b> and then ask whether equity incentives divert the attention of corporate lawyers from gatekeeping. We find that executive <b>gatekeepers</b> reduce compliance failures (AAERS and insider trading profits) to negligible levels and decrease securities fraud and uncaught accounting fraud by 43 % and 9 % respectively. A general counsel fixed effect explains 12 % {{of the variation in}} insider trading profits, 7 % in AAERs, and 6 % in class action suits, over and above firm, year, and CEO fixed effects. Then, using the assumption that <b>gatekeepers</b> hired from law firms are initially less responsive to incentive pay as compared to those hired from other corporations for identification, we find that equity incentives given to <b>gatekeepers</b> unwind some governance improvements. A one standard deviation increase in <b>gatekeeper’s</b> compensation delta unwinds 82 % of the prevention of securities fraud. <b>Gatekeepers</b> do not get diverted, however, from frauds associated with regulatory compliance. We conclude with an alternative interpretation of our design that these gatekeepers-in-residence may be hire...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the link between}} <b>gatekeepers</b> and corruption, and examines how money laundering mechanisms are used to conceal the proceeds of corruption. In order to successfully trace and recover stolen assets, {{we need to understand}} how <b>gatekeepers</b> utilize various money laundering mechanisms and offshore financial centres. This writing highlights how <b>gatekeepers</b> operating in the private sector, wittingly or unwittingly, use their expert knowledge of the international financial system to facilitate corruption by helping corrupt leaders legitimate, secure, and obfuscate the movement of the proceeds of corruption within the global banking system. It also looks at potential alternative responses to further curb <b>gatekeeper’s</b> roles in the money laundering process...|$|R
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and <b>Gatekeeper</b> at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's <b>gatekeeper.</b> Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma's fifth head. He wanders the universe {{in the form of}} a naked Kapali mendicant, begging for alms with Brahma's kapala (skullcap) as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} September 2012 and took roughly eight months to complete. The park {{built a new}} {{entrance}} plaza featuring the keyhole towers as the centerpiece. The roller coaster replaced Disaster Transport and Space Spiral, both demolished {{during the summer of}} 2012, bringing Cedar Point back to its former total of 16 roller coasters. It was Cedar Point's first new roller coaster since Maverick debuted in 2007, and the third B coaster in the park following Raptor (1994) and Mantis (1996). In 2013, <b>GateKeeper</b> was the most frequently-ridden roller coaster at Cedar Point, and it ranked 28th among steel roller coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards poll from Amusement Today.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} note {{focuses on}} the intersection of gender, sexuality, and age relations with <b>gatekeepers</b> by concentrating on explicit and implicit forms of sexual harassment and intimidation by male <b>gatekeepers</b> toward the author, a female researcher.

40|$|In this study, {{the process}} of {{innovation}} through knowledge transfer is investigated by identifying <b>gatekeepers</b> in cognitive innovation networks in the biotech industry in Germany, using network analysis on records from an unprecedented combination of subsidy programs of the European Commission (FP 6) and the federal German government. The results indicate that geographical distance between organizations does not act as a boundary for collaboration between the organizations that take part in these subsidy programs: Most actors are well connected beyond their own region. The <b>gatekeepers</b> are organizations that {{play an important role}} in connecting all organizations of the cognitive network. All <b>gatekeepers</b> are found to be organizations with a public mission (universities or research organizations), most <b>gatekeepers</b> are very active in the subsidy programs, taking part in many different collaborative projects, but the decisive characteristics of <b>gatekeepers</b> have yet to be discovered. Government and private organizations may utilize these conclusions in fine-tuning innovation (stimulation) policies and strategies...|$|R
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the <b>Gatekeeper</b> explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E

However, O'Malley befriends youngster Jeb (Darryl Hickman), son of the <b>gatekeeper</b> of the Forrest estate, Jason Rickards (Howard Da Silva). The grief-stricken boy shows him a way into the mansion, where he meets Christine. Though she is cordial enough, she refuses any cooperation with his biography. After O'Malley leaves, Forrest's private secretary, Clive Kerndon (Richard Whorf), fearful of how the reporter will react to the brushoff, convinces Christine to offer her help {{so that they can}} steer him in the direction they want.|$|E
5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The <b>gatekeeper</b> at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} paradox of {{executive}} lawyers serving as <b>gatekeepers</b> (reputation intermediaries) and executives (agents incentivized by equity compensation). We document these roles; general counsel fixed effect explains 4. 3 % of variation across governance measures on average and 2. 8 % in investment measures. We study the compensation pivot of this paradox using the identifying assumption from the sociology literature of professionalism that <b>gatekeepers</b> hired from law firms are initially less responsive to incentive pay as compared to those hired from other corporations. We find that equity incentives given to <b>gatekeepers</b> divert their attention away from corporate monitoring to strategic value creation. A one standard deviation increase in <b>gatekeeper’s</b> compensation delta diverts 98 % of the prevention of securities fraud. <b>Gatekeepers</b> do not get diverted, however, from frauds associated with regulatory compliance. On the flip side, we find some evidence that equity incentives are associated with increases in investments.

Capital market gatekeeping theory traditionally relies heavily on threats of legal liability for failure to perform legally mandated functions (along with a presumed constraint imposed by reputation effects). The ineffectiveness of many <b>gatekeepers</b> {{in the past decade}} revealed limitations of the liability strategy and yet reforms continue to emphasize legal duties and liability for <b>gatekeepers.</b> This emphasis also has the negative side-effect of discouraging <b>gatekeepers</b> from willingness to perform desired functions - such as to detect for fraud.

5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the <b>gatekeeper,</b> who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park.

5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the <b>Gatekeeper,</b> whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to gain insight into (i) {{processed}} snack-food availability, (ii) processed snack-food salience and (iii) the size of dinnerware among households with overweight <b>gatekeepers.</b> Moreover, associations between gatekeepers' characteristics and in-home observations were determined. Design: A cross-sectional observation of home food environments was conducted as part of a baseline measurement of a larger study. Setting: Home food environments of overweight and obese <b>gatekeepers</b> in the Netherlands. Subjects: Household <b>gatekeepers</b> (n 278). Mean household size of the <b>gatekeepers</b> was 3 · 0 (SD 1 · 3) persons. Mean age of the <b>gatekeepers</b> was 45 · 7 (SD 9 · 2) years, 34 · 9 % were overweight and 65 · 1 % were obese. Of the <b>gatekeepers,</b> 20 · 9 % had a low level of education and 42 · 7 % had a high level of education. Results: In 70 % of the households, eight or more packages of processed snack foods were present. In 54 % of the households, processed snack foods were stored close to non-processed food items and in 78 % of households close to non-food items. In 33 % of the households, processed snack foods were visible in the kitchen and in 15 % of the households processed snack foods were visible in the living room. Of the dinnerware items, 14 % (plates), 57 % (glasses), 78 % (dessert bowls), 67 % (soup bowls) and 58 % (mugs) were larger than the reference norms of the Netherlands Nutrition Centre Foundation.
