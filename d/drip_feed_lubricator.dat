2500|$|From {{the start}} of 1948, the {{railways}} were nationalised to form British Railways (latterly [...] "British Rail") {{under the control of}} the British Transport Commission. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and stations was completed by 1954. Rail revenue fell and, in 1955, the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-1950s saw the hasty introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock to replace steam in a modernisation plan costing many millions of pounds but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount. This failure to make the railways more profitable through investment led governments of all political persuasions to restrict rail investment to a <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> and seek economies through cutbacks.|$|R

50|$|Ring oilers {{were used}} for speeds up to around 1,000 rpm. Above this, the oil tended to be thrown {{centrifugally}} from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for crankshaft main bearings, {{they could not be}} used on connecting rod big end bearings. They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings. Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> oiler. For this reason they were widely used on larger electric motors and generators.|$|R
40|$|A {{capillary}} gas chromatographic {{method for}} the profiling of trimethylsilylated mono- and disaccharides and polyols in urine, plasma and unwashed and washed erythrocytes is described.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the issue {{regarding}} the survival, preservation of life, health and neuropsychic development of infants with extremely low birth weight. 25 preterm infants aged 0 to 4 weeks were studied. The inclusion criteria were infants aged 28 – 34 weeks of gestation, with weights ranging from 1, 000 to 1, 850 g. Enteral feeding consisted of specialized formula with prebiotics (6 hours after birth through a <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> tube), increasing to 150 ml/kg a day {{by the age of}} 10 – 12 days. The study results demonstrated that the maximum weight loss was recorded on day 4, 0 ± 1, 5. The original body weight was restored, on average, on day 13. The average daily weight gain was 14, 0 g/kg a day which evidenced good digestion of nutrients and high energy value of the formula. The results of lab tests showed a reduced level of nonesterified fatty acides, a slow waning of _-fetoprotein synthesis. Using a special formula with prebiotics on this category of infants, therefore, provides optimal rate of body weight growth and models protein lipid metabolism in blood serum after the anabolic pattern.

40|$|The 89 -year-old {{film-maker}} {{and designer}} Franco Zeffirelli {{is recognised for}} his spectacular mise en scène and professional mastery in the spheres of international cinema and opera, yet is critically despised by ‘serious’ film critics in Italy and abroad. This essay explores Zeffirelli's habitus (in Bourdieu's terms) {{within the field of}} Italian and international cinema and concludes that he differentiates himself from conventional accounts of auteur authority by his appeal to a middlebrow audience. The paper then investigates how Zeffirelli has maintained contact with this constituency over his long career. On the international front, these include the career choices he has made, the opportunities offered by new audiences thirsty for cultural capital and the technological development of new media products, such as his use of performance codes on DVD extras and reissues of his films and opera productions. On the local, rather than global, front, he maintains his Italian identity and appeal to a middlebrow constituency through a <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> of controversial interventions {{in the same way as}} Katie Price. He is vocal in his support of Silvio Berlusconi, expresses other controversial opinions in the press and social media, and intervenes regularly in support of the Fiorentina football team. The paper concludes by identifying the precariousness of the processes by which Zeffirelli constructs himself as an auteur in old age, and the mechanisms by which his constituency remakes the authorial sign and recognises him as a celebrity auteur...|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the evening McGuire acted as an intermediary and seems to have taken pleasure in his newfound power over the revered Vernon who wanted an audience with Scott. McGuire had spent the last decade trying to circle with some of the top professionals. He used his money, and his considerable knowledge, to assist other performers and constantly expand his knowledge of magic and secret sleights.However he was never able to get close to two of the best, Dai Vernon or Sam Horowitz.So McGuire got close to a magician both men admired, Max Malini, and through clever use of his association with Malini got to Horowitz.With his knowledge of Scott, McGuire had leverage and a worth to the top cardmen. For months before the June demonstration he had been giving some notes on Scott's work to Cardini.In 1931 he released a collection of manuscripts involving aspects of Scott's work which became known as The Phantom of the Card Table. Around thirty copies were released selling for as much as $50 each (approx $500 in today's currency).Through his <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> of notes to Horowitz and Cardini he got Vernon to start calling. McGuires replies contained nothing of value and only forced Vernon to keep writing. In the correspondence he prodded Vernon and talked up Scott's achievements and skills.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate the progression of bowel involvement after two years' follow-up in seven patients affected by glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Methods: Seven patients (5 F, 2 M, aged 4. 5 - 20. 6 y) entered the study. Bowel involvement was evaluated by ileocolonoscopy and specific IBD serologic markers. To evaluate disease activity, Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), terminal ileum wall thickness detected at ultrasonography (US), 99 mTechnetium labelled autologous White Cell Scan (Tc-WCS) and barium meal with follow-through were investigated. Results: Ileocolonoscopy and histology examination revealed variable degrees of bowel involvement in all patients. The results of serologic markers were indicative of a Crohn's-like ileocolitis. US and Tc-WCS, could clearly define patients with severe inflammatory involvement, but failed to identify all patients with mild to moderate disease. For the most severely affected patients, anti-inflammatory agents and steroids were prescribed, whereas nutritional therapy with polymeric formula and antibiotics were assumed by two other patients and antibiotics only by one patient. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was prescribed to all patients. Ileocolonoscopy and histology data improved in all patients. The assumption of G-CSF and/or gastric <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> (g. d. f.) was inversely associated with the PCDAI results (p < 0. 05).
