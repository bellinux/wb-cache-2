40|$|This paper {{describes}} a system {{designed for use}} by professional translators {{that enables them to}} <b>dictate</b> <b>their</b> translation. Because the speech recognizer has access to the source text as well as the spoken translation, a statistical translation model can guide recognition.

We discuss the experiments that led to integration of the translation model in a way that improves both speed and performance. 1 Introduction The TransTalk project attempts to integrate speech recognition and machine translation {{in a way that makes}} maximal use of their complementary strengths. Professional translators often <b>dictate</b> <b>their</b> translations first and have them typed afterwards. If they dictate to a speech recognition system instead, and if that system has access to the source language text, it can use probabilistic translation models to aid recognition. For instance, if the speech recognition system is deciding between the acoustically similar French [...] ...|$|R
