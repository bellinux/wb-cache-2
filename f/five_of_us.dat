25|$|At {{this time}} I visited {{one of our}} Advent sisters, {{and in the morning}} we bowed around the family altar. It was not an {{exciting}} occasion, and there were but <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City...|$|E

We also had the local train time table with us {{so that we could}} choose a train as per our convenience. We purchased bags and pressure cookers in Bombay.’’ He also claimed to have misled investigators by blaming the attacks on the Al-Qaeda.|$|E

500|$|Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was {{recorded}} at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 by producer Rob Schnapf, {{best known for}} his work with Beck and The Vines. Powderfinger had already written most of the album before departing to the United States. In particular, Powderfinger wrote songs in parts and brought them together; some songs were written in pairs or trios, while others were written in parts by different people, and then combined. According to the band, this brought a [...] "diverse" [...] and [...] "fresh" [...] approach to songwriting. The band used different methods in putting the album together as [...] "it comes back to the sound the <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can make together". Powderfinger guitarist Darren Middleton commented that as a rule they preferred not to put together an album that was just [...] "plain". As the style of writing differed, the band identified the need for piano performances in many of their songs, enlisting veteran pianist Benmont Tench to play parts throughout.|$|E
500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm {{not sure what the}} difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
