50|$|Fast returnThe <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> is {{probably}} the most simple and common form of passing shot. Because the opponent has a shorter reaction time when they are at the net as compared to the baseline, a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> can catch them off-guard or render them unable to react quickly enough. A <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> is usually played with great power as angled as possible either cross-court or down-the-line. To be able to hit such a shot, a player must have either a very strong and flat forehand or backhand, and not all players are able to execute such a passing shot well. Players who are adept at using pace to execute passing shots include Andre Agassi, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams.|$|E

50|$|In common terms, societies, companies, and {{individuals}} are often {{confronted with the}} decision to either invest now and get a <b>fast</b> <b>return,</b> or put off the investment until a new technology has emerged and possibly make a bigger profit then. For example, a regular problem for individuals is the decision of when {{to buy a new}} computer. Since computer speed develops at a steady pace, delaying the investment for a year may mean having to make do with a slower (or no) computer for the first year, but after that the individual will be able to buy a better computer for the same price. In many cases, however, the technological development is not as predictable as this, so it is harder to make an informed decision.|$|E

50|$|Angled shotAs {{compared}} to the <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> that uses speed to catch the opponent off-guard, angled shots {{are meant to be}} more subtle but are harder to pull off. However, if executed correctly, it is probably the most efficient way of hitting a passing shot. It involves hitting the ball at as acute an angle as possible, usually cross-court such that the ball falls {{right in front of the}} net, but bounces towards the side, making it impossible for the opponent to return the ball. To hit at such an angle, a lot of top-spin on the ball is usually required as well as a soft touch. Thus, players who can execute angled shots well are usually players who are familiar with using a lot of top-spin in their play, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who is famous for hitting Half-volley angled passing shots. Chris Evert is usually considered to have had one of the best directed passing shots in the history of the game, hitting her shots with pinpoint precision against serve and volley players.|$|E

Despite this, he stated that the ending had [...] "charm" [...] because the TARDIS travellers had begun to become friends.

He commented that it felt [...] "rushed" [...] and the resolution was a [...] "cop-out" [...] that failed to explain why the characters were acting so strangely. [...] David J.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{determinants}} of job-related fast repeat migrations {{of the labor force}} of Taiwan, based on the linked microdata of national migration surveys from 1980 through 1989. The main findings are as follows. First, the propensity to make <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> migration is negatively affected by the level of education and positively affected by the duration of unemployment, which suggests that those with a limited labor-market knowledge and an unsuccessful job search are more prone to make a return migration. Second, the propensity to make fast onward migration is strongly enhanced by the number of previous moves and negatively affected by the duration of unemployment, which suggests that more experienced and more successful previous migrants are more prone to make an onward migration. Third, those whose reason for the previous migration was job search are more likely to make a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> migration than those whose reason for the previous migration was job change or job transfer, which suggests that those who have secured a job at the destination before moving {{are less likely to be}} disappointed and to make a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> migration than those who migrated before securing a job. Fourth, gender selectivity in fast onward migration is very strong in terms of both overall level and age pattern, which reflects the strong dominance of patriarchal ideology on Taiwanese society. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{industrialization}} and the traffic development increase {{the frequency of}} ligament injuries in people, whereas the sportsmen belong to a category where this type of injury occurs most frequently. The {{average age of the}} people exposed to ligament injuries is around the age of 30. A precondition for a successful treatment in patients with ligament lesions is an accurate and timely diagnosis, well-performed surgical procedure and an appropriate and timely rehabilitation. The diagnosis is usually performed with RTG (radiography), CTM (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance) as the most accurate medical imaging technique. Moreover, this also includes various specific tests by which an accurate and timely diagnosis is established. The successfully performed surgery is followed by a rehabilitation treatment. The rehabilitation is performed in protocols which are especially created and designed for these types of injuries. The protocols comprise specific exercises in different postures by which optimal results are achieved, with regard to the range of movement in the knee joint as well as with regard to the strength of the quadriceps as the biggest and strongest muscle, and also a muscle that has the greatest role in the stability of the knee. The successfully performed rehabilitation in protocols means a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> of the daily activities in full range, and for the sportsmen a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> to the sports field and beginning with the trainings in full range and without limitation...|$|E
