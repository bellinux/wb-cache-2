Well, by this time I was most down {{to the foot of the}} island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp <b>fire,</b> <b>stopping</b> every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says: ...|$|E

I never heard such a row, and their trenches--we could stand up {{and look at them}} without getting a single shot at us--were flying about like the crater of a volcano. We were not in our firing trench. We had gone back into some new trenches, at the rear--I think {{to get out of the}} way of the counter fire. But this morning they weren't doing very much. For once our guns were on top. There was a feeling of anticipation--very like waiting for an examination paper to be given out; then we were at it. Getting out of a trench to attack gives you an odd feeling of being just hatched. Suddenly the world is big. I don't remember our gun <b>fire</b> <b>stopping.</b> And then you rush. 'Come on! Come on!' say the officers. Everybody gives a sort of howl and rushes. When you see men dropping, you rush the faster. The only thing that checks you at all is the wire twisted about everywhere. You don't want to trip over that. The frightening thing is the exposure. After being in the trenches so long you feel naked. You run like a scared child for the German trench ahead. I can't understand the iron nerve of a man who can expose his back by turning to run away. And there's a thirsty feeling with one's bayonet. But they didn't wait. They dropped rifles and ran. But we ran so fast after them that we caught one or two in the second trench. I got down into that, heard a voice behind me, and found my two prisoners lying artful in a dug-out. They held up their hands as I turned. If they hadn't I doubt if I should have done anything to them. I didn't feel like it. I felt friendly.|$|E

Roxul Inc. Final Report [...] October 7, 1997 Page i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <b>Fire</b> <b>stops</b> can introduce a physical connection between the two sides of a double-stud wall, hence providing structural flanking paths for transmission of vibration which worsens the sound insulation. This study primarily addressed the specific case of a load-bearing party wall with double wood studs, supporting a floor with wood joists perpendicular to the party wall and a floor deck or sub-floor of 15. 9 mm OSB. Even without structural transmission of vibration through a <b>fire</b> <b>stop,</b> the sound insulation in a real building is normally affected by flanking transmission. Addition of a <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> provides yet another path for vibration transmission between the rooms, and hence tends to worsen the sound insulation further. This study examines how a <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> at the floor/wall junction can degrade the apparent sound insulation of the party wall (the nominal separation) by increasing structural transmission of vibration around that wall via the connected floor system (the flanking path). Group 0 Constructions have no physical <b>fire</b> <b>stop.</b> Adding batt insulation to fill the wall's inter-stud cavities leaving a gap of 25 mm or less (Case 2) improves sound insulation provided by the party wall itself while adding negligible structural transmission. Strictly speaking, this is not a <b>fire</b> <b>stop,</b> but it does provide the necessary fire resistance (as shown in the companion study of fire spread) and meets the presc [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1905, company {{president}} John L. Rapier dies, allowing his son Paul {{to take his}} position at Rapier and Company, {{leading up to the}} next name change from The Daily Register to The Mobile Register. Five years later, Frederick I. Thompson became the new owner of the Register. The Mobile Item would be the next newspaper to operate under the Mississippi native, who owned a chain of newspapers in Alabama, but it would remain an afternoon paper under the name The Mobile News-Item starting in 1916. Publisher Ralph B. Chandler's afternoon newspaper The Mobile Press began publication on April 15, 1929 inside a former church on Jackson and St. Michael Street in downtown Mobile. Thompson suffered financially during The Great Depression, allowing his competitor to buy out The Mobile Register in 1932. The Mobile Daily Newspapers Incorporated was established to publish the Register as a morning paper, the Press as an afternoon paper, and both papers are combined as the weekend paper The Mobile Press Register. For the Press to continue, the Mobile News-Item had to end publication. The year 1944 had moments good and bad for the Press Register, starting with a <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> the presses for a brief period of time, but with help from the Army Air Corps and a New Orleans printing facility, the newspaper continued publishing. On October 1, 1944, The Mobile Press Register began publication at its new facility on 304 Government Street in downtown Mobile after years on St. Louis and Hamilton. [...] "No effort has been spared to make it 100% efficient", as the front page article stated that day. George M. Cox was the first Press Register editor to work in the building.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} present {{evidence}} of smoke spread due to problems in compartmentation and also reviews different test methods {{which can be}} employed to identify these problems during construction stages. Since 2010, evidence has emerged that the rapid spread of smoke occurs in and between UK buildings, including where accredited construction details and/or robust details are specified [1, 2]. It is considered that this rapid smoke spread {{could be due to}} incorrect installation, missing, inappropriate or defective components, that make up compartmentation and <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> within concealed spaces [1, 2, 3]. These defects can compromise the ability of compartmentation to resist fire and smoke spread between dwellings and also into any means of escape. The impact of the defects could ultimately be detrimental to occupant safety, care staff with the occupants and also fire fighters, {{in the event of a}} real fire. In 2016, fire risk assessments undertaken in buildings before occupancy (that ascertain the performance of the building with respect to fire and smoke spread in accordance with Approved Document B) of the UK Building Regulations are based upon a visual review of building design details and documentation, and also visual inspection of as-built details. However, this approach is inadequate to identify defects in the components that make up compartmentation and <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> details in concealed spaces [3] since, it is impossible to determine with the naked eye whether these details have been installed as designed. Littlewood and Smallwood [1, 2] have identified an urgent need to investigate the extent of these smoke spread problems within new dwellings being constructed in the UK and also the development for an appropriate compliance test which can identify issues in fire compartmentation and <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> and used before buildings are occupied - such as the in-construction testing (iCT) process. The paper also reviews different tests that can be employed as part of iCT methodology to identify the potential defects in fire compartmentation, and fire stops such as cavity barriers in buildings...|$|E
30|$|A {{critical}} {{issue for the}} structural fire protection of timber structures {{appears to be the}} integrity of fire proofing materials such as gypsum plasterboard (Lennon et al. 2000). Additional research is required to better understand the factors leading to ‘fall-off’ of plasterboard and other <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> materials and systems during fire. It is important to recognise the difference between light timber frame buildings (where the fire resistance of wood must be protected by gypsum lining materials) and heavy timber buildings which rely on the predictable charring rate of large timber members.|$|E
30|$|To date, most {{large-scale}} {{structural fire}} testing {{has focused on}} prevention of structural collapse during fire, and relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to preservation of compartmentation under large deformations in real structures during fire; this is particularly of concern given the large floorplate deflections and wide discrete cracking which have been widely observed in large-scale fire tests on steel-concrete composite slabs (see Section 3.1). The impacts of vertical and lateral deformations of structural frames on <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> and on both horizontal and vertical compartmentation should be studied to preserve life safety in buildings which are now becoming ever more reliant on defend-in-place life-safety strategies (for instance in highrise buildings where fire safety strategies are typically based on the assumption that a fire will be confined to the floor of origin).|$|E

30|$|Taken together, {{the tests}} {{described}} in this report highlight {{a number of important}} construction details and potential construction errors which may appear inconsequential to a building contractor, but which may have a profound impact on the structural fire response and integrity of a building during fire. Examples of this include integrity of <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> during large deformations, lapping of steel reinforcing mesh, anchorage of steel reinforcing mesh over shear studs on protected perimeter beams, use of deformed versus smooth bars for reinforcement (potentially leading to strain localization and tensile failure of deformed steel bars during fire), proper anchorage and grouting of hollowcore slabs, use of specific types of bolted steel connections to promote connection ductility and rotational capacity during fire, quality, uniformity, and robustness of structural fire protection materials (either passive or intumescent), and so on. Serious unknowns continue to surround many, if not all, of these issues, and {{there is a need for}} testing to support the development of best practice guidance which can be used to provide quality assurance programs on construction sites of so-called ‘fire engineered’ buildings.|$|E
