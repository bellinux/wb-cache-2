40|$|In thermal {{processing}} of oil shale in vertical retorts huge quantities {{of a solid}} waste – semicoke are formed. It {{has been shown that}} circulating fluidized bed combustion of semicoke could be a promising technology allowing utilization of its high residual energy potential. Tests in combustion of pure semicoke and semicoke with a small addition of oil shale (up to 20 %) were carried out using a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>device</b> with a thermal capacity of 50 kWth. The main parameters of combustion process and the additional heat produced were determined and calculated. The experiments indicated that semicoke with low moisture content (below 10 %) could be burnt in fluidized bed without adding of oil shale. For the combustion of semicoke with higher moisture content (over 10 %) about 10 % of oil shale must be added. One possibility for utilizing residual carbon present in semicoke could also be production of carbon-rich materials in order to obtain, for example, activated carbon. A series of experiments accompanied by SEM X-Ray and EDAX analysis was carried out in order to elucidate the distribution of carbon and mineral part in semicoke and to find possibilities for their separation and subsequent enrichment. Different separation methods – selective grinding and subsequent screening, pneumatic separation and triboelectroseparation method were analyzed. It was shown that due to close integration of mineral and organic part in semicoke, the separation of carbon-rich ingredients by the methods used was not enough effective to obtain enriched products suitable for the production of activated carbon...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the gravity separation of fine particles in a Reflux Classifier, a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>device</b> with a system of parallel inclined channels located above. A significant advance is reported here over what was previously possible, through the application of a recent discovery described by Galvin et al. (2009). By using closely spaced inclined channels it is possible to achieve significant suppression of the effects of particle size, and hence produce a powerful separation on the basis of density. Experimental work was undertaken on the continuous steady state separation of coal and mineral matter, with a very narrow channel spacing of 1. 77 mm used to process a feed finer than 0. 5 mm in diameter, and a channel spacing of 4. 2 mm used to process coarser feeds finer than 2. 0 mm. These results are compared with previous findings reported in the literature for wider channels. The gravity separation performance is shown to be remarkably high, with a significant reduction in the variation of the separation density with particle size, and a significant reduction in the Ecart probable error, E p. For example, over the particle size range 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm the composite E p for the size range decreased from 0. 14 for the wide channels used in previous studies to a typical level of 0. 06 for the closely spaced inclined channels used in the present study. The separation performance was also shown to be insensitive to feed pulp density and feed solids throughput over a very broad range...|$|E

The aim of these designs is {{to solve the problems}} arising by the granulation of powdery materials in <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>devices.</b> The gasdistributor and the collection system proved to be reliable at operation; they reduce the size of still zones, effectively disperse the binding solution in the bed and ensure the collection of granules of given diameter. The solution to be granulized is spread over the layer (Fig. 1 a, c) or into the layer (Fig. 1 b) through nozzles. The granules are pulled out of the device through the outlet nipple.

40|$|The Reflux Classifier (RC) is a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> {{separator}} {{capable of}} operating at high hydraulic loadings {{due to the}} presence of parallel inclined plates within the system. When the fluidized suspension passes up through the inclined channels formed by the plates, faster settling particles segregate onto the inclined surfaces, and slide back down to the zone below, while slower settling particles pass on through. The parallel inclined plates provide for a much higher sedimentation area. This arrangement is suitable for both hydrosizing and gravity separation. At MEGS 01, the results obtained for a pilot-scale study of the RC were reported [Galvin, K. P., Doroodchi, E., Callen, A. M., Lambert, N., Pratten, S. J., 2002. Pilot plant trial of the reflux classifier. Minerals Engineering, 15, 19 – 25]. Since then Ludowici MPE, in association with the University of Newcastle have developed the technology at the full-scale. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide details on the performance of the full-scale RC in the gravity separation of a coal and mineral matter feed in the size range of 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm. Historically, this feed has been processed using spirals, however, there is a strong trend now in Australia to employ <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>devices,</b> thus allowing significant changes to be made to the cut-point.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Froth {{flotation}} {{has been}} in use {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century. It is a well-established process, yet many of the fundamental mechanisms that governs the capture of particles in flotation systems are not fully understood. One of those mechanisms is the detachment due to the turbulent conditions inside the mechanical flotation cells. Turbulence itself is an active research area with many unknowns and therefore its application to the flotation is somehow limited. Nevertheless, the detachment of coarse particles and therefore the limit of a floatable upper particle size limit in mechanical flotation cells is attributed to the turbulent eddies that form in the cells due to strong agitation provided by the impeller. A workaround for coarse particle floatability problem is grinding. However, grinding processes that govern the final product size of particles are very energy intensive. There are countries that exists that the 15 % of the total energy consumed in that country, is solely used by the mining industry. It is also known that grinding takes a significant portion of the costs of an operating mine due to the energy requirements. For a sustainable environment in the future, the energy consumption must be reduced. Since grinding takes a large portion of the energy requirements of an operating mill, even a slight reduction in the consumption will result in a large savings in operating costs and will contribute to the sustainable environment aim in the long run. To reduce the energy costs related with grinding, a method must be utilized that can float coarse particles. A solution has been suggested by Jameson (2010), known as the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> froth flotation. A <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> provides a quiescent environment, due to the lack of eddies, which assists large particles to float to the concentrate without detaching from bubbles in the pulp phase. Since the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> flotation is a fairly new process, the literature lacks studies regarding the behaviour of <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> flotation systems. This thesis examines the effects of operating conditions such as the fluidization ratio, the particle size, the bubble size, the air flowrate, the values concentration, the bed height and the contact angle of particles on the performance of a specifically constructed laboratory scale <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> flotation <b>device</b> by using single bubble experiments to gain understanding on the mechanisms that govern particle collection in <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> flotation. This thesis also provides a model for particle accumulation on the surface of the bubbles rising in a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed.</b> To complement the model predictions, and to be able to evaluate the goodness of the model, the results of carefully designed experiments are described that utilizes a new method to determine the rise velocity of bubbles inside the particulate zone in a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed.</b> From photographic evidence, it is seen that the particles attached to a bubble slide down to the rear of the bubble as it rises in the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed.</b> Particles continue to accumulate in the rear up to a point, beyond which newly arrived particles are able to exert a force on the layer of those that had previously arrived, dislodging individual particles. Thus, once a bubble has reached a surface coverage of approximately 45 to 50 % as seen in the experiments, it cannot collect further particles. It should be noted that the packing fraction, the fraction of a given geometrical segment on the bubble’s surface actually covered by solid mineral, was found to be of the order of 0. 2 For uniform spheres in a square array, the packing fraction is Π/ 4 = 0. 785. It can be concluded that the particles in the surface layer are relatively loosely packed, compared with the close packing that can be achieved by uniform spherical particles in contact with all their neighbours. The observation that bubbles rising in the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> are never fully covered with particles when they emerge, leads to two separate conditions that limit the mass that a bubble can lift out of the bed. One is the well-known buoyancy limit, according to which the mass of particles that can be carried must be such that the buoyancy of the particle- laden bubble must be zero. This limit still applies, subject to a second limit, that the surface coverage of the bubble when the buoyancy limit applies, must be less than a number specific to the system under examination and theoretically cannot be larger than 1. The observed limit for the experiments carried out during this study was approximately 50 %. In general, it has been found that the model is a good first approximation that allows the determination of mass accumulation on the surface of a bubble rising in a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> flotation <b>device.</b> It has also been found that the collision and the attachment times are extremely fast in <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> flotation. The fitted collection efficiency term has been found to be consistent with what has been reported in the literature previously. It is concluded that to maximize the collection of particles, and therefore recovery, the operating parameters such as particle size, bubble size, the height of the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> and the fluidization ratio U/Umf, must be selected carefully for the system in question...|$|R

40|$|A dual <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> process using CaO-based solid sorbent is {{considered}} to be a promising technology to separate CO 2 from flue gas with low energy penalty. As reactor for CaO-looping cycle, both bubbling <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> and “fast ” <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> are available, thus four possible combinations, (bubbling or fast absorber) x(bubbling or fast regenerator), are conceivable for this process.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} the process design of gas {{distributors}} for <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> are based on empirical "rules of thumb" and do not {{take into consideration the}} effect of distributor design on bubble size in the bed. A method for designing the distributor plate in a large <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> to give a specified bubble size-range is presented here. For a given distributor in a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> the method may also be used to estimate bubble size. The present predictions are in good agreement with observed bubble size in a 1. 22 m × 1. 22 m square <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> reported by Whitehead and Young...|$|R
50|$|To {{assess the}} {{bubbling}} behaviour of the vibrating <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed,</b> {{factors such as}} the size of the bubble and its velocity were also taken into account. For various vibration amplitudes and frequencies, numerical simulations of the vibrating <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> was conducted to better understand the behaviour of the bubbles under the vibrating conditions. The results showed that due to the oscillatory displacement of the vibrating <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> causes the mean bubble diameter to increase but lowers the acceleration rate of the bubbles. Thus, it was concluded that bubbling behaviour in a vibrating <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> in dependent on the vibrations.|$|R

40|$|Spirals as {{internals}} are {{utilized to}} reduce the axial mixing of solids in <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds,</b> by routing the solids flow in a predetermined route or by localizing the solids mixing. The drying kinetics of continuous <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> with and without internals has been compared and modeled using batch drying kinetics and residence time distribution analysis. The batch drying experiments were conducted to establish the drying kinetics of ragi mimicking the conditions in the continuous <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed.</b> The batch drying kinetic data was modeled using a number of semi empirical models to identify the appropriate model and establish the kinetic parameters. Among the models tested, the Page model was found to match the experimental data, with minimum error. The kinetic parameter (k) was found to increase with temperature. The activation energy (E) {{was estimated to be}} 30. 5 kJ mol– 1, while the Arrhenius constant was 0. 03 s– 1. The drying rate in the continuous bed was found to increase with increase in temperature of the heating medium and height of the downcomer. The rate of drying in a continuous <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> is lower than the rate of drying in batch <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed,</b> while the drying rate in a continuous <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> with internals approximates drying rate in batch <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed...</b>|$|R
