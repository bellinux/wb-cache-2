[...] "When I was 16, Tony came to my local <b>drum</b> <b>store</b> with a bassist and did a [...] clinic that left a {{powerful}} impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should {{have a lot of}} impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band—the drums should speak just as freely as anybody." [...] Blackman says that the way that Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her. [...] "I just love and loved everything about Tony", says Blackman. [...] "To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music." [...] But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. [...] "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that – Okay, I might not be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track", says Blackman. [...] "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way".|$|E

40|$|Currently, the United Kingdom has no {{facility}} for {{the disposal of}} any waste above the low level category, indicating that all intermediate and high level waste, apart from spent fuel, has to be stored {{on the site of}} origin. To meet this storage requirement, nuclear sites are resorting to converting existing buildings or contemplating the construction of dedicated facilities, resulting in considerable cost implications. These financing aspects not only concern the construction strategy but also impinge on the ultimate decommissioning costs associated with each particular nuclear site. This paper reports on an investigation to apply the commercially available interlocking hollow block system to the design of a store for drums of radioactive waste. This block system can be quickly, and cost effectively, erected and filled with a choice of dense material. Later, the store can be dismantled with a minimum of disposable radioactive waste and the complete facility re - erected at another location if required, considerably reducing both capital construction and decommissioning costs. The investigation also encompassed a detailed review of the equipment required to place the drums of waste into the store, resulting in a scheme for a remotely operated vehicle that did not rely on umbilical control cables. The drum handler design included for 100 % redundancy of all functions, meaning that whichever component failed, the handler was always recoverable to effect the necessary repair. The ultimate aim of the waste <b>drum</b> <b>store</b> review was to produce a facility that was as safe as a conventionally constructed unit, but at a lower overall building and decommissioning cost...|$|E
40|$|For the {{computer}} Zebra we have undertaken {{a project of}} con-structing an Algol translator {{with the aim of}} being as complete as possible (with the only exception of own variable arrays). As a few new concepts are used in this design, it is thought to be useful to communicate them in this form. Zebra is a two address machine with a very limited fast store and a reasonable <b>drum</b> <b>store</b> of 8192 words. The operation code is a rather peculiar one. Every bit of the 15 bits of the function part of an instruction is used separately for a different elemen-tary function. The operations are in fact micro-operations and more complicated actions such as multiplication, division, list searching, etc. are not built in functions but can be readily pro-grammed. This makes the code extremely powerful for just those operations which are required for an Algol translator. On the other hand it is not the appropriate object language for Algol. Therefore we decided to create a new object language within the machine which is used interpretatively. The structure of this object language (called Intermediate Code or IC) is fully adapted to the requirements of Algol. The analytic code of Zebra helps a great deal in making the interpreter fast and c 0. npact. Another reason why an interpretive code is not such a drawback is that the machine has no built-in floating point operations so that these have to be programmed anyway. The system as a whole works on a load-and-go basis. First the translator is put into the machine, into {{the upper end of the}} store and the Algol program is then fed in, translated and built up in the lower part of the store. Then the interpreter over-writes the translator and the program can start working. We shall distinguish these phases by the names translate phase ~nd run phase...|$|E
