The aim was to analyze all therapeutically relevant mutations in lung cancer samples in a high-throughput fashion while significantly reducing turnaround time and amount of input DNA compared with conventional <b>dideoxy</b> <b>sequencing</b> of single polymerase chain reaction amplicons. Methods:In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a 102 amplicon multiplex polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing on an Illumina sequencer on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in routine diagnostics. Analysis of a validation cohort of 180 samples showed this approach to require significantly less input material and to be more reliable, robust, and cost-effective than conventional <b>dideoxy</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Subsequently, 2657 lung cancer patients were analyzed.
