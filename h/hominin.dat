5|$|The {{origins of}} the MSA are {{characterized}} in most regions by the Acheulian to MSA transition. This transition {{is considered to be}} a gradual process, rather than a singular event wherein <b>hominin</b> technologies advanced rapidly. Although the dates for this transition vary widely, the oldest reliably dated MSA site is Gademotta in Ethiopia at greater than 276 thousand years ago. The Middle Awash valley of Ethiopia and the Central Rift Valley of Kenya constituted a major center for behavioural innovation. It is likely that the large terrestrial mammal biomass of these regions supported substantial human populations with subsistence and manufacturing patterns similar to those of ethnographically known foragers.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest <b>hominin</b> fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known <b>hominin</b> ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E
25|$|It is {{unlikely}} that <b>hominins</b> populated Eurasia after a one-off event getting a few <b>hominins</b> across a strait (such as a Homo erectus family drifting on flood debris and landing on a Eurasian bank). There are biological constraints to the minimum size a population must maintain to avoid extinction. That is to say, if less than 50 <b>hominins</b> at once made it into Eurasia and lost contact with African <b>hominins,</b> the population would likely undergo an extinction vortex, {{in part due to}} inbreeding.|$|R

25|$|The {{trouble with}} this account is that Gigantopithecus {{was not a}} <b>hominin</b> and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the {{physical}} evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are <b>hominin</b> autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely <b>hominin</b> traits in parallel.|$|E

50|$|Although {{it is an}} {{extremely}} difficult task {{to figure out the}} evolution of the <b>hominins,</b> knowledge of these <b>hominins</b> has been growing. As indicated {{in the image of the}} family tree of the evolution of <b>hominins,</b> Kenyanthropus platyops were previously known to be one of the older <b>hominins</b> until the finding of the fossils in Kenya in the year 1999. Kenyanthropus platyops actually made the evolutionary path of the <b>hominins</b> more confusing, because of the fact that the specific species represented a new type of species and genus. However, after the discovery of the fossil in Kenya, it came to the notion that the K. platyops were one of the earlier species, living in the same time of the Australopithecus afarensis. After the finding of the K. platyops skull, the common ancestor has shifted to the K. platyops from the A. afarensis.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unclear}} what genetic {{influence}} H. ergaster had on later <b>hominins.</b> Recent genetic analysis has generally supported the recent-Out-of-Africa hypothesis, and {{that same kind}} of analysis may in time designate H. ergaster as the ancestor to all later <b>hominins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Sagittal sacral {{orientation}} {{within the}} pelvic girdle of humans {{is a key}} component of posture and obstetrics. On the one hand, sacral orientation has direct influence on the lumbar curvature; while on the other hand, it has an impact on the dorsoventral dimension of the birth canal. In this study, we aim to explore the evolution of sacral orientation in the sagittal plane and its relationship with the lumbar curvature in <b>hominins.</b> To do this, we measured sacral orientation using the pelvic incidence (PI) angle of the pelves of 53 modern humans, 19 nonhuman hominoids, and 4 fossil <b>hominins.</b> Our results show that the PIs of modern and fossil H. sapiens are the highest while the PI of nonhuman hominoids is the lowest (a nearly parallel sacrum in relation to the hip bone). Australopithecines PI is higher than that of nonhuman hominoids, but lower than that of modern humans. The PI of Homo heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis (Neandertal lineage <b>hominins)</b> is the lowest among <b>hominins.</b> We also found a strong correlation between lumbar lordosis and PI in nonhuman hominoids and <b>hominins,</b> indicating that PI angle is a good predictor of the lumbar lordosis when only the pelvis is preserved. We conclude that sacral orientation changed during the course of human evolution. When Neandertal lineage <b>hominins</b> are ignored, the results indicate a fairly simple path of evolution from nonhuman hominoid-like to human-like sacral orientation with two stages of the development. Neandertal lineage <b>hominins</b> show a reversal of this trend. </p...|$|R
25|$|The Afar Triangle is {{a cradle}} {{source of the}} {{earliest}} hominins. It contains a paleo-archaeological district that includes the Middle Awash region and numerous prehistoric sites of fossil <b>hominin</b> discoveries, including: the hominids and possible hominins, Ardi, or Ardipithecus ramidus, and Ardipithecus kadabba, see below; the Gona (Gawis cranium) hominin; several sites of the world's oldest stone tools; Hadar, the site of Lucy, the fossilized specimen of Australopithecus afarensis; and Dikika, {{the site of the}} fossilized child Selam, an australopithecine <b>hominin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} type 58 causes {{cervical cancer}} in 1020% {{of cases in}} East Asia. It is rarely found elsewhere. An estimate of the date of evolution {{of the most recent}} common ancestor places it at 478,600years ago (95% HPD 391,000569,600). As this date is before the generally accepted date of the evolution of modern humans, this suggests that this virus was transmitted to humans from a now extinct <b>hominin.</b> As this virus is usually transmitted sexually this furthermore suggests that mating occurred in this area between modern humans and a now extinct <b>hominin</b> species.|$|E
50|$|Like most hominids, {{but unlike}} all {{previously}} recognized <b>hominins,</b> {{it had a}} grasping hallux or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees. It is not confirmed how much other features of its skeleton reflect adaptation to bipedalism {{on the ground as}} well. Like later <b>hominins,</b> Ardipithecus had reduced canine teeth.|$|R
50|$|The {{footprints}} {{demonstrate that}} the <b>hominins</b> habitually walked upright as there are no knuckle-impressions.

The <b>hominins</b> seem to have moved in a leisurely stroll.|$|R

25|$|In 2013 the Neanderthal {{genome project}} {{published}} {{evidence of a}} minimum 0.5% Neanderthal gene flow into the Denisovans. The Denisovan genome shared more derived alleles with the Altai Neanderthal genome from Siberia than with the Vindija cave Neanderthal genome from Croatia and the Mezmaiskaya cave Neanderthal genome from the Caucasus, suggesting that the gene flow came from a population that was {{more closely related to}} the Altai Neanderthal. The Denisovan genome includes a component derived from an unknown <b>hominin</b> that diverged long before the modern human/Neanderthal/Denisovan separated, suggesting a possible gene flow from said unknown <b>hominin</b> to Denisovans or a population sub-structure.|$|E
25|$|That Russia {{was also}} {{home to some of}} the last {{surviving}} Neanderthals was revealed by the discovery of the partial skeleton of a Neanderthal infant in Mezmaiskaya cave in Adygea, which was carbon dated to only 29,000 years ago. In 2008, Russian archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of Novosibirsk, working at the site of Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia, uncovered a 40,000-year-old small bone fragment from the fifth finger of a juvenile <b>hominin,</b> which DNA analysis revealed to be a previously unknown species of human, which was named the Denisova <b>hominin.</b>|$|E

25|$|East Asian fossils {{from this}} period are {{typically}} placed in the genus Homo erectus. Very little fossil evidence is available at known Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe, but {{it is believed that}} <b>hominins</b> who inhabited these sites were likewise Homo erectus. There is no evidence of <b>hominins</b> in America, Australia, or almost anywhere in Oceania during this time period.|$|R
50|$|Decreased body hair {{began in}} <b>hominins</b> over 2 {{million years ago}} and aided {{persistence}} hunting (the ability to catch prey in very long distance chases) in the warm savannas where <b>hominins</b> first evolved. The two main advantages are felt to be bipedal locomotion and greater thermal load dissipation capacity due to better sweating and less hair.|$|R
25|$|In contrast, {{a recent}} genetic {{study found that}} unlike other early groups in Malesia, Andamanese Negritos lack Denisovan <b>hominin</b> {{admixture}} in their DNA. Denisovan ancestry is found among indigenous Melanesian and Aboriginal Australian populations between 4–6%.|$|E
25|$|Homo neanderthalensis {{retained}} most of {{the features}} of Homo heidelbergensis after its divergent evolution. Although shorter, Neanderthals were more robust, had large brow-ridges, a slightly protruding face, and lack of prominent chin. With a virtually identical cranial capacity to Cro-Magnon, they also had a larger brain than all other hominins. Homo sapiens, on the other hand, have the smallest brows of any known <b>hominin,</b> are taller and more gracile, and have a flat face with a protruding chin. H. sapiens have a larger brain than H. heidelbergensis, and a smaller brain than H. neanderthalensis, on average. To date, H. sapiens is the only known <b>hominin</b> with a high forehead, flat face, and thin, flat brows.|$|E
25|$|Loss of body hair in Hominini {{species is}} assumed {{to be related to the}} {{emergence}} of bipedalism some 5 to 7 million years ago. Bipedal <b>hominin</b> body hair may have disappeared gradually to allow better heat dissipation through sweating.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{evidence}} was presented for archaic admixture in some Sub-Saharan African populations (Biaka Pygmies and San), derived from archaic <b>hominins</b> that {{broke away from}} the modern human lineage around 700,000 years. After a survey for the introgressive haplotypes across Sub-Saharan populations, it was suggested that the admixture event happened with archaic <b>hominins</b> that possibly once inhabited Central Africa.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is likely}} that the australopithecines gave rise to the {{earliest}} Homo genera. The earliest <b>hominins</b> also produced lines, whether of australopithecines or other genera, that arose after speciating from the line to chimpanzees but went extinct without developing into Homo; thus, not all <b>hominins</b> are ancestral to the emergence of early Homo. (See [...] "Genera", classification infobox.) ...|$|R
50|$|Ungulates {{are known}} from archaeological {{evidence}} {{to have been}} the main prey of the early Homo, and given their great speed, they would have easily been able to outrun early <b>hominins.</b> Ungulate speed, coupled with the variable visibility of the savanna-woodland, meant that hunting by endurance running required the ability to track prey. Pickering and Bunn argue that tracking is part of a sophisticated cognitive skill set that early <b>hominins</b> would not have had, and that even if they were following a trail of blood left by an injured ungulate—which may have been in their cognitive capacity—the ability to craft penetrating projectile technology was absent in early <b>hominins.</b>|$|R
