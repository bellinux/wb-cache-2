The purpose of the work: revealing the laws and mechanisms of development of the alternating variations under the tolune effect of the rats' <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> in the different terms of pregnancy, in the period of lactation, and of its posterity. The laws and mechanisms of the morpho-functional stress of the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> in the organism of pregnant rats have been revealed. It has been shown, that the effect of tolune on the MPC level before pregnancy and in its forst week causes the essential alternating variations of the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> of the pregnant organism and of the posterity. Experimentally justified have been the perspective ways of limiting the alternating variations of the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> of the pregnant and its posterity the conditions of interaction of the mother organism with the organic solvents. The results of the work show the necessity of limiting the contact of women of the child-birth age with the given factors of the industrial medium.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{observations}} in man which describe {{the frequency and}} severity of bacterial infections of the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> in association with common bile duct obstruction. : ` This association has been corroborated in animals by observing {{the frequency with which}} complicating bacterial infections interfere with experiments designed to study the effects of sterile biliary obstruction. 5 " In view of the close relationship between obstruction and infection in the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> and considering the ease with which these structures are accessible in the experimental animal, it is remarkable that so little attention has in the past been directed to the pathogenesis of these infections. 7 " 8 The experiments to be described were designed to obtain information about infection in the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> and also to see whether previous observations from this laboratory concerning obstruction and infection in the urinary tract 9 were peculiar to that organ system or applicable to similar situations elsewhere in the body.

40|$|The {{study of}} bile {{proteins}} could improve {{the understanding of}} physiological processes involved in the regulation of the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system.</b> Researchers have tried for years to investigate the bile proteome but, until recently, only a few tens of proteins were known. The advent of proteomics, availing of large-scale analytical devices paired with potent bioinformatic resources, lately allowed the identification of thousands of proteins in bile. Nevertheless, the knowledge of {{their role in the}} <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> still represents almost a "blank page in the book of physiology. " In this review, we first guide the reader through the historical phases of the analysis of bile protein content, emphasizing the recent progresses achieved through the use of proteomic techniques. Thereafter, we deeply explore the involvement of bile proteins in health and disease, with a particular focus on the discovery of biomarkers for biliary tract malignancies. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

40|$|The {{preceding}} {{paper has}} demonstrated {{the ease with}} which bacterial infection of the liver can be initiated in the presence of common bile duct obstruction in animals. 1 This report deals with the relationship between bacterial infection of the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> and common bile duct obstruction in man. The detection of infection within the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> in man is of considerable importance particularly in diseases such as cholecystitis, bile duct obstruction and biliary cirrhosis. Despite the vast literature concerned with the role of bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of these disorders, criteria for {{the presence or absence of}} bacterial infection are poorly defined. Severe and fulminating infections are easily diagnosed clinically and pathologically. " 4 Thus, patients with chills, high fever, blood stream sepsis, shock and abscess formation in the liver are not likely to be overlooked. Much more numerous, however, are those patients with less severe infections for which there are no adequate diagnostic criteria. There are many persons with liver or gall bladder disease who have merely fever or leucocytosis with histological evidence of inflammation without abscess formation. Indeed, the presence of inflammatory exudate in the liver is often not associated with any clinical indication of the presence of bacterial infection. These problems of definition were clearly recognized by Rolleston 50 years ago. ' As late as 1952, however, Moschowitz ' remarked, "There are a number of problems in regard to biliary cirrhosis that await solution. 1. What are the relative roles of pure obstruction (cholestasis) and infection (cholangitis or cholangiolitis), in the production of these lesions?" Ten years later, in 1962, we know little more: "Much more informatio...|$|E
40|$|Liver resection, {{compared}} with other abdominal operations, is characterized by greater predisposition to septic complications. This {{may be explained by}} several factors, including the major role of the liver in immune defence, anatomical features such as the close relationship of the <b>hepato‑biliary</b> <b>system</b> with the intestine, underlying liver disease if present and specific preoperative treatments favouring postoperative sepsis. A critical point is that sepsis does not always present with immediately recognizable signs, such as fever or leukocytosis. At times it presents with more subtle signs, for instance hyperbilirubinemia and encephalopathy. After liver resection these may be misinterpreted as simple consequences of transient parenchymal insufficiency, therefore resulting in failure to recognize and promptly treat underlying sepsis. Particular caution is needed in this setting to avoid dismal outcomes. This chapter focuses on these aspects, describing underlying mechanisms and preventive measures and further characterizing the powerful synergism of sepsis overimposed on postoperative liver dysfunction in determining poor outcome...|$|E
40|$|On the Indian sub-continent, nearly 5, 000  years ago, the {{domestication}} of the riverine buffalo—the incredible Asian {{dairy animal}} was initiated. It plays a versatile role in socio-economic upliftment of its owners {{from the rural}} agricultural communities in Asian, African, South American and a few European countries. Comparatively, buffaloes are lesser evolved and susceptible to infectious diseases than cattle. However, poor body thermoregulation and wallowing nature predisposed them to snail borne infections, especially tropical fasciolosis—an incessant major constraint on buffalo production and improvement programmes. This review article is an insight into the global prevalence, varied epizootiological factors, offers possible explanation to pathophysiological clinical signs, deleterious effects of the tropical liver fluke, involving <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system,</b> haemopoitic system, endocrine glands and their secretions, oxidative stress, altered metabolism and significant fall in food conversion efficiency with unaffected digestibility of nutrients.

40|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{commonly}} considered a are cancer. However, {{if we consider}} the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> a single entity, cancers of the gallbladder, intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic biliary tree altogether represent approximately 30 % of the total with incidence rates close to that of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the third {{most common cause of}} cancer-related death worldwide. In addition, cholangiocarcinoma is characterized by a very poor prognosis and virtually no response to chemotherapeutics: radical surgery, the only effective treatment, is not frequently applicable because late diagnosis. Biomarkers for screening programs and for follow-up of categories at risk are under investigation, however, currently none of the proposed markers has reached clinical application. For all these considerations, cancers of the biliary tree system should merit much more scientific attention also because a progressive increase in incidence and mortality for these cancers has been reported worldwide. This manuscript deals with the most recent advances in the epidemiology, biology and clinical presentation of cholangiocarcinoma. (C) 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l.

40|$|Opisthorchis felineus or Siberian {{liver fluke}} is a {{trematode}} parasite (Opisthorchiidae) that infects the <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system</b> {{of humans and}} other mammals. Despite its public health significance, this wide-spread Eurasian species {{is one of the}} most poorly studied human liver flukes and nothing is known about its population genetic structure and demographic history. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap for the first time and to explore the genetic diversity in O. felineus populations from Eastern Europe (Ukraine, European part of Russia), Northern Asia (Siberia) and Central Asia (Northern Kazakhstan). Analysis of marker DNA fragments from O. felineus mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and 3 (cox 1, cox 3) and nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) sequences revealed that genetic diversity is very low across the large geographic range of this species. Microevolutionary processes in populations of trematodes may well be influenced by their peculiar biology. Nevertheless, we suggest that lack of population genetics structure observed in O. felineus can be primarily explained by the Pleistocene glacial events and subsequent sudden population growth from a very limited group of founders. Rapid range expansion of O. felineus through Asian and European territories after severe bottleneck points to a high dispersal potential of this trematode species...|$|E
40|$|Copper (Cu) is an {{essential}} metal, although in excess is highly toxic due to its redox properties and, therefore intracellular Cu homeostasis is a highly regulated process. Cu-ATPases are pivotal regulatory, proteins of intracellular and bodily Cu homeostasis. Two Cu-ATPases, ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B with distinct, functions are found in mammals and herein we report the structure and expression under Cu stress of, homologues of ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), the first such report for any, fish. The deduced protein sequences of S. aurata ATP 7 A (saATP 7 A) and ATP 7 B (saATP 7 B), displayed 63 % and 75 % identity respectively to their human homologues. All characteristic structural, features of Cu-ATPases were conserved between fish and mammals, {{although the number of}} Cu-binding, domains was less in fish ATP 7 B than in mammalian ATP 7 B. The tissue expression of sea bream, Cu-ATPases was similar to that observed in mammals, saATP 7 A being ubiquitously expressed, although low in liver, whilst saATP 7 B was mainly expressed in the intestine and liver. By analysis of the sequenced genomes of other species we have confirmed the presence of ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B genes in fish and propose that the presence of two Cu-ATPase genes in vertebrates represents a retention and neo-functionalization of a duplicated ancestral gene coincident with the development of a closed circulatory system and discrete <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>system.</b> Expression of Cu-ATPase mRNA was changed after exposure to excess Cu in a manner dependent on exposure route and tissue type. Excess dietary Cu (130 mgkg− 1 Cu dry diet) reduced saATP 7 A mRNA levels in intestine, gill, kidney and liver, and increased hepatic saATP 7 B mRNA consistent with increased biliary excretion. Whilst after waterborne Cu exposure (0. 3 mgL− 1 Cu), expression of ATP 7 A mRNA was increased in intestine and liver and toxic responses were observed in gill and liver. Our results indicate that Cu-ATPases in both fish and mammals have similar functions in maintenance of Cu homeostasis and are consistent with previous physiological evidence from various fish species for the involvement of multiple Cu-ATPases in Cu transport. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that fish can detoxify excess dietary Cu relatively efficiently but are unable to cope with excess dissolved Cu in the water, demonstrating that the exposure route is critical to toxicity...|$|E
