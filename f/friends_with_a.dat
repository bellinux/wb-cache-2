5|$|Appleroth's company, Traders Pty Ltd, {{was run by}} his son, Bert II, then grandson, Bert III, and {{ownership}} passed to Bert III's wife Val {{when he died in}} 1985. According to Traders' managing director, Hugh Knox, the Appleroth family were <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> former managing director of McCormick & Company, which opened up negotiations between the parties. Aeroplane Jelly was sold to McCormick Foods Australia in 1995, the Australian subsidiary of the United States-based McCormick & Company.|$|E
5|$|Biographers {{and critics}} agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly veiled {{version of the}} author, {{evidenced}} by numerous similarities between them. As {{a student at the}} Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's faith was shaken {{at the time of his}} first communion. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the dormitories.|$|E

Miles has a school friend, Todd (Desmond Robertson) who seems not to be bothered by Miles' condition. Miles wants to become a jazz pianist against the wishes of his classical-oriented instructor Miss Gimpole (Carol Kane). At a local nightspot, Miles becomes <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> jazz saxophonist, Tyrone Pike (Hines), who also has Tourette's but has learned ways to cover up his condition.|$|E
5|$|We had Belzer in {{the band}} for six months. I {{want to believe it}} was purely musical, and I {{honestly}} believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gay person at that point in our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations {{were at least}} in part politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Dave Matthews Band is an American rock band, {{formed in}} Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews. Other band members include bassist Stefan Lessard, violinist Boyd Tinsley, and drummer Carter Beauford. In November 1990, Matthews became <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lawyer named Ross Hoffman while a {{bartender}} in Charlottesville. Hoffman convinced Matthews {{to create a}} demo album of a few songs that he had written. Matthews then shared the demo with other musicians, including Beauford and Moore. Both of them, who were jazz musicians at the time, joined Matthews after hearing the demo. The band has released eight studio albums, all with RCA Records: Under the Table and Dreaming (1994), Crash (1996), Before These Crowded Streets (1998), Everyday (2001), Busted Stuff (2002), Stand Up (2005), Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (2009), Away from the World (2012). They have sold over 31 million albums in the United States, making them {{one of the top}} 100 highest-selling music acts of all-time.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon becomes <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new student, a Mexican {{immigrant}} named Pedro Sánchez (Efren Ramirez) {{who rarely}} conveys emotion or speaks. Pedro runs for class president after seeing a poster {{at the school}} dance. On the election day, he gives a mediocre speech {{in front of the}} student body. Napoleon does a dance routine as Pedro's skit for the election and receives a standing ovation, saving the campaign and winning Pedro the election. Following the campaign, Kip and Lafawnduh meet each other in real life and are wed. Jared Hess has stated that the series takes place before the marriage, but after Pedro's election, and several new characters are introduced.|$|E

Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has {{turns out to be}} Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstream}} media depicted Diệm as a friendly and charismatic leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> young boy from a Collingwood public housing estate and having tea with South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, with the females wearing the traditional ao dai. In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to mingle with his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E

He decides to teach Lisa a lesson by showing her friends her yearbook, {{revealing}} {{that she is}} a nerd. Lisa is furious at Bart, thinking that his disclosure has turned her friends away. Eventually, at a carnival, Bart realises how depressed Lisa has become, and how he cost her the only friends she has ever had. However, when Lisa returns to the beach house from the carnival she finds her friends in the act of decorating the Simpsons' car with sea shells in her honor, and they explain that they like her for who she is. To make up with Lisa, Bart has them sign her yearbook.|$|E
5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E

New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors. Club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), a senior, {{has no idea what}} to do about his future. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) has a new boyfriend (LaMarcus Tinker); her former boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) moved to another state. Three New Directions members have left: Sam, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who also broke up with Puck (Mark Salling), and Sam's ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair, a nose ring and a tattoo; she has taken up smoking, and has made <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of outcast girls called the Skanks.

5|$|Jimmy Kudo (Japanese: Shinichi Kudo) is a {{high school}} detective who {{sometimes}} works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is attacked by members of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison, but instead of killing him, the poison transforms him into a child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mouri) and her father Richard (Kogoro), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases, but when {{he is able to}} solve one, he uses a tranquilizer needle to put Richard to sleep, and impersonates his voice to reveal the solution to the case. He also enrolls in a local elementary school where he makes <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with a variety of characters, including his professor friend Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena (Sonoko), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), various police detectives from different regions, and the Kaito Kid.|$|E
5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> monkey and uses her {{stiletto}} heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E
