Another path is to, and through, the main oxidizer valve and enters the main combustion chamber. Another small flow path is tapped off {{and sent to the}} oxidizer heat exchanger. The liquid oxygen flows through an anti-flood valve that prevents it from entering the heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present for the heat exchanger to utilize the heat contained in the gases discharged from the HPOTP turbine, converting the liquid oxygen to gas. The gas is sent to a manifold and then routed to pressurize the liquid oxygen tank. Another path enters the HPOTP second-stage preburner pump to boost the liquid oxygen's pressure from 30 to 51 MPa (4,300 psia to 7,400 psia).

A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E

40|$|Fixture unit {{approach}} used for estimating the probable maximum simultaneous demands in building water supply systems {{is based on}} a fact that a given simultaneous reference design flow rate may be produced by different numbers of identical appliances characterized by the appliances’ <b>discharging</b> <b>flow</b> rates and <b>discharge</b> probabilities. Each appliance is represented by a fixture unit value, which indicates the appliance associated with the same simultaneous demand of a number of base case appliances characterized by the base case <b>discharging</b> <b>flow</b> rate and <b>discharge</b> probability. The validity of the selected reference design flow rate and its sensitivity to the probable maximum simultaneous demand for water systems in high-rise residential buildings are examined in this paper. In particular, fixture units and the estimated probable maximum simultaneous demands due to appliances attributed by discharge probabilities and <b>discharging</b> <b>flow</b> rates ranged from 1 / 8 to 8 times the based case attributes are considered. Estimated demands from the fixture unit approach are compared with computational results for an example water supply installation by Monte-Carlo simulations.

An increased reference design flow rate would be required for the applications of the fixture unit approach in demand analysis of larger water installations in similar densely built environment.

The use of a dynamic discharge valve is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic discharge valve.

If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the scroll compressor can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic discharge valve present (since there are additional <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> losses associated with the presence of the discharge valve as well as discharge ports tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} presents {{findings in}} regard to the vehicular interactions that arise when carpools and regular vehicles are segregated in their own lanes. Empirical evidence shows that the presence of a carpool lane can diminish vehicular lane-changing maneuvers near bottlenecks, which in turn can increase bottleneck <b>discharge</b> <b>flows</b> in adjacent lanes. This so-called smoothing effect is so pronounced that in many cases even an underutilized carpool lane can increase total bottleneck <b>discharge</b> <b>flows</b> and therefore benefit all freeway commuters and not only carpoolers. Ironically, the congested regular-use lanes are often damaging to the carpool-lane travelers. It is found that slow speeds in a carpool lane can be due to both, high demand for that lane and slow speeds in the adjacent regular-use lane. These findings imply that the current US policy to restrict most classes of Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEVs) from slow-moving carpool lanes can be counterproductive. The LEVs excluded from carpool lanes will thereafter contribute to congestion and slowing in the regular lanes, and this, in turn, can also reduce the speeds of those vehicles that continue to use the carpool lanes, despite the reduced use of those lanes. Implications for all of the above findings are discussed. This includes discussion on constructive ways to amend the new regulation, and promising strategies to increase the vehicle speeds in carpool lanes by improving the travel conditions in regular lanes...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{time scale}} of axisymmetric vortex rings is studied numerically for relatively long discharge times. Experimental {{findings on the}} existence and universality of a formation time scale, {{referred to as the}} `formation number', are confirmed. The formation number is indicative of the time at which a vortex ring acquires its maximal circulation. For vortex rings generated by impulsive motion of a piston, the formation number was found to be approximately four, in very good agreement with experimental results. Numerical extensions of the experimental study to other cases, including cases with thick shear layers, show that the scaled circulation of the pinched-off vortex is relatively insensitive to the details of the formation process, such as the velocity programme, velocity profile, vortex generator geometry and the Reynolds number. This finding might also indicate that the properly scaled circulation of steady vortex rings varies very little. The formation number does depend on the velocity profile. Non-impulsive velocity programmes slightly increase the formation number, while non-uniform velocity profiles may decrease it significantly. In the case of a parabolic velocity profile of the <b>discharged</b> <b>flow,</b> for example, the formation number decreases by a factor as large as four.
