5|$|The {{impact of}} the conquest on {{the lower levels of}} English society is {{difficult}} to assess. The major change was the elimination of slavery in England, which had disappeared {{by the middle of the}} 12th century. There were about 28,000 slaves listed in Domesday Book in 1086, fewer than had been enumerated for 1066. In some places, such as Essex, the decline in slaves was 20 per cent for the 20 years. The main reasons for the decline in slaveholding appear to have been the disapproval of the Church and the cost of supporting slaves, who unlike serfs, had to be maintained entirely by their owners. The practice of slavery was not outlawed, and the Leges Henrici Primi from the reign of King Henry <b>I</b> <b>continue</b> to mention slaveholding as legal.|$|E

500|$|Thief was {{the first}} 3D stealth game for a {{personal}} computer, and its stealth gameplay innovations influenced later games in the genre. The game has been cited as {{the first to use}} light and shadow as a stealth mechanic, and the first to use audio cues, such as the ability to eavesdrop on conversations and alert guards with loud footsteps. The game's use of sound wave propagation, which allowed sounds to travel around corners and through rooms, became widely considered by game developers. Thiefs influence has been recognized in other stealth games, such as Assassin's Creed, Hitman, Splinter Cell, and Tenchu. Marc Laidlaw, writer and designer on Half-Life, said that [...] "Thief is the single most terrifying, immersive, and rewarding game I have played and the one single-player game <b>I</b> <b>continue</b> to replay. [...] There are countless books I wish I had written; Thief {{is one of the few}} games I wish I had worked on." [...] Laidlaw called Thief his favorite game, an opinion shared by Fallout 3 lead designer Emil Pagliarulo.|$|E

500|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, where Björk premiered the song, {{she wore}} a very large dress which {{unfolded}} during her performance of [...] "Oceania" [...] to eventually occupy the entire stadium, and showed {{a map of the}} world in sign of union. Additionally, Björk wore [...] "bluish-purple glittery eye shadow across her lids. Her dark hair dangled in tiny twists that framed her pixieish, freckled face". Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony, the song was downloaded more than 11,000 times on the iTunes Store. Jake Coyle from Today commented that her dress was [...] "reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001". According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time, if it weren't for the fireworks {{at the end of the}} song, he was legitimately unsure if people in the audience would have cheered. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: [...] "They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyoncé-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but <b>I</b> <b>continue</b> to wonder about Björk's significance".

In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a [...] "breakdown in communication" [...] with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a [...] "hilarious, ridiculous rumor". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: [...] "Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely grateful to {{have had the opportunity to}} play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. <b>I</b> <b>continue</b> to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly thank all of the fans who have supported me and the show with such passion and enthusiasm." [...] In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: [...] "I think I speak for the entire Grey's Anatomy family when I say we wish T.R. Knight the best in his future endeavors. He is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no {{relation}} to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. [...] Hussey and Ferraro, {{directors of the}} Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. [...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. <b>I</b> <b>continue</b> to stand behind every word of it without the slightest reservation." [...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 {{that they would not}} be dismissed from the order. However, the leadership of the School Sisters of Notre Dame distanced the order from Hussey and Ferraro, calling them [...] "intransigent" [...] and stating that they [...] "have in practice placed themselves outside the life and mission of the congregation." ...|$|E

Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. <b>I</b> <b>continue</b> to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E
