40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} well {{accepted}} that the martensites <b>in</b> quenched <b>carbon</b> steels exhibit two typical morphologies which are closely dependent on the carbon content, i. e. lath martensite <b>in</b> low <b>carbon</b> steels and lenticular martensite <b>in</b> high <b>carbon</b> steels.

It was found that lots of lath martensites consist of twin as their substructure, rather than high density dislocations. In addition, nanoscale precipitates cohering with ferrite matrix were found at the twin interfaces.

5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved <b>in</b> <b>carbon</b> tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{absorption}} <b>in</b> <b>carbon</b> nanotubes {{differs from}} absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
