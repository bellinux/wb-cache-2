5|$|In {{addition}} to {{meeting the needs}} of the British forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like Violet Club were no longer required, as Project E weapons could do the job pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only lighter than the British <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> warhead used in Yellow Sun, but remarkably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version of the Mark 28 was developed, known as Red Snow, and a Yellow Sun Mark 2 using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with <b>Green</b> <b>Grass.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 90 minute {{production}} was conceived in 1997 and commissioned in 2003, {{with the premise}} established in the final episode of Only Fools and Horses in 2003. It was shelved and Only Fools and Horses spin-off The Green <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> was developed; its success led to the prequel being recommissioned in July 2009. Filming began in October in London and the {{production was}} first broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 24 January 2010. It was the second most watched programme of the day but gained mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut <b>green</b> <b>grass,</b> and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E

25|$|A {{spin-off}} of Only Fools and Horses entitled The Green <b>Green</b> <b>Grass,</b> {{also written}} by John Sullivan {{and directed by}} Tony Dow, was first aired in the UK in September 2005. Sullivan had considered writing a sitcom around the popular characters of Boycie and Marlene (John Challis and Sue Holderness) since the mid-1980s, {{but it was not}} until the series finally ended that the idea came to fruition. The Green <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> sees Boycie and Marlene forced to leave Peckham by one-time Only Fools and Horses villains, the Driscoll Brothers, and has included guest appearances by Denzil (Paul Barber) and Sid (Roy Heather). A second series of The Green <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> was broadcast in the UK in October 2006, a third in November 2007 and a fourth in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|Delays and {{failures}} in the Granite programme and the abandonment of Green Bamboo without a test, left {{a gap in the}} programme and an emergency capability weapon to fill that gap was devised from elements of both Green Bamboo and Orange Herald; being known as Knobkerry, or <b>Green</b> <b>Grass,</b> and the Interim Megaton Weapon. There were also other factors involved in the decision to build an Interim Megaton Weapon. One being that the UK HEU production programme was by 1957 producing quantities of HEU for which there was no immediate need; and the Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to see it continue to languish in stores, unused for weapons, when it was being produced at great cost. The <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> warhead containing perhaps 70–86kg of HEU (although there are no reliable declassified sources for this figure) was therefore hurriedly produced and installed in a modified Blue Danube casing, to be known as Violet Club, until a better solution based on the Yellow Sun casing could be produced, known then with <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> installed, as Yellow Sun Mk.1. Only five Violet Club weapons were produced, known by the RAF description of Bomb, Aircraft, HE 9,000lb HC, and they were stripped of their <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> warheads for transfer to the better casings when these became available.|$|E

Novels three and four, Wild Geese and Timber Wolf, are both sequels to <b>Greener</b> <b>Grass.</b> Characters are following during their adventures in North America.

[...] Originally novel six was to be focused on a character from <b>Greener</b> <b>Grass,</b> but became the story of a number of characters on a Southern tobacco plantation.

25|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram above, one method used to {{decrease}} the likelihood of accidental detonation employed metal balls.

25|$|Grass on {{golf courses}} {{is kept in}} three {{distinct}} conditions: that of the rough, the fairway, and the putting <b>green.</b> <b>Grass</b> on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly.

Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.|$|E
