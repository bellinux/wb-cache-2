40|$|The <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> {{of animal}} manures are major {{concerns}} of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) worldwide. Concerns are both environmental and economic: environmental because of noxious odors from ammonia volatilization, leaching of nitrates into ground and surface waters, and excessive amount of heavy metals in the manure; economic because of disposal costs, compliance of envi-ronmental regulations, {{and the loss}} of valuable nutrients from the farming system. A central goal of sustai-nable farming systems is to convert waste products into a valuable resource. Livestock manure from CAFOs is often spread on cultivated fields, but the loss of manure nitrogen (often over 50 %) through ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching makes the nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratio to low for balanced and appropriate crop applications. Both empirical evidence and the chemical composition/structure of natural zeolites support their mix-ture with animal manures as an environmentally friendly approach to solve the above problems. Natural zeolites are hydrated sodium or potassium, calcium aluminosilicate minerals found in many countries.

Given the recent technological and organisational changes in the <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of network infrastructures, the traditional model of User Groups of research information and their Needs has to be challenged. A small-scale user survey combined with an elite questionnaire procedure is still to be conducted in a forthcoming period of this investigation, attempting to collect data from several previous identified User Groups, assessing their specific Needs in the use of current research information and specifically identifying the bridge conducting research information to production systems and innovation settings. Pursuing the goal to collect some empirical evidence in the real usefulness of CRIS systems a simultaneous question was being addressed. How can users help to enhance the efficiency of those systems, participating in real-time and with one another on current research networks? On the other hand, the recognised trend from Distributed Static Systems to Transactional Systems supported on web technology is giving rise to the implementation of evolutionary systems based on Network Computing approaches.

30|$|In India, CBM {{recovery}} is increasing day-by-day {{and expected to}} rise from current 0.5 to 7 mmscmd by 2020. The commercial methane production in India has been started since 2007, first in Raniganj Coalfield by GEECL and consequently by Essar and ONGC. Production of CBM is associated with pumping of large quantity of aquifer water to reduce hydrostatic pressure existing on coal seams. Produced water quality and quantity vary widely, and {{it is necessary to}} manage through some combinations of treatment, storage, <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>use.</b> Unlike conventional gas reservoirs, coal is both the reservoir rock and the source rock for methane. CBM wells, in comparison with conventional oil and gas wells, produce large volume of water early in their life, and the water volume declines over time (Khatib and Verbeek 2003). Usually, CBM-produced water is discharged into associated unlined holding ponds (Reddy et al. 2003). Management of CBM-produced water is associated with challenges, and it is also very expensive for operators. Understanding about produced water characteristics can help in increasing the production and also knowledge of its chemical constituents; operators can determine the proper application of scale inhibitors and well treatment chemicals as well as identify potential well-bore or reservoir problem areas (Breit et al. 1998). The geochemical properties of CBM-produced water vary with the original depositional environment, depth of burial and coal type, and it vary significantly across production areas (Jackson and Myers 2002). CBM-produced water can be beneficially used, but the presence of some of the chemical parameters and their concentrations may limit the use of these waters in certain areas (Shramko et al. 2009). The suitability of CBM-produced water for agricultural purposes generally irrigation or stock watering, will depend not only {{on the quality of the}} produced water but also on the conditions of the receiving areas (ALL 2003).|$|E
40|$|Background. Municipal {{solid wastes}} {{management}} has recently {{become an important}} public health concern. Municipal solid wastes are {{a major source of}} raw materials {{that could be used for}} resource recovery for diverse applications. Objectives. The present study aimed to determine the composition of municipal solid waste and recoverable resources from the waste of the Ga East Municipal Assembly (GEMA) in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Methods. An exploratory approach was used to collect pertinent data from the Abloradgei dumpsite in GEMA using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussion. A field characterization study was undertaken to segregate and estimate the value of various components of collected waste. Dumpsite workers were asked about current general composition of MSW, mode of collection and disposal, record of sanitation-related diseases, use of modern treatment plant, waste management legislation and enforcement challenges, number of trucks received by the dumpsite per day, record on pretreatment of MSW before <b>disposal,</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of personnel protective equipment. Results. The results showed that significant proportions (48. 8 %) of the municipal solid wastes were organic materials, while the remaining (51. 2 %) were inorganic materials. The results also showed that 63 % of the municipal solid waste is collected with no sorting from the source and no modern treatment applied before dumping. It was estimated that the value of the recyclable materials in GEMA municipal solid waste amounts to Ghana Cedis (GH¢) 9, 381, 960 (plastic); 985, 111 (mixed glass); 5, 160, 078 (paper) and 11, 586, 770 (metal) with a total of GH¢ 27, 113, 919 ($ 10, 845, 568) equivalent to 2, 106, 339. 2 m 3 (74, 384, 667. 5 ft 3) per annum of biogas from these components with a market value of GH¢ 1, 997, 972. 17 ($ 768, 393. 62); 11, 579 Mwh (1. 32 Mw) of electricity and 9, 535 Mwh (1. 09 Mw) of heat. This is estimated to be lost with the current waste management practices. Conclusions. We recommend that GEMA institute sustainable recycling practices and utilization of biogas production technologies and prioritize sanitation and waste management education for the public, obligate home segregation of waste materials, involve workers by providing them with protective clothing, incorporate informal waste collectors and scavengers into the new system and collaborate with research institutions in waste-to-resource projects to ensure a more sustainable waste management system in the municipality.

This was undertaken {{in the context of}} continuous child health promotion activities conducted by government and non-government organizations throughout Kenya. It was the aim of such activities to increase the prevalence of health promoting childcare practices; to what extent have there been changes in optimal childcare practices in Kenya during the 11 -year period under study? Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2003, 2008 – 9 and 2014. Women 15 – 49 years old with children 0 – 59 months were interviewed about a range of childcare practices. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine changes in, and correlates of, optimal childcare practices using the 2003, 2008 – 9 and 2014 data. Samples of 5949, 6079 and 20964 women interviewed in 2003, 2008 – 9 and 2014 respectively were used in the analysis. Results: Between 2003 and 2014, there were increases in all health facility-based childcare practices with major increases observed in seeking medical treatment for diarrhoea and complete child vaccination. Mixed results were observed in home-based care where increases were noted in the use of insecticide treated bed nets, sanitary stool <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of oral rehydration solutions, while decreases were observed in the prevalence of urging more fluid/food during diarrhoea and consumption of a minimum acceptable diet. Logit models showed that area of residence (region), household wealth, maternal education, parity, mother&# 39;s age, child’s age and pregnancy history were significant determinants of optimal childcare practices across the three surveys. Conclusions: The study observed variation in the uptake of the recommended optimal childcare practices in Kenya. National, regional and local child health promotion activities, coupled with changes in society and in living conditions between 2003 and 2014, could have influenced uptake of certain recommended childcare practices in Kenya.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{consideration}} {{of this paper}} are the transformations of underdeveloped societies caused by the economical development, that {{is the process of}} modernization whose the most significant precondition is industrialization. In the first part (I) the author in an analytical way reviews the concepts:»underdeveloped society« and »developed society«. According to the author there is no human society that could be characterized as a stationary and concludes that, there are no sufficiently developed regions that could be confronted to the underdeveloped ones, because in no country technical and other potentials are never sufficiently developed neither they are at the <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> to all social strata evenly. The author thinks that the difference between traditional and industrial society is almost the same as the difference between the developed and the underdeveloped regions within the developed industrial system. Then the eight points of difference between developed and underdeveloped societies are given, and in this connection the author cites in the table according to the typology of Melvil Herskovitz the characteristics of the preindustrial society and the society under the process of industrialization. In the second part (I I) the author considers the basic characteristics of the so called traditional agrarian society and its modes of social transformations in the process of modernization. In that context the author points out the process of transformation of family and family relations and stresses especially the forms of transformation of extended family of South Slavs known under the name »zadruga«. Characteristics of such family are, according to the author, as follows: 1. livelihood, education and care of children are the matters of whole family-household, 2. age of marriage is early youth (20 for male and 17 for female), 3. marriage of both sexes are strictly controlled, 4. social value of woman is estimated by the number of children she has, 5. husband is more motivated for having descendents (male) than wife, 6. different position of males and females, 7. relationship between man and wife are reduced almost only to sex, and 8. authority in family belongs to males exclusively. The author then considers transformations of these characteristics in the process of modernization of society. The third part of this article (I I I) is devoted to innovations as indicators of adaptibilily of population to industrial conditions of life. Adoption of innovations is not only a matter of technical adaptation, but it requires also a new system of motivations that substantially differs from the one in the traditional society, and individual transformation of people as well. The author then discusses the three fields in which innovations are being realized: a) productive activities, b) management and c) consumption...|$|E

40|$|Glass frits {{with a high}} B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } {{concentration}} {{have been}} designed which, when combined with high-alumina concentration nuclear waste streams, will form glasses with durabilities that are acceptable for repository <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> predictable <b>using</b> a free energy of hydration model. Two glasses with nepheline discriminator values closest to 0. 62 showed significant differences in normalized boron release between the quenched and heat treated versions of each glass. X-ray diffraction confirmed that nepheline crystallized in the glass with the lowest nepheline discriminator value, and nepheline may also exist in the second glass as small nanocrystals. The high-B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } frit was successful in producing simulated waste glasses with no detectable nepheline crystallization at waste loadings of up to 45 wt%. The melt rate of this frit was also considerably better than other frits with increased concentrations of Na{sub 2 }O...|$|R
50|$|Spill {{containment}} {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} a more eco-friendly solution than using absorbent spill kits that have very small capacity, require <b>disposal</b> after <b>use</b> <b>and</b> do not permit re-cycling of the spilled agent. Chemical handling and oil transfer companies in the UK are now deploying spill containment bladders and valves that can be retro-fitted to existing drainage systems in just a few hours.|$|R
