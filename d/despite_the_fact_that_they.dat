5|$|One of the {{conditions}} of the NHL's participation in the Olympics is to include regular NHL referees and linesmen in the tournament, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are American or Canadian, and thus gives the perception of American or Canadian bias in the officiating.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{his friend}} Lao She {{introduced}} him to the famous pingju opera performer Xin Fengxia, who had acted in one of Wu's plays and admired his talent. They married that year, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy.|$|E

50|$|It {{is noted}} {{that there are a}} number of errors in the making of <b>the</b> film. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> New Orleans is {{actually}} below sea level, the movie shows sinkholes in a cavern extending more than 60 ft underground, and bone dry, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> virtually any digging underground in the real New Orleans would result in flooded ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem is}} whether to {{quantify}} the whole ring as a single species (<b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> not all individuals can interbreed) or to classify each population as a distinct species (<b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it can interbreed with its near neighbours). Ring species illustrate that the species concept is not as clear-cut as it is often thought to be.|$|R
5|$|Wild trout {{naturally}} reproduce in Hammersley Fork {{from its}} headwaters downstream to its mouth. Great blue herons {{have been observed}} at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are more commonly found in large river valleys. Little yellow stoneflies also inhabit it. Brown trout {{first appeared in the}} stream in the 1920s after being stocked in Cross Fork and in the 1940s the brown trout populations significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued orders to the German 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge at Gyékényes by coup de main.

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Lao She {{introduced}} Xin Fengxia to {{the famous}} playwright Wu Zuguang. Like many intellectuals at the time, Wu held high hopes for the new People's Republic and returned to China from British Hong Kong. Xin, who had acted in one of Wu's plays, admired his talent. They married that year, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied painting with Qi Baishi, {{one of the most}} celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|Brummer {{was ready}} for service with the fleet by May 1916, though she did not steam {{with the rest of}} the High Seas Fleet for the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been built as minelaying cruisers, Brummer and Bremse were never used in this capacity. In the autumn of 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the chief of the Admiralstab, decided to {{supplement}} the U-boat campaign with surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia. In addition to damaging British shipping, Scheer sought to divert escorts from the Atlantic theater, where his U-boats were concentrated. Brummer, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Leonhardi, and Bremse, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Westerkamp, were selected for the first such operation. Their high speed and large radius of action, coupled with their resemblance to British light cruisers, made them suited to the task. In preparation for the raid, their crews painted the ships dark gray to further camouflage them as British vessels.|$|E

5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued orders to the 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge northeast of Koprivnica by coup de main. As a result, limited objective attacks were launched {{along the line of}} the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and troops on the march, and by the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava, including at Barcs. The local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent among the Croat troops of the 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{never actually}} had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in the tub and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E

25|$|ERISA Section 514 preempts {{all state}} laws {{that relate to}} any {{employee}} benefit plan, with certain, enumerated exceptions. The most important exceptions — i.e. state laws that survive <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may relate to an employee benefit plan — are state insurance, banking, or securities laws, generally applicable criminal laws, and domestic relations orders that meet ERISA's qualification requirements.|$|E
