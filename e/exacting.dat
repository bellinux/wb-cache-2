40|$|Association rule mining {{has made}} many {{achievements}} {{in the area}} of knowledge discovery. However, the quality of the extracted association rules is a big concern. One problem with the quality of the extracted association rules is the huge size of the extracted rule set. As a matter of fact, very often tens of thousands of association rules are extracted among which many are redundant thus useless. Mining non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solve this problem. The Min-max <b>exact</b> basis proposed by Pasquier et al [Pasquier 05] has showed exciting results by generating only non-redundant rules. In this paper, we first propose a relaxing definition for redundancy under which the Min-max <b>exact</b> basis still contains redundant rules; then we propose a condensed representation called Reliable <b>exact</b> basis for <b>exact</b> association rules. The rules in the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis are not only non-redundant but also more succinct than the rules in Min-max <b>exact</b> basis. We prove that the redundancy eliminated by the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis does not reduce the belief to the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis. The size of the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis is much smaller than that of the Min-max <b>exact</b> basis. Moreover, the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis is a lossless representation of <b>exact</b> association rules since we prove that all <b>exact</b> association rules can be deduced from the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis. Experimental results show that the Reliable <b>exact</b> basis significantly reduces the number of the extracted rules...|$|R
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the <b>exacting</b> purity requirement could be met.|$|E
