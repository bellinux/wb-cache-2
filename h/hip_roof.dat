25|$|The Bruce Round Barn is {{the last}} known round barn {{constructed}} by the team of Shaffer and the Haas Brothers. The design of the Bruce Barn {{is important in the}} evolution of general round barn design. The single <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> construction, complete with a series of internal rafter braces for extra support are the result of the inability of some carpenters to complete the self-supporting roofs that round barns typically utilized. The Haas Brothers and Shaffer came up with two novel solutions to this problem. The first was to construct a conical roof, the second, which is exemplified in the Bruce Round Barn, was to construct a single <b>hip</b> <b>roof.</b> The University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station heavily influenced the roof style.|$|E

25|$|The single <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> design {{represents}} {{the evolution of}} round barn construction in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin.

Two of the three round barns designed at the University of Illinois experiment station feature the central silo.|$|E

This is due to its masonry walls, {{specially}} braced <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> and metal framed windows and doors.|$|E
