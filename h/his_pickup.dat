5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with <b>his</b> <b>pickup</b> truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E
5|$|Coffee shop {{employees}} {{who witnessed the}} shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter {{from a series of}} photos. Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest. Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him. A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled. Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be holed up inside. After several attempts to coax or force him out of the house, including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside. Later that day, police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and <b>his</b> <b>pickup</b> truck, which had blood stains inside.|$|E
5|$|When {{the budget}} was {{projected}} at $100 million (Warner Bros. wanted it {{for no more}} than $75 million), producer Larry J. Franco commissioned a test reel from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the visual effects company he worked with on Jumanji. Burton was persuaded to change his mind to employ computer animation, which brought the final production budget to $80 million. Although Purves was uncredited for his work, stop-motion supervisors Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders, who would later collaborate with Burton on Corpse Bride, received character design credit. Warner Digital Studios was responsible for the scenes of global destruction, airborne flying saucer sequences, the Martian landing in Nevada, and the robot that chases Richie Norris in <b>his</b> <b>pickup</b> truck. Warner Digital also used practical effects, such as building scale models of Big Ben and other landmarks. The destruction of Art Land's hotel was footage of the real-life night-time demolition of The Landmark Hotel and Casino, a building Burton wished to immortalize.|$|E

On the ice, however, the 'Canes were now out of the doldrums; led by the return of longtime Whalers captain Ron Francis, Keith Primeau's 30 goals and Gary Roberts' 178 penalty minutes, they tallied their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1992. They also won the new Southeast Division by eight points, only their second division title as an NHL team (following the 1987 Adams Division title as the Whalers).

After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of <b>his</b> <b>pickup.</b> Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help.

500|$|In 1985, Kulwicki sold {{most of his}} belongings, {{including}} his short track racing equipment, to move approximately [...] to the Charlotte area in North Carolina. He kept only a few things; <b>his</b> <b>pickup</b> truck was loaded to tow a trailer full of furniture and tools. An electrical fire twodays before he left destroyed his truck, so Kulwicki had to borrow one to pull the trailer. After arriving in the Charlotte area, he showed up unannounced at Terry's shop ready to race. Veteran NASCAR drivers were initially amused by Kulwicki's arrival on the national tour: He was a driver from the northern United States when the series was primarily a southern regional series, he had a mechanical engineering degree when few other drivers had completed college, and, with only sixstarts, had limited driving experience in the junior Busch Series. Kulwicki was described as very studious, hard working, no-nonsense, and something of a loner. He frequently walked the garage area in his racing uniform carrying a briefcase. Kulwicki made his first career Winston Cup start at Richmond on September 8, 1985, for Bill Terry's No. 32 Hardee's Ford team. That season he competed in fiveraces for Terry, with his highest finish being 13th.|$|E

500|$|In October 1967, {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album [...] began at Olympic Studios in London. [...] On October 25, after recording the strongly R [...] "Wait Until Tomorrow", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of [...] "Little Wing". [...] It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. [...] Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, [...] "Chas knew right away what was needed. [...] He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again". [...] After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. [...] For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. [...] For his rhythm guitar, he had set <b>his</b> <b>pickup</b> selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a [...] "hollow" [...] tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as [...] "out-of-phase". [...] However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized {{the use of the}} Univibe phase shifter effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). [...] Next, Hendrix added a straight ("dry, without any effects") glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. [...] According to Kramer, [...] "Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio" [...] and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. [...] Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. [...] These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.|$|E

He studied the work of other artists -primarily Claire Leighton, Rockwell Kent and Thomas Nason {{and to a lesser extent}} Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood.

25|$|Nearly {{seven years}} after he first {{requested}} it, Garcia received his second custom guitar (Tiger) from Irwin {{in the summer of}} 1979. The first concert that Garcia played Tiger was August 4, 1979 at the Oakland Auditorium Arena. Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover. The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was cocobolo, with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and flame maple, in that order. The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil DiMarzio SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing <b>his</b> <b>pickups</b> every year or two. The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate {{in the back of the}} guitar. In terms of weight, everything included made Tiger tip the scales at 13½ pounds. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.|$|R
