500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when I got out of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of a relationship. The client claims she also <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the rowdiness of the fans, and {{the fact}} that many {{families}} began sitting in the more affordable bleachers, alcoholic beverages were banned from the bleachers in 2000. Yankees Program Vendor Ted Banks commented that [...] "There wasn't any special reason for that, it <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of hand. Those people used to get wild when Jose Canseco played for the A's. A few people threw things at Ken Griffey Jr." ...|$|E

2500|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{occurs when}} the abuser believes that abuse is acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. [...] It may produce intergenerational cycles of abuse in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Very few people recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family disputes that <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of control. Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence differs widely from country to country. Domestic violence often happens {{in the context of}} forced or child marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Building 20's origins as a {{temporary}} structure, researchers and other occupants felt free to modify their environment at will. [...] As described by MIT professor Paul Penfield, [...] "Its 'temporary nature' permitted its occupants to abuse it {{in ways that would}} not be tolerated in a permanent building. If you wanted to run a wire from one lab to another, you didn't ask anybody's permission [...] you <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> a screwdriver and poked a hole through the wall". Many building occupants were unaware of the presence of asbestos.|$|E

5000|$|Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave a {{negative}} review, and {{compared it to}} Taylor Swift's [...] "You Belong with Me". [...] "I didn’t sit in when this was made or anything, {{but it sounds like}} it passed through so many levels of self-consciousness that most of the personality <b>just</b> <b>got</b> rubbed <b>out</b> of the mix at some point, leaving behind a flimsy song and a recycled production." ...|$|R

2500|$|George {{did some}} work {{on what would}} {{eventually}} become Down on the Farm but then [...] declared that Little Feat had disbanded. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book Written in My Soul) conducted eleven days before his death, George {{made it clear that}} he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne's attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped [...] "into one of his 'Day at the Dog Races'. I <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of there as fast as I could. It was embarrassing". In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barrère.|$|E

50|$|Following the albums release, {{the band}} were dropped by Columbia Records. In 2006 guitarist Larry Hibbitt stated that:there {{were a lot}} of things that were wrong with album. A lot of it was to do with the fact that we had {{absolutely}} no working relationship with the label by the time it came out. There was loads of pressure to get Shatterproof out and get the ball rolling again. They just wanted a record - any record. It <b>just</b> <b>got</b> put <b>out</b> and forgotten about. It still sold 65,000 but nobody quite seems to realise that.|$|R
60|$|It was nobody's fault--certainly not mine. It {{was just}} Fate.

The kid set up his usual yell at the sight of her, and she stopped at the foot of the steps.|$|R

I threw my eye over him as he advanced with a peculiar rolling gait, and formed certain conclusions. A drunkard who has once been a gentleman, I reflected to myself, for there was something peculiarly dissolute in his appearance, also one who has {{had to do with}} the sea, a diagnosis which proved very accurate.|$|R

60|$|The {{specialist}} came. He was a tall, untidily-dressed man, {{with his}} hair wild and straggling, {{as if he had}} <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of bed.

30|$|Students {{attending}} {{five days}} per week in a training provider improved their overall attitudes towards the provider considerably – with high scores towards peers and staff – yet their attitudes towards school deteriorated. School profiles show little or no attitudinal improvement and students illustrate a growing aversion to the school system. As Henry stated, `John [provider tutor] listens to you; he’s brilliant. I never had that at school. I <b>just</b> <b>got</b> sent <b>out</b> all the time. There’s no way I’d go back. I didn’t realise {{how bad it was}} until I got out.’ This impression can also be found in the attitude to teachers/tutors, with an overall score of 54 negative points recorded at school (– 1 and below) compared to 28 at the WBL provider (see Tables 3 and 4).|$|R

60|$|It {{wanted a}} quarter to eight when they reached Cadogan Place.

50|$|Hamilton {{saw that}} an {{appointing}} power of an executive {{was a very}} huge decision {{not only for the}} Senate but for the entirety of the United States. Hamilton saw that without this article the United States could fall back into what they had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> themselves <b>out</b> of, a tyranny. A President with absolute appointing power would send them back to a feel of when the King of England had control over the United States. However, having it vice versa with the President not having less appointing power than the Senate, would cause more arguments than needed to run a smooth operating government. Hamilton's conclusion was based on his two ideas. The President with his judgement can appoint a qualified person to the Senate and {{it is up to the}} Senate to see if they are the right vote or not.|$|R
