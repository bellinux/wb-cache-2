The symposium was part of a series of events that will result in a formal publication, listing all described taxa, both living and extinct, along with an estimation of the remaining undescribed species of each group. The impetus for the symposium was a growing concern about the present incomplete knowledge of our biota, and an acceptance of New Zealand&# 039;s international obligations under both the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity and the 1996 <b>Global</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> <b>Initiative.</b> Estimates suggest that there are approximately 80, 000 eukaryote species in New Zealand&# 039;s marine, freshwater, and land environments, of which about 40 % are known.

40|$|To fulfil {{commitments}} to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), {{countries of the}} Asian region must understand that taxonomic expertise is vital for effective implementation. The <b>Global</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> <b>Initiative</b> (GTI) therefore states 'understanding taxonomy to be a priority in implementing CBD'. Fungi, in particular, are a group of organisms where {{countries in the region}} lack taxonomists to carry out the requirements of CBD. Previously, several Asian countries had groups of taxonomists active in the study of fungi, but in recent years the number of mycologists has dwindled because of other commitments, retirement without replacement and more importance being placed on other disciplines, such as biotechnology. This paper will briefly review the history of the study of fungi in the Asian region and then examine the current situation through an analysis of publications in international journals. It will address the effects of CBD on mycological taxonomic research in the region. It will then look at the future for taxonomic mycology in Asia?

40|$|Given {{the ongoing}} and often {{destructive}} impact of humans {{on the natural}} environment, the need for sound and robust taxonomies has become critically important (see for example Godfray & Knapp, 2004). The difficulty with naming organisms is especially acute in African countries, where resources and facilities for taxonomic research are limited (Klopper & al., 2002), and biodiversity is usually relatively high. South Africa, for example, incorporates the world’s richest temperate flora with 19, 581 indigenous plant species from 2267 genera and 349 families of vascular plants (Germishuizen & al., 2006; Steenkamp & Smith, 2006). Approximately 65 % of the country’s vascular plant species are endemic (Raimondo & al., 2009), with many occurring in its three regions and 15 centres of plant endemism (Van Wyk & Smith, 2001). Expertise as well as preserved and living material of the biodiversity of developing nations—typically former colonies of imperialist nations—are often located in developed countries and not available {{in the country of}} origin (Figueiredo & Smith, 2010). The CBD recognises this impediment and in Article 17 calls on signatory parties to exchange and repatriate information to facilitate research (<b>Global</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> <b>Initiative,</b> 2001). To overcome the obstacle of having to physically ship valuable—and essentially irreplaceable—pressed plant specimens between herbaria around the world, the African Plants Initiative (API) was conceived. The notion was to scan type specimens and make electronic images of them available online. This approach efficiently enables both virtual repatriation of information, and access by researchers of other herbaria to the most important accessioned material, thus removing some of the constraints to taxonomic work. It has been six years since the inception of the API, and this paper reports on its achievements in South Africa, one of the founding countries of the thrust...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reach the goals of DIVERSITAS in West Pacific and Asia - International Biodiversity Observation Year (DIWPA-IBOY), it is {{necessary}} to build capacity in the region by the participating institutions. A series of Parataxonomist Training Courses on the key major orders of insects have been organized during the years 2004 - 2006. A total of 49 participants from 27 Institutions in Indonesia have been trained. These courses have been hosted by Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense and Research Center for Biology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (RC Biology-LIPI), and financial and technical support came through several Japanese Center of Excellence programs supporting the DIWPA-IBOY activities. These courses emphasize field biology through a range of activities, from basic lectures and practical exercises or field works, required for independent research in the highly diverse natural environments of the region. During these trainings, focus was on insect specimens collected by entomological staffs of Bogor Zoological Museum during IBOY sampling activities at Gunung Halimun National Park (a core site) in 2002 - 2003. The insect collection section at the Bogor Zoological Museum benefitted significantly from the processing of these specimens by the course participants during the courses. Thus the courses contribute not only from the point of capacity building, but also in term of collections and identification of the Indonesian insect diversity. Such parataxonomist training courses now need to be extended both into different group of organisms and into different regions throughout the country.

40|$|Pain in {{sickle cell}} disease (SCD) is {{associated}} with increased morbidity, mortality, and high health care costs. Although episodic acute pain {{is the hallmark of}} this disorder, there is an increasing awareness that chronic pain is part of the pain experience of many older adolescents and adults. A common set of criteria for classifying chronic pain associated with SCD would enhance SCD pain research efforts in epidemiology, pain mechanisms, and clinical trials of pain management interventions, and ultimately improve clinical assessment and management. As part of the collaborative effort between the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks public-private partnership with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and the American Pain Society, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society Pain <b>Taxonomy</b> <b>initiative</b> developed the outline of an optimal diagnostic system for chronic pain conditions. Subsequently, a working group of experts in SCD pain was convened to generate core diagnostic criteria for chronic pain associated with SCD.

Uncinorhynchus vorago sp. nov., (Gnathorhynchidae) has a triangular stylet consisting of a double-folded plate, which proximally forms a tube, but without a distal, needle-shaped tip. Austrorhynchus artoisi sp. nov. (Polycystididae), has two prostate stylets. Prostate stylet type II consists of a distal tube and a short proximal funnel, which has a stirrup-shaped ornament, whereas the stylet type III shows an unpronounced foot and style connected to each other by a narrow clasp and a comb-bearing plate. The foot and plate are connected to a thread-like flagellum. Lenopharynx bathos sp. nov.

We assess phylogenetic patterns using ~ 16 K base pairs of the complete mitogenome for 154 fin whales from the North Pacific, North Atlantic [...] including the Mediterranean Sea [...] and Southern Hemisphere. A Bayesian tree of the resulting 136 haplotypes revealed several well-supported clades representing each ocean basin, with no haplotypes shared among ocean basins. The North Atlantic haplotypes (n = 12) form a sister clade to those from the Southern Hemisphere (n = 42). The estimated time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for this Atlantic/Southern Hemisphere clade and 81 of the 97 samples from the North Pacific was approximately 2 Ma. 14 of the remaining North Pacific samples formed a well-supported clade within the Southern Hemisphere. The TMRCA for this node suggests that at least one female from the Southern Hemisphere immigrated to the North Pacific approximately 0. 37 Ma.

The Nearctic Euura megacephala is removed from synonymy with the Holarctic E. destricta and treated as a valid species. 34 species names are newly combined with Euura.

40|$|Background: Effective {{communication}} {{is a critical}} component in ensuring that children are fully vaccinated. Although numerous communication interventions have been proposed and implemented {{in various parts of}} Nigeria, the range of communication strategies used has not yet been mapped systematically. This study forms part of the ‘Communicate to vaccinate’ (COMMVAC) project, an initiative aimed at building research evidence for improving communication with parents and communities about childhood vaccinations in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: This study aims to: 1) identify the communication strategies used in two states in Nigeria; 2) map these strategies against the existing COMMVAC <b>taxonomy,</b> a <b>global</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of vaccination communication interventions; 3) create a specific Nigerian country map of interventions organised by purpose and target; and 4) analyse gaps between the COMMVAC taxonomy and the Nigerian map. Design: We conducted the study in two Nigerian states: Bauchi State in Northern Nigeria and Cross River State in Southern Nigeria. We identified vaccination communication interventions through interviews carried out among purposively selected stakeholders in the health services and relevant agencies involved in vaccination information delivery; through observations and through relevant documents. We used the COMMVAC taxonomy to organise the interventions we identified based on the intended purpose of the communication and the group to which the intervention was targeted. Results: The Nigerian map revealed that most of the communication strategies identified aimed to inform and educate and remind or recall. Few aimed to teach skills, enhance community ownership, and enable communication. We did not identify any intervention that aimed to provide support or facilitate decision-making. Many interventions had more than one purpose. The main targets for most interventions were caregivers and community members, with few interventions directed at health workers. Most interventions identified were used in the context of campaigns rather than routine immunisation programmes. Conclusions: The identification and development of the Nigerian vaccination communication interventions map could assist programme managers to identify gaps in vaccination communication. The map may be a useful tool as part of efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination coverage in Nigeria and similar settings...|$|R
