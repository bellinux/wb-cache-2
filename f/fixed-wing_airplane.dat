5000|$|Tanakadate {{was also}} an early proponent of {{military}} aviation. In the Russo-Japanese War, he was an advisor to the Imperial Japanese army {{on the use of}} hot air balloons for military reconnaissance purposes. This led to the establishment of an aviation laboratory at Tokyo Imperial University. At a 1907 conference in Paris on the metric system, Tanakadate saw a model of early <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>airplane,</b> and extended his stay in Paris to study further.In his Japanese laboratory he built a wind tunnel. Tanakadate published dozens of articles on aeronautics and aviation from 1910 to 1916 in both Japanese and in French.

5000|$|The {{designer}} of ZHYZ UAV Tornado Leopard (Xuan-Feng Bao, 旋风豹) {{is the high}} school senior Mr. Liang Ming-Xuan (梁明轩), whose father was a team member of Chinese national team of model airplanes, and after his retirement of national team, he became a coach for Zhuhai team. Mr. Liang Ming-Xuan was heavily influenced by his father and had {{a keen interest in}} model airplane design and competition. The idea of this ZHYZ experimental UAV is rooted in the Mr. Liang Min-Xuan’s attempt to combine the advantage of helicopter and <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>airplane.</b> [...] In October 2012, the design was submitted to the Innovation Cup All China UAV Design Competition and subsequently won first place. The VTOL UAV is produced by the school-owned factory, but the initial production was met with failure: Due to the high speed of the UAV in level flight, the precision requirement is high, so it was decided to utilize laser cutting processing. However, when the ordinary material commonly used by model airplanes was cut by laser, it disintegrated. As a result, a much more expensive high density foam material had to be used to solve the problem. Propulsion was another issue in that not only the school owned factory could not produce it, there was not any available on the market either, so it had to be custom built. The resulting VTOL UAV Tornado Leopard cost more than ¥ 20000, much more expensive than model airplanes. Tornado Leopard is a tail-sitter with winglets. Payload is mounted in the nose of the fuselage and propulsion is provided by a ducted fan mounted at the rearend of the empennage, and the ducted fan is actually a pair of coaxial rotors. The VTOL UAV takes-off and lands like a coaxial helicopter, and once airborne, Tornado Leopard would transition itself to level flight, where the coaxial rotors would act as contra-rotating propellers to provide thrust as a pusher engine. The complete name of Tornado Leopard VTOL UAV is Tornado Leopard Coaxial Rotors UAV (Xuan-Feng Bao Gong-Zhou Shuang-Jiang Wu-Ren-Ji, 旋风豹共轴双桨无人机) ...|$|E

By enabling a fixed-wing UAV to achieve these feats, the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft in level flight are complimented by hover capabilities that were typically limited to rotorcraft. Flight and perch landing results are presented. This capability significantly eases support and maintenance of the vehicle.

30|$|Transfer {{requests}} are {{initiated by}} the referring hospitals or by the patients’ families. A medical report is sent from the referring hospital detailing the medical condition and justification for the transfer. The report is then reviewed by an administrative committee to determine the eligibility of the patient for hospital admission. The concerned services and the ICU team assess eligible patients using the data in the medical report and by phone conversation with the referring physician if required, for potential benefit from the transfer and the stability for the transfer. Once the patient is accepted, the transfer process is initiated. Patients are transferred only if the clinical condition is deemed stable enough as judged by the respiratory, cardiovascular, and other clinical parameters. Transfers occur by fixed-wing airplanes, helicopters, or by ground ambulances depending on {{the distance from the}} referring hospitals.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} generating motion plans for a robot that are guaranteed to succeed despite uncertainty in the environment, parametric model uncertainty, and disturbances. Furthermore, we consider scenarios where these plans must be generated in real-time, because constraints such as obstacles in the environment may not be known until they are perceived (with a noisy sensor) at runtime. Our approach is to pre-compute a library of "funnels" along dierent maneuvers {{of the system that}} the state is guaranteed to remain within (despite bounded disturbances) when the feedback controller corresponding to the maneuver is executed. The resulting funnel library is then used to sequentially compose motion plans at runtime while ensuring the safety of the robot. A major advantage of the work presented here is that by explicitly taking into account the eect of uncertainty, the robot can evaluate motion plans based on how vulnerable they are to disturbances. We demonstrate and validate our method using extensive hardware experiments on a small <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>airplane</b> avoiding obstacles at high speed (~ 12 mph), along with thorough simulation experiments of ground vehicle and quadrotor models navigating through cluttered environments. To our knowledge, the resulting hardware demonstrations on a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>airplane</b> constitute one of the first examples of provably safe and robust control for robotic systems with complex nonlinear dynamics that need to plan in realtime in environments with complex geometric constraints. The key computational engine we leverage is sums-of-squares (SOS) programming. While SOS programming allows us to apply our approach to systems of relatively high dimensionality (up to approximately 10 - 15 dimensional state spaces), scaling our approach to higher dimensional systems such as humanoid robots requires a dierent set of computational tools. In this thesis, we demonstrate how DSOS and SDSOS programming, which are recently introduced alternatives to SOS programming, can be employed to achieve this improved scalability and handle control systems with as many as 30 - 50 state dimensions. by Anirudha Majumdar.

After the war he decided to focus his efforts and creating a safer plane so that more people would feel comfortable flying. In 1930 he formed the Vertoplane Development Corporation of New York.

40|$|This chapter {{contains}} {{information on}} dealing with non-normal and emergency situations that may occur in flight. The key to successful management of an emergency situation, and/or preventing a non-normal situation from progressing into a true emergency, is a thorough familiarity with, and adherence to, the procedures developed by the airplane manufacturer and contained in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s Operating Handbook (AFM/POH). The following guidelines are generic and {{are not meant to}} replace the airplane manufacturer’s recommended procedures.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{the development of}} the transitioning vehicle Cyclone, which has been specifically designed for meteorological and agricultural applications. The mission requirements demand take-off and landing from a small area and the ability to cope with high wind speeds. In contrast with recent suggestions, our proposed design aims to be closer to a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>airplane</b> rather than a rotary wing. In particular, the design focuses on a tilt-body style transitioning vehicle with blown-wing concept. The propeller wing interaction is calculated using a semi-empirical method. The total wing span and wing surface area are decided according to the mission performance requirements. For the control of the vehicle, incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion is used. This control method does not need the modeling of external forces or moments and is able to counteract the strong aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the vehicle through the feedback of its angular acceleration. Together with the design phases and manufacturing process, several test flights are presented. Particular diffculties of the proposed design are discussed, including lack of providing suffcient pitch-up moment and control reversal during descent. The test flights demonstrate the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of the vehicle, as well as its transitioning into forward flight from hovering, and vice versa, for an effcient missionperformance...|$|E
