2500|$|John Daniel Scott, among others, {{have cited}} that “people who sing {{are more likely}} to be happy.” This is because “singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are {{associated}} with pleasure and well being.” Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his This is Your Brain on Music, argues that “music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication” and that “singing[...] [...] might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal [...] [...] [...] speech” (260).

60|$|The other notable element was this: {{that when}} the produce of the land began by custom to be cut up and only {{partially}} transmitted to the lord, the remainder was generally subdivided into two types of property. One the serfs enjoyed severally, in private patches, while the other they enjoyed in common, and generally {{in common with the}} lord. Thus arose the momentously important mediæval institutions of the Common Land, owned side by side with private land. It was an alternative and a refuge. The mediævals, except when they were monks, were none of them Communists; but they were all, as it were, potential Communists. It is typical of the dark and dehumanized picture now drawn of the period that our romances constantly describe a broken man as falling back on the forests and the outlaw's den, but never describe him as falling back on the common land, which was a much more common incident. Mediævalism believed in mending its broken men; and as the idea existed in the communal life for monks, it existed in the communal land for peasants. It was their great green hospital, their free and airy workhouse. A Common was not a naked and negative thing like the scrub or heath we call a Common on the edges of the suburbs. It was a reserve of wealth like a reserve of grain in a barn; it was deliberately kept back as a balance, as we talk of a balance at the bank. Now these provisions for a healthier distribution of property would by themselves show any man of imagination that a real moral effort had been made towards social justice; that it could not have been mere <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accident</b> that slowly turned the slave into a serf, and the serf into a peasant proprietor. But if anybody still thinks that mere blind luck, without any groping for the light, had somehow brought about the peasant condition in place of the agrarian slave estate, he has only to turn to what was happening in all the other callings and affairs of humanity. Then he will cease to doubt. For he will find the same mediæval men busy upon a social scheme which points as plainly in effect to pity and a craving for equality. And it is a system which could no more be produced by accident than one of their cathedrals could be built by an earthquake.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} yeast {{sex chromosome}} evolution by comparing genome sequences from 16 {{species in the}} family Saccharomycetaceae, including data from genera Tetrapisispora, Kazachstania, Naumovozyma, and Torulaspora. We show that although most yeast species contain a mating-type (MAT) locus and silent HML and HMR loci structurally analogous to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, their detailed organization is highly variable and indicates that the MAT locus is a deletion hotspot. Over evolutionary time, chromosomal genes located immediately beside MAT have continually been deleted, truncated, or transposed to {{other places in the}} genome in a process that is gradually shortening the distance between MAT and HML. Each time a gene beside MAT is removed by deletion or transposition, the next gene on the chromosome is brought into proximity with MAT and is in turn put at risk for removal. This process has also continually replaced the triplicated sequence regions, called Z and X, that allow HML and HMR to be used as templates for DNA repair at MAT during mating-type switching. We propose that the deletion and transposition events are caused by <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accidents</b> during mating-type switching, combined with natural selection to keep MAT and HML on the same chromosome. The rate of deletion accelerated greatly after whole-genome duplication, probably because genes were redundant and could be deleted without requiring transposition. We suggest that, despite its mutational cost, switching confers an evolutionary benefit by providing a way for an isolated germinating spore to reform spores if the environment is too poor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA molecules, {{through their}} dual {{appearance}} as sequence and structure, represent a suitable model to study evolutionary properties of quasispecies. The essential ingredient {{in this model}} is the differentiation between genotype (molecular sequences which are affected by mutation) and phenotype (molecular structure, affected by selection). This framework allows a quantitative analysis of organizational properties of quasispecies as they adapt to different environments, such as their robustness, {{the effect of the}} degeneration of the sequence space, or the adaptation under different mutation rates and the error threshold associated. Results We describe and analyze the structural properties of molecular quasispecies adapting to different environments both during the transient time before adaptation takes place and in the asymptotic state, once optimization has occurred. We observe a minimum in the adaptation time at values of the mutation rate relatively far from the phenotypic error threshold. Through the definition of a consensus structure, it is shown that the quasispecies retains relevant structural information in a distributed fashion even above the error threshold. This structural robustness depends on the precise shape of the secondary structure used as target of selection. Experimental results available for natural RNA populations are in qualitative agreement with our observations. Conclusion Adaptation time of molecular quasispecies to a given environment is optimized at values of the mutation rate well below the phenotypic error threshold.

40|$|SummaryHIV latency is {{the chief}} {{obstacle}} to eradicating HIV but is widely believed to be an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accident</b> providing no lentiviral fitness advantage. However, findings of latency being “hardwired” into HIV’s gene-regulatory circuitry appear inconsistent with latency being an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accident,</b> given HIV’s rapid mutation rate. Here, we propose that latency is an evolutionary “bet-hedging” strategy whose frequency has been optimized to maximize lentiviral transmission by reducing viral extinction during mucosal infections. The model quantitatively fits the available patient data, matches observations of high-frequency latency establishment in cell culture and primates, and generates two counterintuitive but testable predictions. The first prediction is that conventional CD 8 -depletion experiments in SIV-infected macaques increase latent cells more than viremia. The second prediction is that strains engineered to have higher replicative fitness—via reduced latency—will exhibit lower infectivity in animal-model mucosal inoculations. Therapeutically, the theory predicts treatment approaches that may substantially enhance “activate-and-kill” HIV-cure strategies...|$|E
40|$|Researchers in the Astrobiology Technology Branch at Ames Research Center {{have begun}} {{investigating}} alternate concepts {{for the detection}} of extraterrestrial life. We suggest searching for extraterrestrial ecology, exoecology, as well as for extraterrestrial biology, exobiology. Ecology describes the interactions of living things with their environment. All ecosystems are highly constrained by their environment and are constrained by well-known system design principles. Ecology could exist wherever there is an energy source and living I things have discovered some means to capture, store, and use the available energy. Terrestrial ecosystems use as energy sources, light, organic molecules, and in thermal vents and elsewhere, simple inorganic molecules. Ecosystem behavior is controlled by matter and energy conservation laws and can be described by linear and nonlinear dynamic systems theory. Typically in an ecosystem different molecules are not in chemical equilibrium and scarce material is conserved, stored, or recycled. Temporal cycles and spatial variations are often observed. These and other -eneral principles of exoecology can help guide the search for extraterrestrial life. The chemical structure observed in terrestrial biology may be highly contingent on <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accidents.</b> Oxygen was not always abundant on Earth. Primitive sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide and sulfur to perform photosynthesis instead of water and oxygen. Astrobiologists have assumed, for the sake of narrowing and focusing our life detection strategies, that extraterrestrial life will have detailed chemical similarities with terrestrial life. Such assumptions appear very reasonable and they allow us to design specific and highly sensitive life detection experiments. But the fewer assumptions we make, the less chance we have of being entirely wrong The best strategy {{for the detection of}} extraterrestrial life could be a mixed strategy. We should use detailed assumptions based on terrestrial biology to guide some but not all future searches for alien life. The systems principles of exoecology seem much more fundamental and inescapable than the terrestrial biology analogies of exobiology. We should search for exoecology as well as exobiology...|$|R
40|$|The reverse {{tricarboxylic acid}} (rTCA) cycle has been {{explored}} from various standpoints as an idealized primordial metabolic cycle. Its simplicity and apparent ubiquity in diverse organisms across {{the tree of}} life have been used to argue for its antiquity and its optimality. In 2000 it was proposed that chemoinformatics approaches support some of these views. Specifically, defined queries of the Beilstein database showed that the molecules of the rTCA are heavily represented in such compound databases. We explore here the chemical structure space, e. g. the set of organic compounds which possesses some minimal set of defining characteristics, of the rTCA cycle's intermediates using an exhaustive structure generation method. The rTCA's chemical space as defined by the original criteria and explored by our method is some six to seven times larger than originally considered. Acknowledging that each assumption in what is a defining criterion making the rTCA cycle special limits possible generative outcomes, there are many unrealized compounds which fulfill these criteria. That these compounds are unrealized could be due to <b>evolutionary</b> frozen <b>accidents</b> or optimization, though this optimization may also be for systems-level reasons, e. g., the way the pathway and its elements interface with other aspects of metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Animal clades tend {{to follow}} a {{predictable}} path of waxing and waning during their existence, regardless of their total species richness or geographic coverage. Clades begin small and undifferentiated, then expand to a peak in diversity and range, only to shift into a rarely broken decline towards extinction. While this trajectory is now well documented and broadly recognised, the reasons underlying it remain obscure. In particular, it is unknown why clade extinction is universal and occurs with such surprising regularity. Current explanations for paleontological extinctions call on the growing costs of biological interactions, geological <b>accidents,</b> <b>evolutionary</b> traps, and mass extinctions. While these are effective causes of extinction, they mainly apply to species, not clades. Although mass extinctions is the undeniable cause for the demise of a sizeable number of major taxa, we show here that clades escaping them go extinct because of the widespread tendency of evolution to produce increasingly specialised, sympatric, and geographically restricted species over time...|$|R

Hence, biology suffers from a deadening parochialism, much like the physics of falling bodies before Newton showed that the same laws applied to the motion of apples in England and to the planets about the sun. The deparochialization of biology can only come in the same way and must therefore await the search for extraterrestrial life. It is in this sense that the significance of explorations of the planets and their satellites, asteroids, comets, and the interplanetary medium for the origin of life is assessed...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} grief {{may be a}} useful {{biological}} trait that is shaped by natural selection seems both preposterous and somewhat cold-blooded. The overwhelming pain and the inability to carry on with daily life after {{the loss of a}} loved one seem to be sufficient evidence that grief i. s useless. Also, the idea that the capacity for grief may exist because it somehow increases Darwinian fitness is deeply disturbing. Whether the grief is one's own or that of a loved one, most people do not care why it exists; they just want to know how to relieve the pain. From another vantage point, however, grief is not only normal, it is an essential aspect of our humanness. Imagine, for a moment, that scientists discovered a drug that safely prevents grief and all its pain. If grief were just an abnormality or some useless <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accident</b> or social construction, then presumably it would be sensible and humane to encourage wide use of the drug to eliminate grief. To many, such a world would seem inhuman indeed. Vast suffering would be eliminated, but at what cost ' We do no...|$|E
30|$|Because of the {{extremely}} unbalance {{distribution of the}} electrical load and the energy in China, the Chinese power grids are required to transport the large-scale electrical power from the west to east over long distances, of which the scale is expanding rapidly, the structure {{is becoming more and}} more complicated, the technology continues to improve and the operation is flexible and changeable. Meanwhile, with the intensive construction of the large-scale ultra-high or extra-high voltage HVDC, the national grid is becoming an unprecedented large-scale AC/DC hybrid connected complex power system, of which the system protection is confronted with the severe challenges. If the fault cannot be cut-off in time, there will be a complex and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accident</b> process in the AC/DC hybrid power system, and what’s worse, the HDVC will be forced to quit operation, causing the huge power shortage and severely threatening the safe and stable operation of the power grid. In order to cut-off the faults rapidly and guarantee the safe operation of the whole power grid, the protection of the AC/DC hybrid system is required to operate faster, more reliably, more accurately and more sensitively, and especially, it is of great significance to increase the operation speed of the backup protection.|$|E
50|$|Not {{only has}} life evolved, but life has evolved to evolve. That is, {{correlations}} within protein structure have evolved, and mechanisms to manipulate these correlations have evolved in tandem. The rates {{at which the}} various events within the hierarchy of evolutionary moves occur are not random or arbitrary but are selected by Darwinian evolution. Sensibly, rapid or extreme environmental change leads to selection for greater evolvability. This selection is not forbidden by causality and is strongest on the largest-scale moves within the mutational hierarchy. Many observations within evolutionary biology, heretofore considered <b>evolutionary</b> happenstance or <b>accidents,</b> are explained by selection for evolvability. For example, the vertebrate immune system shows that the variable environment of antigens has provided selective pressure {{for the use of}} adaptable codons and low-fidelity polymerases during somatic hypermutation. A similar driving force for biased codon usage as a result of productively high mutation rates is observed in the hemagglutinin protein of influenza A.|$|R
40|$|Morphology and {{biomechanics}} {{are linked}} by causal morphogenesis (‘Wolff's law’) and {{the interplay of}} mutations and selection (Darwin's ‘survival of the fittest’). Thus shape-based selective pressures can be determined. In both cases {{we need to know}} which biomechanical factors lead to skeletal adaptation, and which ones exert selective pressures on body shape. Each bone must be able to sustain the greatest regularly occurring loads. Smaller loads are unlikely to lead to adaptation of morphology. The highest loads occur primarily in posture and locomotion, simply because of the effect of body weight (or its multiple). In the skull, however, it is biting and chewing that result in the greatest loads. Body shape adapted for an arboreal lifestyle also smooths the way towards bipedality. Hindlimb dominance, length of the limbs in relation to the axial skeleton, grasping hands and feet, mass distribution (especially of the limb segments), thoracic shape, rib curvatures, and the position of the centre of gravity are the adaptations to arboreality that also pre-adapt for bipedality. Five divergent locomotor/morphological types have evolved from this base: arm-swinging in gibbons, forelimb-dominated slow climbing in orang-utans, quadrupedalism/climbing in the African apes, an unknown mix of climbing and bipedal walking in australopithecines, and the remarkably endurant bipedal walking of humans. All other apes are also facultative bipeds, but it is the biomechanical characteristics of bipedalism in orang-utans, the most arboreal great ape, which is closest to that in humans. If not <b>evolutionary</b> <b>accident,</b> what selective factor can explain why two forms adopted bipedality? Most authors tend to connect bipedal locomotion with some aspect of progressively increasing distance between trees because of climatic changes. More precise factors, in accordance with biomechanical requirements, include stone-throwing, thermoregulation or wading in shallow water. Once bipedality has been acquired, development of typical human morphology can readily be explained as adaptations for energy saving over long distances. A paper in this volume shows that load-carrying ability was enhanced from australopithecines to Homo ergaster (early African H. erectus), supporting an earlier proposition that load-carrying was an essential factor in human evolution...|$|E
