No <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men {{were more likely to}} identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women were {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.|$|E

50|$|Others {{have found}} young girls {{to be more}} {{negatively}} influenced by the evaluations of adults more generally. Some have posited that this <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> due to girls more often attributing failure to lack of ability rather than a lack of motivation or effort. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> may <b>be</b> attributable to normative socialization practices, in which people generally emphasize dependence and interpersonal relationships for girls, but achievement and independence for boys.|$|R
50|$|Privacy {{has also}} been a concern for the SnapChat app, which allows you to send {{messages}} either text or photo or video which then disappear. One study has shown that security is not a major concern for the majority of users and that that most do not use Snapchat to send sensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally). As part of their research almost no statistically significant <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{examined}} eyewitness behavior by presenting two dissimilar stimuli: a colored {{picture of a}} farmhouse kitchen and a watercolor-and-ink picture of a busy street crossing. After viewing each picture for 60 seconds, subjects answered 10 questions (5 factual and 5 leading) pertaining to each picture. Factual questions referred to information about true details in the picture, whereas leading questions referred to information about unconventional details in the picture. No significant <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in accuracy of recall or in resistance to misleading information.|$|E
50|$|A {{similar study}} {{conducted}} by the Management Research Group of 17,491 questionnaires found that out of common leadership competency areas surveyed, women were rated higher by their superiors in areas like credibility with management, future potential, insight, sensitivity, and working with diverse people. Men were ranked higher in business aptitude, financial understanding, and strategic planning, which the researchers note are seen to be critical to corporate advancement. No <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in competencies such as team performance, effective thinking, and willingness to listen and no differences were found in overall effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|A {{gender role}} is a {{theoretical}} construct {{in the social}} sciences and humanities that refers to a set of social and behavioral norms that, within a specific culture, are widely considered to be socially appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. Socially accepted gender roles differ widely between different cultures. Proponents of gender role theory assert that observed <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in behavior and personality characteristics are, at least in part, socially constructed, and therefore, the product of socialization experiences; this contrasts with other models of gender that assert that <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> "essential" to biological sex. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> exist in almost all societies. With differences in the norms adopted, this suggests that <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are,</b> at least partly, influenced by culture. ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1870s the {{government}} initiated {{a campaign to}} encourage more women to move to New Zealand. They did this by giving them the prospect of working with more pay than being at home. By 1916 and 1941 the inequality issue began to dissipate, and the <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> about equal. By 1971 the gender shift began and women began to outnumber the men. By 2001 there were 104 women to every 100 men.The female population is soon to outrank the male population by 2051, {{because of the high}} mortality rate among men aged 15-24, and the female life expectancy is expected to increase much faster than males.|$|E
50|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 13,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual.

50|$|Predator stress {{has been}} shown to improve {{classical}} conditioning in males and hinder it in females. A study done by Maeng et al. demonstrated that stress allowed faster classical conditioning of male rats while disrupting the same type of learning in female rats. These <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> shown to be caused by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When the researchers inactivated that brain region by administering muscimol to the females, no gender differences in classical conditioning were observed 24 hours later. Inactivating the mPFC in the male rats did not prevent the enhanced conditioning that the males previously exhibited. This discrepancy between genders has also been shown to be present in humans. In a 2005 study, Jackson et al. reported that stress enhanced classical conditioning in human males and impaired classical condition in human females.|$|E

50|$|A {{study of}} beliefs about miraculous healing {{among the more}} religiously {{committed}} has indicated that there are significant differences in belief about miraculous healing even among people within the same denomination (Anglican). Researchers found that positive belief in faith healing was mainly a characteristic of conservative Christians, most especially those with charismatic experience. Belief about miraculous healing {{was seen as a}} subset of belief about health and well-being in general. Older people had less belief in miraculous healing or the sovereignty of God over illness, while those with experience of higher education had more inclusive beliefs about miraculous healing and saw human input as less important in the healing process. The study further showed that people with degrees or post-graduate qualifications can and do believe in the possibility of miraculous healing.

50|$|A 2012 study {{examined}} gender-specific associations between trauma cognitions, alcohol cravings and alcohol-related consequences in individuals with dually diagnosed PTSD and alcohol dependence (AD). Participants had entered a treatment study for concurrent PTSD and AD; baseline information was {{collected from participants}} about PTSD-related cognitions in three areas: (a) Negative Cognitions About Self, (b) Negative Cognitions About the World, and (c) Self-Blame. Information was also collected on two aspects of AD: alcohol cravings and consequences of AD. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> examined while controlling for PTSD severity. The results indicate that Negative Cognitions About Self are significantly related to alcohol cravings in men but not women, and that interpersonal consequences of AD are significantly related to Self-Blame in women but not in men. These findings suggest that for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AD, psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on reducing trauma-related cognitions are likely to reduce alcohol cravings in men and relational problems in women.|$|E
50|$|Lucia O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} studied {{adolescent}} sexual functioning; they compared an adolescent sample with an adult sample and found {{no significant differences between}} them. Desire, satisfaction and sexual functioning were generally high among their sample of participants (aged 17-21). Additionally, no significant <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction.In terms of problems with sexual functioning mentioned by participants in this study, the most common problems listed for males were experiencing anxiety about performing sexually (81.4%) and premature ejaculation (74.4%). Other common problems included issues becoming erect and difficulties with ejaculation. Generally, most problems were not experienced on a chronic basis. Common problems for girls included difficulties with sexual climax (orgasm) (86.7%), not feeling sexually interested during a sexual situation (81.2%), unsatisfactory vaginal lubrication (75.8%) anxiety about performing sexually (75.8%) and painful intercourse (25.8%). Most problems listed by the girls were not persistent problems. However, inability to experience orgasm seemed to be an issue that was persistent for some participants.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Developing a patient-centered {{attitude}} {{is an important}} objective of medical education. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> in students' patient-centered attitudes are also reported. PURPOSES: Our study aims to measure (a) do <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> and age differences exist in 1 st- and 6 th-year students' attitudes toward the ideal physician? and (b) what happens to <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in attitudes as students pass the medical curriculum? METHODS: In 2004, attitudes of 1 st-year and 6 th-year medical students of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre are measured with the Ideal Physician Scale. Scores between groups are compared with t tests and univariate analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: Although {{both male and female}} students' attitudes become more care-oriented as they pass through the curriculum, <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> still apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Medical education does not differentially influence male and female students. Nevertheless, existing <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> reproduced.

5000|$|In 2005, Janet Shibley Hyde {{from the}} University of Wisconsin-Madison {{introduced}} the gender similarities hypothesis, {{which suggests that}} males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables. The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences. She concludes her article by stating: [...] "It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences. Arguably, they cause harm in numerous realms, including women’s opportunities in the workplace, couple conflict and communication, and analyses of self-esteem problems among adolescents." ...|$|E

50|$|Bleakley, Hennessy, and Fishbein {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which adolescents seek out sexual media. Results showed gender differences in the amount of sexual-content seeking, with males reporting more seeking than females. Seeking sexual content correlated positively with pre-coital behavior and relationship experience at a higher level for males compared to females of the same age (younger males in particular). This suggests that sexual media exerts a larger effect on relationship behaviors in younger males. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> greatest for internet pornography and movies, and may be due to varying motivations for seeking sexual content. The researchers suggest that actively seeking out sexual content in media may be related to an adolescent’s sexual behavior. The idea of differences in adolescents who seek out sexual content in media is explored further in a study by Bleakley and colleagues; results from the cross-sectional component demonstrated that sexual behavior and exposure to sex in the media are both cause and effect. Analysis showed more variance in sexual behavior than in exposure to sexual media, indicating that individual differences influence the seeking of sexual content. For example, sexually active youth may seek out sexual media for different reasons, ranging from information-gathering to seeking validation for their behaviour. Bleakley and colleagues found a feedback loop, in which sexually active adolescents {{are more likely to be}} exposed to sexual media and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|A {{comprehensive}} review {{of the results of}} needle aponeurotomy in 1,013 fingers was performed by Gary M. Pess, MD, Rebecca Pess, DPT and Rachel Pess, PsyD and published in the Journal of Hand Surgery April 2012. Minimal followup was 3 years. Metacarpophalangeal joint (MP) contractures were corrected an average of 99% and Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) contractures an average of 89% immediately post procedure. At final follow-up, 72% of the correction was maintained for MP joints and 31% for PIP joints. The difference between the final corrections for MP versus PIP joints was statistically significant. When a comparison was performed between patients age 55 years and older versus under 55 years, there was a statistically significant difference at both MP and PIP joints, with greater correction maintained in the older group. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> not statistically significant. Needle aponeurotomy provided successful correction to 5° or less contracture immediately post procedure in 98% (791) of MP joints and 67% (350) of PIP joints. There was recurrence of 20° or less over the original post procedure corrected level in 80% (646) of MP joints and 35% (183) of PIP joints. Complications were rare except for skin tears, which occurred in 3.4% (34) of digits. This study showed that NA is a safe procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. The complication rate was low, but recurrences were frequent in younger patients and for PIP contractures.|$|E
