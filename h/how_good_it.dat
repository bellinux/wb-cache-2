500|$|As well as {{providing}} social commentary, Odyssey Number Five also discussed love, a recurring motif in Fanning's songwriting. Fanning noted {{that one of}} the causes of this was his passion for soul and gospel music, stating that he [...] "listen to a lot of soul music that's unashamedly about love and <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> makes you feel". Lead guitarist Ian Haug agreed, and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to Fanning's lyrics, stating [...] "It's really important for us to agree with what Bernard is singing." ...|$|E

Gospel and soul music that is [...] "unashamedly about love and <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> makes you feel" [...] was common during the Odyssey Number Five recording sessions. Powderfinger worked hard in those sessions to ensure a more polished work than Internationalist; guitarist Darren Middleton concluded that [...] "My Happiness", [...] "The Metre", and [...] "Up & Down & Back Again" [...] were more [...] "complete" [...] because of the band's efforts. The lighter elements of [...] "My Happiness" [...] in comparison {{to some of the}} band's earlier work saw Fanning reveal his passion for several other musicians, such as James Taylor—something that [...] "five years ago ... would have been an embarrassing thing to say".|$|E

500|$|Illmatic {{has also}} helped {{to shape the}} attitudes and {{perceptions}} of hip hop fans, who cherish it as a music template that defines the genre's conventions.

The evidence they point to when they want to say: this is <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> can be.” New York Times columnist Jon Caramanica also credits the album with inadvertently spawning hip hop's counterculture. [...] "Illmatic" [...] he writes, [...] "mobilized a national network of dissidents craving something true to the streets but eager to distance themselves from what was beginning to be perceived as a scourge – gangster rap." [...] According to Caramanica, Nas' debut was received by these fans as a [...] "rebuke" [...] towards trends that were beginning to shape mainstream rap: [...] "the pop crossover, the exuberant production values, [...] the splintering of rap into [...] and concerned wings." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> was. It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one last look at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E

500|$|CNN writer Henry Hanks {{praised the}} season premiere {{and said he}} was [...] "overjoyed" [...] that the show had returned. He found {{particularly}} funny the scenes {{at the start of the}} episode which showed the part-time jobs Tom, Donna and Jerry had during the parks department hiatus. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] not only included many fun moments, but that the jokes felt [...] "fresher and more rambunctious" [...] than they had in the previous season, and that the shows seemed to have discovered [...] "a newfound sense of purpose". Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said [...] "Go Big and Go Home", along with the five other first episodes of the season [...] "couldn't be funnier". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman felt the episode was a strong start to the season, and particularly praised Rob Lowe, whose character he said was [...] "really beginning to jell". Blogcritics writer Jerome Wetzel wrote, [...] "I can't express in words <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> is to have Parks and Recreation back on television." [...] Wetzel said the characters were so well defined that the show rivaled the ensemble cast of The Office, a comedy made by the same producers as Parks and Recreation. Zap2it writer Rick Porter wrote that Parks and Recreation [...] "was one of the two or three funniest comedies on TV when it finished its second season, and it begins its third season having lost none of its mojo". He particularly praised the performances of Nick Offerman and Rob Lowe.|$|E
500|$|Played by Mike Reid, Frank {{had been}} a regular {{character}} in the serial from 1987 to 1994, and had appeared in a recurring role until 1998, when Reid agreed to return full-time. Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special two-hander episode aired in November 1998, featuring only Pat and Peggy for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to Roy (Tony Caunter), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity. The episode, written by Tony Jordan, featured what the Sunday Mirror described as one of [...] "the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap", with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming [...] "You bitch!" [...] and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming [...] "You cow!". According to press reports, the fight scene between the characters was [...] "so powerful {{that it had to}} have scenes and dialogue cut so it could be screened before the 9pm watershed." [...] Barbara Windsor was reportedly bruised during the filming. Windsor commented, [...] "The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn't believe <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> was. Pam and I were really proud." [...] The Sunday Mirror described it as: [...] "one of the most impressive episodes of all time". In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.|$|E
500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today showed {{appreciation}} for [...] "I Was Here": [...] "At 29, the still-in-her-prime Beyoncé {{seems a little}} young to be worrying about her legacy, as she does on the Warren power ballad I Was Here. But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album's most moving song." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.|$|E

[...] Bajo says, [...] "It's always gameplay for me. I don't care what the game is about, if the gameplay is engaging, challenging, and interesting to me, I will play the hell out of it and I'll love it. Second, for me it needs a good story.

Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: [...] "He called me to tell me <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people.

2500|$|In 2013, the American critic Richard Brody wrote The Birth of a Nation was :"...a seminal {{commercial}} spectacle {{but also}} a decisively original work of art—in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality. It’s tempting {{to think of the}} film’s influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it’s even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie’s fabricated events shouldn’t lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn’t lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of Birth of a Nation, even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about The Birth of a Nation is <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it’s that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment—together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous)." ...|$|E
