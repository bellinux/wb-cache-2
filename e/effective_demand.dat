5|$|Nurkse {{emphasised}} that Keynesian theory shouldn't {{be applied}} to underdeveloped countries because they don't face a lack of <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> {{in the way that}} developed countries do. Their problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause inflationary pressure.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's {{geographical}} area is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large <b>effective</b> <b>demand.</b> For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small. This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E

30|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of HPPS is documented in Stadtler (1988). Here, the architecture of HPPS is analyzed, regarding its practical application to lot-sizing problems. Focusing on lot-sizing problems, Stadtler (1988) develops the concept of <b>effective</b> lot-size <b>demand.</b> In a computational study including rolling schedules and partial demand uncertainty, Stadtler (1988) shows that <b>effective</b> lot-size <b>demands</b> increase the precision of estimating inventory levels. This results in more suitable directives for short-term planning and, in turn, decreases costs.|$|R
25|$|During the {{depression}} of 1873–96, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations {{were able to}} reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates, and, as a result, industrial production increased by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates {{in the two countries}} helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During {{the depression}} the British ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0% while Germany's rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. In essence, {{during the course of the}} depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment while Germany stimulated <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment with regard to social overhead capital, such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, while this input stagnated or decreased in Britain and the investment helped to stimulate industrial demand in Germany. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.|$|E
60|$|The {{machines}} {{which produce}} corn {{and raw materials}} on the contrary, are the gifts of nature, not the works of man; and we find, by experience, that these gifts have very different qualities and powers. The most fertile lands of a country, those which, like the best machinery in manufactures, yield the greatest products with the least labour and capital, are never found sufficient to supply the <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> of an increasing population. The price of raw produce, therefore, naturally rises till it becomes sufficiently high to pay the cost of raising it with inferior machines, and by a more expensive process; and, as there cannot be two prices for corn of the same quality, all the other machines, the working of which requires less capital compared with the produce, must yield rents in proportion to their goodness.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this view}} {{there are three}} errors. The first and chief is the {{overlooking}} {{the fact that all}} exchangeableness of commodity, or <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> for it, depends on the sum of capacity for its use existing, here or elsewhere. The book we cannot read, or picture we take no delight in, may indeed be called part of our wealth, in so far as we have power of exchanging either for something we like better. But our power of effecting such exchange, and yet more, of effecting it to advantage, depends absolutely on the number of accessible persons who can understand the book, or enjoy the painting, and who will dispute the possession of them. Thus the actual worth of either, even to us, depends no less on their essential goodness than on the capacity consisting somewhere for the perception of it; and it is vain in any completed system of production to think of obtaining one without the other. So that, though the great political economist knows that co-existence of capacity for use with temporary possession cannot be always secured, the final fact, on which he bases all action and administration, is that, in the whole nation, or group of nations, he has to deal with, for every grain of intrinsic value produced he must with exactest chemistry produce its twin grain of governing capacity, or in the degrees of his failure he has no wealth. Nature's challenge to us is in earnest, as the Assyrian's mock, [...] "I will give you two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them." [...] Bavieca's paces are brave, if the Cid backs him; but woe to us, if we take the dust of capacity, wearing the armour of it, for capacity itself, for so all procession, however goodly in the show of it, is to the tomb.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} tension in neo-Keynesian macroeconomics {{as to whether the}} familiar IS-LM analysis should be interpreted as a description of equilibrium or disequilibrium. The present paper shows how the IS-LM model can be used for either purpose. The first section provides the preliminaries for the model of disequilibrium behavior that I will use. The second section lays out the sectoral notional and <b>effective</b> <b>demands.</b> The third section gives the equilibrium solution while the fourth and fifth sections give excess supply and excess demand solutions respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of wage and price adjustment equations rests {{heavily on the}} use of tension variables that aim at capturing the disequilibria in the labor and goods markets. Disequilibrium models therefore provide a natural way of endogenizing these tension variables. This paper estimates jointly a two-market disequilibrium model and a wage and price adjustment block where price and wage growth react to excess <b>effective</b> <b>demands.</b> The estimation is carried out using the simulated pseudo-maximum-likelihood methods developed by Laroque and Salanie (1989); the results promising as regards the {{estimation of}} even more sophisticated models.

50|$|In economics, <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> (ED) in {{a market}} is the demand for a product or service which occurs when purchasers are {{constrained}} in a different market.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the stability of a general equilibrium model in which trade takes place at non-equilibrium prices. Quantity constraints are perceived by the traders and <b>effective</b> <b>demands</b> and supplies are explicitly derived from utility and profit maximization. Therefore, spillover effects are taken into account whenever a quantity constraint is binding. Furthermore, we resolve the problem of bankruptcy as follows. Traders, in maximizing their objective functions, plan at the same time not to go bankrupt, by constraining their behavior explicitly. Such a constrained behavior assigns to money a role as a medium of exchange. The system is shown to be globally stable, when both prices and quantity constraints adjust in disequilibrium. ...|$|R

40|$|Twenty {{five years}} after the {{publication}} of the second edition, this paper describes and evaluates the Contributions to monetary and macroeconomics made in Don Patinkin's Money, Interest, and Prices (MIP). Its first accomplishment was to settle definitively many issues, such as the valid and invalid dichotomies between real and nominal magnitudes, Say's identity, the nature of the Keynesian system, and the requirements for the neutrality of money, which had been disputed for decades. It also opened the road to the future by developing macroeconomic models from a well specified microeconomic foundation. In so doing, it established the base on which subsequent equilibrium macroeconomics built. Beyond that, in Chapter XII, Patinkin pioneered the development of disequilibrium analysis by presenting a fully articulated model that makes the key distinction between notional and <b>effective</b> <b>demands,</b> and using it to explain price and quantity adjustments in conditions of unemployment. ...|$|R
