5|$|The scoring for {{the home}} version is {{proportionally}} {{identical to the original}} except that each <b>item</b> <b>is</b> worth 1/10th its arcade value, with the bonus Vitamins as the only variation, being worth 100 points, which is the equivalent of the 1000 point scoring melon bonus item that appears in the 7th and 8th levels of the arcade game. Unlike the arcade version, if Pac-Man loses a life while the vitamin appears, the vitamin may not necessarily be forfeited.|$|E
5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an <b>item</b> <b>is</b> inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Action Film and JIF {{continued}} producing films {{until the}} beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Indies began in early 1942, leading to the closing of all but one film studio. The cast of Srigala Item remained with JIF until the company closed, as did Tan. According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Catalogue of Indonesian Films), a copy of Srigala <b>Item</b> <b>is</b> stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. The reels have been damaged by acid, leading to part of the film being excised.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{statistical}} analysis, 8 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from physical (literacy) environment, 8 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from parent literacy habits, 6 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from child literacy habits, 23 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from parent-child interaction for language and literacy activities, and 10 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from parental beliefs, {{to make a}} questionnaire containing 55 items (Refer to Additional file  3). However, we acknowledge the limitation that the sample size of experts we had was small for the analyses.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the more}} than four {{thousand}} items collected, {{only about a third}} came from the professional literature, and the other two-thirds from non-academic sources. These <b>items</b> <b>were</b> classified, similar <b>items</b> <b>were</b> eliminated, and the remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> rewritten to be clear. The rewritten <b>items</b> <b>were</b> then classified into 33 subcategories, and the subcategories supplemented with newly generated items to give equal coverage.|$|R

5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey <b>item</b> <b>is</b> subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate <b>item</b> <b>is</b> found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, {{during the}} International Defence Exhibition and Seminar in Karachi, Nigeria was {{reportedly}} buying between 25 and 40 JF-17s from Pakistan. Nigerian Air Force chief Air Marshal Adesola Nunayon Amosu had visited Pakistan earlier in October 2014. Nigeria became the second customer in 2016 by placing {{an order for}} 3 planes. However, as the news reports value the deal at US$25 million, {{it is not clear}} if the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> misreported. June 2016 article in Jane's re-affirmed NAF budget for 3 JF-17, 10 Super Mushshak, and 2 Mi-35M aircraft in 2016.

40|$|Purpose Computer-adaptive tests (CATs) {{can measure}} {{precisely}} at individual level with few items selected from an item bank. Our {{aim was to}} select fatigue items to develop a CAT for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and include expert opinions that are important for content validity of measurement instruments. Methods <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> included from existing fatigue questionnaires and generated from interview material. In a Delphi procedure, rheumatologists, nurses, and patients evaluated the initial pool of 294 <b>items.</b> <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> selected for the CAT development if rated as adequate by at least 80 % of the participants (when 50 % or less agreed, they <b>were</b> excluded). Remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> adjusted based on participants’ comments and re-evaluated in the next round. The procedure stopped when all <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected or rejected. Results A total of 10 rheumatologists, 20 nurses, and 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients participated. After the first round, 96 of 294 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> directly selected. Nine <b>items</b> <b>were</b> directly excluded, and remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> adjusted. In the second round, 124 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> presented for re-evaluation. Ultimately, 245 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected. Conclusion This study revealed a qualitatively evaluated <b>item</b> pool to <b>be</b> used for the item bank/CAT development. The Delphi procedure is a beneficial approach to select adequate items for measuring fatigue in R...|$|R
5000|$|... 'A' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> very {{important}} for an organization. Because of the high value of these 'A' items, frequent value analysis is required. In addition to that, an organization needs to choose an appropriate order pattern (e.g. ‘Just- in- time’) to avoid excess capacity. 'B' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> important, but of course less important than 'A' items and more important than 'C' items. Therefore, 'B' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> intergroup <b>items.</b> 'C' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> marginally important.|$|R
5|$|In Oracle of Ages, {{the central}} <b>item</b> <b>is</b> the Harp of Ages, which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between {{the past and}} the present. In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in Final Fantasy games {{is to increase}} character attributes; arming Zidane with a Mythril Vest, for example, increases his base defense statistic. In Final Fantasy IX, weapons and armor include special character abilities, which the character may use when the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> equipped (permitting the ability matches their class). Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle, the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped. In addition to granting abilities the equipment in Final Fantasy IX determines the statistical growth of the characters {{at the time of}} level up. Armor not only raises base defense or evasion statistics but raises defense and/or other statistics at level up.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey <b>item</b> <b>is</b> the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey <b>item</b> <b>is</b> found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Tigers usually {{prefer to}} eat prey they have caught themselves, {{but are not}} above eating carrion in times of {{scarcity}} and may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey <b>item</b> <b>is</b> under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and crocodiles on occasion. Tigers may also prey on these competitors. Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory. Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers {{and in some cases}} even kill them.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} was a {{deductive}} approach and involved developing a large pool of items. 245 new <b>items</b> <b>were</b> {{generated by the}} authors in accordance with relevant personality research, reference materials, and the current diagnostic criteria.

5|$|Æthelstan {{ascended the}} throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In the {{earliest}} known depiction of an English king wearing a crown, he is shown presenting a copy of Bede's Life of St Cuthbert to the saint himself. Until his reign, kings had been portrayed on coins wearing helmets and circlets, or wreath-like diadems {{in the style of}} Roman emperor, Constantine the Great. Whether or not they wore such an <b>item</b> <b>is</b> open to question. Coins are unreliable because the portraits were often generic or copied from overseas coins. Edgar the Peaceful was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced into the ceremony for his coronation in 973.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country uses {{a series}} of map screens to track the players' progress. Between each level, players control their {{character}} on the map screen, navigating {{to the next level}} they want to play. Each level on the map is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings (the game's main enemy), while friendly areas are marked by members of the Kong family. Every individual world map screen has one boss enemy {{at the end of the}} course, which must be defeated to travel back to the main map screen of the whole island. It is possible to access previous world maps without defeating the boss by finding Funky Kong and borrowing his barrel plane. Players use this ability to select the world from the main screen, then the level within it. During play the game interface hides most game-related information, such as the number of bananas, letters, and animal tokens collected, as well as the number of lives remaining. When an <b>item</b> <b>is</b> collected, the relevant information briefly appears on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Maggie {{tells them}} that the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> a computer, with the {{location}} of five tons of refined plutonium abandoned in a mine by the Soviet Union after the Cold War. Vilain intends to retrieve the plutonium and sell it. The Expendables are able to weakly track the computer's signal and follow Vilain, which leads them to Bulgaria where they stay overnight at an abandoned Russian military base. The next morning, the team is ambushed by the Sangs and a tank. After the Expendables run out of ammunition, they are saved by Ross's old friend, Booker, who quickly eliminates both the Sangs and the tank. Before he departs, Booker informs the group of a nearby village whose residents oppose Vilain. Meanwhile, Hector and Vilain dig up the plutonium and begin collecting it.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each <b>item</b> <b>is</b> labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|Plant food {{is stored}} year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, {{occasionally}} in walls {{or in the}} ground. The food <b>item</b> <b>is</b> usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached food is retrieved in cold weather. Siberian birds store {{the seeds of the}} Siberian stone pine, sometimes hoarding enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast {{is an important part of}} the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an <b>item</b> <b>is</b> collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E
50|$|RWK's quests are {{primarily}} obtained {{by going to}} a specific location, talking to special NPCs, or defeating certain monsters at specific locations. Quest <b>items</b> <b>are</b> designed to enhance the characters, {{and some of the}} powerful quest <b>items</b> <b>are</b> also obtainable by purchasing them from Glitchless.
