30|$|Data in {{this thesis}} also include the sales, profit, and {{incremental}} of enterprises. We use {{the average number of}} employees in an enterprise to calculate the average operation index and compare the operational performance between monopoly industries and competition industries. From Table  2 we can see that there are great differentials in operation situations among enterprises in monopoly industries. Although the proportion of enterprises ﻿with﻿ loss﻿ in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> quite high, the proportions of average profit and average incremental are higher than the corresponding index in competition industry. The profit per capita in monopoly <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> 7.8 thousand yuan, while the median of the average profit in enterprises of competition <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 3.5 thousand yuan; the median of the average sales in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 336.1 thousand yuan, while the median for the average sales in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 326 thousand yuan. The average incremental is also a measurement on enterprises’ operation situation. The median of the average incremental in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 53.4 thousand yuan, while the median of average incremental in competition <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 36.6 thousand yuan. As the incremental of financial <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> not calculated and there is lack of data about enterprises’ incremental, the number observed on average incremental is less than other indexes of enterprises.|$|R
