5|$|Defensively, Iowa State was led {{by three}} players who {{achieved}} first team all-conference honors: senior defensive lineman Jake McDonough and senior linebackers Jake Knott and A.J. Klein. Knott recorded over 10 tackles in five games while Klein achieved that feat four times. Iowa State was expected to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> safety Durrell Givens and defensive back Jansen Watson back from injury for the game. The remainder of the Cyclone secondary was rounded out by senior Jeremy Reeves and junior Jacques Washington. Coming into the game, Iowa State ranked 59th {{in the nation in}} pass defense efficiency and 69th nationally in run defense.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton was quickest in Q2, just 0.012 seconds {{ahead of}} his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg. The Mercedes power unit proved its superiority on the high-speed Montreal track, with all remaining Mercedes-powered cars making it into Q3, leaving Kimi Räikkönen and the two Red Bull drivers to take the remaining three places. This {{was the first time}} in 2015 that Force India was able to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> cars into Q3 in qualifying, having last done so at the 2014 German Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|In a confrontational situation, {{although}} the ultimate intention {{may be to}} apply the handcuffs to the rear in the back-to-back position, officers are often forced to settle for the first position {{in which they can}} <b>get</b> <b>both</b> of the suspect's wrists.|$|E

25|$|The 1988 Game was {{surrounded}} by tacit accusations against Oakland A's fans of stuffing the ballot box in favor of catcher Terry Steinbach, whose qualifications as a starter were questioned by some sportswriters.

5000|$|Grabow had a 94 mph fastball {{that runs}} inside on left-handed hitters, a sharp, hard, late-breaking slider, [...] "one {{of the best}} changeups in the game", [...] "the bottom falling out of it", which confounds right-handers, and was equally adept at <b>getting</b> <b>both</b> right and left-handed batters out.|$|R
25|$|Weight loss {{surgery in}} those with obesity and type two {{diabetes}} is often an effective measure. Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels {{with little or no}} medications following surgery and long-term mortality is decreased. There is, however, a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery. The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear. It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> their weight and blood sugar under control.|$|E

The win, added to third place for the sister car of Allan McNish, Rinaldo Capello and Tom Kristensen, enabled Audi to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> their cars to finish on the podium. Audi didn't have {{everything}} its own way though as the Toyota TS030 hybrid of Alex Wurz, Kazuki Nakajima and Nicolas Lapierre challenged hard, leading early on, to finish a richly deserved second.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{composition}} of the offspring depends on what type of apomixis takes place. When endomitosis occurs before meiosis or when central fusion occurs (restitutional meiosis of anaphase I or the fusion of its products), the offspring get all to {{more than half of}} the mother's genetic material and heterozygosity is mostly preserved (if the mother has two alleles for a locus, it is likely that the offspring will <b>get</b> <b>both).</b> This is because in anaphase I the homologous chromosomes are separated. Heterozygosity is not completely preserved when crossing over occurs in central fusion. In the case of pre-meiotic doubling, recombination -if it happens- occurs between identical sister chromatids.|$|E

5000|$|The odds {{of getting}} {{none of the}} 50 main balls but <b>getting</b> <b>both</b> lucky stars is {{approximately}} 1 in 115. This means that it is less likely than getting 2 main balls and one lucky star (1 in 49). However, there is no prize for only getting 2 lucky stars.|$|R
25|$|On {{the high}} and windy summit of Mount Suribachi, Rosenthal {{discovered}} a group of Marines attaching a large flag to a length of steel pipe. Nearby, he saw the smaller flag flying and managed to get himself photoed by Campbell under the flag with Sgt. Genaust and Army Pfc. George Burn, a photographer for Yank Magazine. Another group of Marines was getting themselves ready to lower the smaller flag {{at the same instant}} the larger flag was raised under an officer's orders. Rosenthal briefly contemplated attempting to photograph both of the flags at once, but was not in position to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> flags in the photograph (Pvt. Campbell did capture an image of the first flag coming down while the second flag was going up), so he focused his attention on the group of men preparing to raise the second flag.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, the Oslo Tunnel {{was being}} planned {{to connect the}} Drammen Line to Oslo East Station. This would make Oslo West Station unnecessary, and would allow a central station to be built at the {{location}} of the East Station. The tunnel was planned to run in a similar route as would be necessary to connect Jernbanetorget to Nationaltheatret, and a railway station was planned to connect to Nationaltheatret. Simultaneously, Oslo Sporveier worked with possibilities to connect their eastern and western networks, and <b>get</b> <b>both</b> into the city core. During the 1960s, the planning office for the metro proposed to build a connecting tunnel between Nationaltheatret and Jernbanetorget. However, the initial plans involved creating a station close to Nationaltheatret, named for Slottsparken, which would serve as the transfer point between the two systems. This station had a planned dimension to hold 25,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{to the act}} of {{succession}} in Denmark follow the same rules as changes to the constitution. First, it must be passed by parliament, then passed in unchanged form by the next parliament following parliamentary elections, and then be submitted to a public referendum. In order for the law to be approved in the referendum, it must <b>get</b> <b>both</b> a majority of votes cast in favour and at least 40% of all eligible voters voting in favour. Although an opinion poll from May 2005 showed a majority of 77% in favour of the change, it would not guarantee passage of the bill. In fact turnout at the preceding European Parliament elections in 2004 was so low (47.6%), that even a 77% margin in favour would not take the proposal past the 40% threshold. However, turnout increased and at midnight on the election night with most votes counted, the threshold had been passed and the law was certain to pass.|$|E

500|$|Dónal McBrien {{gave the}} {{performance}} 3.8 stars out of 5 {{in a review}} for Metal Ireland writing: [...] "It's horror punk, and you get exactly what you expect.

500|$|While {{promoting}} 2014's The Endless River, Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd's studio albums. “I {{think there}} are ideas contained there that we have continued to use {{all the way through}} our career,” he says. “I think [...] was a quite good way of marking Syd ’s departure and Dave ’s arrival.

500|$|Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it {{is fairly}} easy for a crooked sports {{official}} to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a [...] "rogue official". According to Lang, an official can directly influence {{the outcome of a}} game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future. [...] Lang also believed a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.|$|E

[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you <b>get</b> <b>both</b> sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs for}} Frozen were written and {{composed}} by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, {{both of whom}} had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh (2011) (also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo– The Musical (2007). Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to <b>get</b> <b>both</b> of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters).
