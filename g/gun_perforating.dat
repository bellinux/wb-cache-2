50|$|In 1932, Bill Lane and Walt Wells invented bullet <b>gun</b> <b>perforating</b> {{and formed}} the Lane-Wells Company in Vernon, California. They {{performed}} their first job on Union Oil's La Merced #17 well in Los Angeles. The company {{that would become}} Western Atlas (later Baker Atlas) grew quickly and added other wireline services, including the gamma ray log in 1939 and the neutron log in 1941, which were developed by Well Surveys Inc., an affiliated company. In 1948, a Lane-Wells crew performed the company's 100,000th job on La Merced #17, {{the site of the}} first perforating run.|$|E
40|$|In the {{oilfield}} development, the perforation {{process is}} known as the “goal”, therefore, the perforating operation is the most important process in the well completion process. However, in the perforating process, the <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> is working in the down hole; the operator cannot observe on the ground. And the <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> itself, and the <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> assemble process produced some unpredictable situation, such as broken blasting, gun broken, etc. These problems will influent the well completion process; even make the whole well scrapped. In this thesis, we will analysis one unpredictable situation in Bohai oilfield, through a variety of experiments to find and analyze the cause of the abnormal cases, to avoid the same problems in the future work...|$|R
50|$|A {{perforation}} in {{the context}} of oil wells refers to a hole punched in the casing or liner of an oil well to connect it to the reservoir. In cased hole completions, the well will be drilled down past the section of the formation desired for production and will have casing or a liner run in separating the formation from the well bore. The final stage of the completion will involve running in <b>perforating</b> <b>guns,</b> a string of shaped charges, down to the desired depth and firing them to perforate the casing or liner. A typical <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> can carry many dozens of explosive charges.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{technologies}} of high charge perforator and high density perforator {{are widely used}} in domestic and international oil-gas wells perforating job, {{which leads to the}} increase of the explosion load intensity, resulting in more string damage accidents, and seriously affects the normal production of oil and gas. The software of LS-DYNA was used to measure the dynamic response of the <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> under four types of perforation conditions. It analyzes <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> head's forms and characteristics of output load under different working conditions, and also analyzes the impact on perforating gun's structural strength under different axial and radial load. These conclusions provide an important theoretical reference for reasonable arranging the perforating technology, improving perforation safety and reducing the well perforating accidents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at the {{deficiencies}} of tubing-conveyed oriented perforating technology for horizontal well, a pumping perforation technology in horizontal well has been developed. Pumping perforation technology {{process is a}} perforation process transferring the <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> string into perforation section of the horizontal well with pumping fluid, and then completing the perforation while perforating bullets exploding after powering on, and finally towing back the <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> {{to the ground with}} cable. It is of the advantages such as simple perforation column, simple and convenient process and the shorter operating time. <b>Perforating</b> <b>gun</b> string is acted on by the impact, gravity and buoyancy of pumping liquid during moving in the horizontal section. Based on the theory of metal friction and the hydraulics principles, the calculation model of the critical injection rate (namely pumping displacement) in the horizontal section is established by considering the effect of the composition of the gun string, buoyancy, friction coefficient, heavy guns, gun ramps, pumping fluid density, and calculated the impact of impact, effects of assembly components of gun string, pumping-fluid buoyancy, frictional coefficient, weight of gun, angle of gun-string, pumping-fluid density and computing method of impacting force. Field applications show that the calculation model established can meet the construction needs...|$|R
50|$|A cased hole gamma {{perforator}} is used {{to perform}} mechanical services, such as shooting perforations, setting downhole tubing/casing elements, dumping remedial cement, tracer surveys, etc. Typically, a gamma perforator will {{have some sort of}} explosively initiated device attached to it, such as a <b>perforating</b> <b>gun,</b> a setting tool, or a dump bailor. In certain instances, the gamma perforator {{is used to}} merely spot objects in the well, as in tubing conveyed perforating operations and tracer surveys.|$|R
50|$|Oil Well Perforation may be {{basically}} classified in {{two types}} a) Overbalanced Perforating and b) Underbalanced Perforating. Overbalanced perforating is normally {{carried out with}} the help of <b>Perforating</b> <b>Guns</b> or Hollow carriers. In Overbalanced Perforation the weight of the Well-bore Column is more than the Reservoir Pressure, thus it normally ensures that the Well does not start flowing oil or gas immediately after perforation. However, it may have the effect of damaging the formation due to forced entry of well-bore fluid (mud) into the reservoir.|$|R
40|$|Background. Any large missing {{part of the}} ureter may be {{replaced}} by transureteroureterostomy, psoas hitch, Boari flap, nephrectomy, renal autotransplanation or by the implementation of an intestinal graft. Case report. A patient with a defect of the lumbal- pelvic portion of the right ureter, after the management of a penetrating and <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> shot wound was presented. The missing part of the ureter was successfully replaced with an appendix. The technique of uretero-transappendixcystoneostomy complete with a Boari flap and a psoas hitch was used. Conclusion. By {{the use of an}} original combination of surgical techniques, a large defect of the ureter and the defect of the bladder, as well as the preservation of the renal function was achieved in a more successful manner...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a multibody system is {{established}} to investigate the dynamic response of an oil tube-shock absorber-perforating gun system in downhole perforation-test joint operation. In the model, the oil tube and <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> are modeled as elastic rods and the shock absorber is modeled as single particle system with damping and a spring. Two force continuity conditions are used to simulate the interactions among the three components. The perforation impact load is determined by an experiment of underwater explosion of perforating bullets. Using the model, the effects of charge quantity of perforating bullet, the number of shock absorbers, {{and the length of}} oil tube on the dynamic response of oil tube and packer are investigated. On this basis, a basic principle of the combination design of shock absorber and oil tube is proposed to improve the mechanical state of downhole tools. The study results can provide theoretical support for the design of downhole perforation-test joint operation...|$|R
40|$|The present {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} study and the analysis of large strain and high strain rate behavior of materials and components. Theoretical, experimental and computational aspects are taken into consideration. Particular reference is made to the modeling of metallic materials, although other kinds of materials are considered as well. The work may be divided into three main parts. The {{first part of the}} work consists in a critical review of the constitutive modeling of materials subjected to large strains and high to very high strain rates. Specific attention is paid to the opportunity of adopting so-called strength models and equations of state. Damage and failure modeling is discussed as well. In this part, specific interest is addressed to reviewing the so-called Johnson-Cook strength model, by critically highlighting its positive and negative aspects. One of the main tackled issue consists in a reasoned assessment of the various procedures adoptable in order to calibrate the parameters of the model. This phase is enriched and clarified by applying different calibration strategies to a real case, i. e. the evaluation of the model parameters for a structural steel. The consequences determined by each calibration approach are then carefully evaluated and compared. The second part of the work aims at introducing a new strength model, that consists in a generalization of the Johnson-Cook model. The motivations for the introduction of this model are first exposed and discussed. The features of the new strength model are then described. Afterwards, the various procedures adoptable for the determination of the material parameters are presented. The new strength model is then applied to a real case, i. e. a structural steel as above, and the results are compared to those obtained from the original Johnson-Cook model. Comparing to that, the obtained outcomes show that the new model displays a better capacity in reproducing experimental data. Results are discussed and commented. The third and final part of the work deals with an application of the studied topics to a real industrial case of interest. A device called <b>perforating</b> <b>gun</b> is analyzed in its structural problematics and critical aspects. This challenging application involves the modeling of several typologies of material, large strains, very high strain rate phenomena, high temperatures, explosions, hypervelocity impacts, damage, fracture and phase changes. In this regard, computational applications of the studied theories are presented and their outcomes are assessed and discussed. Several finite element techniques are considered. In particular, tridimensional Eulerian simulations are presented. The obtained results appear to be very promising in terms of the possibilities of a fruitful use in the design process of the device, in particular in order to achieve an optimization of its key features...|$|R
