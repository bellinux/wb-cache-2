40|$|Amoxicillin, ampicillin, and <b>epicillin</b> (500 mg of each) {{were given}} orally to fasting {{men and women}} in a triple {{crossover}} study. Peak serum concentrations were significantly higher for amoxicillin than for ampicillin and significantly lowest for <b>epicillin.</b> The concentrations of antibiotics in serum were comparable in men and women. Total urine recovery was highest for amoxicillin (56. 7 %) and lowest for <b>epicillin</b> (27. 5 %), and higher in men than in women {{for each of the three}} antibiotics. Saliva, sweat, and tears contained only very small amounts of amoxicillin and, rarely, ampicillin or <b>epicillin.</b> A significant (P < 0. 02) sequence effect was noted in that peak serum concentrations of ampicillin were higher (6. 4 μg/ml) if <b>epicillin</b> had been taken the previous week than when ampicillin was taken first (2. 7 μg/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epicillin</b> {{exhibits}} excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice {{infected with}} a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and <b>epicillin,</b> the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of <b>epicillin</b> or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in <b>epicillin</b> than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10 -μg <b>epicillin</b> discs should be the same as is used for 10 -μg ampicillin discs...|$|E
40|$|A new semisynthetic penicillin, {{structurally}} {{related to}} ampicillin, {{has been assigned}} the generic name <b>epicillin,</b> 6 -[d- 2 -amino- 2 -(1, 4 -cyclohexadienyl) acetamido]-penicillanic acid. The antimicrobial spectrum and level of activity of <b>epicillin</b> in vitro {{are similar to those}} of ampicillin. In studies with recent clinical isolates, these two antibiotics, when compared with carbenicillin, showed consistently higher antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Proteus species. When tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, on the other hand, <b>epicillin</b> exhibited a level of intrinsic activity superior to that of ampicillin but less than that of carbenicillin. <b>Epicillin</b> is an amphoteric substance that is sensitive to penicillinase, is acid-stable, and is minimally, but reversibly, bound to human serum protein...|$|E
40|$|A fluorimetric {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} ampicillin and <b>epicillin</b> in aqueous solution and plasma. Alkaline degradation followed by heating at 100 °C yields a strong fluorescent derivative from each of these antibiotics. Formaldehyde catalyses {{the formation of the}} fluorescent derivative. Structural similarities between the side chains of these antibiotics and their identical excitation and emission spectra suggest that both the antibiotics may be forming similar fluorescent derivatives. The assay {{does not appear to be}} interfered with the common drugs administered together with ampicillin and <b>epicillin...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} 93 cases of Pneumonias in adults {{was carried out}} over a period o f 3 years. The {{predominant}} organisms isolated were Enterobacter, E. coli, Streptococci and Staphylococci. Clinical and radiographic responses to the drugs administered (<b>Epicillin,</b> Ampi-cillin and Penicillin) were broadly comparable. Only 5 cases (<b>Epicillin)</b> failed to respond. There was little difference in the responses according to the organisms isolated or the sensitivity to the drug administered. The responses were similar in both Gram positive and Gram negative infections and the drug sensitivity status {{did not seem to}} matter...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-seven {{clinical}} isolates of Haemophilus influenzae {{from various}} {{sections of the}} United States, England, and Germany were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, <b>epicillin,</b> carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and methicillin. Fifty-three of the strains had previously been judged to be ampicillin resistant and 14 had been determined to be ampicillin susceptible. Fifty-two of the 53 resistant strains produced β-lactamase, {{but none of the}} susceptible strains produced it. On the basis of minimal inhibitory concentrations, the most active compounds were ticarcillin and carbenicillin. Whether this greater activity is useful clinically has not been established...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of treatment with increasing oral doses of three absorbable antibiotics on the colonization {{resistance of the}} digestive tract was investigated in mice. Mice treated with ampicillin or <b>epicillin</b> {{in any of the}} applied doses had a strongly decreased colonization resistance as demonstrated by 'bacterial overgrowth' after contamination with resistant strains of Escherichia coli. After a treatment period 2 weeks, Streptococcus faecalis became resistant in a number of animals. Oral treatment with cephradine on the other hand had no obvious influence on the endogenous flora of the mice, nor was the colonization resistance decreased...|$|E
40|$|Simple, {{rapid and}} {{selective}} HPLC {{methods have been}} developed for the analysis of amoxycillin, ampicillin, <b>epicillin,</b> mecillinam and propicillin. A Hypersil ODS 5 mu m (150 x 4. 6 mm I. D.) column was used with mobile phases containing aqueous phosphate buffers, pH 3 - 4. 6 and either methanol or acetonitrile as the organic modifier. Samples were detected by their optimal UV absorption (210 - 230 nm). The lower limits of quantitation of the compounds !(100 mu l injection volume) were 0. 1 mu g/ml. The assays were linear in the range of 0. 1 - 100 mu g/ml with r(2) values greater than 0. 99. The methods have been applied successfully for the measurement of the Aux of the compounds across Caco- 2 cells monolayers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
