Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters.|$|E

5|$|A base such as spermine <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton {{can go on}} the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|Ampelosaurus atacis {{is known}} from a {{specimen}} from the Marnes Rouges Inférieures Formation. More specifically, {{it is known}} from the Bellevue layer, which has produced many vertebrate fossils. Even though it produced many vertebrates, the formation only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> elements of plants and invertebrates. The vertebrates consist of numerous remains of Ampelosaurus, scales of Lepisosteus, shell fragments of an indeterminate turtle, cranial fragments and teeth of a crocodile, isolated theropod teeth, classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., an indeterminate ankylosaur, and a dentary and many postcranial elements of Rhabdodon priscus. The bird Gargantuavis philoinos, and dinosaur eggs have also been recovered.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} approaches, Sir Gawain sets {{off to find}} the Green Chapel and keep {{his side of the}} bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his {{beautiful}} wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E

5|$|M-40 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US12 in rural Cass County. Running north through farm fields, the highway rounds Bar Lake {{and into the}} community of Jones. The area around Jones <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more lakes in a wooded setting. As the trunkline continues north, it passes back into farm lands. The road curves around to the northwest as it passes between Bogart Lake and Streeters Mill Pond near Dutch Settlement Road. M-40 follows Centre Street into Marcellus. When the highway meets {{the western end of}} M-216 in town, M-40 turns west along Main Street and runs out of town. The roadway returns to a northerly course, and later it curves northwesterly again near Cedar Lake near the Van Buren County line.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
5|$|The city <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{sources of}} entertainment. Parks that are {{monitored}} by the corporation suffer from maintenance issues. The Trichinopoly Club or Trichy Club was established in Tiruchirappalli Cantonment in 1869. The club was disbanded in 1972 and its assets were {{taken over by the}} Madras Club. The P. T. Rajan Park, Chinnaswamy Park, Lourdusamy Park, Raja Park, Parangiri Velusamy Park and Ibrahim Park are some of the important government-run parks in the city. Of these, the Raja Park and Ibrahim Park are frequented by children. There have been plans to set up a zoological park at M. R. Palaiyam {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Once completed, the zoo is expected to house about 500 animals belonging to 50 different species. The Anna Science Centre in Tiruchirappalli has one of the two planetaria in the state.|$|E

5|$|Although Orion <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{lines in}} both Homeric poems {{and in the}} Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the video}} games, Kyo has made {{appearances}} which met disapproval by critics. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN lamented {{the fact that}} Kyo <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> appearances in the volume from the manhua The King of Fighters 2003 in comparison to Ash Crimson, who is the greater focus of the series. Den of Geek found ridiculous the comic SVC Chaos as when Kyo is killed by Akuma and Takuma Sakazaki in the first chapter, Iori in turn kills himself {{in order to go}} to the afterlife and kill Kyo there which in turn causes M. Bison to also kill himself to search Iori. Additionally, John Funk from The Escapist found Kyo's actor in the series' live-action confusing since they changed his nationality from Japanese to North American when first announced seeing as one of the weakest points from the upcoming movie. Beyond Hollywood was also confused by Kyo's portrayal in the film due to flashbacks of his childhood featuring him as Japanese whereas his adult self is American.|$|E
