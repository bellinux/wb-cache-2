40|$|ABSTRACTWave induced {{vibrations}} {{increase the}} fatigue and <b>extreme</b> <b>loading,</b> {{but this is}} normally neglected in design. The industry view on this is changing. Wave induced vibrations are often divided into springing and whipping, and their relative contribution to fatigue and <b>extreme</b> <b>loading</b> varies depending on ship design. When it comes to displacement vessels, the contribution from whipping on fatigue and <b>extreme</b> <b>loading</b> is particularly high for certain container vessels. A large modern design container vessel with high bow flare angle and high service speed has been considered. The container vessel was equipped with a hull monitoring system from a recognized supplier of HMON systems. The vessel has been operating between Asia and Europe {{for a few years}} and valuable data has been collected. Also model tests have been carried out of this vessel to investigate fatigue and <b>extreme</b> <b>loading,</b> but model tests are often limited to head seas. For the full scale measurements, the correlation between stress data and wind data has been investigated. The wave and vibration damage are shown versus heading and Beaufort strength to indicate general trends. The wind data has also been compared to North Atlantic design environment. Even though {{it has been shown that}} the encountered wind data has been much less severe than in North Atlantic, the <b>extreme</b> <b>loading</b> defined by IACS URS 11 is significantly exceeded when whipping is included. If whipping may contribute to collapse, then proper seamanship may be useful in order to limit the <b>extreme</b> <b>loading.</b> The vibration damage is also observed to be high from head to beam seas, and even present in stern seas, but fatigue damage in general is low on this East Asia to Europe trade...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on the biomechanics of <b>extreme</b> <b>loads.</b> Experiments in this area are very difficult to implement, they are usually based on the extrapolation of the measurements provided with volunteers, PMHS, etc. The project {{is based on the assumption}} that traffic accidents generate loads that correspond to a definition of <b>extreme</b> <b>loading.</b> Their mathematical simulations allow us to map and evaluate them. This dissertation covers three areas: pedestrian accidents, side impact of a child and whiplash injuries. The thesis presents a detailed analysis of selected processes including sensitivity analysis of impact conditions and of impactor parameters.

40|$|The safety {{performance}} of reinforced concrete (RC) members {{is influenced by}} various material degradation mechanisms. Based on selected degradation models and allowing for possible <b>extreme</b> <b>loading</b> events, an attempt {{is made in the}} study presented here to quantify this time-variant influence. The uncertainty associated with the problem can be attributed to a series of factors such as the material strengths and their degradation, the number of <b>extreme</b> <b>loading</b> events, and the magnitude of <b>extreme</b> <b>loading.</b> The quantification of the {{safety performance}} is thus implemented in a stochastic modeling manner, resulting in estimated probabilistic characteristics of the time-variant RC member loading-carrying capacity and the corresponding probabilities of failure of the RC members. A sensitivity analysis of these characteristics is also carried out. Due to the structural redundancy usually present in an RC structure, different failure combination scenarios are investigated.

50|$|Iliotibial band {{syndrome}} (ITBS or ITBFS, for iliotibial band friction syndrome) is {{a common}} thigh injury generally associated with running. It can also be caused by cycling or hiking. The onset of iliotibial band syndrome occurs most commonly in cases of overuse. The iliotibial band itself becomes inflamed in response to repeated compression {{on the outside of}} the knee or swelling of the fat pad between the bone and the tendon on the side of the knee. ITB syndrome can also be caused by poor physical condition, lack of warming up before exercise, or drastic changes in activity levels. Until recent anatomical studies showed differently, the previously held belief was that the distal portion of the iliotibial band rubbed over a bursa, however this bursa was found not to exist. Additionally, the theory that the iliotibial band needs to stretch has been questioned as, in cadaveric studies under <b>extreme</b> <b>load,</b> the flexibility of the iliotibial band has been shown to be minimal with greater stiffness than capsular fibers.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a Bayesian parametric {{model for the}} purpose of estimating the <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> on a wind turbine. The <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> is the highest stress level imposed on a turbine structure that the turbine would experience during its service lifetime. A wind turbine should be designed to resist such a high load to avoid catastrophic structural failures. To assess the <b>extreme</b> <b>load,</b> turbine structural responses are evaluated by conducting field measurement campaigns or performing aeroelastic simulation studies. In general, data obtained in either case are not sufficient to represent various loading responses under all possible weather conditions. An appropriate extrapolation is necessary to characterize the structural loads in a turbine's service life. This study devises a Bayesian spline method for this extrapolation purpose, using load data collected in a period much shorter than a turbine's service life. The spline method is applied to three sets of turbine's load response data to estimate the corresponding extreme loads at the roots of the turbine blades. Compared to the current industry practice, the spline method appears to provide better <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> assessment.

Normally these loads are derived from simulated time series by identifying the absolute extreme values, leaving a high amount of uncertainty and chance in these design parameters. Here we describe a method to determine statistically well founded <b>extreme</b> <b>loads</b> on the basis of the extreme value theory. Analyzing tower loads, we find that the extreme values of a given load component are described by a Pareto distribution, and non-correlated simultaneous components are normally distributed. Utilizing the peak-over-threshold method we obtain the optimal parameters of the Pareto distribution with the help of the maximum-likelihood estimation...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> effects caused by vehicles is {{of critical importance}} in the evaluation and design of bridge structures. Two methods for estimating <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> effects over the service life of bridges are commonly cited in literature: (1) {{the use of a}} fitted probability distribution based on statistical data to extrapolate the <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> effects on a probability plot, or (2) the application of Monte Carlo simulation to generate representative truck data over a bridge’s lifespan such that maximum load effect values can then be determined directly. In this paper, results obtained using the two aforementioned methods are presented including their advantages and disadvantages {{in the context of the}} analysis of rural bridges in Saskatchewan. For this purpose, estimated load effects are based on truck data recorded over a period of one year at several weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations located on Saskatchewan highways. The conducted analyses are based on a typical bridge type common to rural Saskatchewan. It was found that the Monte Carlo simulation approach resulted in more reliable <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> effect estimations, along with providing other information that is of value in the development of new truck loading models...|$|E

40|$|For short- to medium-span bridges, truck gross vehicle weights (GVW) and {{axle loads}} are of great {{importance}} to assess <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> effects, as <b>extreme</b> <b>load</b> events are obtained by combining the extremes of GVWs or axle loads. In this paper, three known prediction methods are applied, a normal distribution fitting to the sample distribution upper tail, the block maxima method and the peaks-over-threshold method, to extrapolate extreme traffic loads. Moreover, two methods, the delta method and the profile likelihood method, are introduced to assess the confidence in these extrapolations. Results show that generalized Pareto distribution based peaks-over-threshold method is the best among these three methods to assess the extreme traffic loads.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} which wave conditions are inducing <b>extreme</b> mooring <b>loads</b> on a highly dynamically responding moored structure. Currently, the design of a mooring system for a typical oil and gas offshore structure is based on the prediction of the <b>extreme</b> mooring <b>loads</b> for a limited number of wave conditions along the envelope of a wave scatter diagram. During the design process, an inappropriate choice of wave conditions could lead to an incorrect estimation of <b>extreme</b> mooring <b>loads,</b> which may result either in the loss of the mooring system or in a costly overdesign. This paper draws on mooring tensions and wave conditions that have been recorded at a mooring test facility using a multi-leg catenary mooring system. The mooring loads have been assessed to identify <b>extreme</b> mooring <b>loads,</b> which have been analysed in respect to the corresponding wave conditions. Further, joint probability distributions of wave conditions that results in <b>extreme</b> mooring <b>loads</b> have been determined. The most important finding is that <b>extreme</b> mooring <b>loads</b> were not necessarily identified to occur on the envelope of the wave climate parameter scatter diagram...|$|R
