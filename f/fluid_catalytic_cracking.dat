U. S. governmental agencies are calling for strict environmental regulations on the quality of gasoline. <b>Fluid</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracked</b> naphtha is an important blending component of the gasoline pool. The majority of the sulfur in the gasoline pool comes from these cracked naphthas. Therefore, increased regulations win require the removal of sulfur from <b>fluid</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracked</b> naphtha. The hydrodesulfurization processes used to remove sulfur also saturate olefins and reduce octane number. As the sulfur is removed by hydrogenation, the C 6 to CIO olefins become saturated. It has been observed through experimentation that the reactivity of the olefins with hydrogen and the change in octane number depend on the carbon number and type of the olefins. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the reaction kinetics and develop correlations for C 6 to CIO olefin saturation reactions. Data from pilot plant studies at the Texaco Research and Development Lab in Port Arthur, Texas were examined. From the data collected and the correlations that are developed, a more complete understanding of the olefin saturation mechanism in the hydrodesulfurization of FCC naphtha was developed...|$|R

25|$|Since {{crude oil}} {{generally}} contains only 10 to 40 percent of hydrocarbon constituents in the gasoline range, refineries typically use a <b>fluid</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> unit (FCCU) process to convert {{high molecular weight}} hydrocarbons into smaller and more volatile compounds, which are then converted into liquid gasoline-size hydrocarbons. Alkylation processes transform low molecular-weight alkenes and iso-paraffin molecules into larger iso-paraffins with a high octane number. While FCCUs are a very common unit in modern oil refineries, it is not common for a refinery have an alkylation unit.

40|$|International audienceThe {{share of}} diesel fuel in European {{transport}} sector, which currently represents over 50 % of total 11 demand, is increasing, requiring massive imports of this product, {{while at the}} same time, gasoline fuels are 12 today in surplus. In terms of air pollutant emissions, gasoline and kerosene streams have shown potential 13 in achieving lower emissions in Compression Ignition (CI) engines, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) 14 and particulates. A new fuel formulation approach through the use of light fractions within diesel 15 technology could consequently address both questions of energy demand balance and reduction of diesel 16 engines pollution footprint. In this study, a fuel formulation for a Diesel engine is optimized to achieve 17 lower pollutants emissions and higher engine efficiency. The fuel matrix is based on seven refinery 18 streams representative of gasoline (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Gasoline HSRG, Hydrotreated <b>Fluid</b> 19 <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracking</b> HFCC and Reformate REF), kerosene (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Kerosene HSRK 20 and Hydrocracked Kerosene HCKK) and diesel cuts (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Diesel HSRD and 21 Hydrocracked Light Diesel HCKLD). A D-Optimal mixture design is applied to build, a 12 -run, 7 -factor fuelmatrix and the fuels are thoroughly optimized on two engine conditions at light and mid-load representativeof typical vehicle running conditions. The results show a high sensitivity and a good correlation ofthe engine efficiency and pollutants emissions with the volumetric contribution of each refinery streamto the fuel composition. The optimum fuel composition varies across the range of engine operatingpoints. At light load for example, the addition of up to 50 vol% of gasoline streams (HSRG and HFCC) todiesel streams demonstrates a good potential to simultaneously reduce NOx and particulate emission...|$|R
25|$|At that time, just a {{few years}} after the Russian Revolution, Russia was desperate to develop {{industry}} and earn foreign exchange, so their oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American. At about that time however, <b>fluid</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely thermal cracking processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was however not complete; many types of cracking, including pure thermal cracking, still are in use, depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. Thermal cracking remains important however, for example in producing naphtha, gas oil, and coke, and more sophisticated forms of thermal cracking have been developed for various purposes.

2500|$|Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for {{producing}} fuel oil and gasoline, both important [...] "primary energy" [...] sources. 84 {{percent by volume}} of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other fuel oils, and liquefied petroleum gas. The lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and medium oil are depleted, oil refineries are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using <b>fluid</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.|$|E

The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of extracted lipids and the corresponding residues of the microalga was also examined, and the results showed that the lipids could be efficiently converted to light olefins. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of lipids extracted by different solvents demonstrated that neutral lipids gave the highest yield of light olefins at 36. 7 %. The yields of light olefins obtained from <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of the extraction residues were much lower than the yields obtained from lipids, and thus the lipids, especially the neutral lipids, are the primary contributors to the generation of light olefins.
