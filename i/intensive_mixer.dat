40|$|Foam {{concrete}} is modern {{building material}} which combines satisfactory mechanical and heat insulating properties. The developed technology of foam concrete allows obtaining material, which is characterised by {{wide range of}} density, without additional thermal treatment. The aim {{of this research is}} to elaborate foam concrete compositions with the best rate between mechanical strength and volume weight by controlling technological parameters of producing process as well as adding non-metallic fibers and using pozzolanic admixtures, such as silica fume. In the framework of research basic properties of foam concrete, such as water absorption, compressive strength, density, have been investigated for different mix compositions. The obtained properties of foam concrete have been compared with properties of traditionally used autoclaved aerated gas silicate concrete. Experimental results showed that use of <b>intensive</b> <b>mixers</b> makes it possible to achieve stable mix and high performance properties of hardened material. Density of the material ranged from 400 to 1100 kg/m 3 and compressive strength 1 – 10 MPa.

40|$|Blends of starch and zein {{plasticized}} with glycerol {{were prepared}} by melting processing in an <b>intensive</b> batch <b>mixer</b> {{connected to a}} torque rheometer at 160 °C. The resulting mixtures were compression molded and then characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X ray diffraction and water-absorption experiments. The blends were immiscible, showing two distinct phases of starch and zein. The water uptake at equilibrium and its diffusion coefficient were determined. The water uptake at equilibrium decreased with increasing zein content. The diffusion coefficient fell sharply on addition of 20 % zein and remained constant as zein content was increased. No appreciable effect of zein on starch crystallization was observed by X ray diffraction. The use of zein in thermoplastic starch compositions causes {{a decrease in the}} water sensitivity of these materials and lower its melt viscosity during processing making zein a suitable and very promising component in TPS compositions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThermoplastic starch (TPS) was {{modified}} with ascorbic acid and citric acid by melt processing of native starch with glycerol as plasticizer in an <b>intensive</b> batch <b>mixer</b> at 160 °C. It {{was found that}} the molar mass decreases with acid content and processing time causing the reduction in melting temperature (Tm). As observed by the results of X-ray diffraction and DSC measurements, crystallinity was not changed by the reaction with organic acids. Tm depression with falling molar mass was interpreted {{on the basis of the}} effect of concentration of end-chain units, which act as diluents. FTIR did not show any appreciable change in starch chemical compositions, leading to the conclusion that the main changes observed were produced by the variation in molar mass of the material. We demonstrated that it is possible to decrease melt viscosity without the need for more plasticizer thus avoiding side-effects such as an increase in water affinity or relevant changes in the dynamic mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{thermoplastic}} polymers and their blends were melt-processed with high intensity ultrasonic wave in an <b>intensive</b> <b>mixer.</b> For the effective transfer of ultrasonic energy, an experimental apparatus was specially {{designed so that}} polymer melt can directly contact with ultrasonic horn. It was observed that significant vari-ations in the rheological properties of polymers occur due to the unique action of ultrasonic wave without any aid of chemical additives. It was {{also found that the}} direct sonication on immiscible polymer blends in melt state reduces the domain sizes considerably and stabilizes the phase morphology of the blends. The degree of compatibilization was strongly affected by viscosity ratio of the components and the morphology was stable after annealing in properly compatibilized blends. It is suggested that ultrasound assisted melt mixing can lead to in-situ copolymer formation between the components and consequently provide an effec-tive route to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends...|$|E

40|$|Granulated {{foam glass}} is an {{effective}} insulation material based on natural raw and technogenic materials. Its manufacture on the technology of low temperature foaming, excluding premelting of glass {{or the use of}} scrap and waste glass, comprises the steps of drying and grinding of tripoli of Potaninsk deposit (Chelyabinsk region). After that, we should to mix the crushing product with a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution in the <b>intensive</b> <b>mixer</b> granulator for forming of granulated material, its drying at temperature of 200 ºC and foaming at temperature of 830 - 850 ºC. The choice of tripoli as a silica component for insulating filling agents on the technology of low temperature foaming is caused by a high content of active silica in the rock, the constancy of the composition and porous structure. The quality (density, strength and thermal conductivity characteristics) of the developed heat insulating crystalline granulated material is comparable to the best foreign models...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an ultra-high {{performance}} mortar was optimized. The interaction curve of {{two types of}} densified silica fume (white and grey) with cement was determined based on the Marquardt method. It was seen that the white silica fume increased the packing density more than the grey silica fume. Consequently, this enabled us to lower the water-to-binder ratio of the mortar with white silica fume and lead to higher compressive strengths. The highest value attained during this project was 172 MPa. In the second part, the influence of entrapped air on the real packing density was investigated. Therefore, the water-to-binder ratio of a paste and a mortar was incrementally lowered and the amound of fresh air was determined according to EN 12350 - 7. From this data {{the discrepancy between the}} minimum water demand ratio and the void ratio was elucidated. By mixing the same mixtures under a pressure of 50 mbar, both ratios became the same.

Phase separation was observed in some compositions and was dependent on rubber and on plasticiser content (glycerol). Increasing plasticiser content made possible the addition of higher amounts of rubber. the addition of rubber was, however, limited by phase separation the appearance of which depended on the glycerol content.

40|$|Amidos de milho contendo aproximadamente 72 e 100 % de amilopectina foram convertidos em amidos termoplásticos por processamento em um misturador intensivo a 160 ºC, usando glicerol como plastificante. Os amidos termoplásticos foram condicionados em ambiente de 53 ± 2 % u. r. e caracterizados por medidas de absorção de água, difração de raios X, ensaios mecânicos de tração e por análises dinâmico mecânicas (DMA). O amido com menor teor de amilopectina apresentou maior viscosidade durante o processamento, que foi atribuída à estrutura da amilose. Os amidos termoplásticos TPS 1 (72 % de amilopectina) e TPS 2 (100 % de amilopectina) não mostraram diferenças apreciáveis nas propriedades de absorção de água. Após duas semanas de armazenamento, o TPS 1 apresentou estrutura semicristalina, enquanto o TPS 2 apresentou estrutura totalmente amorfa. Após seis semanas ocorreu um aumento da cristalinidade do TPS 1 e ocorreu a formação de estruturas cristalinas no TPS 2. As propriedades mecânicas e dinâmico-mecânicas foram afetadas pela cristalinidade do amido que é função da razão amilose/amilopectina.

The starch with lower amylopectin content presented higher viscosity during the processing which was attributed to linear amylose chains. The thermoplastic starches TPS 1 (72 % of amylopectin) and TPS 2 (100 % of amylopectin) did not display significant differences in water absorption. After two weeks of aging, TPS 1 exhibited semicrystalline structure, whereas TPS 2 presented a amorphous structure. After six weeks, the crystallinity of TPS 1 increased and some crystalline behavior could be detected in TPS 2.

The method is used to study the evolution of the paste during processing in an <b>intensive</b> laboratory scale <b>mixer</b> for three different formulations: a hard-to-mix concrete, a self-compacting mortar and an easy to mix cement paste.

40|$|At the Magnel Laboratory for Concrete Research an <b>intensive</b> vacuum <b>mixer</b> {{which can}} {{regulate}} the air pressure is available. As such {{the amount of}} entrapped air in cementitious materials can be varied. The effect of the reduced air content due to vacuum mixing on the rheology and workability was already investigated in previous work. Furthermore, the previous work investigated the influence of entrained air on the rheological properties. The impact of vacuum mixing on the compressive strength and the microstructure of (ultra) high performance mortar is documented elsewhere. However, the impact of air entrainment on high performance mortar {{has not yet been}} published. Therefore, this paper will focus on the evolution of the pore structure of air-entrained high performance mortar by using mercury intrusion porosimetry, fluorescence microscopy and air void analysis. This data will enable to verify the pore diameters, often used to explain the evolution of the rheology by the ratio of shear stresses and the surface tension. Furthermore it explains the evolution of the density, the compressive strength and the bending tensile strength. The air entrainment was varied between 0 % abd 2. 5 % wt. cement. As a consequence the air content was systematically increased. In case of the air void analyser, the amount of air cavities was increased from 1 % to 14 %. From the cumulative air void fraction it was noticed that pores with a diameter of 80 µm were dominant in the mortar. From data of the mercury intrusion porosimetry the amount of capillary pores was increased from 7. 4 % and 22. 2 %. The critical diameter at lower percentage of air entrainment was 40 nm, a more continuous curve was obtained for the highest percentages. Furthermore, the amount of pores situated between 10 µm and 100 µm were limited or not existing. In conclusion, this paper highlights the underestimation of the lareger air pores by mercury intrusion porosimetry. Besides this, the decrease in compressive strength and bending tensile strength {{can be explained by the}} changes in the pore structure. Finally, it was checked whether the increase in plastic viscosity due to air entrainment was caused by the air bubbles or by the polymer itself...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This Ph. D thesis {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} of menthol-loaded-Poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (NP's) for transdermal application. Polymers are increasingly needed to produce nanoparticles ready to convey drugs to the tissues or cells of interest. Polymer nanoparticles are submicron-sized colloidal systems. Without doubt, the adequacy of these systems relies upon {{the structure of the}} vehicle and, specifically, on the mean size and on the particle size distribution (PSD). The poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) polymer is chosen to synthesize nanoparticles because of its adaptability and fine tunning of its physico-chemical properties (great biocompatibility and biodegradability) which can be changed to acquire the desired nanoparticle size. Nanospheres have a monolithic type of structure (network) in which drugs are dispersed or absorbed on the surfaces or in the particles. Nano-capsules are vesicular systems in which the drug is kept in a cavity comprising of an inner liquid encompassed by a polymeric layer, which gives a supporting structure to the encapsulated material. For this state the active principle is normally dissolved in the inner core, yet may likewise be absorbed to the capsule surface. Nanosphere or nanocapsule development basically relies upon the production process. Nanoparticles utilized as drug delivery systems ought to be made out of biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic polymers. A number of distinctive strategies can be used to integrate polymer nanoparticles. Each has their own particular points of interest and constraints, which normally include blending of two fluid streams, e. g. emulsification-evaporation, emulsification-diffusion and solvent displacement. The solvent displacement strategy is characterized by simplicity of reproducibility, the possibility to utilize solvents with low poisonous potential and above all controlled particle size distribution (PSD). The nano-precipitation system involves dissolving the drug and polymer in the same solvent and afterward blending them with an antisolvent (typically water) in which the drug is immiscible and the nanoparticles are spontaneously framed. In this study, the nanoparticles were produced by utilizing three intensive reactors: a confined impinging jet mixer (CIJM), a two-inlet vortex mixer (VM) and a four-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM), testing their performance in the same operating conditions. Dynamic light scattering was carried out to measure the mean nanoparticle size (dp), particle size distribution (PSD), zeta potential (Z-average) and Polydispersity index (PDI). Nanoparticle separation was carried out by a centrifugation process for Transmission Electron microscope (TEM) analysis and menthol loading evaluation. Menthol quantification was evaluated by Gas chromatography (GC). Differential scanning calorimetry and transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques were considered for analysing the particle surface morphology and menthol and identification in the nanoparticles and melatonin suspension over textile fabrics. Exceptional micro scale reactors are extremely helpful to get an efficient blend of the considerable number of components present in the solvent solution. High super-saturation can be produced by distinctive micromixers, for example, the Confined Impinging Jets Mixer (CIJM) and the Multi Inlet Vortex Mixer (MIVM), in less time than the required time for nucleation and growth procedures of the precipitating solutes. Super saturation brings the unconstrained development of nanoparticles within the nano estimate limits. The nanoparticles were prepared using the aforementioned <b>intensive</b> <b>mixers</b> (CIJM and MIVM), PCL polymer and diverse internal cores (menthol, melatonin, miglyol etc). The main goal was to investigate the effect of these working parameters on the mean size of the nanoparticles, a reasonable design of Experiment (DoE) was utilized. Furthermore, the effect of the inlet feed speed Vj (Flow rate FR), mass proportion and quench volumetric proportion QR (dilution) on the mean size dp, the zeta potential Zp and poly dispersity index (PDI) of the nanoparticles was also explored. At first poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (nanospheres) were produced under different working conditions. The essential goal of this evaluation was to prepare the nanoparticle synthesis with a wide size range of menthol-loaded -PCL. A further aim to advance the synthesis parameters. After early promising results it was evident that further examinations were required keeping in mind the final goal to optimize the mean size of the nanoparticles. Likewise, quantification of nanoparticles was completed with the specific end goal of estimating drug loaded and encapsulation efficiency. Quantification procedure included various stages followed by centrifugation, extraction and gas chromatography analysis. All nanoparticles studied in this proposition were produced by the solvent displacement technique, utilizing three reactors CIJM, MIVM- 4 and VM- 2. All trials were performed with a PCL of monolithic-type molecular weight (Mw) 14000 g/mol. Two unique solvents were utilized for the production of the nanoparticles; acetone and acetonitrile. Since these solvents satisfy the following criteria: adequate dissolvability of PCL, water miscibility and low harmfulness. The impact of solvents on the delivered nanoparticles utilizing acetone and acetonitrile was seen: with higher estimations of the inlet feed rate, the nanoparticles became distinctly smaller. In addition, preliminary trials using a third solvent tehtrahydroforan were also done for the sake of comparsion. The impact of the working conditions on the mean size of nanoparticles was explored the underlying polymer concentration, the inlet feed rate and the impacts of the post preparing conditions, for example, the quench (dilution). It was found that the initial polymer concentration, and in addition the inlet feed velocity, has {{a significant impact on the}} mean size of nanoparticles. With higher feeding concentrations of PCL polymer, nanoparticles became distinctly greater. When feed velocity was expanded the mean size of nanoparticles diminished. It was also observed that NP size was higher for acetonitrile in contrast with acetone solvent at comparable working conditions in all cases. Moreover, dilution of the solution containing nanoparticles (higher the quench) was found indispensible to obtain stable nanoparticles. In addition, by expanding the inlet feed rate, smaller nanoparticles with lower zeta potential, were acquired. Smaller nanoparticles were created in the MIVM regarding the CIJM. Polydispersity index (PDI, 0. 05 ± 0. 3) and zeta potential (- 30 mV to - 40 mV) were observed in all investigated experiments. After nanoparticles were produced, they were quantified. An exact and appropriate measurement of menthol was acquired by a Gas chromatography (GC). Results showed that the incorporation efficiency of menthol in the nanoparticles with expanding menthol content was very nearly 60 % - 80 % in both the CIJM and VM mixers, and this indicates that menthol was adequately exemplified by PCL polymer upon precipitation. Loading was assessed at 35 % - 50 % around, with expanding mass proportion of menthol and PCL, when utilizing both reactors. These results were confirmed through morphologic perceptions of nanoparticles utilizing transmission electronic microscope (TEM) examination. From there on, the work was centered around the synthesis of PCL nanocapsules containing differing internal cores (miglyol, and melatonin). Melatonin nanocapsules were further utilized for the impregnation of cotton fabrics. Furthermore, the synthesis and characterization of the nanocapsules formed by PCL (surface layer) and by melatonin or miglyol (in the core) was investigated. To optimize the nanocapsules production process, the impact of different working conditions was explored i. e. the underlying polymer concentration, the underlying, melatonin or miglyol concentrations and the inlet feed rate, on their mean sizes. Comparative conclusions, were observed for menthol loaded nanoparticles, that is when expanding inlet feed rate the mean size of nanocapsules diminished. Finally, it was also found that when concentrations of all substances was increased larger nanocapsules were shaped...|$|R
