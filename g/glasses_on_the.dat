5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with a strained oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted; as a result, he started wearing <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mound.|$|E
25|$|From the 18th century, English {{lead glass}} became popular {{throughout}} Europe, and was {{ideally suited to}} the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and Frans Greenwood stippled imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century. Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably {{as the result of}} imported English workers. Imitating lead-crystal à la façon d’Angleterre presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces. Towards {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway. By 1800, Irish lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} and cricket writer John Arlott wrote of Fender: [...] "Unmistakable on the field, lanky, bespectacled, curly-haired, slouching along, hands deep in pockets {{and wearing a}} grotesquely long sweater, he was immortalised by cartoonist Tom Webster". This appearance made him a favourite of cartoonists generally, and Fender enjoyed this fame, particularly the cartoons of Webster who drew Fender in a long sweater before he ever wore one; Fender then adopted [...] them to match his image. Similarly, he continued to wear <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field after discovering {{that he did not}} need them.|$|E
500|$|Another stunt {{scene was}} filmed for Episode 6; the charity ball scene was filmed {{over two days}} at a Masonic Lodge and {{concluded}} with a fight between Jenny and Natalie (played by Lorelei King). The shots of Jenny spraying Natalie with a fire extinguisher were limited to two takes because {{it took so long}} to re-apply King's make up. The table that Ripley and King's stunt doubles fall through had its legs weakened, and the <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table were replaced with sugar glass. The Brief Encounter fantasy was filmed at a steam railway near Rochdale. Nigel Cole used the scene as an opportunity to make his mark as a television director. Most of the scene was filmed by Cole and the main crew. Establishing shots were filmed by Langan and the second unit, due to time constraints. The lighting and focus of the fantasy station was intended to be a direct contrast to the harsh modernity of Piccadilly, which appeared in the [...] "real life" [...] scenes.|$|E

[...] "If the widow had any taste, she might surely {{pick up some}} better fellow than that." [...] Here Tom's eye wandered from <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chimney-piece to <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table; and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental, he emptied the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth.|$|R
6000|$|He came, {{and stood}} looking gloomily {{in from the}} doorway. He {{caught sight of the}} {{decanters}} and the <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> library table. [...] "Oh!" [...] he said, and gave a laugh cut in two by a hiccough.|$|E
6000|$|Upon this, the {{landlord}} danced down his <b>glasses,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bar, uncorked his decanters, and deferentially pushed them over toward the sailors, {{as much as}} to say--"Honorable gentlemen, {{it is not for}} me to allowance your liquor;--help yourselves, your honors." ...|$|E
