40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} resistance {{status of}} Culex species to different class of insecticides {{and assess the}} major anti–mosquito strategies employed by urban households and their possible effects on malaria acquisition. MethodsStructured questionnaires were randomly administered to obtain information on demographic characteristics, measures that people use to prevent mosquito bites and their perception of where mosquitoes breed in their communities. Adult susceptibility assays were also carried out using WHO discriminating dosages of four insecticides from different chemical classes against Culex species. ResultsMajority of respondents (54. 75 %) preferred the use of <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticides</b> {{in the form of}} aerosols and coils. Among households that used <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticides,</b> the use of coil was most frequent (62. 9 %) with a mean (95 % CI) of 9. 18 (8. 99, 9. 37) coils per week. Strong level of pyrethroid–resistance and multiple insecticide resistance in Culex species were also detected in some of the study sites. ConclusionsThe excessive use of <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticides</b> and high level of resistance in Culex species observed in the study area has implications for the ITN component of the nation's malaria control program in more subtle ways. People will lose interest in the use of ITN when it fails to protect users from bites of resistant Culex species. Excessive use of <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticides</b> may also select resistance in both malaria vectors and Culex species. On this account we recommend that nuisance mosquitoes must be controlled as part of malaria control programs to improve acceptance and utilization of ITN...|$|R

In one model, using multiple linear regression and a backward stepwise elimination procedure, most of the variation in the overall abundance of T. infestans was explained by insecticide use and the presence of hens nesting indoors; in another model using the same procedure it was explained by insecticide use, bug density in 1988 and previous spraying with deltamethrin in 1985. Variations in bug density per capture stratum (household goods, beds, walls and roof) were explained by the bug density in other strata and by {{one or two of the}} following risk factors: hens nesting indoors, type of roof, presence of cracks in the walls and number of people living in the house.

Our objective was to identify the main ecological and sociodemographic determinants of house infestation and abundance of Triatoma infestans in traditional Qom populations including a Creole minority in Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina. A cross-sectional survey determined house infestation by timed-manual searches with a dislodging aerosol in 386 inhabited houses and administered questionnaires on selected variables before full-coverage insecticide spraying and annual vector surveillance. We fitted generalized linear models to two global models of domestic infestation and bug abundance, and estimated coefficients via multimodel inference with model averaging. Most Qom households were larger and lived in small-sized, recently-built, precarious houses with fewer peridomestic structures, and fewer livestock and poultry than Creoles'. Qom households had lower educational level and unexpectedly high residential mobility. House infestation (31. 9 %) was much lower than expected from lack of recent insecticide spraying campaigns and was spatially aggregated. Nearly half of the infested houses examined had infected vectors. Qom households had higher prevalence of domestic infestation (29. 2 %) than Creoles' (10. 0 %), although there is large uncertainty around the adjusted OR. Factors with high relative importance for domestic infestation and/or bug abundance were refuge availability, distance to the nearest infested house, <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticide</b> use, indoor presence of poultry, residential overcrowding, and household educational level. Our study {{highlights the importance of}} sociodemographic determinants of domestic infestation such as overcrowding, education and proximity to the nearest infested house, and corroborates the role of refuge availability, domestic use of insecticides and household size.

40|$|Abstract-The current {{situation}} concerning cockroach (BhtteNa germanica (L.)) presence and insecticide control {{was investigated in}} high-rise blocks of low-income flats in the French city of Rennes. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the results of professional cockroach insecticide treatments and to try to understand why control success was so low. Treatments were proposed every two months for a year. Cockroach abundance and six general environmental characteristics were recorded after each treatment, for each flat treated. The environmental characteristics recorded for each flat were: nationality of residents, duration of occupation, human density, application of domestic pesticides, reactions of residents to the presence of cockroaches and degree of cleanness. A multivariate analysis stressed the influence of the combination of level of cleanness and human density on cockroach abundance. Our data revealed for the first time that although dirtiness influenced cockroach abundance it did not influence cockroach presence.

METHODS: a secondary base case-control study was conducted with 274 cases of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL±P) and cleft palate only, with 548 controls (1 : 2). The authors analyzed residential proximity to industrial areas, exposure to commercial insecticides, agricultural pesticides, and vector control spraying, as well as various occupational exposures. The results were obtained by conditional regression analysis. RESULTS: proximity to industrial installations as a risk factor (OR = 3, 32; 95 %CI: 2, 18 - 5, 05) for all orofacial clefts, as well as the combined use of household insecticides and urban vector control pesticide spraying (OR = 5, 73; 95 %CI: 2, 51 - 11, 28). A group of maternal occupations heavily associated with orofacial clefts was domestic services (OR = 2, 89; 95 %CI: 1, 76 - 4, 86).

40|$|Pyrethrum is {{the name}} of a {{petroleum}} extract from the flower of the chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. This extract has been used commercially by the industrialised world as an insecticide for more than 150 years and even references as far back as Ming dynasty around year 70 AD have been found. The flower has been grown several places (Dalmatia, Japan, South America) but it has been proven that the content of the active constituents called pyrethrins are at its peak when the flowers are grown in places with 12 h daylight / 12 h (wich means around equator) and between 1700 - 2200 meters above sea level. Kenya with its great highland plains is one of todays major producers of pyrethrum extract. The flowerheads are handpicked by the farmer and the family and sold to the national Kenya Pyrethrum Bureau. The watercontent is reduced from 80 % to 10 % by drying in sunlight or by mechanical means. The first extraction gives a oleo-resin of dark brownish colour. After second extraction one get what is called a pale extract. This is used in for instance <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticide</b> sprays. The pyrethrins of pyrethrum are six closelly related esters (fig. 1). Analysis is performed by HPLC (liquid chromatography) or GC (gas chromatography). All the esters are fatsoluble and can be extracted with the lipids from for instance food objects treated with pyrethrum. WHO/FAO have established the maximum residue values for pyrethrins in different kind of food sold for human consumption. For dried cod who has been sprayed with pyrethrum to keep the flies away, the maximum residue leve 1 of pyrethrins is 3 mg/kg. Pyrethrins are readily broken down if ingested by varmblooded animals by the esterase activity in the stomach/gut. It is also relativly harmless when inhaled. Injected into the blood can the effect be lethal in smaller doses. Pyrethrum have been used as a cure for gastrointestinal parasites and doses up to 50 mg caused no negative effect to the host. There have never in the long history of pyrethrum been reported of death caused by overexposure. Pyrethrum has become interesting today because of the positive results conserning removing of salmon lice on salmon in fishfarming. Salmon lice cost norwegian farmers millions of US$ every year in loss of fish, devaluation of the fish due to wounds and buying of expencive chemicals to remove the lice. The chemicals in use are about to be abandoned because of ill effects to both farmers and environment. Pyrethrum is readily broken down in nature, in fact so fast that an antioxydant must be added. Mixed in water, pyrethrum is lethal to fish, but administered in an oil-layer on top of the cages, the salmon delouse themselves by jumping through this oil-layer. The pyrethrum in the oil selectivly kill the louse because the pyrethrins can pass their outer lipid membrane but the fish who have a water soluble mucus layer, are not affected. NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Pyretrum er navnet på et naturekstrakt fra blomsterhodene på en krysantemumblomst, Chrysantemum cinerariaefolium. Dette ekstraktet er et "gammelt" middel og har blitt brukt som et insekticid i lang tid. Glynne Jones, (1989) har laget et historisk sammendrag som strekker seg over 150 år. Den første kjente eksport fant sted fra Dalmatia (nå ca. Ungarn) til det vestlige Europa i 1820 og i 1825 fantes pyretrum pulver i de fleste apotek i den industrialiserte del av verden. Pyretrums bruk og virkning er veldokumentert på mange forskjellige arter av insekter. Staudinger & Ruzicka (1924) publiserte de første vitenskaplige artiklene omhandlende pyretrum og la grunnlaget for en vitenskaplig vurdering av pyretrum som insekticid. Rundt 1930 ble analysemetoder utviklet og gav en mulighet til å estimere aktiviteten til pyretrumprodukter. "The Association of Official Agricultural Chemists" - (AOAC) har utviklet en analysemetode for bestemmelse av total mengde pyretrum i ekstrakt. De første analysemetodene fant to aktive substanser i pyretrum som ble kalt pyretrin I og pyretrin II. Ved videre-utvikling av kjemiske kunnskaper og analysemetoder har det blitt funnet fire aktive substanser til. Disse seks forbindelsene er estere som refereres til under samlebetegnelsen pyretriner. Alle pyretrinene er fettløselige og dagens analysemetoder går ut på å ekstrahere dem ut sammen med fett og andre fettløselige stoffer. De må så skilles fra fettet og i enkelte tilfeller er det nødvendig med en omgang til med rensing/oppkonsentrering før de kan separeres med hjelp av kromatografiske metoder. I dag er det mest vanlig å benytte HPLC (væske-kromatografi) til den endelige bestemmelsen av mengde pyretriner i en prøve. Hovedprodusenten av pyretrum-ekstrakt er Kenya. De har enkelte år problemer med å holde en stabil produksjon p. g. a. tørke. Dette faktum kombinert med økende priser fikk i midten av 70 -årene amerikanerne til å fremstille syntetiske varianter av pyretrum, kalt pyretroider. Etter en stor tørke i 1976 tok de over mye av markedene i USA og Europa. I de kommersielle blandingene er som regel kun tale om et aktivt stoff. Det har vist seg at insekter kan bygge opp resistens mot disse. De brytes heller ikke så raskt ned som pyretrinene i naturlig pyretrum gjør. Ved avlusning av laks benyttes i dag Nuvan som er en farlig miljøgift, den er også helsefarlig for oppdretteren. Hvis vår arbeidshypotese er riktig; at pyretrum kan gjøre avlusningen med minst samme effektivitet og til konkurrerende pris, vil dette være av betydning av miljøhensyn og ikke minst for oppdretterne som da vil arbeide med et stoff som ikke er farlig for deres egen helse...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphate {{pesticides}} {{have been}} classically described as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in insects and invertebrates. However, {{there is now}} more evidence supporting the hypothesis that these compounds also act through noncholinergic pathways, especially those related to cognitive processes. The enzyme acylpeptide hydrolase {{was identified as a}} new target for organophosphate pesticides. This enzyme is more sensitive than AChE to some organophosphates (OP), including dichlorvos, which is the parent compound for metrifonate, a therapeutic agent used in the treatment of cognitive impairment associated to Alzheimer´s disease. Therefore, there is some doubt as to whether the mechanism of action of this drug is mediated by a potentiation of cholinergic transmission. However, the direct action of acylpeptide hydrolase in cognitive processes and the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying subacute exposure to OP have yet to be demonstrated. This review deals with evidence demonstrating the existence of mechanisms of actions of OP, which are independent of cholinergic pathway potentiation and which have an effect on cognitive processes. In addition, the possible participation of the enzyme acylpeptide hydrolase in these processes is also discussed. Finally, the possibility of using this enzyme activity as a new biomarker for exposure to OP is considered.

40|$|New {{pesticides}} {{based on}} natural products are urgently needed, {{in consideration of}} their environmental care and lower collateral effects. Neem oil, the main product obtained from Azadiractha indica A. Juss, commonly known as neem tree, is mainly used in medical devices, cosmetics and soaps, as well as important insecticide. Manufacturing of neem oil first includes {{the collection of the}} neem seeds as raw material used for the extraction. Neem cake is the waste by-product remaining after extraction processes. The quality of the oil, as that of the cake, strictly depends from the quality of seeds {{as well as from the}} type of extraction processes used, which strongly influences the chemical composition of the product. Currently, the different types of commercial neem cake on the market are roughly identified as oiled and deoiled cake, but several other differences can be detected. The differences are relevant and must be determined, to obtain the necessary correlation between chemical constitution and larvicidal activities. Six different batches of neem cake, marketed by several Indian and European companies, were analyzed by HPLC and HPTLC, and their fingerprints compared, obtaining information about the different compositions, focusing in particular on nortriterpenes, considered as the main active components of neem oil. Therefore, the chemical composition of each cake was connected with the biological activitiy, i. e., the effects of the extracts of the six neem cakes were tested on eggs and larvae of Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta) (Diptera: Culicidae), commonly known as Asian tiger mosquito. The results confirmed the previously reported larvicide effects of neem cake that, however, can now be related to the chemical composition, in particular with nortriterpenes, allowing in that way to discriminate between the quality of the various marketed products, as potential <b>domestic</b> <b>insecticides...</b>|$|R

Studies were conducted in 2010 under laboratory conditions. The results obtained indicate that in soils sprayed and non-sprayed by bioinsecticides the activities of invertase and urease undergo to changes from May to August. Maximal activities in soils were registered in June (25. 641 mg C~ 6 ~H~ 12 ~O~ 6 ~ g^- 1 ^ for invertase and 12. 254 mg NH~ 3 ~ g^- 1 ^ for urease) and minimal &#x 2013; in May (20. 643 mg C~ 6 ~H~ 12 ~O~ 6 ~ g^- 1 ^ for invertase) and in August (9. 297 mg NH~ 3 ~ g^- 1 ^ for urease) at the average for all variants.

40|$|Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. Occupational {{exposure}} to organophosphorus insecticides (OPs), such as chlorpyrifos, may be {{monitored by the}} measurement of the activity of peripheral cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes, including erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (EAChE) and serum cholinesterase (SChE). Lymphocyte neuropathy target esterase (NTE) {{is thought to have}} potential as a predictor of organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). This paper describes work performed in 39 Australian pest control operators (PCOs) exposed to a termiticide containing chlorpyrifos, and 34 unexposed control subjects. EAChE activities in PCOs did not differ from those of unexposed control workers. Mean NTE activity was slightly higher in PCOs than in controls and mean SChE was 52 % of control activity. These results indicate that exposure of Australian PCOs to termiticides containing chlorpyrifos may be monitored using SChE but not EAChE or NTE, and that workers in this industry have sufficiently high OP {{exposure to}} significantly depress SChE activity. SChE inhibition of 70 – 80 % may be associated with symptoms. Although no current symptoms were reported to be associated with occupational OP exposure, these workers may be at increased risk of acute effects following inadvertent spills or self-contamination due to their background level of exposure to OPs. While it is preferable to compare ChE enzyme activities between pre- and post-exposure periods to evaluate OP-related effects in individuals, in some cases there is an absence of pre-exposure data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that a screening value for SChE of 550 nmol/min/ml in a single blood sample may be useful to identify potentially OP-exposed individuals in the Australian population. Australian control subjects were similar with respect to EAChE, but displayed activities of NTE and SChE ≈ 50 and 23 % lower than an unexposed UK reference group. While these comparisons are presently speculative, they suggest that there may be differences in SChE and NTE activities in control populations of the two countries. The routine treatment of Australian homes with termiticides containing OPs, or differences in the availability and use of <b>domestic</b> OP-containing <b>insecticides</b> may explain these population differences. Further work is required to examine whether these differences are real, and if so their likely cause. S. M. Dyer, M. Cattani, D. L. Pisaniello, F. M. Williams and J. W. Edwards[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Background: Thanks to a {{considerable}} increase in funding, malaria control interventions (MCI) whose efficacy had been demonstrated by controlled trials have been largely scaled up during the last decade. Nevertheless, it was not systematically investigated whether this efficacy had been preserved once deployed on the field. Therefore, we sought the literature to assess the disparities between efficacy and effectiveness and the effort to measure the protective effectiveness (PE) of MCI. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for references with keywords related to malaria, to control interventions for prevention and to study designs that allow for {{the measure of the}} PE against parasitemia or against clinical outcomes. Results: Our search retrieved 1423 references, and 162 articles were included in the review. Publications were scarce before the year 2000 but dramatically increased afterwards. Bed nets was the MCI most studied (82. 1 %). The study design most used was a cross-sectional study (65. 4 %). Two thirds (67. 3 %) were conducted at the district level or below, and the majority (56. 8 %) included only children even if the MCI didn’t target only children. Not all studies demonstrated a significant PE from exposure to MCI: 60. 6 % of studies evaluating bed nets, 50. 0 % of those evaluating indoor residual spraying, and 4 / 8 showed an added PE of using both interventions as compared with one only; this proportion was 62. 5 % for intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women, and 20. 0 % for <b>domestic</b> use of <b>insecticides.</b> Conclusions: This review identified numerous local findings of low, non-significant PE –or even the absence of a protective effect provided by these MCIs. The identification of such failures in the effectiveness of MCIs advocates for the investigation of the causes of the problem found. Ideal evaluations of the PE of MCIs should incorporate both a large representativeness and an evaluation of the PE stratified by subpopulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to provide initial estimates {{of the relationship between}} insecticide use on passenger aircraft and exposure levels present in the cabin environment. The work was initially divided into three tasks including 1) a review of insecticide application practices in commercial aircraft, 2) exploratory measurements of insecticide concentrations in treated aircraft and 3) screening level exposure modeling. Task 1 gathered information that is needed to assess the time-concentration history of insecticides in the airline cabin. The literature review focused on application practices, information about the cabin environment and existing measurements of exposure concentrations following treatment. Information from the airlines was not available for estimating insecticide application rates in the U. S. domestic fleet or for understanding how frequently equipment rotate into <b>domestic</b> routes following <b>insecticide</b> treatment. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends several methods for treating aircraft with insecticide. Although there is evidence that these WHO guidelines may not always be followed, and that practices vary by airline, destination, and/or applicator company, the guidelines in combination with information related to other indoor environments provides a plausible basis for estimating insecticide loading rates on aircraft. The review also found that while measurements of exposure concentrations following simulated aerosol applications are available, measurements following residual treatment of aircraft or applications in domestic aircraft are lacking. Task 2 focused on developing an approach to monitor exposure concentrations in aircraft using a combination of active and passive sampling methods. An existing active sampling approach was intended to provide data immediately following treatment while a passive sampler was developed to provide wider coverage of the fleet over longer sampling periods. The passive sampler, based on a thin-film polymer-coated glass design, was developed specifically for deployment in the airliner ventilation system for long-term unattended monitoring of insecticide loading in the aircraft. Because access was not available for either treated aircraft or treatment records {{during the course of this}} study, the development and calibration of the passive samplers was halted prior to completion. Continued development of a field ready passive sampler for insecticides in aircraft would require collaboration with the airline industry to finalize the method for deployment and calibration conditions for the sampler. The Task 3 screening level modeling assessment used a dynamic two-box mass balance model that includes treated surfaces and air to explore the time-concentration history of insecticides in the cabin. The model was parameterized using information gathered during the literature review and run for several different insecticide use scenarios. Chemical degradation or sequestration in the surface compartment and mass transfer from the surface to the air limit the rate at which insecticides are removed from the system. This rate limiting process can result in an accumulation of insecticide in the airliner cabin following repeated applications. The extent of accumulation is a function of the overall persistence of the chemical in the system and the amount of chemical applied during each treatment...|$|R
