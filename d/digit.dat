5|$|None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle <b>digit</b> would converge towards the first <b>digit,</b> while the third <b>digit</b> would twist inwards. The first <b>digit</b> of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{comparison}} between the performance of Latin and Arabic handwritten <b>digits</b> recognition problems is presented. The performance of ten different classifiers is tested on two similar Arabic and Latin handwritten <b>digits</b> databases. The analysis shows that Arabic handwritten <b>digits</b> recognition problem is easier than that of Latin <b>digits.</b> This is because the interclass difference in case of Latin <b>digits</b> is smaller than in Arabic <b>digits</b> and variances in writing Latin <b>digits</b> are larger. Consequently, weaker yet fast classifiers are expected to play more prominent role in Arabic handwritten <b>digits</b> recognition.

5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The third <b>digit</b> of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This <b>digit</b> was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. As in most coelurosaurs, the second <b>digit</b> of the hand is the largest, even when the third <b>digit</b> is not present.|$|E

5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (<b>digit</b> bones) beginning with the innermost <b>digit,</b> is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first <b>digit</b> was not larger than {{than that of the}} second <b>digit,</b> as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E

While Tanystropheus is likely also neotenic, it does not approach Dinocephalosaurus in the extremity of this condition. Several other peculiar traits {{are present in the}} feet of Dinocephalosaurus. Unlike Tanystropheus and most other protorosaurs, the fifth metatarsal of Dinocephalosaurus is simple and straight instead of hooked. Tanystropheus merely has a fifth metatarsal which is mildly thickened at the top end, and it additionally possesses a long phalanx on the fifth <b>digit</b> that acts not unlike another metatarsal. On the third <b>digit</b> of the foot, there are four phalanges but none of them appear to be the terminal claw, which suggests that Dinocephalosaurus had a higher-than-average count of at least five phalanges in the third <b>digit.</b>|$|E
