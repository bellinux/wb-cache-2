[...] Rav Nahman objected to Rabbi Hanina's interpretation, noting that Moses did not say that he would always <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers,</b> but merely that he would rule if he knew the answer or seek instruction if he did not.

60|$|Though {{the heat}} was intense and the glare from the white dam dazzling, Dick found work {{something}} of a relief. It was his habit to fix his mind upon the task {{in which he was}} engaged; but of late his thoughts had been occupied by Clare and conjectures about the Adexe coaling station and the strange black-funnel boat. The delay in the French liner's arrival had made the matter look more urgent, but he had now an excuse for putting off its consideration. His duty to his employer came first.

Why had not that fool Fortunio asked him, so that Garnache might have overheard his answer? Was he from Paris and the Queen, or was he, perchance, from Italy and Florimond? These were questions to which it imported him to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> He must know what letters the fellow brought.

Because of troubles between the tribes themselves and between the colonists and the tribes, some saw the praying towns as a refuge from war. Other tribes had been all but destroyed from disease and famine and possibly looked to Christianity and the Puritan way of life as an answer to their suffering, when their traditional beliefs did not seem to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> Many Natives joined the towns simply because they had no other option economically or politically.|$|E
