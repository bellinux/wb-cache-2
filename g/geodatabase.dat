25|$|ArcGIS for Desktop Standard, {{formerly}} known as ArcEditor, is the midlevel software suite designed for advanced editing of spatial data published in the proprietary Esri format. It provides tools {{for the creation of}} map and spatial data used in GIS, including the ability of editing <b>geodatabase</b> files and data, multiuser <b>geodatabase</b> editing, versioning, raster data editing and vectorization, advanced vector data editing, managing coverages, coordinate geometry (COGO), and editing geometric networks. ArcEditor is not intended for advanced spatial analysis.|$|E
2500|$|ArcGIS {{is built}} around a <b>geo{{database}},</b> which uses an object-relational database approach for storing spatial data. [...] A <b>geodatabase</b> is a [...] "container" [...] for holding datasets, tying together the spatial features with attributes. [...] The <b>geodatabase</b> can also contain topology information, and can model behavior of features, such as road intersections, with rules on how features relate to one another. [...] When working with geodatabases, {{it is important to}} understand feature classes which are a set of features, represented with points, lines, or polygons. [...] With shapefiles, each file can only handle one type of feature. [...] A <b>geodatabase</b> can store multiple feature classes or type of features within one file.|$|E
2500|$|Geodatabases in ArcGIS can {{be stored}} in three {{different}} ways – as a [...] "file geodatabase", a [...] "personal geodatabase", or an [...] "ArcSDE geodatabase". [...] Introduced at 9.2, the file <b>geodatabase</b> stores information in a folder named with a [...]gdb extension. The insides look similar to that of a coverage but is not, in fact, a coverage. Similar to the personal <b>geodatabase,</b> the file <b>geodatabase</b> only supports a single editor. However, unlike the personal <b>geodatabase,</b> there is virtually no size limit. By default, any single table cannot exceed 1TB, but this can be changed. [...] Personal geodatabases store data in Microsoft Access files, using a BLOB field to store the geometry data. [...] The OGR library is able to handle this file type, to convert it to other file formats. [...] Database administration tasks for personal geodatabases, such as managing users and creating backups, can be done through ArcCatalog. [...] Personal geodatabases, which are based on Microsoft Access, run only on Microsoft Windows and have a 2 gigabyte size limit. [...] Enterprise (multi-user) level geodatabases are handled using ArcSDE, which interfaces with high-end DBMS such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2 and Informix to handle database management aspects, while ArcGIS deals with spatial data management. [...] Enterprise level geodatabases support database replication, versioning and transaction management, and are cross-platform compatible, able to run on Linux, Windows, and Solaris.|$|E
50|$|ArcGIS Server is {{also used}} to manage {{multiuser}} <b>geodatabases.</b> Multiuser <b>geodatabases</b> leverage ArcSDE technology, implemented on a relational database management system (RDBMS). ArcGIS Server Enterprise supports IBM DB2, IBM Informix Dynamic Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. ArcGIS Server Workgroup supports Microsoft SQL Server Express R1 and R2.|$|R
5000|$|Esri has {{a number}} of both single-user and {{multiuser}} <b>geodatabases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The shapefile format {{does not}} have the ability to store topological information. The ESRI ArcInfo coverages and personal/file/enterprise <b>geodatabases</b> do have the ability to store feature topology.|$|R
2500|$|One major {{difference}} is the programming (scripting) languages available to customize or extend the software to suit particular user needs. [...] In the transition to ArcGIS, Esri dropped support of its application-specific scripting languages, Avenue and the ARC Macro Language (AML), in favour of Visual Basic for Applications scripting and open access to ArcGIS components using the Microsoft COM standards. ArcGIS is designed to store data in a proprietary RDBMS format, known as <b>geodatabase.</b> [...] ArcGIS 8.x introduced other new features, including on-the-fly map projections, and annotation in the database.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design concepts {{and development of}} an interface (Pre- Pro 2004) utilizing <b>geodatabases</b> for the Hydrologic Modeling System (HMS) of the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC). HMS is a rainfall-runoff model which supports lumped-parameter as well as distributed-parameter based modeling. PrePro 2004 uses the spatial-analysis as well as data handling capabilities of ArcGIS. The spatial data are processed to create input files for HMS. These input files and the output from HMS are stored in two <b>geodatabases</b> which were developed using data model concepts. The tools are provided to reproduce an HMS model from the data inside these <b>geodatabases.</b> The interface is developed based on the DataCentric approach which brings different hydrologic and hydraulic models together. This approach aims to attain a long-term goal of utilizing the same data for different hydrologic or hydraulic models with additional model specific requirements. Two case studies are presented to show the applications of the tools developed. The first case study details the creation of HMS input files for Salado Creek watershed with Digital Elevation Model as input. It includes the importation of an existing HMS model for Salado Creek watershed as Appendix C. The second case study details the creation of HMS input files for the Bull Creek watershed, with land use and soil type data as inputs. It describes the capabilities of tools developed in detail...|$|R

50|$|A spatial query is {{a special}} type of {{database}} query supported by <b>geodatabases</b> and spatial databases. The queries differ from non-spatial SQL queries in several important ways. Two {{of the most important}} are that they allow for the use of geometry data types such as points, lines and polygons and that these queries consider the spatial relationship between these geometries.|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the marine environment {{plays an important role}} in the understanding of the dynamics affecting the transport, fate and persistence (TFP) of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). This work is part of a project funded by the Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca. The aim of the project is the assessment of the TFP of POPs in the Mediterranean sea. The analysis will be carried out at regionalmesoscale (central Mediterranean), and at local spatial scale considering different Italian test sites (the Delta of the Po River, the Venice Lagoon and the estuary of the Rio Nocella). The first step of this work involves the implementation of GIS <b>geodatabases</b> for the definition of the input dataset. The <b>geodatabases</b> were populated with MERIS and MODIS level 2 and level 3 products of Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient (DAC), Particulate Inorganic Carbon (PIC), Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The spatial scale (central Mediterranean sea) and the reference system (Plate Carrée projection) have been imposed as a constraint for the <b>geodatabases.</b> Four <b>geodatabases</b> have been implemented, two for MODIS and two for MERIS products with a monthly, seasonal and climatological temporal scale (2002 - 2013). Here, we present a first application of a methodology aimed to identify vulnerable areas to POPs accumulation and persistence. The methodology allowed to assess the spatial distribution of the CHL-a in the central Mediterranean sea. The chlorophyll concentration is related to the amount of nutrients in the water and therefore provides an indicator of the potential presence of POPs. A pilot area of 300 x 200 km located in the North Adriatic sea has been initially considered. The seasonal and climatological MODIS and MERIS CHL-a variability were retrieved and compared with in-situ forcing parameters, i. e. Po River discharge rates and wind data. Study outlooks include a better accuracy of the distribution of the vulnerable areas achieved through the use of additional parameters (CDOM, SST, POC), and an assessment of the contribution of the contaminants by atmospheric dry deposition to the marine environment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|The post-industrial {{landscape}} (PIL) is {{a generally}} accepted {{phenomenon of the}} present world. Its features are fossil in comparison to those ones in operating industrial landscapes. The required knowledge about the position, size, shape and type of PIL will help decision makers plan PIL future. The paper deals with the selection of identification features of PILs. Applicable data must be related to four landscape structures: natural, economic (land use), social (human) and spiritual. Present Czech <b>geodatabases</b> contain sufficient {{quantity and quality of}} data they can be interpreted as source of PIL identification criteria. GIS technology was applied for such data collection, geometric and format pre-processing, thematic reclassification and final processing. Using selected identification and classification criteria, 105 PILs were identified on the Territory of Czech Republic and classified into individual types. A SWOT analysis of results was carried out to identify the reliability level of data and the data processing. The identified PILs represent the primary results generally obtained in the Czech Republic.
