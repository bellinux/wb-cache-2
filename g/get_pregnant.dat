5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|Most {{treatments}} used in HHT {{have been}} described in adults, and the experience in treating children is more limited. Women with HHT who <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> are at {{an increased risk of}} complications, and are observed closely, although the absolute risk is still low (1%).|$|E

50|$|And as {{mentioned}} before, Larry kills Lovey and Calhoon's pet Koi out of anger - Crystal <b>gets</b> <b>pregnant</b> {{and her mother}} takes her to Japan to abort the baby.

5|$|Ben and Abi {{continue}} their relationship, but Ben is still secretly seeing Paul. Babe Smith (Annette Badland) offers Abi {{work in the}} pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that {{she is able to}} {{turn a blind eye to}} Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him out of the room and confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not <b>get</b> <b>pregnant.</b> She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E
5|$|Caspar Bartholin, a 17th-century Danish anatomist, {{dismissed}} Colombo's and Falloppio's {{claims that}} they discovered the clitoris, {{arguing that the}} clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the second century. Although 17th-century midwives recommended {{to men and women}} that women should aspire to achieve orgasms to help them <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, notably in the work of Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E

She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less proud to serve under him.|$|E
5|$|Peter buys The Rovers Return from Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard). After {{another round}} of IVF fails, Toyah is told that future {{treatment}} is not recommended as problems with her uterus mean she is very unlikely to ever <b>get</b> <b>pregnant.</b> She and Peter look into surrogacy after talking to Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston). She and Peter are accepted as clients by a surrogacy agency and Jackie, a surrogate mother, agrees to carry their baby after meeting them.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{is rooted in}} gender inequality, attempts to control women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who {{see it as a}} source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion. Health effects depend on the procedure. They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to <b>get</b> <b>pregnant,</b> complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.|$|E

5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> at least once. Although female {{fertility}} is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|Following Connor {{receiving}} Delia's corneas, Chloe {{began to}} become more attached to him. Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby scrapbook. While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and {{goes so far as}} blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment. Wanting outpatient treatment, she has to be placed under a conservatorship, and not wanting it to be under Esther, Kevin proposes to her and they abruptly marry again. Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a restraining order against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her and tears up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated when he was trying to <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility. Kevin also accepted that he can't give Chloe the help she needs and Chloe accepts that she needs help. She chooses a facility in California, the night before leaving, she and Kevin make love one last time. She leaves town soon after, having had heartfelt goodbyes with her friends and family. However, she reveals that she still has Billy's sperm in her bag before leaving town. Soon after, Kevin sends her flowers, but she refuses them, and asks that Kevin not visit her, devastating him.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms can vary. Some {{patients}} have lower often recurring abdominal pain or pelvic pain, while {{others may be}} asymptomatic.

25|$|Allowing {{women to}} <b>get</b> <b>pregnant</b> past the natural time can factor into issues of overpopulation.
