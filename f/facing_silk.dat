Like The Band Wagon, Daddy Long Legs did only moderately well at the box office.|$|R
500|$|Robbie Daw of Idolator {{appreciated}} the plot twist of the video, commenting, [...] "We really expected Nicki to waste that other warrior-in-training hater. The {{fact that she}} dies—and does so in such a beautiful way here—kind of makes us love her all the more." [...] Daw also inferred that the fancy attire from the [...] "No More I Love You's" [...] video inspired Minaj's in the [...] "Your Love" [...] video. Nicole Sia of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the video resembles Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in its fight scene. Sia also commented on Minaj's appearance stating [...] "the camera cuts to Ms. Young Money soloing in front of billowing one-million-thread-count satin sheets, just to remind us how damn FINE she is." [...] Tray Hova of Vibe gave {{a list of the}} best and worst parts of the music video, stating the best were Minaj chopped through the blocks of cement, her crazy <b>faces,</b> <b>silk</b> sheets and headgear, and that the worst part was the [...] "melodramatic ending" [...] and [...] "the return of those Freddy Krueger fingers." ...|$|R

60|$|The porter {{stared at}} him. John's evening clothes were spattered with mud, the rain-drops were glistening {{on his coat}} and <b>face,</b> his new <b>silk</b> hat was ruined.

60|$|Aaron {{dropped his}} heavy bag, with relief, and stood there, hat in hand, in his damp {{overcoat}} {{in the circle}} of light, looking vaguely at the yellow marble pillars, the gilded arches above, the shadowy distances and the great stairs. The butler disappeared--reappeared in another moment--and through an open doorway came the host. Sir William was a small, clean old man with a thin, white beard and a courtly deportment, wearing a black velvet dinner jacket <b>faced</b> with purple <b>silk.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, on many {{recently}} made coats and jackets, the lapel is made without the loop required, which would normally {{sit on the}} reverse of the lapel, beneath the buttonhole. Sometimes, the lapel buttonhole is in the [...] "keyhole" [...] shape, {{as opposed to the}} traditional straight cut, or is not even pierced through, in which case the boutonnière may be pinned onto the jacket lapel, although this may be considered unsightly and continued pinning could eventually damage the cloth or <b>silk</b> <b>facing.</b>|$|R

We would both fain have been excused from going but we feared that our refusal might give undue offence, and so hinder {{the success of our}} mission. My homespun garments ware somewhat rough for such an occasion, yet I determined to appear in them, {{with the addition of a}} new black baize waistcoat <b>faced</b> with <b>silk,</b> and a good periwig, for which I gave three pounds ten shillings in the Haymarket.' ...|$|R
40|$|Survey of 115 silk workers near Guwahati (Assam) {{for their}} {{dermatologic}} problems revealed important differences from the problem <b>faced</b> by the <b>silk</b> workers in Bangalore (Karnataka). Prevalence {{of the two}} major dermatoses, maceratin and pitted keratolysis occurring in 51. 8 % and 37. 5 % of the workers at Bangalore, was seen in only 2. 6 % and 6. 1 % of the Assam workers.

50|$|Roy Carson was a British hard-boiled detective {{created in}} 1948 by Denis McLoughlin {{and his brother}} Colin and first {{published}} by Boardman Books in their series of rotogravure comic books (1948-1954). Roy, with his plucky girl companion <b>Silk,</b> <b>faced</b> all manner of underworld adventures with an odd combination of American and British elements. Boardman Books also used Roy Carson in text stories published in their children's annuals in the 1950s. In the late-1950s and early 1960s, Roy Carson stories were reprinted {{in a number of}} British albums and annuals. In 1999, the comic fanzine Best of British #1 reprinted Roy Carson and the Old Master, originally published in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Doctoral degree {{graduates}} {{have significant}} variations, {{depending on the}} field or reason that the degree is awarded. Doctors of Philosophy wear the black gown, with 10 cm red <b>silk</b> <b>facing</b> on either side and within the sleeves, a black hood with red edging, and a black velvet Tudor bonnet with red braiding. Other doctorate graduates wear a red gown, with {{the inside of the}} sleeves lined in white, and a red Cambridge hood with white silk edging, along with the black Tudor bonnet with matching braiding. Doctors of the University essentially receive the inverse of the Ph.D. attire, wearing a red gown, with black facing and sleeve lining, but still with a black Tudor bonnet with red braiding.|$|R
5000|$|Seven {{years later}} during the [...] "Original Sin" [...] storyline, Spider-Man {{is exposed to}} the {{energies}} of the Watcher’s eye. He receives {{a vision of the}} radioactive spider that bit him also biting Cindy Moon, and learns what happened to her afterwards. Spider-Man immediately goes on to search for Cindy to break her out of the facility Ezekiel had kept her. After freeing Cindy, she attacks Spider-Man in a fit of rage saying that he has doomed them all. Spider-Man calms Cindy down by telling her that Morlun is dead. Cindy makes her way out of the facility to finally see the city of New York, stopping only to make a costume out of her webbing. She tells Spider-Man to refer to her as Silk. Silk is heartbroken to find that her family has moved. Silk and Peter also find that they are powerfully attracted to each other due to their shared Spider-Sense. Silk finds out that Morlun might be still alive, which causes her to attack Peter. However, their attraction to each other leads to sex. Peter stops as soon as Cindy begins to remove his mask, after which they move back to Peter and Anna Maria’s apartment. Afterwards, Peter and Cindy go to the Fact Channel’s news station where they are attacked by Black Cat and Electro. While Silk is easily able to dodge Electro’s lightning bolts thanks to her “hyper-spider-speed and senses,” Spider-Man isn’t as lucky. Black Cat then goes after the paralyzed superhero and begins to unmask him in front of live TV. Thankfully, J. Jonah Jameson hogged up too much space in front of the camera, preventing the camera (and anyone else) from seeing Peter’s <b>face.</b> <b>Silk</b> quickly spins a temporary mask for Peter and escapes with him back into Peter and Anna Maria’s apartment. At the waterfront where Parker Industries will be holding the demonstration for their new device meant to cure Electro, Cindy spins Peter some Electro-insulated webbing to prevent what happened during their last fight with Electro from happening again. When the fight begins, Black Cat sabotages the machine which causes Electro to go out of control and hit a helicopter. Silk hurries and begins spinning porous webs to catch the crashing helicopter. She then creates an insulated web-pod to contain the inevitable explosion of energy coming from Electro. The entire incident ends with a depowered Electro and a missing Black Cat. Afterwards, Cindy gets accepted for a job at the Fact Channel where she intends to use the information center in order to find her family.|$|R
60|$|Vast in {{bulk and}} stature, {{with a long}} white face, which, broadened at the base by a big double chin, {{appeared}} egg-shaped in the fringe of thin greyish whisker, the great personage seemed an expanding man. Unfortunate from a tailoring point of view, the cross-folds {{in the middle of}} a buttoned black coat added to the impression, as if the fastenings of the garment were tried to the utmost. From the head, set upward on a thick neck, the eyes, with puffy lower lids, stared with a haughty droop on each side of a hooked aggressive nose, nobly salient in the vast pale circumference of the <b>face.</b> A shiny <b>silk</b> hat and a pair of worn gloves lying ready on the end of a long table looked expanded too, enormous.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with most}} Bailey Colleges, St Chad's {{students}} wear their college gowns to formal hall, matriculation, college congregations and other academic or formal events. The college gown {{is similar to}} others in Durham, {{with the addition of}} green cord across the edge of the vented sleeves (in practice most undergraduates' gowns do not have this feature). St Chad's also has retained its own distinctive academic hood (of black stuff with green lining and trim): previously designed for pre-1970s ordinands, the hood is today worn by graduates of the North East Institute for Theological Education and by honorary fellows. The rector has a distinctive robe (a full-sleeved gown of black corded <b>silk,</b> <b>faced</b> with silver-trimmed palatinate purple, and with sleeves lined with palatinate purple); college officers generally wear the academic regalia associated with their highest degrees.|$|R
