40|$|The global <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> (H) is an {{important}} quantity in research of global geophysics, geodynamics and astronomy. It relates with the luni-solar precession, nutation(18. 6 yr terms), tilt-over mode and so on. From observations, the value of H is about 1 / 305. 5 with very high accuracy. But the calculated value of H from PREM model is about 1 / 308. 8 at the first order accuracy. There is about 1 % difference between them, which is an interesting question and attracted many researches since 1980 s. But, there is not any certain conclusion about it till now. At first, we recalculate the geometrical flattening (f) profile, which is rotating symmetric,from PREM Earth model from potential theory in hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE). Higher accuracy and more pivotal points are adopted in this work, and we get finer flattening profile than before. By using of the finer flattening profile, we get the <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> of PREM (H_PREM), {{which is a little}} closer to the observed value than before. But the change is so little that no matter how many points and how high the accuracy we adopt, the 1 % difference can not be interpretted. In order to study this 1 % difference, we replace the homogenous uppest crust and ocean layers in PREM with some real surface layers model. According to the depth range of each model, we construct three Earth models as following:...|$|E

This paper reviews the reduction of Mariner 9 data to more accurately define the dynamical characteristics of the Martian system. Primary results include the discovery of triaxiality of Martian gravity field and physical shape of Mars, and the verification of the discrepancy in optical and <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening.</b> The impact of the Mariner 9 results on future space missions is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of control of a spacecraft in a 24. 6 hour synchronous orbit about Mars...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an improved model of Martian global topography {{which has been}} obtained by fitting a sixteenth-degree harmonic series to occultation, radar, spectral, and photogrammetric measurements. Empirical elevation data based on photographic data are used to supplement the observations in areas without data. Values for the mean radius, the mean density, and the displacement {{of the center of}} the figure from the center of mass are presented. The reported geometric flattening is too great and the reported <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> is too small for Mars to be homogeneous and hydrostatic. Maps of the data distribution, global topography, and Bouguer gravity anomaly are interpreted in terms of a crustal thickness map which is consistent with gravity, topography, and recent preliminary Viking seismic results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} acousto-optic {{interaction}} induced by an acoustic flexural wave among the optical propagation modes supported by tapered optical fibres. We {{have investigated the}} evolution of the acousto-optic resonance condition as the fibre is progressively tapered, showing that the taper radius can be regarded as a new degree of freedom in the design of acousto-optic filters. Finally, we demonstrate a novel acousto-optic filter based on nonuniform tapers for <b>dynamic</b> gain <b>flattening</b> of optical fibre amplifiers...|$|R

Depending on the boundary conditions and external modulation, we show {{control of the}} local <b>dynamic</b> morphology, including <b>flattening</b> and stable rippling patterns. In addition to studying the dynamic response of atomically thin layers to external time-varying excitation, our results open intriguing possibilities for modulating their properties via local dynamic morphology control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{recently}} developed acoustic multiple transducer array was utilized to measure small-scale bed {{forms in the}} nearshore and inner shelf regions at Duck, North Carolina. Two populations of wave-formed ripples were observed: short wave ripples (SWR) with heights ranging from 3 mm to 2 cm and lengths ranging from 4 to 25 cm and long wave ripples (LWR) with heights ranging from 3 mm to 6 cm and lengths ranging from 35 to 200 cm. The SWR were only present sometimes, and their presence or absence was determined by a critical value of the near-bed mobility number. The SWR were highly <b>dynamic,</b> sometimes <b>flattening</b> during wave groups and reforming over several incident wave periods. The LWR, in contrast, were almost always present. They were longer and lower relief than predicted by models or generally observed previously. Both SWR and LWR were often observed to migrate shoreward but were rarely observed to migrate seaward. The dimensions of the SWR, when they were present, were predictable by the Nielsen [1981] model or the Wiberg and Harris [1994] model to within approximately a factor of 2. 1...|$|R
40|$|Results {{of testing}} the {{effectiveness}} of the theory of precessional dynamos in the generation of the magnetic fields of the planets are presented. It is shown that the magnetic state of Earth and of the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Venus can be satisfactorily described by the formula H(i) = H(3) V(i) /V(3) T(3) /T(i) omega(i) /omega(3) sin(alpha 1) /sin(alpha 2) where H, V, T, omega and alpha are the dipole fields, volumes of liquid cores, periods of rotation, rates of precession, and angles between precession vector and angular rotation, respectively, for the planets and earth. The v(i) corresponds to known models of the internal structure. It is shown that the magnetic state of Mercury satisfies this formula if the <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> of the planet f =. 000057 -. 000083...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} and large deviation of the gravitational equipotential surface (EPS) of Mars from a spheroid of revolution suggests {{a description of}} Mars {{in terms of a}} spheroid nearly in isostatic equilibrium with an extra mass in the Tharsis region. The displacement from Mars and the shape of the spheroid are calculated by using this description and a Mars gravity model. The EPS is represented as a contour map of its height above the spheroid. This representation provides the first clear demonstration that the Hellas depression coincides with a depression in the EPS. The disequilibrium contribution of Tharsis to the coefficient J 2 of the second-degree harmonics of gravitational potential of Mars is estimated to be (126 + or - 5) times 10 to the minus 6 th. The optical flattening and <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> calculated on this basis are in substantially better agreement than are those calculated in the usual way...|$|E
40|$|Topographic contour maps of Mars are {{compiled}} by synthesizing data acquired from various scientific experiments of the Mariner 9 mission, including S-band radio occultation, the UV spectrometer, the IR radiometer, the IR interferometer spectrometer, and television imagery, {{as well as}} earth-based radar information. The entire planet is mapped at scales of 1 : 25, 000, 000 and 1 : 5, 000, 000 using Mercator, Lambert, and polar stereographic map projections. For the computation of map projections, a biaxial spheroid figure is adopted. The semimajor and semiminor axes are 3393. 4 and 3375. 7 km, respectively, with a polar flattening of 0. 0052. For the computation of elevations, a topographic datum is defined by a gravity field {{described in terms of}} spherical harmonics of fourth order and fourth degree combined with a 6. 1 -mbar occultation pressure surface. This areoid can be approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid with semimajor axes of A = 3394. 6 km and B = 3393. 3 km and a semiminor axis of C = 3376. 3 km. The semimajor axis A intersects the Martian surface at longitude 105 deg W. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> of Mars is 0. 00525. The contour interval of the maps is 1 km. For some prominent features where overlapping pictures from Mariner 9 are available, local contour maps at relatively larger scales were also {{compiled by}} photogrammetric methods on stereo plotters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn turbomachines, dry {{friction}} devices (under platform dampers, shrouds, and tie-wire) are usually introduced to reduce resonant responses of bladed disks. Dry friction between rubbing elements induces a highly nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> behaviour which <b>flattens</b> the frequency response functions. It {{is clear that}} such behaviour requires an optimisation process to find the optimum parameters {{that lead to the}} minimum forced response amplitudes. However, different interpretations still remain concerning the explanation of the physical origin of this type of flattening. The most common one is based on dissipated energy. In this case, heat resulting from the relative frictional motion between contacting surfaces is supposed to bring sufficient dissipation to flatten response functions. On the other hand, a different approach considers that a decrease in vibrational amplitudes is explained by changes in boundary conditions induced by a stick/slip behaviour. In this study, a single degree-of-freedom system is used and analysed both in time and in frequency domains (Harmonic Balance Method) in order to show the contribution of respectively energy dissipation and change of contact state on peak levels...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{regulation}} of epithelial morphogenesis {{is essential for the}} formation of tissues and organs in multicellular organisms, little is known about how signalling pathways control cell shape changes in space and time. In the Drosophila ovarian epithelium, the transition from a cuboidal to a squamous shape is accompanied by a wave of cell flattening and by the ordered remodelling of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions. We show that activation of the TGFb pathway is crucial to determine the timing, the degree and the <b>dynamic</b> of cell <b>flattening.</b> Within these cells, TGFb signalling controls cell-autonomously the formation of Actin filament and the localisation of activated Myosin II, indicating that internal forces are generated and used to remodel AJ and to promote cytoskeleton rearrangement. Our results also reveal that TGFb signalling controls Notch activity and that its functions are partly executed through Notch. Thus, we demonstrate that the cells that undergo the cuboidal-to-squamous transition produce active cell-shaping mechanisms, rather than passively flattening in response to a global force generated by the growth of the underlying cells. Thus, our work on TGFb signalling provides new insights into the mechanisms through which signal transduction cascades orchestrate cell shape changes to generate proper organ structure...|$|R
40|$|Two active optical {{waveguide}} devices were investigated {{using a variety}} of theoretical techniques for their potential application to telecommunications networks. A reconfigurable transverse waveguide grating was numerically modelled and shown to offer switching up to 1 x 16 with high refractive index modulating materials or 1 x 4 with much faster, but lower refractive index modulating materials. Furthermore, a method was shown for combining the grating with a finer fixed grating to select a wavelength multiplexed signal. A previously devised <b>dynamic</b> gain <b>flattening</b> filter device was also numerically analysed to determine its general characteristics and the limitations of its configuration. Its effects on attenuation control and data signal distortion were analysed under a range of conditions and guidelines for keeping that distortion limited determined. A simplified model of the filter operation was used to form a control algorithm allowing immediate jumps in the attenuation levels to be accomodated. Finally, an experimental implementation of the filter with an arrayed waveguide grating and free space imaged liquid crystal phase modulating array was demonstrated. Unfortunately errors in the construction of this filter prevented typical attenuation profiles from being illustrated, but the resulting measurements were found consistent with the filter modelling. It was judged that the gain flattening filter could potentially be used for both generating a set of data modulated wavelength channels as a source and for correcting the relative levels of those channels after different transmission paths had modified them. Both of these features would be particularly desirable in an optically routed system. The wide switching capabilities of the transverse grating (1 x 16) could be useful for initial network configuration or recovery from link failure, but unfortunately it does not offer sufficient advantages over an array of simpler junctions to make its development clearly worthwhile. Electrically selecting a single wavelength channel from many using the fixed and reconfigurable grating combination would potentially be useful in an add/drop multiplexer component.

40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization of homoleptic copper(l) complexes with substituted pirazino [2, 3 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthroline, RpplR', (R = H, Me, COOH or COOMe, and R' = H, Me) as ligand. The ligand ppl {{works as an}} acceptor of electronic density, which is delocalized mainly in the quinoxaline part of its structure. The UV-Vis spectra show that all the complexes display bands in the range 400 - 650 nm, which are MLCT in character. The lambda(max) and extinction coefficients of the MLCT band at 450 nm. and the LC band do not change significatively when varying the R substituent. Nevertheless, {{the intensity of the}} shoulder around 500 nm does change; this absorption has been related to either a static or <b>dynamic</b> <b>flattening</b> distortion of the complex D- 2 d -> D- 2 symmetry. The cyclic voltammetry of the complexes shows irreversible redox processes with E-p values that do not follow the tendency expected from the donor/acceptor character of the substituents on the ligand. All the complexes studied showed no emission both in acetonitrile and dichloromethane as solvent at room temperature and under argon atmosphere. All the results are discussed in relation to the proposed flattened distortion of the ground state, as well as in relation to the donor/acceptor character of the substituents on the ligand, the steric effects on the symmetry of the metal center and the excited state distortion...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen native {{speakers}} of German heard normal sentences, sentences which were either lacking <b>dynamic</b> pitch variation (<b>flattened</b> speech), or comprised of intonation contour exclusively (degraded speech). Participants were to {{listen carefully to}} the sentences and to perform a rehearsal task. Passive listening to flattened speech compared to normal speech produced strong brain responses in right cortical areas, particularly in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). Passive listening to degraded speech compared to either normal or flattened speech particularly involved fronto-opercular and subcortical (Putamen, Caudate Nucleus) regions bilaterally. Additionally the Rolandic operculum (premotor cortex) in the right hemisphere subserved processing of neat sentence intonation. As a function of explicit rehearsing sentence intonation we found several activation foci in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area), the left inferior precentral sulcus, and the left Rolandic fissure. The data allow several suggestions: First, both flattened and degraded speech evoked differential brain responses in the pSTG, particularly in the planum temporale (PT) bilaterally indicating that this region mediates integration of slowly and rapidly changing acoustic cues during comprehension of spoken language. Second, the bilateral circuit active whilst participants receive degraded speech reflects general effort allocation. Third, the differential finding for passive perception and explicit rehearsal of intonation contour suggests a right fronto-lateral network for processing and a left fronto-lateral network for producing prosodic information. Finally, it appears that brain areas which subserve speech (frontal operculum) and premotor functions (Rolandic operculum) coincidently support the processing of intonation contour in spoken sentence comprehension...|$|R
