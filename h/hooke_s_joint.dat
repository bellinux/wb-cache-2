40|$|Sacro-iliac <b>joint</b> (<b>S.</b> I <b>joint)</b> {{dysfunction}} {{can result}} in leg length discrepancies (LLD). LLD {{has been associated with}} many musculoskeletal problems such as osteoarthritis of the hips, knee pain and lower back pain. It has been theorised that LLD alters a persons body posture, which in turn changes the forces acting on the joints in the lower extremity and spine. These unnatural forces then create the excessive forces seen as the causative factors in the previously mentioned musculoskeletal conditions. (Murrel, Cornwall, Doucet 1991) The purpose of this pilot study was to was to compare the effect of chiropractic manipulative therapy on the <b>S.</b> I <b>joints</b> with chiropractic mobilisations of the <b>S.</b> I <b>joints</b> on the weight transfer from the spine into the lower limbs. This randomised study consisted of two groups of fifteen patients between the ages of eighteen and fifty years. All potential candidates were examined and admitted once all the inclusion and exclusion criteria had been met. Once <b>S.</b> I <b>joint</b> restrictions were detected the patient received either chiropractic manipulation or mobilisation to the restricted joint. Group A received chiropractic manipulation while group B were treated with mobilisations of the <b>S.</b> I <b>joints.</b> Patients were treated over a two week treatment period. Objective measurements were taken before the 1 st treatment and after the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th and final consultations one month later. The measurements were taken with the Spinal Analyses Machine (S. A. M). This instrument has got two scales on a platform that determines the patients weight distribution from the spine through the left and right lower limbs. The data collected was then statistically analysed using the One Way ANOVA Test (analyses of variance) as well as the Student-Newman-Keuls Method to compare the inter-group and intra-group data. Statistically significant changes in the weight distribution between the lower limbs were seen in group A. Based on the results from the study chiropractic manipulation to the <b>S.</b> I <b>joint</b> proved to be more effective than mobilisation in the treatment of <b>S.</b> I <b>joint</b> dysfunction.

40|$|Ig class switch {{recombination}} (CSR) {{and somatic}} hypermutation serve to diversify antibody responses and are orchestrated by {{the activity of}} activation-induced cytidine deaminase and many proteins involved in DNA repair and genome surveillance. Msh 5, a gene encoded in the central MHC class III region, and its obligate heterodimerization partner Msh 4 have {{a critical role in}} regulating meiotic homologous recombination and have not been implicated in CSR. Here, we show that MRL/lpr mice carrying a congenic H- 2 b/b MHC interval exhibit several abnormalities regarding CSR, including a profound deficiency of IgG 3 in most mice and long microhomologies at Ig switch (<b>S)</b> <b>joints.</b> We found that Msh 5 is expressed at low levels on the H- 2 b haplotype and, importantly, a similar long <b>S</b> <b>joint</b> microhomology phenotype was observed in both Msh 5 and Msh 4 -null mice. We also present evidence that genetic variation in MSH 5 is associated with IgA deficiency and common variable immune deficiency (CVID) in humans. One of the human MSH 5 alleles identified contains two nonsynonymous polymorphisms, and the variant protein encoded by this allele shows impaired binding to MSH 4. Similar to the mice, Ig <b>S</b> <b>joints</b> from CVID and IgA deficiency patients carrying disease-associated MSH 5 alleles show increased donor/acceptor microhomology, involving pentameric DNA repeat sequences and lower mutation rates than controls. Our findings suggest that Msh 4 / 5 heterodimers contribute to CSR and support a model whereby Msh 4 / 5 promotes the resolution of DNA breaks with low or no terminal microhomology by a classical nonhomologous end-joining mechanism while possibly suppressing an alternative microhomology-mediated pathway...|$|R

Transnational threats to U. S. national security include drug cartels and international criminal and terrorist organizations. In response, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Joint</b> Forces Command is leading a transition toward {{a new approach to}} warfare. A cornerstone of this new approach is the concept of Rapid Decisive Operations, which integrate knowledge, command and control, and Effects-Based Operations to achieve the desired strategic outcome or “effect” on the enemy through the synergistic application of the full range of military and nonmilitary capabilities at all levels of conflict. In preparing for and conducting a RDO, the military acts in concert with and leverages the other instruments of national power to understand and reduce the adversary’s critical capabilities and coherence. Focusing on effects, rather than attrition, enables a highly coordinated level of inter-service, interagency, and international cooperation. An experiment was conducted to examine aspects of EBO, and to specifically assess and refine the effects-based planning process. This paper describes the results of a survey on the effects-based planning and assessment process, and is a companion paper to two other papers that discuss results of the other two surveys that were administered.

40|$|A thrust stand {{calibration}} {{technique for}} use in testing repetitively-pulsed electric thrusters for in-space propulsion has been developed and tested using a modified hanging pendulum thrust stand. In the implementation of this technique, current pulses are applied to a solenoidal coil to produce a pulsed magnetic field that acts against the magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet mounted to the thrust stand pendulum arm. The force on the magnet is applied in this non-contact manner, with the entire pulsed force transferred to the pendulum arm through a piezoelectric force transducer to provide a time-accurate force measurement. Modeling of the pendulum arm dynamics reveals that after an initial transient in thrust stand motion the quasisteady average deflection of the thrust stand arm away from the unforced or zero position {{can be related to}} the average applied force through a simple linear <b>Hooke</b> <b>s</b> law relationship. Modeling demonstrates that this technique is universally applicable except when the pulsing period is increased {{to the point where it}} approaches the period of natural thrust stand motion. Calibration data were obtained using a modified hanging pendulum thrust stand previously used for steady-state thrust measurements. Data were obtained for varying impulse bit at constant pulse frequency and for varying pulse frequency. The two data sets exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with each other as the constant relating average deflection and average thrust match within the errors on the linear regression curve fit of the data. Quantitatively, the error on the calibration coefficient is roughly 1 % of the coefficient value...|$|R
