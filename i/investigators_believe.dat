5|$|Pakistani {{investigators}} probing {{links between}} Lal Masjid and terrorists {{have discovered the}} enrolment registers listing the students who studied at the seminary. The <b>investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the information, found in the Jamia Hafsa complex, will help clarify {{the number of people}} killed or missing in the operation. Officials believe the list of registered students matches the number of students evacuated or captured from the mosque and Jamia Hafsa.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which <b>investigators</b> <b>believe</b> occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, <b>investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some <b>investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>believed</b> up to {{two dozen}} patient deaths might have been homicides, but stated that they had {{difficulty}} acquiring the medical records needed to document the patients' conditions. Tenet Healthcare said it turned over all the patient records it had on the case. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believed</b> that of the two dozen possible cases, they initially had the strongest case {{in the deaths of}} four of the patients who had died on the hospital's seventh floor.|$|R
50|$|According to {{an article}} posted in the British The Sunday Times, <b>investigators</b> <b>believed</b> that library.nu was {{operated}} by Irish nationals, possibly from Galway, through a server in Kiev.|$|R

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some <b>investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believe</b> it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

50|$|<b>Investigators</b> {{said they}} <b>believed</b> {{more than one}} man's semen was found inside Marcia's body. Semen also was found on her clothes. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believed</b> Marcia had been lured into a garage and killed there.

5000|$|From Iquilla's {{account of}} what Asha had taken with her, <b>investigators</b> <b>believed</b> the girl had planned and {{prepared}} for this departure over the several days preceding her disappearance. [...] "She's not your typical runaway," [...] observed SBI agent Bart Burpeau. Another expert, Ben Ermini of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, noted that most children who run away are at least 12. An FBI agent also pointed {{to the lack of}} an issue she might have been running away from, such as a dysfunctional family or poor academic performance. Still, <b>investigators</b> <b>believed</b> that was the most likely explanation for her departure, but that for some reason she either got off track or was abducted.|$|R
50|$|CNN {{claimed in}} October 2001 that U.S. <b>investigators</b> <b>believed</b> Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh (Ahmed Umar Syed Sheikh), using the alias Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad, sent more than $100,000 from Pakistan to Mohamed Atta, the {{suspected}} hijack ringleader of the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|R
25|$|News {{stories in}} 1999 {{did not mention}} {{anything}} about cipher messages, which were not announced until 12 years later when the FBI listed the death as a murder, and posted a notice for help on the main page of their website. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the notes in McCormick’s pants pockets were written within the three days before his death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>believe</b> the I-70 killer may be {{responsible}} for two murders in 1993, and an attempted murder in 1994, all of which occurred in Texas. The two murder victims were 51-year-old Mary Ann Glasscock, who was killed on September 25, 1993 in Fort Worth at the Emporium Antiques store, and 22-year-old Amy Vess, who was shot to death in a dance apparel store in Arlington on November 1.|$|E
25|$|Bittaker and Norris {{abducted}} {{their final}} victim, 16-year-old Shirley Lynette Ledford, on October 31, 1979. Ledford was abducted {{as she stood}} outside a gas station; hitchhiking home from a Halloween party in the Sunland-Tujunga suburb of Los Angeles. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believe</b> Ledford accepted a ride home from Bittaker and Norris because she recognized Bittaker, as he {{is known to have}} frequented the restaurant in which Ledford held a part-time job as a waitress.|$|E

5|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>believed</b> the {{aircraft}} captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of {{the aircraft}} was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. <b>Investigators</b> <b>believed</b> he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|R

25|$|Birgenair Flight 301 was {{a flight}} {{chartered}} by Turkish-managed Birgenair partner Alas Nacionales from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic to Frankfurt, Germany, via Gander, Canada, and Berlin, Germany. On 6 February 1996, the Boeing 757–225 operating the route crashed shortly after take-off from Puerto Plata's Gregorio Luperón International Airport. All 189 {{people on board}} died. The cause was a pitot tube that <b>investigators</b> <b>believe</b> was blocked by a wasp nest that was built inside it. The aircraft had sat unused for two days without the pitot tube covers in place.|$|E
25|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>believe</b> that Hughes {{entered an}} area of deteriorating weather with low {{visibility}} and lost his visual reference with the ground. This induced spatial disorientation and eventually led to a graveyard spiral with the aircraft entering into a right-hand diving turn, with a nose-down attitude of 25°. When the aircraft cleared the clouds, Hughes attempted to arrest the high descent rate by pulling the nose up and applying full power, {{but it was too}} late. The FAA investigators later found evidence that the propeller was at maximum speed during impact.|$|E
