40|$|In {{this paper}} we show {{a way to}} create stable <b>full</b> body <b>motion</b> for a {{humanoid}} robot without defining all joint trajectories in advance. The <b>full</b> body <b>motion</b> is split in a task and compensation motion. The task motion can be generated in advance, while the compensation motion is obtained during execution of the task. We show that the compensation motion {{can be obtained by}} making use of the linear relation between the joint velocities and the linear momentum of the complete robot. A setpoint for the linear momentum is generated by making use of the error between the current Capture Point and the desired Capture Point location. We have implemented the control algorithm in simulation as well on a real humanoid robot. We were able to create stable <b>full</b> body <b>motion</b> for a bending forward task. It turns out that the control algorithm to create stable <b>full</b> body <b>motion</b> is insensitive for model errors in the internal model of the robot.

This allows the Sega CD to run games containing <b>full</b> <b>motion</b> video.|$|E

When <b>full</b> search <b>motion</b> estimation is employed for the seven block sizes, only one of the best block size motion vectors is used; all the other block size motion vectors are discarded.

The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game. This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features <b>full</b> <b>motion</b> video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered graphics. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Terra Nova {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} first squad-oriented games with {{three-dimensional}} (3D) graphics; the player is often assisted by artificially intelligent teammates who may be given tactical commands. Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game, , Terra Nova was subject to a long and difficult development process, caused in part by the production of its <b>full</b> <b>motion</b> video cutscenes. The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such effects as procedural animation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. The game uses <b>full</b> <b>motion</b> capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
