5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used in}} {{carborundum}} printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. Carborundum grit {{is applied}} in a paste {{to the surface of}} an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for <b>intaglio</b> printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, George Palmer, a {{pilot flying}} between Las Vegas, Nevada and Blythe, California noticed the Blythe geoglyphs. His find {{led to a}} survey of the area in 1932 by Arthur Woodward, Curator of History and Anthropology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Malcolm J. Rogers {{subsequently}} studied and sketched the Blythe <b>Intaglios</b> in 1939. After National Geographic published an article about the Blythe <b>Intaglios</b> in 1952, people began to visit the site which led to some destruction of the <b>intaglios.</b> The interest in the Blythe <b>intaglios</b> lead to the search for and discovery of more desert <b>intaglios.</b> The Bureau of Land Management erected fences in 1974 to protect the <b>intaglios</b> and the Blythe <b>Intaglios</b> were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.|$|R

5000|$|Geoglyphs {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world, the construction methods range from earthern mounds, piles of stone, or the removal of surface plants or soil. The most famous desert <b>intaglios</b> are the Nazca Lines in Peru. The Blythe Geoglyphs or <b>intaglios</b> (anthropomorphic geoglyphs) were created by scraping away layers of darker rocks or pebbles to reveal a stratum of lighter-valued soil. The displaced rocks outlined the figures and the exposed soil was stamped down which {{makes it more difficult}} for plants to grow in the lines. The <b>intaglios</b> are located on flat terraces in the Colorado River floodplain. While these [...] "gravel pictographs" [...] are found through the deserts of southeastern California, human figures are found only near the Colorado River. Other <b>intaglios</b> depict mountain lions, birds, snakes, and unidentified zoomorphic and geometric shapes. The figures are so immense that many of them were not observed by non-Indians until the 1930s. [...] The set of Blythe <b>Intaglios</b> and nearby geoglyphs include several dozen figures, thought to be ceremonial in nature. No Colorado River Native American group has claimed to have made the <b>intaglios,</b> although some have claimed to use them. Many of the <b>intaglios</b> are believed to date from the prehistoric period, but their age and the identity of their creators are still uncertain. If the quadruped figures represent horses (reintroduced in North America by the Spanish) then a historical date would be supported. Jay von Werlhof and his collaborators obtained 13 AMS radiocarbon dates for the figures, ranging from 900 BCE to 1200 CE.|$|R

5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or <b>intaglio.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of <b>intaglio</b> printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E

25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic printing, <b>intaglio</b> printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and <b>intaglio</b> printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, <b>intaglio</b> about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, 100-won notes (series III) {{were printed}} using <b>intaglio</b> {{printing}} techniques, {{for the first}} time on domestically printed notes, to reduce counterfeiting.

5000|$|Bernardi {{was best}} known for his <b>intaglios</b> {{engraved}} in rock crystal, which had been pioneered by Valerio Belli. This was a difficult luxury artform that was fashionable among wealthy Italian collectors. Though described as being [...] "engraved", the <b>intaglios</b> are cut by drills, sometimes quite deeply. Castings of many of the crystal carvings were taken in wax and them used to make metal plaquettes, which Bernardi also designed and made de novo. He also made some versions in glass.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{observations}} of the <b>intaglios</b> on quartz cylinder seals from Western Asia suggested {{that they had been}} engraved by one or more of four basic techniques, that is, micro-chipping, filing, drilling and wheel-cutting.

Examination and comparison of experimentally engraved features with the seal <b>intaglios</b> was made directly with a binocular microscope and also by examination of impressions with a scanning electron microscope. Successful replication was achieved using tools of flint, chalcedony, copper, bronze and iron together with quartz and emery abrasives...|$|R

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} the <b>intaglios</b> are stopping points on a keruk pilgrimage or simply {{the practice of}} the keruk ceremony at various places.

Warfare has been offered a possible explanation as to the spread along the Colorado River of ceremonies such as the keruk and the similar style of desert <b>intaglios.</b>|$|R
