40|$|Traditionally, {{vertical}} circulation (induced by <b>gravity</b> <b>circulation</b> and tidal straining), tidal pumping, and resuspension are suggested {{as the major}} processes for the formation and maintenance of the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM). Due to strong mixing, tidal pumping is considered as the dominating process in macrotidal estuaries. To analyze field observation data, the classical empirical decomposition method is commonly suggested, but the tidal pumping flux (TPF) based on this method may lead to erroneous conclusions about the mechanisms of ETM formation because the effects of advection induced by the horizontal SSC gradient and fine bed sediment supply are ignored. If these effects are included, the TPF clearly reproduces the convergence patterns and thus demonstrates {{its role in the}} formation of the ETM. By a simplified analytical solution, the TPF is the result of the competition between the downstream flux induced by the river current together with the lag in sediment response and the upstream flux induced by tidal asymmetry and the lag. Field observations in the well-mixed macrotidal Yalu River estuary (located between China and North Korea) were analyzed. Tidal pumping is identified as the dominant mechanism of its ETM formation, and the position of the ETM for different river discharges and sediment settling velocities can be predicted by the concept of tidal pumping by numerical and analytical procedures. The present study provides a typical example of how to evaluate the tidal pumping contributions on ETM formation using the combined information provided by field data, numerical modeling results, and analytical solutions.

The AP 1000 reactor is provided with passive safety systems which require no operator actions due to utilizing only natural forces such as <b>gravity,</b> natural <b>circulation</b> and compressed gas to achieve the safety function. In this paper the core damage frequency due to Small Break LOCA Initiating Event has been presented and besides that, the reliability analysis of the passive core cooling system has been evaluated by the aid of RAT (Risk Assessment Tool) which was developed in the Nuclear Safety Center of Shiraz University. Multiple Greek letter Logic (MGL) method is used for the evaluation of CCF of high redundancy safety systems. The results show that the contribution of the SB LOCA in the final core damage frequency of AP 1000 is decreased due to passive safety systems usage and human independent functions.

The simplified model represents the one-dimensional interaction of a single gravity wave mode with a zonal-mean flow. Solutions of this model are shown to agree very well with numerical results from a more complete mean-flow/gravity-wave model (essentially the model developed by Holton, 1982). A single nondimensional parameter, the ratio of a mean flow radiative forcing parameter, and the gravity wave momentum flux incident into the middle atmosphere from below largely determine {{the solution of the}} model. For typical middle atmosphere parameter values, an approximate solution can be obtained, and this solution permits the parameter dependence of the circulation to be characterized very simply.

40|$|A spatiospectral {{localization}} {{method is}} discussed for processing the global geopotential coefficients from satellite mission data to investigate time-variable gravity. The time-variable mass variation signal usually appears {{associated with a}} particular geographical area yielding inherently regional structure, while the dependence of the satellite gravity errors on a geographical region is not so evident. The proposed localization amplifies the signal-to-noise ratio of the (non-stationary) time-variable signals in the geopotential coefficient estimates by localizing the global coefficients to {{the area where the}} signal is expected to be largest.

40|$|The {{tools of}} geodesy have the {{potential}} to transform the Ocean Observing System. Geodetic observations are unique in the way that these methods produce accurate, quantitative, and integrated observations of <b>gravity,</b> ocean <b>circulation,</b> sea surface height, ocean bottom pressure, and mass exchanges among the ocean, cryosphere, and land. These observations have made fundamental contributions to the monitoring and understanding of physical ocean processes. In particular, geodesy is the fundamental science to enable determination of an accurate geoid model, allowing estimate of absolute surface geostrophic currents, which are necessary to quantify ocean’s heat transport. The present geodetic satellites can measure sea level, its mass component and their changes, both of which are vital for understanding global climate change. Continuation of current satellite missions and the development of new geodetic technologies can be expected to further support accurate monitoring of the ocean. The Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) provides the means for integrating the geodetic techniques that monitor the Earth's time-variable surface geometry (including ocean, hydrologic, land, and ice surfaces), gravity field, and Earth rotation/orientation into a consistent system for measuring ocean surface topography, ocean currents, ocean mass and volume changes. This system depends on both globally coordinated ground-based networks of tracking stations as well as an uninterrupted series of satellite missions. GGOS works with the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and space agencies to ensure the availability of the necessary expertise and infrastructure. In this white paper, we summarize the community consensus of critical oceanographic observables currently enabled by geodetic systems, and the requirements to continue such measurements.

40|$|Scope of this research, {{carried out}} by ENEA in {{collaboration}} with University of Pisa and Polytechnic of Milano since 1999, is the identification of a methodology allowing {{the evaluation of the}} reliability of passive systems as a whole, in a more physical and phenomenal way. The paper describe the study, named REPAS (Reliability Evaluation of Passive Safety systems), {{carried out by}} the partners and finalised to the development and validation of such a procedure. The strategy of engagement moves from the consideration that a passive system should be theoretically more reliable than an active one. In fact it does not need any external input or energy to operate and it relies only upon natural physical laws (e. g. <b>gravity,</b> natural <b>circulation,</b> internally stored energy, etc.) and/or “intelligent” use of the energy inherently available in the system (e. g. chemical reaction, decay heat, etc.). Nevertheless the passive system may fail its mission not only as a consequence of classical mechanical failure of components, but also for deviation from the expected behaviour, due to physical phenomena mainly related to thermalhydraulics or due to different boundary and initial conditions. The main sources of physical failure are identified and a probability of occurrence is assigned. The reliability analysis is performed on a passive system which operates in two-phase, natural circulation. The selected system is a loop including a heat source and a heat sink where the condensation occurs. The system behaviour under different configurations has been simulated via best-estimate code (Relap 5 mod 3. 2).

40|$|International audienceThe middle {{atmosphere}} is generally {{defined as the}} region of the atmosphere located between the tropopause (8 – 17 km) and the mesopause (85 – 90 km). It includes the stratosphere, where the ozone layer takes place, and the mesosphere.

In this paper, the safety performance of the AP 1000 during a small break {{loss of coolant accident}} (SBLOCA) is investigated.

RELAP/SCDAPSIM is designed to describe the overall reactor coolant system (RCS) thermal hydraulic response and core behaviour under normal operating conditions or under design basis or severe accident conditions. Passive safety components in the AP 1000 showed a clear improvement in accident mitigation. It was found that RELAP/SCDAPSIM is capable of modelling a LOCA in an AP 1000 and it enables the investigation of each safety system component response separately during the accident.

The study is based on several circulation estimates obtained over the period 1992 – 2002 by combining most of the available ocean datasets with a global general circulation model on a 1 ° horizontal grid and by exchanging only the EGM 96 geoid model with two different geoid models available from GRACE. As compared to the EGM 96 -based solution, the GRACE geoid leads to an estimate of the ocean circulation that is more consistent with the Levitus temperature and salinity climatology. While not a formal proof, this finding supports the inference of a substantially improved GRACE geoid skill. However, oceanographic implications of the GRACE model are only modest compared to what can be obtained from ocean observations alone. To understand the extent to which this is merely a consequence of a not-optimally converged solution or if a much more accurate geoid field could in principle play a profound role in the ocean estimation procedure, an additional experiment was performed in which the geoid error was artificially reduced relative to all other datasets.

Sakurai et al. (2011) showed convergence between near surface easterly wind from dissipating local convective cells along the southwestern coastline of Sumatera Island and ambient southerly wind over the Indian Ocean, and this resulted in the successive generation of convective cells at the leading edge of precipitating systems that drove their offshore migration according to a case study of dual-Doppler radar observations. In addition, Mori et al. (2011) suggested that a seeder-feeder mechanism acts between leading-edges of westward spreading anvil clouds formed by local convections and eastward propagating large-scale MJO convections, which contributes to the offshore migration and re-development of the precipitating systems over the same region. On the contrary, Yokoi et al. (2017) recently studied radar and intensive sounding data obtained during the pre-YMC 2015 campaign conducted around Bengkulu (3.86 ° S, 102.33 ° E) on the southwestern coastline of Sumatera and found that shallow gravity waves generated by initial convections over the mountain foothill region in the daytime drove the convections toward the offshore in the late evening. Meanwhile, Wu et al. (2008) showed that the land-breeze (<b>gravity</b> current) <b>circulation</b> played an essential role in the nocturnal offshore migration of rainfall over Kalimantan/Borneo Island, and such events were mainly formed by evaporation cooling after rainfall in the evening over the island plain as well as nocturnal radiative cooling based on both satellite observations and numerical model simulations. Moreover, Ichikawa and Yasunari (2008) concluded that orography induced local circulation (i.e., mountain–valley breeze) and its interaction with large-scale monsoon winds were key factors for rainfall offshore propagation over New Guinea Island in addition to both land–sea breeze <b>circulation</b> and <b>gravity</b> waves.|$|R

40|$|Recent cloud-resolving {{numerical}} modeling {{results suggest}} that radiative forcing causes accelerated rates of tropical cyclogenesis and early intensification. Furthermore, observational studies of tropical cyclones have found that oscillations of the cloud canopy areal extent often occur that are clearly related to the solar diurnal cycle. A theory is put forward to explain these findings. The primary mechanism that seems responsible {{can be considered a}} refinement of the mechanism proposed by Gray and Jacobson (1977) to explain diurnal variations of oceanic tropical deep cumulus convection. It is hypothesized that differential radiative cooling or heating between a relatively cloud-free environment and a developing tropical disturbance generates circulations that can have very significant influences on convective activity in the core of the system. It is further suggested that there are benefits to understanding this mechanism by viewing it in terms of the lateral propagation of thermally driven <b>gravity</b> wave <b>circulations,</b> also known as buoyancy bores. Numerical model experiments indicate that mean environmental radiative cooling outside the cloud system is playing an important role in causing a significant horizontal differential radiative forcing and accelerating the rate of tropical cyclogenesis. As an expansive stratiform cloud layer forms aloft within a developing system the mean low-level radiative cooling is reduced, while at mid levels small warming occurs. During the daytime there is not a very large differential radiative forcing between the environment and the cloud system, but at nighttime when there is strong radiative clear-sky cooling of the environment it becomes significant. Thermally driven circulations develop, characterized by relatively weak subsidence in the environment but much stronger upward motion in the cloud system. This upward motion leads to a cooling tendency and increased relative humidity. The increased relative humidity at night appears to be a major factor in enhancing convective activity, thereby leading in the mean to an increased rate of genesis. It is postulated that the increased upward motion and relative humidity that occur throughout a deep layer aid both in the triggering of convection and in providing a more favorable local environment at mid levels for maintenance of buoyancy in convective cells due to a reduction of the detrimental effects of dry air entrainment. Additionally, the day/night modulations of the environmental radiative forcing appear {{to play a major role}} in the diurnal cycles of convective activity in the cloud system. It is shown that the upward velocity tendencies in the system core produced by the radiative forcing are extremely weak when compared to those produced by latent heat release in convective towers, but nevertheless over the course of a night they appear capable of significantly influencing convective activity...|$|R

The MT structure above the first tropopause is composed of strong temperature fluctuations. By {{a detailed analysis of}} observed three-dimensional wind and temperature fluctuation components, it is shown that the phase and amplitude relations between these components are consistent with the theoretical characteristics of linear inertia–gravity waves (IGWs). Numerical simulations were performed by using a nonhydrostatic model. The simulatedMT structures and IGWparameters agreewell with the observation. In the analysis using the numerical simulation data, it is seen that IGWs were generated around 658 S, 158 E and around 708 S, 158 E, propagated eastward, and reached the region above Syowa Station when the MT event was observed. These IGWs were likely radiated spontane-ously from the upper-tropospheric flow around 658 S, 158 E and were forced by strong southerly surface winds over steep topography (708 S, 158 E). The MT occurrence is attributable to strong IGWs and the low mean static stability in the polar winter lower stratosphere. It is also shown that nonorographic gravity waves associatedwith the tropopause folding event contribute to 40 % of the momentum fluxes, as shown by a <b>gravity</b> wave–resolving general <b>circulation</b> model in the lower stratosphere around 658 S.

In Early Cretaceous the same area experienced a flood basalt volcanism which produced a LIP-(Large Igneous Province, Bryan & Ernst, 2008). We present here a new approach that integrates the newest gravity data of the satellite mission GOCE (<b>Gravity</b> Ocean <b>Circulation</b> Explorer) and the seismologic and geophysical drilling information to determine the Paraná basin lithospheric structure. The latest seismological investigations in South America (Assumpção et al., 2012) reveal a deep (> 40 km) Moho under the Paraná basin. These observations {{do not agree with}} the gravity data that evidence a relative gravity high trending NE-SW in the central portion of the basin and over the greatest thickness of the sediment layers. Further constraint for the gravity modeling are the geophysical data obtained from a drilling survey in search for hydrocarbons (Melfi et al., 1987). Isostatic modeling show us, that this relative gravity high cannot be explained by the volcanic deposits because they are less in volume with respect to the light pre-volcanic alluvional layer. The gravity high certainly cannot be explained by crustal thinning, as the seismological data suggest normal to thick crust. In our work we calculate the effect of underplating related to magmatic effusion. This magmatism is supposed to be more than 10 time the volume of superficial flood volcanism (Bryan & Ernst, 2008). We calculate the missing mass using isostatic modeling: we first reduce the Bouguer field by the gravity effect of crustal thickness using the seismological Moho, and the effect of sediment. We test 2 different density contrasts between crust and mantle: - 0. 5 and - 0. 3 Mg/m 3, the first takes into account a light, and the second a heavy crustal density. After that we use the spectral methodology for gravity inversion, and obtain a crustal body that explains our missing mass. To test the different possible patterns, we adopted several models, changing the reference depth, and the density contrast. Finally we simplify the unknown body with a cut off cone, and we estimate the volume of intruded basaltic material. We see that the geometry is in agreement with petrologic considerations. We conclude that the deep Moho under Paraná basin can be explained for example by a thick layer of gabbro with a contrast density of 0. 2 Mg/m 3 with respect to a normal crust, located at 40 km, with a volume of about 1. 66 × 106 km 3 (Assumpção et al., 2012) when the total volume of the superficial LIP is 0. 46 × 106 km 3...|$|R
40|$|The hot Jupiter WASP- 43 b has {{now joined}} the ranks of transiting hot Jupiters HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b as an {{exoplanet}} with a large array of observational constraints on its atmospheric properties. Because WASP- 43 b receives a similar stellar flux as HD 209458 b but has a rotation rate 4 times faster and a much higher gravity, studying WASP- 43 b serves as a test of the effect of rotation rate and <b>gravity</b> on the <b>circulation</b> when stellar irradiation is held approximately constant. Here we present 3 D atmospheric circulation models of WASP- 43 b using the SPARC/MITgcm, a coupled radiation and circulation model, exploring the effects of composition, metallicity, and frictional drag. We find that the circulation regime of WASP- 43 b is not unlike other hot Jupiters, with equatorial superrotation that yields an eastward-shifted hotspot and large day-night temperature variations (~ 600 K at photospheric pressures). We then compare our model results to observations from Stevenson et al. which utilize HST/WFC 3 to collect spectrophotometric phase curve measurements of WASP- 43 b from 1. 12 - 1. 65 microns. Our results show the 5 x solar model lightcurve provides a good match to the data, with a phase offset of peak flux and planet/star flux ratio that is similar to observations; however, the model nightside appears to be brighter. Nevertheless, our 5 x solar model provides an excellent match to the WFC 3 dayside emission spectrum. This is a major success, as the result is a natural outcome of the 3 D dynamics with no model tuning, and differs significantly from 1 D models that can generally only match observations when appropriately tuned. In sum, these results demonstrate that 3 D circulation models can provide important insights in interpreting exoplanet atmospheric observations, even at high spectral resolution, and highlight the potential for future observations with HST, JWST and other next-generation telescopes.

30|$|Daily and diurnal {{variations}} of surface rainfall observed by AWSs at all sounding and CDR/WPR sites showed distinctly different characteristics, in particular {{for those in}} the meridional directions among the northern (Pramuka: coastal sea), central (Serpong: plain), and southern (Bogor: mountain foothills) sides of Jakarta. Rainfall over the coastal sea had a gentle peak in the night followed by a weak one until the next morning, whereas that over the mountain foothills had a pronounced peak in the evening and was delayed gradually from the beginning {{to the end of the}} period with increases in its intensity. The CDR confirmed those characteristics formed by the meridional marches of diurnal rainfall (DRMMs), which traveled northward (southward) in the nighttime (daytime) over Jakarta with speed of approximately 5  m s−[*] 1 (2  m s−[*] 1). In addition, spatiotemporal variation of meridional winds over Jakarta based on the intensive soundings showed a land–sea-breeze-like circulation close to the surface, namely, the development and expansion of land-breeze-like southerly wind from the mountain foothill region after sunset (19 LT), and then an increase of its intensity and intrusion into the Jawa Sea occurred across the coastline in the nighttime (22 LT) followed by its retreat back to the land region early the next morning (04 LT). Both results suggest that nocturnal rainfall formed over the front of land-breeze-like southerly wind close to the surface and traveled from the mountain foothill region with evening showers toward the coastal region through the night coincident with the meridional advance and retreat of the front. Furthermore, the observational results suggested that the northward (southward) DRMM was driven primarily by convections formed over the converged frontline ahead of land-breeze (sea-breeze)-like southerly (northerly) wind close to the surface. Although the nature of the DRMM was fundamentally consistent with the results in a previous numerical simulation study (Koseki et al. 2012), other mechanisms that may play a contributing role as drivers of the DRMM over Jakarta, e.g., mountain–valley breeze <b>circulations,</b> <b>gravity</b> waves, self-sustaining processes in mesoscale convective systems, and coastal convergence effects, as well as heat and moisture budgets and their local transportation, should be examined in detail in future studies.|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} experiments during NASA Shuttle flights SLS 1 and 2 (9 - 15 days) and EUROMIR flights (30 - 90 days) we observed that pulmonary blood flow (cardiac output) was elevated initially, and surprisingly remained elevated {{for the duration}} of the flights. Stroke volume increased initially and then decreased, but was still above 1 Gz values. As venous return was constant, the changes in SV were secondary to modulation of heart rate. Mean blood pressure was at or slightly below 1 Gz levels in space, indicating a decrease in total peripheral resistance. It has been suggested that plasma volume is reduced in space, however cardiac output/venous return do not return to 1 Gz levels over the duration of flight. In spite of the increased cardiac output, central venous pressure was not elevated in space. These data suggest that there is a change in the basic relationship between cardiac output and central venous pressure, a persistent "hyperperfusion" and a re-distribution of blood flow and volume during space flight. Increased pulmonary blood flow has been reported to increase diffusing capacity in space, presumably due to the improved homogeneity of ventilation and perfusion. Other studies have suggested that ventilation may be independent of gravity, and perfusion may not be gravity- dependent. No data for the distribution of pulmonary blood volume were available for flight or simulated microgravity. Recent studies have suggested that the pulmonary vascular tree is influenced by sympathetic tone in a manner similar to that of the systemic system. This implies that the pulmonary circulation is dilated during microgravity and that the distribution of blood flow and volume may be influenced more by vascular control than by <b>gravity.</b> The cerebral <b>circulation</b> is influenced by sympathetic tone similarly to that of the systemic and pulmonary circulations; however its effects are modulated by cerebral autoregulation. Thus it is difficult to predict if cerebral perfusion is increased and if there is edema in space. Anecdotal evidence suggests there may be cerebral edema early in flight. Cerebral artery velocity has been shown to be elevated in simulated microgravity. The elevated cerebral artery velocity during simulated microgravity may reflect vasoconstriction of the arteries and not increased cerebral blood flow. The purpose of our investigations was to evaluate the effects of alterations in simulated gravity (+/-), resulting in changes in cardiac output (+/-), and on the blood flow and volume distribution in the lung and brain of human subjects. The first hypothesis of these studies was that blood flow and volume would be affected by gravity, but their distribution in the lung would be independent of gravity and due to vasoactivity changing vascular resistance in lung vessels. The vasodilitation of the lung vasculature (lower resistance) along with increased "compliance" of the heart could account for the absence of increased central venous pressure in microgravity. Secondly, we postulate that cerebral blood velocity is increased in microgravity due to large artery vasoconstriction, but that cerebral blood flow would be reduced due to autoregulation...|$|R
