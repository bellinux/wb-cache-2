5|$|Blatty was a Roman Catholic. In 2012, {{he filed}} a canon law {{petition}} against {{his alma mater}} Georgetown University. According to Blatty, the school for <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> been at variance with Catholic church teaching by inviting speakers who support abortion rights, and disobeying Pope John Paul II's instructions issued to church-affiliated {{colleges and universities in}} 1990.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} in recent <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> been {{the study of}} the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field {{has come to be known}} as science and technology studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the Māori population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Māori population converted to Christianity. In the 2013 census, 2,595 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among Māori. Immigration and associated demographic change in recent <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E

5|$|The {{pervasive}} and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response {{the system of}} national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves, four of which {{are part of the}} World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{step from}} rationals to reals {{is a major}} extension. There {{are at least two}} popular ways to achieve this step, both {{published}} in 1872: Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend for the last few <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling of a shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> led to the recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use {{at the expense of}} previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{migration}} to Copenhagen, rising {{over the last}} three <b>decades,</b> <b>has</b> contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. Muslims in Western Europe originate from both Arab and non-Arab countries. Those in the United Kingdom are primarily from South Asia, in France from North and West Africa, in Germany from Turkey, in Belgium from Morocco, and in the Netherlands from Morocco and Turkey.}} While there are no official statistics, {{a significant portion of the}} estimated 175,000–200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in Nørrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period, {{following}} {{the invention of}} long-playing records, Tosca recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. In 1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, she made the recording for EMI which for <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> been considered {{the best of all}} the recorded performances of the opera. She recorded the role again for EMI in stereo in 1964. A number of Callas's live stage performances of Tosca were also preserved. The earliest were two performances in Mexico City, in 1950 and 1952, and the last was in London in 1965. The first stereo recording of the opera was made in 1957 by RCA Victor. Erich Leinsdorf conducted the Rome Opera House orchestra and chorus with Zinka Milanov as Tosca, Jussi Björling as Cavaradossi and Leonard Warren as Scarpia. Herbert von Karajan's acclaimed performance with the Vienna State Opera was in 1963, with Leontyne Price, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Giuseppe Taddei in the leading roles.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation in the Holocaust or labeled the Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of those events in Jewish and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography in the past two <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{styles of}} {{architecture}} in Madagascar have been impacted {{over the past}} two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction in the Highlands began during the reign of Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the London Missionary Society and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and French colonization of the island in 1896. Modernization over the past several <b>decades</b> <b>has</b> increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related to the external orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly in the Highlands. Among those with means, foreign construction materials and techniques – namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features – have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.|$|E
