40|$|ECBM {{displacement}} {{experiments are}} a direct way {{to observe the}} gas displacement process and efficiency by inspecting the produced gas composition and flow rate. We conducted two sets of ECBM experiments by injecting N 2 and CO 2 through four large parallel specimens (300 × 50 × 50 [*]mm coal briquette). N 2 or CO 2 is injected at pressures of 1. 5, 1. 8, and 2. 2 [*]MPa and various crustal stresses. The changes in pressure along the briquette and the concentration of the gas mixture flowing out of the briquette were analyzed. Gas injection significantly enhances CBM recovery. Experimental recoveries of the original extant gas are in excess of 90 % for all cases. The {{results show that the}} N 2 breakthrough occurs earlier than the CO 2 breakthrough. The breakthrough time of N 2 is approximately 0. 5 <b>displaced</b> <b>volumes.</b> Carbon dioxide, however, breaks through at approximately 2 <b>displaced</b> <b>volumes.</b> Coal can adsorb CO 2, which results in a slower breakthrough time.

50|$|One common {{point of}} {{confusion}} regarding Archimedes' principle {{is the meaning}} of <b>displaced</b> <b>volume.</b> Common demonstrations involve measuring the rise in water level when an object floats on the surface in order to calculate the displaced water. This measurement approach fails with a buoyant submerged object because the rise in the water level {{is directly related to the}} volume of the object and not the mass (except if the effective density of the object equals exactly the fluid density). Instead, in the case of submerged buoyant objects, the whole volume of fluid directly above the sample should be considered as the <b>displaced</b> <b>volume.</b> Another common point of confusion regarding Archimedes' principle is that it only applies to submerged objects that are buoyant, not sunk objects. In the case of a sunk object the mass of displaced fluid is less than the mass of the object and the difference is associated with the object's potential energy.|$|E
50|$|Rotational {{stability}} {{depends on}} the relative lines of action of forces on an object. The upward buoyancy force on an object acts {{through the center of}} buoyancy, being the centroid of the <b>displaced</b> <b>volume</b> of fluid. The weight force on the object acts through its center of gravity. A buoyant object will be stable if the center of gravity is beneath the center of buoyancy because any angular displacement will then produce a 'righting moment'.|$|E
50|$|When {{it is at}} rest, a vessel's {{weight is}} borne entirely by the buoyant force. At low speeds every hull acts as a {{displacement}} hull, meaning that the buoyant force is mainly responsible for supporting the craft. As speed increases, hydrodynamic lift increases as well. In contrast, the buoyant force decreases as the hull lifts out of the water, decreasing the <b>displaced</b> <b>volume.</b> At some speed, lift becomes the predominant upward force on the hull and the vessel is planing.|$|E

50|$|Volumetric {{efficiency}} (VE) in {{an internal}} combustion engine design refers to the efficiency with which the engine can move the charge of fuel and air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. Volumetric efficiency is also the ratio of air volume drawn into the cylinder to the cylinder's swept volume. More specifically, volumetric efficiency is a ratio (or percentage) of the mass of air and fuel that is trapped by the cylinder during induction divided by the mass that would occupy the <b>displaced</b> <b>volume</b> if the air density in the cylinder were equal to the ambient air density. The flow restrictions in the intake system create a pressure drop in the inlet flow which reduces the density (unless boosts like turbos or superchargers or cam tuning techniques are used). Volumetric efficiency can be improved in a number of ways, most effectively this can be achieved by compressing the induction charge (forced induction) or by aggressive cam phasing in naturally aspirated engines as seen in racing applications. In the case of forced induction volumetric efficiency can exceed 100%.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} {{directed}} to evaluate the ability of using cone penetration test as a simple method to investigate the consistency level of fresh concrete. A cone of 30 ° apex angle attached with different load values was used. Eighteen concrete mixes divided into three groups were conducted. Three types of coarse aggregate were tried. Crushed dolomite, round gravel, and crushed basalt all of 20 mm maximum grain size were investigated. For each type of coarse aggregate, six levels of concrete consistency calibrated by standard slump test were tried. For the investigated mixes and at a specified consistency level, the <b>displaced</b> <b>volume</b> values were directly proportional to the applied load. The inclination of this relation is termed as the <b>displaced</b> <b>volume</b> rate (D. V). The results of cone penetration were analyzed and compared to the corresponding slump test values. The <b>displaced</b> <b>volume</b> per unit mass, bearing strength, as well as shear yield strength were the evaluated properties. The results introduce the cone penetration test as a simple instrument that could be adopted either at a laboratory or at site to evaluate fresh concrete workability. Moreover, it is being more sensitive compared to the well known slump test. It can simply and clearly distinguish between stiff mixes as well as floppy ones.

This improvement utilizes aÂ comprehensive model to explore two working fluids (R 410 A and R 134 a), various displaced volumes, at a variety ofÂ geometric parameters.

Â The eccentricity ratio is varied between 0. 81 and 0. 92 and the length-to-diameter ratio is varied between 0. 4 and 3. Â The key tradeoffs are evaluated and {{the results show that}} there is an optimum eccentricity and length-to-diameter ratio,Â which will maximize the model predicted performance, that is unique to a particular fluid and <b>displaced</b> <b>volume.</b> ForÂ R 410 A the modeling tool predicts that the overall isentropic efficiency will optimize at a length-to-diameter ratio thatÂ is lower than for R 134 a.
