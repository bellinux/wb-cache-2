25|$|Pakistan's {{economic}} expansion for financial year (FY) 2015, which ended on 30 June 2015, {{was led by}} services as growth in manufacturing slowed. Industrial growth was hobbled by a slowdown in large-scale manufacturing to 3.3% owing to continued power shortages and weaker <b>external</b> <b>demand.</b> The resilience of small-scale manufacturing and construction sustained industrial growth at 3.6%. Agriculture growth remained modest at 2.9%. Private fixed investment slipped to equal 9.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 10.0% a year earlier because of continuing energy constraints and the generally weak business environment that has depressed investment for several years.|$|E

Internal demands could be hunger, happiness, and control over environment. There are two parts to coping responses: first is the process of coping responses and second is the relationship between the person and outside forces.|$|R

Context takes many forms, and some form of categorisation of information from different viewpoints can assist designers in deciding how information should affect behaviour, and inform the handling of uncertain or conflicting information. We discuss the various approaches to context modeling, and derive an initial methodology for including contextual information in adaptive applications.

The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of <b>external</b> <b>demand,</b> avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.|$|E

30|$|As {{has been}} {{previously}} noted, the difference from Sect. 4.3 {{is due to the}} facts that (1) final demands are raised proportionally so that the original shares of the sectors become significant and (2) regional final demands are changed instead of <b>external</b> <b>demands</b> (exports). The changes in the values of South and Soso are entirely different from those in Fig.  7 because of their dependency on export industries. These movements may well indicate the end of the domestic reconstruction boom; further observations will be necessary for a definitive conclusion.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} organisational change {{processes that}} occur when accountability <b>demands</b> from powerful <b>external</b> stakeholders change. It investigates, firstly, whether these <b>external</b> accountability <b>demands</b> {{impact on the}} performance management systems of {{two different types of}} organisations. Secondly, it considers whether the goals for improved performance contained within the <b>external</b> accountability <b>demands</b> are realised. The paper derives its primary insights from analysing in-depth interviews with managers working in a private sector company and in public sector organisations. The analyses reveal complex organisational responses. In the public sector case study, the organisations tended to reorient their performance management systems towards the external accountability demands; whilst in the private sector organisation, pressures from falling share prices forced managers to focus their decision making on the preferred performance measures contained in shareholders’ accountability demands. However, whilst there is some evidence of performance management system changes, the desires for improved performance subsumed by the <b>external</b> accountability <b>demands</b> are not necessarily realised through the performance management system changes...|$|R

On the other hand, the modern university sees itself as a generator of new forms engaged with the advance of technological innovation and economic development in its region (Youtiea and Shapira 2008). In the context of innovation as a central issue, universities are simultaneously central generators, especially motivated by the <b>external</b> <b>demands,</b> and repositories of knowledge in our society. The way that knowledge is developed, disseminated and applied affects not only the cultural richness of the society, but also the global competitiveness.|$|R
