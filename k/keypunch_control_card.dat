40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} implementation {{details of a}} digitally controlled DC-DC converter that {{is used as a}} front end converter for solar inverter (DC-AC) application. It implements an isolated DC-DC stage with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm in order to utilize the full capacity of a 500 W solar panel. It maintains its input voltage at the reference set point generated by the MPPT algorithm and delivers power to a downstream DC-AC inverter when connected across its output. The DC-AC inverter transfers the power from the DC-DC stage to an emulated grid connected across its own output. A C 2000 Piccolo-B <b>control</b> <b>card</b> and a 500 W isolated DC-DC stage EVM are used to implement the complete DC-DC system.
