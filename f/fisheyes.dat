50|$|A fisheye lens is {{a special}} type of ultra-wide angle {{retrofocus}} lens {{with little or no}} attempt to correct for rectilinear distortion. Most <b>fisheyes</b> produce a circular image with a 180° field of view. The term fisheye comes from the supposition that a fish looking up at the sky would see in the same way.|$|E
50|$|Two other {{specialty}} lenses are the <b>fisheyes.</b> Two versions were produced. The 7.5mm 5.6 is {{a circular}} fisheye, rendering a 180 degree {{field of view}} in a 23mm image circle. It requires manual operation and stopped-down metering. The 15mm 2.8 is a full-frame fisheye, rendering a 180 degree field of view across the diagonal of the 35mm frame with the considerable barrel distortion of a fisheye lens. It includes all FD features and may be used with automatic exposure. Both lenses include internal filters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fisheye</b> lenses {{refer to}} ultra-wide angle lenses that have {{field of view}} equal or larger than 180 degrees. Such lenses {{introduce}} large amount of barrel distortion to capture at least the entire hemisphere {{in front of the}} lens. <b>Fisheye</b> lenses were initially designed for scientific use, such as cloud recording and angle measuring, and were widely used for commercial purposes later. The development of photographic <b>fisheye</b> lenses started in 1960 s. However, the lack of detailed references on photographic <b>fisheye</b> lens design makes such design challenging. This thesis provides detailed introduction of photographic <b>fisheye</b> lens design for 35 mm format DSLR cameras.

The performance of the current diagonal <b>fisheye</b> lenses for 35 mm DSLR cameras are evaluated in detail.

5000|$|The first {{types of}} fisheye lenses to be {{developed}} were [...] "circular fisheye" [...] — lenses which took in a 180° hemisphere and projected this as a circle within the film frame. Some circular <b>fisheyes</b> were available in orthographic projection models for scientific applications. These have a 180° vertical angle of view, and the horizontal and diagonal angle of view are also 180°. Most circular fisheye lenses cover a smaller image circle than rectilinear lenses, so {{the corners of the}} frame will be completely dark.|$|E
40|$|Fisheye views use {{distortion}} {{to provide}} both local detail and global context {{in a single}} continuous view. However, the distorted presentation can {{make it more difficult}} to interact with the data; it is therefore not clear whether fisheye views are good choices for interactive tasks. To investigate this question, we tested the effects of magnification and representation on user performance in a basic pointing activity called steering - where a user moves a pointer along a predefined path in the workspace. We looked specifically at magnified steering, where the entire path does not fit into one view. We tested three types of fisheye at several levels of distortion, and also compared the <b>fisheyes</b> with two non-distorting techniques. We found that increasing distortion did not reduce steering performance, and that the <b>fisheyes</b> were faster than the nondistorting techniques. Our results show that in situations where magnification is required, distortion-oriented views can be effective representations for interactive tasks...|$|E

The first gathered information about what memory strategies people choose at increasing levels of distortion, without presupposing any particular strategy. The second looked more closely at how two particular strategies (maintaining a mental map, and using landmarks in the data) affected memory performance.

40|$|As a community, human-computer {{information}} and interface designers {{have tended to}} avoid use of <b>fisheyes,</b> and multi-scale presentations with their attendant distortion because of concern about how this distortion may lead to confusion and misinterpretation.

We describe a study about relative difficulty in reading distortions that investigates the effect of the use viewing cues such as the cartographic grid and shading on people’s ability to interpret distortions.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{refinements}} {{to existing}} eye pointing techniques involving a fisheye lens. We use a fisheye lens and a video-based eye tracker to locally magnify the {{display at the}} point of the user’s gaze. Our gaze-contingent fisheye facilitates eye pointing and selection of magnified (expanded) targets. Two novel interaction techniques are evaluated for managing the fisheye, both dependent on real-time analysis of the user’s eye movements. Unlike previous attempts at gaze-contingent fisheye control, our key innovation is to hide the fisheye during visual search, and morph the fisheye into view as soon as the user completes a saccadic eye movement and has begun fixating a target. This style of interaction allows the user to maintain an overview of the desktop during search while selectively zooming in on the foveal region of interest during selection. Comparison of these interaction styles with ones where the fisheye is continuously slaved to the user’s gaze (omnipresent) or is not used to affect target expansion (nonexistent) shows performance benefits in terms of speed and accuracy.

Although several varieties of fisheye lens exist, {{little is known}} about how the different types fare for different interactive tasks. In this paper, we investigate one kind of interaction – layout of graphical objects – that can be problematic in <b>fisheyes.</b> Layout involves judgments of distance, alignment, and angle, all of which can be adversely affected by the distortion of a fisheye. We compared performance on layout tasks with three kinds of fisheye: a full-screen pyramid lens, a constrained hemispherical lens, and a constrained flat-topped hemisphere. We found that accuracy was significantly better with the constrained lenses compared to the full-screen lens, and also that the simple hemisphere was better at higher levels of distortion than the flat-topped version. The study shows that although there is a cost to doing layout through distortion, it is feasible, particularly with constrained lenses. In addition, our findings provide initial empirical evidence of the differences between competing fisheye varieties...|$|E

The historical information is added visually through visit wear, an extension of the concepts of edit wear and read wear. This will answer the question “Where have I been?” through visual instead of cognitive processing by overlaying new visual information on the data to indicate a user’s recent interaction history. This thesis describes general principles of visibility in a space that is distorted by a fisheye lens and defines some parameters of the design space of visit wear.

40|$|International {{audience}} 360 {{degree and}} spherical cameras become popular and are convenient for applications like immersive videos. They are often built by fixing together several fisheye cameras pointing in different directions. However their complete self-calibration {{is not easy}} since the consumer <b>fisheyes</b> are rolling shutter cameras which can be unsynchronized. Our approach {{does not require a}} calibration pattern. First the multi-camera model is initialized thanks to assumptions that are suitable to an omnidirectional camera without a privileged direction: the cameras have the same setting and are roughly equiangular. Second a frame-accurate synchronization is estimated from the instantaneous angular velocities of each camera provided by monocular structure-from-motion. Third both inter-camera poses and intrinsic parameters are refined using multi-camera structure-from-motion and bundle adjustment. Last we introduce a bundle adjustment that estimates not only the usual parameters but also a sub-frame-accurate synchronization and the rolling shutter.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In gigacycle fatigue regime (Very High Cycle Regime, Nf> 107 cycles), {{the cracks}} can {{nucleate}} on inclusions, “supergrains”, pores …which {{leads to a}} fish-eye propagation around the defect. The initiation from an inclusion or other defect is closed to the total life, perhaps much more than 99 % of the life in many cases. The integration of the Paris law allows one to predict the number of cycles at crack initiation. As the crack initiation appears, a short crack around the defect propagates followed by a long crack. In all cases, a cyclic plastic zone around the crack exists, and the recording of the surface temperature of the sample during the test must allow to follow the crack propagation and {{to determine the number}} of cycles at the crack initiation. A thermo-mechanical model was developed. It allows the determination of the temperature field evolution in the specimen and shows a good correlation with the experiments.
