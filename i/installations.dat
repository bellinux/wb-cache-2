In this paper <b>installation</b> process is optimized. According to the structural characteristics of vault plate, this paper proposes a new kind of <b>installation</b> guide equipment and analyses the process of guiding, which can help vault plate realizing itself position. The equipment can greatly improve the <b>installation</b> accuracy and working efficiency, and also can reduce the risk of <b>installation.</b> The technology of vault plate <b>installation</b> of LNG storage tank has important practical value and significance...|$|R
