40|$|The early 1990 s saw {{a kind of}} {{crystallisation}} in gaming aesthetics, {{centred on}} games that either squinted towards Gothic or outright claimed {{a place in the}} culture and tradition: Warhammer 40, 000 and Vampire: the Masquerade on the tabletop, Alone in the Dark and Wolfenstein on the PC. These games are genre-defining, persistent, and - to varying degrees - pretty damn Gothic. They’ve lasted for twenty, twenty-five years, and have carried their core aesthetic projects into the twenty-first century. Why? What is it about the Nineties ‘grimdark’ aesthetic that makes it last so long? To answer that question <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of these titles and establish its core 'negative aesthetic', establishing how Gothic shaped gameplay during the early 1990 s and beyond. I approach each in terms of aesthetic theory, {{following in the footsteps of}} Graeme Kirkpatrick by establishing literally how the games make us feel, and go on to collectively place them in the context of a recurring fin-de-siecle cultural moment which has previously seen the flowering of the Gothic novel and Decadent art/writing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study {{the ways in which}} Shelley’s lyrical drama, Hellas, has been received, and to show how the poem belongs within the Shelley canon, both structurally and thematically. Hellas is a drama inspired by the Greek insurrection against Turkey in the 1820 s, and the action is seen from the Turkish sultan Mahmud’s point of view. This enables Shelley to focus both on Turkish defeat, via Mahmud, and Greek victory, through the Chorus. The first chapter <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the sources of Hellas and how three major writers, Aeschylus, Milton and Calderon, influenced Shelley in his work. The second chapter is inspired by Jauss’s theory on the reader’s active participation in the reception of a work. I then go on to a general critical survey. Judging by available written material on Hellas, the work does not belong to Shelley’s more popular literary production. In chapter four and five I analyse the drama with specific attention to character and structure. Because the drama has little external action, I find it relevant to study the major characters: Mahmud, the protagonist, Hassan, Mahmud’s closest associate, the figure of the Wandering Jew, and the Chorus, with its soft and flowing poetry. In the structural analysis <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of the drama’s seven parts, and focus on symmetry and the chaos-order dichotomy. In my conclusion I argue that Hellas does not depart from Shelley’s usual style or themes. Even though the poet himself called it a mere improvise, I find that Hellas is a carefully designed and planned whole, where theme and structure are interwove...|$|R
40|$|The Special Composition Question {{asks for}} the jointly {{necessary}} and sufficient conditions for some material objects (say, some wooden slats) {{to compose a}} further material object (say,. a cupboard). The most popular philosophical answer is universalism: that the material objects always compose a further material object. This thesis attempts to rebut universalism, leaving me to take the more 'common-sense' positionth~t composition is restricted - that it sometimes takes place, and sometimes does not. Towards that end I offer my own response to the Special Composition.. Question: that the material objects compose a further object {{if and only if}} the object they composed would be causally efficacious. <b>At</b> <b>each</b> stage I tie these issues into the metaphysics of persistence i. e. whether objects 'endure' or 'perdure'. Ã‚Â§l is a general introduction, with a list ofmy assumptions. Ã‚Â§ 2 is an expositio~ofmereology (the logic of part and. whole), chorology (the logic of location), the theories of persistence. (endurantism/perdurantism) and some miscellaneous - but) mportant - issues in composition. InÃ‚Â§ 3 - Ã‚Â§ 5 I attempt to refute universalism. Given that there is an intuitive cost attached to universalism (such as the existence of the Eiffel Mahal - that whacky composite object composed out of the Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal), we should only accept universalism if there is sqme benefit in doing so. In those three chapters <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> alledged benefit, and argue that they fail to motivate universalism, thus we should conclude th~t it is false. In Ã‚Â§ 6 I motivate my own answer, and argue that contrary to first appearances it is not trivial and entails that a very popular position in metaphysics - the combination of perdurantism with the standard perdurantist analysis of temporary intrinsics must be false.

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{and immediately}} discusses the so-called ‘soft’ impossibility, i. e., non-logical impossibility generated by modal realism. It {{will be shown}} that although in a particular case genuine modal realism, straightforwardly applied, deems impossible a proposition that other philosophers have claimed to be (intuitively) possible, there is a variety of methodologically acceptable moves available {{in order to avoid}} the problem. The impossibility at issue is the existence of island universes. Given the Lewisian analysis there are three points at which we might try to square genuine modal realism with such a controversial and problematic claim of (im) possibility, namely: a) the contraction of our pre-theoretical opinions about possibility, b) the revision of some Lewisian definitions and/or c) the extension of our ontological commitments. <b>I</b> shall <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of these approaches applied to the problematic case...|$|R
40|$|Start-up {{problems}} for a journal include attracting authors and building initial readership, but challenges {{further down the}} line include building visibility and maintaining credibility. One of the key strategies {{in this regard is}} indexing. According to the literature, the main reasons for having a journal indexed or listed in an abstracting service relate to visibility, and to quality, in terms of credibility and prestige. In this paper, <b>I</b> will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of these in more detail. For concrete examples, I will draw upon my experience with indexing an interdisciplinary journal in the social sciences, Africa Insight, of which I am currently the editor. Our experience, in a nutshell, has been that getting the journal indexed does create more visibility, and that it certainly confers some credibility – but it has had little effect on the bottom-line of subscriptions and sales...|$|R
