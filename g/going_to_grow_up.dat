[...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{does not}} follow, however, {{that there are}} many novelle which, if they were duly padded, would be found novelettes. In that dim, {{subjective}} region where the aesthetic origins present themselves almost with the authority of inspirations there is nothing clearer than the difference between the short-story motive and the long-story motive. One, if one is in that line of work, feels instinctively just the size and carrying power of the given motive. Or, if the reader prefers a different figure, the mind which the seed has been dropped into from Somewhere is mystically aware whether the seed is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> a bush or is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> a tree, if left to itself. Of course, the mind to which the seed is intrusted may play it false, and wilfully dwarf the growth, or force it to unnatural dimensions; but the critical observer will easily detect the fact of such treasons. Almost in the first germinal impulse the inventive mind forefeels the ultimate difference and recognizes the essential simplicity or complexity of the motive. There will be a prophetic subdivision into a variety of motives and a multiplication of characters and incidents and situations; or the original motive will be divined indivisible, {{and there will be a}} small group of people immediately interested and controlled by a single, or predominant, fact. The uninspired may contend that this is bosh, and I own that something might be said for their contention, but upon the whole I think it is gospel.|$|E

40|$|Propagation {{formulae}} for axisymmetric {{shock wave}} in a continuous, inhomogeneous medium are newly derived through hydrodynamic considerations on {{state of the}} flow im-mediately behind the shock, {{with the use of}} orthogonality conditions between shock-rays and their fronts as well as the shock relations. Quasi-stationary velocity of isentropic flow in a steady gravitation is approximately assumed. The method is applied to an explosion of a highly rotating oblate star. From the com-putational results, we · see that the validity of our approximation of quasi-stationary velocity is restricted to the case in which incidence-angle of ray on an equi-density surface is com-paratively small, less than the so-called critical angle. Within the validity, it is shown that shocks <b>going</b> <b>to</b> higher latitudes <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> more rapidly than to lower latitudes. Further, it is proposed that unsteady flow behind the steeply inclined strong shock will produce strong vorticity and the shock may become absolutely unstable. 83 Recently the propagation of shock wave due to a point explosion become...|$|R

He enrolled at the Royal College of Music in February 1897 at the rather advanced age of 35 and stayed for three terms only, studying composition with Charles Villiers Stanford and Walter Parratt. Baker's Dictionary also says that Butler travelled extensively and spent some time in India, where his opera Muirgheis was written, but it is not certain whether these travels took place before or after his London studies. A song composition published in Dublin in 1900 is dedicated to [...] "His Highness Rajendrah Singh, Maharajah of Patiala" [...] (see 'Selected works'). In an obituary, the Kerry Evening Post confirms that Muirgheis was written in Kashmir, northern India. After around 1900 he mainly lived in Kilmashogue, in the mountains above Rathfarnham, Dublin, in a house he had called Muirgheis.|$|R

So we're trying to refocus that back. But there's always temptation and you want to explore it. You want {{to have the opportunity to}} explore it. And the second you start getting too involved in it, it's like any plot line. You go in; it's very hard to get out and it takes a little longer."
