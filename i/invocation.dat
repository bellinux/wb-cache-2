40|$|Asynchronous <b>invocations</b> are an {{important}} functionality {{in the context of}} distributed object frameworks, because in many situations clients should not block during remote <b>invocations.</b> There should be a loose coupling between clients and remote services. Popular web service frameworks, such as Apache Axis, offer only synchronous <b>invocations</b> (over HTTP). An alternative are messaging protocols but these implement a different communication paradigm...|$|R

5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a more direct <b>invocation</b> of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E

50|$|This {{is another}} correct {{sequential}} history. It {{is also a}} linearization! Note that the definition of linearizability only precludes responses that precede <b>invocations</b> from being reordered; since the original history had no responses before <b>invocations,</b> we can reorder it as we wish. Hence the original history is indeed linearizable.|$|R
50|$|Tuxedo {{applications}} {{can request}} that all service <b>invocations</b> and their associated updates to any resources controlled by resource managers (such as databases) {{be controlled by}} a transaction. Once the application begins a transaction, all subsequent service <b>invocations</b> and nested <b>invocations</b> are included {{as part of that}} transaction, even those services that were executed on remote domains. Tuxedo then coordinates the commit processing with the resource managers to ensure atomic updates to all affected resources. Transactions can be controlled by the application or automatically controlled by the Tuxedo configuration, i.e., container managed transactions.|$|R

5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether <b>invocation</b> of Miranda rights {{could be}} implied from the behavior or ambiguous {{words of the}} accused. It concluded (in line with previous cases such as Davis v. United States) that there was good reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act of the accused, including certainty for police, prosecutors, and accused, and social benefit in law enforcement.|$|E

5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One <b>invocation</b> to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E

5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a class can implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one <b>invocation</b> on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|E
5|$|Commencement weekend {{begins on}} Friday {{afternoon}} {{as members of}} the senior class gather in the upper church of Saint Anselm Abbey for the annual honors convocation. The senior academic honors convocation begins with an <b>invocation,</b> said by the Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey, and is followed by the conferral of academic awards, read by the Dean of the College. Virtually every academic department has an award to present to a senior of that major. Next the President of the college awards each Summa Cum Laude graduate; within this elite group the Chancellor's medal is awarded to the graduate with the highest academic grade point average.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>invocation</b> and the {{performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
