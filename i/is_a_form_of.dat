It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable {{due to lack of}} food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E

There are some dwarf forms available for the city gardener – 'Stumpy Gold' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> variety collina originally from the Central Coast, while 'Birthday Candles', 'Coastal Cushion' and 'Golden Cascade' are forms of variety spinulosa from the South Coast of New South Wales.|$|E

From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.|$|E
