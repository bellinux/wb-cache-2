40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} method for blind {{identification}} of finite impulse response (FIR) channels with periodic modulation. The time-domain formulation in terms of block signals is simple compared with existing frequency-domain formulations. It is shown that the linear equations relating the products of channel coefficients and the autocorrelation matrix of the received signal can <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>arranged</b> into decoupled groups. The arrangement reduces computations and improves accuracy of the solution; it also leads to very simple identifiability conditions and a very natural formulation of the optimal modulating sequence selection problem. The proposed optimal selection minimizes the effects of channel noise and error in autocorrelation matrix estimation; it results in a consistent channel estimate when the channel noise is white. Simulation {{results show that the}} method yields good performance: It compares favorably with an existing subspace modulation-induced-cyclostationarity method, and it is robust with respect to channel order overestimation. The effect of modulation period and threshold of the modulating sequence are also discussed. Index Terms—Blind identification, periodic modulation pre-coder, transmitter induced cyclostationarity.

Premenopausal women <b>were</b> <b>further</b> <b>arranged</b> in to two different age group of 22 - 45 years and above 45 years of age.

The request was made at the very moment when the marriage was decided on between the Archduchess Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin of France; and the empress, in acceding to it, strongly recommended the Prince of Arenberg to her daughter.
