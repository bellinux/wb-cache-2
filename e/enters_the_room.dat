5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him.

25|$|The {{church of}} Bintaran {{was founded by}} H. van Driessche to {{accommodate}} the increasing amount of Catholics in Yogyakarta as Kidul Loji Church could not accommodate them anymore. It was designed by J.H. van Oten BNA and the construction was executed by Hollandsche Beton Maatschappij in 1931 on the Kampementstraat (now Bintaran Kidul). The church was designed by Father H. Van Driessche and Mr. Dawoed specifically for the Javanese people, as Javanese people at that time {{were not used to}} attend religious ritual in a Western-style building (e.g. sitting on bench, long narrow room) because of the fabric they used. St. Joseph Church of Bintaran is 36 meters by 20 meters long, and the height is 13 meters. The church is white following the color of the surrounding buildings. The mass bench is only located at the back side, where the Europeans and Javanese upper class usually sat. The front part of this are mattress made of bamboo for the Javanese mass service to sit upon. Sun light <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> through 72 double roosters instead of windows.|$|E

Draco shows Mr. Borgin {{something on his}} arm that Harry believes to be the Dark Mark, Voldemort's sign, though whether or not Harry is correct is never confirmed. (In the film version Draco Malfoy shows Dumbledore the Dark Mark on his arm.) On the Hogwarts Express, Harry invisibly spies on Draco and overhears him discussing Voldemort's task with several other Slytherins. Draco knows Harry is present and, once alone in the compartment, immobilises him and breaks his nose causing Harry to hate Draco even more. Harry is left stranded on the train until Nymphadora Tonks (Luna Lovegood in the film adaptation) rescues him. Harry spends {{much of the year}} trailing Draco's whereabouts on his Marauder's Map, but loses track of him once Draco <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Requirement. When Katie Bell is almost killed in Hogsmeade after handling a cursed necklace and Ron nearly dies by drinking poisoned mead, Harry suspects Draco is behind both attacks.|$|E
