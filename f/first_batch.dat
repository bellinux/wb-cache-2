5|$|As with Joking Apart, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk {{for independent}} production company Pola Jones. The positive {{reaction of the}} studio audience during recording of the first series in 1996 propelled executives to commission {{a second set of}} six episodes before the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> had aired.|$|E
5|$|Greenewalt {{favored the}} bismuth {{phosphate}} process {{due to the}} corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants. Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> was processed at 40% efficiency {{but over the next}} few months this was raised to 90%.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of {{aircraft}} arrived in South Africa in September 1919 at the Artillery Depot at Roberts Heights, Pretoria where an Air Depot was established on 1 January 1920. The combined facility was {{then known as}} the Aircraft and Artillery Depot.|$|E
50|$|After {{twenty years}} of working as a {{consultant}} winemaker both in Argentina and around the world, Susana Balbo decided to open her own winery. In 1999, Susana rented a small winery and began her <b>first</b> <b>batches</b> of wine. Initially the production was quite small. The <b>first</b> <b>batches</b> of the Susana Balbo and Ben Marco lines were released in August 2000.|$|R

5|$|Ilyushin began {{construction}} of another prototype to evaluate this solution {{and this was}} endorsed on 16 October 1954 when the Council of Ministers ordered production to begin at Factory (Zavod) No. 168 at Rostov-on-Don of the improved version, designated as the Il-40P. The Il-40P prototype first flew on 14 February 1955 and began State acceptance trials on 12 October 1955. The changes had resolved all the problems suffered by the earlier design and an order for a <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of forty production machines was placed.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} battery-powered back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later noticed it, and after the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.|$|E
5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E

5|$|The LSWR N15 {{class was}} a British 2cylinder 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} steam locomotive designed by Robert W. Urie. The class has a complex build history spanning three sub-classes and {{eight years of}} construction from 1919 to 1926. The <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of the class was constructed for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), where they hauled heavy express trains to the south coast ports and further west to Exeter. After the Lord Nelsons they were the second biggest express passenger locomotives in the Southern Railway.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of Phantoms {{produced}} for the UK received serials in the XT range, {{with a total}} of 44 production models (20 FG.1s and 24 FGR.2s), as well as the four prototypes and two pre-production models being given XT serial numbers. The bulk of the UK's specially built Phantoms were delivered with XV serials (94 FGR.2s and 28 FG.1s), while the two cancelled sets of airframes (32 FGR.2 and 7 FG.1) also received XV numbers. The second-hand examples (15 F.3) obtained in 1984 received serials in the ZE range.|$|E

50|$|The 5000 series {{units have}} fully {{automatic}} Scharfenberg couplers as standard {{instead of the}} <b>first</b> <b>batch's</b> semi-automatic knuckle couplers, and LED lamps for headlights and interior lighting instead of halogen bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Both changes are being retrofitted to the 4000 series units.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} start the diesel motor, {{it has to be}} pre-heated. The <b>first</b> <b>batches</b> had a small coke oven (later ones used an oil burner) and, for that reason, the {{locomotive}} carried up to 150 kg of coke. The Class 362/363 engines had an electrically-controlled preheater and heat retention system.|$|R
5|$|The first {{production}} batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at the separation plant on 26 December 1944, and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles, where {{he handed it}} over to another courier, who {{took it to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory. Plutonium from Hanford would be used in the Fat Man bomb used in the bombing of Nagasaki. For his wartime services, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Uncharted {{received}} several accolades from web review {{sites such as}} Kotaku and IGN, who named it their PlayStation 3 game of the year. The game went on to sell one million copies after its first ten weeks of retail, and later {{became one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of titles to be released as part of Europe's budget Platinum range of best-selling titles.|$|E
5|$|But {{the real}} reason was that the {{production}} had financial issues, with the acquisition of new crew members {{and the increase in}} popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed {{to come out of the}} original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to rising costs.|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013, Alamogordo's City Commission {{approved}} {{a deal for}} Canada-based film production company Fuel Industries to excavate the Atari landfill site. Fuel Entertainment partnered with Xbox Entertainment Studios and Lightbox to make a documentary about the 1983 massive game burial of Atari games, said {{to be one of}} the gaming culture's greatest urban legends. On April 26, 2014, video game archaeologists began sifting through years of trash from the old Alamogordo landfill. The <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of E.T. games was discovered after about three hours of digging, and hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. In the deal between the City of Alamogordo and Fuel Entertainment regarding the excavation, Fuel Entertainment was to be given 250 games or 10 percent of what was found.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of fifteen {{locomotives}} in March 1928, {{but this was}} reduced to ten when {{it became apparent that}} they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route. Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were not delivered until between March and July 1930. Once the original batch had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934. A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order, but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression. The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935.|$|E

5|$|Production on the Smith Guns {{began in}} late 1941, but {{problems}} with their manufacture meant {{that it was not}} until mid-1942 that the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> were delivered to the Home Guard; by the beginning of 1943, a total of 3,049 Smith Guns had been issued to Home Guard units. Production problems also affected the ammunition for the weapons; a delay in manufacturing anti-tank ammunition meant that each weapon was only supplied with six or seven rounds. A number of Smith Guns were also issued to regular army units tasked with guarding airfields. Soon after issue a malfunction causing an explosion resulting in the death of Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment. Similar incidents followed and all Smith Guns were withdrawn from RAF Regiment units in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Turboliners were {{a family}} of gas turbine {{trainsets}} built for Amtrak in the 1970s. They {{were among the first}} new equipment purchased by Amtrak to update its fleet with faster, more modern trains. The <b>first</b> <b>batch,</b> known as RTG, were built by the French firm ANF and entered service on multiple routes in the Midwestern United States in 1973. The new trains led to ridership increases wherever used, but the fixed consist proved a detriment as demand outstripped supply. The high cost of operating the trains led to their withdrawal from the Midwest in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} {{gained by}} Maunsell's modifications {{showed in the}} improved performance of the <b>first</b> <b>batch</b> of Maunsell S15s over their Urie-built predecessors. A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
