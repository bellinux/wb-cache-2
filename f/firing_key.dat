5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic <b>Firing</b> <b>Key.</b> When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand <b>Firing</b> <b>Key.</b> It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E

5000|$|Pointer : [...] Controls the mount's {{elevation}} and firing. He sits in {{the left}} front corner of the mount. In front of him, are his optical sight, hand wheels, and elevation drive controls. To his right, about elbow high, is a large box called the Elevation Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the elevation power drive. Through a window {{on top of the}} box, he sees a set of dials that indicate the elevation of the gun, and the automatic elevation orders coming from the Fire Control System. Above the Indicator Regulator is the Electrical Fire Select Switch. It is a rotary switch with three positions: Off, Local, and Auto. Off disables the electrical firing system on the mount. Local enables the electric <b>firing</b> <b>key</b> on his right hand wheel. Auto enables the off mount electrical firing circuit from the Fire Control System. Just outside his right knee, is the Percussion Select Lever. This mechanical lever has two positions: Safe, and Armed. When it is in the armed position, the mechanical linkage for percussion firing is enabled. His right footrest is at one end of this linkage, and the firing pin sear in the breech block is at the other. By rocking his right foot forward, he fires the gun. Electrical firing is the primary firing method. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials tell him the difference between the gun's present elevation and the ordered elevation electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. He changes the elevation of the gun, by moving his hand wheels, until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the elevation drive into Auto. This disengages his hand wheels, and gives elevation control to the Fire Control System. Then, he moves the Electrical Fire Select Switch to [...] "AUTO", and reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Elevation in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the elevation drive and the Electrical Fire Select Switch to local. In local control, he controls the gun's elevation with his hand wheels to keep his sight's horizontal cross hair on the target. At the command of the Mount Captain, he fires the gun by squeezing the <b>firing</b> <b>key</b> on his right hand wheel.|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{synchronization}} is {{ubiquitous in}} the nervous system, yet its functional role for information processing is still unclear. Because of the leak current, two input spikes {{are more likely}} to make a postsynaptic neuron fire when they are synchronous. This coincidence detection property has been demonstrated in vivo for thalamocortical processing [1], but the theory of coincidence detection in neurons with in vivo-like synaptic activity is still sparse. We estimated the extra probability for a noisy neuron to fire a spike in response to two synchronous input spikes compared to two distant spikes. Using a simple probabilistic approach, we were able to quantify this extra probability for spiking models {{as a function of the}} background noise and the shape of postsynaptic potentials. Our predictions agreed well with numerical simulations. We found that neurons act as coincidence detectors when excitation and inhibition are balanced, as in cortical neurons in vivo, but not in the mean-driven regime. In the balanced regime, coincident spikes can be several times more efficient than distant spikes in realistic situations. We conclude that in cortical neurons, the relative timing of presynaptic spikes has a major impact on postsynaptic <b>firing.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS Synchrony, coincidence detection, spiking neuro...|$|E

40|$|Although neurons often fire in bursts, {{most of what}} {{is known}} about {{glutamate}} signaling and postsynaptic receptor activation is based on experiments using single stimuli. Here we examine the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by bursts at the parallel fiber to stellate cell synapse. We show that brief stim-ulus trains generate prolonged AMPA receptor (AMPAR) - and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) -mediated EPSCs recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp. These EPSCs contrast with the rapid AMPAR-mediated EPSC evoked by a single stimulus. The pro-longed AMPAR-mediated EPSC is promoted by high-frequency and high-intensity trains and can persist for hundreds of milli-seconds. This EPSC is also increased by L-trans- 2, 4 -PDC, an inhibitor of glutamate transporters, suggesting that these trans-porters usually limit the synaptic response to trains. These prolonged EPSCs reflect both receptor properties and a long-lasting glutamate signal. In addition, several experiments dem-onstrate that glutamate spillover can contribute to receptor activation. First, imaging stimulus-evoked changes in presyn-aptic calcium establishes that distinct parallel fiber bands can be activated. Second, activation of parallel fibers that do not directly synapse onto a given stellate cell can evoke indirect AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in that cell. Third, ex-periments using the use-dependent NMDAR blocker MK- 801 show that these indirect EPSCs reflect glutamate spillover in response to trains. Together, these findings indicate that stim-ulus trains can generate a sustained and widespread glutamate signal that can in turn evoke large and prolonged EPSCs me-diated by ionotropic glutamate receptors.

For most of these people, craft production is a sole source of income. In 1982, a group of economists, anthropologists and sociologists of the Universidad Católica of Lima created Allpa to improve living standards of handicrafts producers. Allpa began active work as an alternative trading organization in 1986. In September 2010 R Winter undertook a short trip (7 days) to Lima R Winter and Allpa used this trip to research and establish where design and technical consultation would be of most benefit. Although very short, this trip was invaluable and gave Robert Winter an insight into the capabilities of the potteries concerned. R Winter concluded that the potteries are well equipped with all suitable materials and equipment for hand and cast made pottery. However it was foreseen that other techniques and alternative production methods which may be introduced may need additional equipment and perhaps support from Allpa, Traidcraft and The University of Sunderland 2011 Workshop/Trip The workshop covered three distinct areas of interest: 	A design and making workshop was delivered at the Chullucanas pottery and a shorter design and making workshop at the Lima pottery.
