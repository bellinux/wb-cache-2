We studied the question for families of curves in another paper. To construct them, we will start by describing the pro-(p') tempered fundamental group of a smooth and proper variety with polystable reduction in terms of the reduction endowed with its log structure, thus defining tempered <b>fundamental</b> groups for <b>log</b> polystable varieties...|$|R
40|$|The {{tempered}} fundamental {{group of}} a p-adic analytic space classifies coverings that {{are dominated by}} a topological covering (for the Berkovich topology) of a finite etale covering of the space. Here we construct cospecialization homomorphisms between (p') versions of the tempered fundamental groups of the fibers of a smooth family of curves with semistable reduction. To do so, we will translate our problem in terms of cospecialization morphisms of fundamental groups of the log fibers of the log reduction. In particular, {{we will have to}} study invariance of the geometric <b>log</b> <b>fundamental</b> group of saturated log smooth log schemes over a log point by change of log point...|$|R
40|$|Pursuant to the authors' {{previous}} chaotic-dynamical {{model for}} random digits of fundamental constants [3], we investigate a complementary, statistical picture in which pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are central. Some rigorous results {{such as the}} following are achieved: Whereas the <b>fundamental</b> constant <b>log</b> 2 = P n 2 Z + 1 =(n 2 n) is not yet known to be 2 -normal (i. e. normal to base 2), we are able to establish b-normality (and transcendency) for constants of the form P 1 =(nb n) but with the index n constrained to run over certain subsets of Z +. In this way we demonstrate, for example, that the constant 2; 3 = P n= 3; 3 2; 3 3;::: 1 =(n 2 n) is 2 -normal. The constants share with; log 2 and others the property that isolated digits can be directly calculated, but for the new class such computation is extraordinarily rapid. For example, we find that the googol-th (i. e. 10 100 - th) binary bit of 2; 3 is 0. We also present a collection of other results [...] such as density results and irrationality proofs based on PRNG ideas [...] for various special numbers...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{internal}} structure of pulsating Herbig Ae stars by {{the aim of}} an asteroseismological study will help us to constrain {{the origin of the}} tremendous activity, wind and variability observed in this group of pre-main sequence stars. The time-series analysis of the equivalent photospheric profiles of HD 104237 has revealed non-radial pulsations of low-degree (ℓ = 0 or 1). We present a preliminary mode identification corresponding to the main detected frequency f 1 = 33. 289 c/d. In addition, as we need to constrain a stellar atmosphere model in order to simulate the pulsations of HD 104237, our aim is to determine accurately its <b>fundamental</b> parameters (Teff, <b>log</b> g, abundances); as this study is still in progress, we present our strategy.

We combine high S/N optical spectra and fully-blanketed non-LTE model atmospheres to derive its <b>fundamental</b> parameters (Teff, <b>log</b> g) and helium abundance. Our best fits indicate Teff = 63 000 K, log g= 6. 0 and log N(He) /N(H) =- 1. 8. We also use available ultraviolet spectra (IUE and FUSE) to measure metal abundances. We find the star to be enriched in iron and nickel {{by a factor of}} ten with respect to the solar values, while lighter elements have subsolar abundances. The FUSE spectrum suggests that the spectral lines could be broadened by rotation.

40|$|Abductive {{reasoning}} (or simply abduction) {{is a form}} {{of logical}} inference that aims to derive plausible explanations for data. The term "abduction" was first coined by Charles Sanders Peirce who distinguished it as a fundamental form of logical inference alongside deduction and induction. Recently, abductive reasoning has begun to attract increasing interest within the field of Artificial Intelligence. In this paper we attempt to present some preliminary ideas regarding the notion of abduction within the framework of conceptual graphs. We propose a definition of abduction in terms of conceptual graphs. A simple method for determining abductions of a restricted type of conceptual graph is suggested. We also present a process which may be useful in increasing the number of possible abductions determined by this method.

40|$|We used {{high-quality}} Kepler photometry and {{spectroscopic data}} {{to investigate the}} Kepler binary candidate KIC 5988140. Using the spectrum synthesis method, we derived the <b>fundamental</b> parameters Teff, <b>log</b> g, [M/H], and v. sini and the abundances. Frequency analyses of both the photometric and the spectroscopic data were performed, revealing the same two dominant frequencies (F_ 1 = 0. 688 and F_ 2 = 0. 344 c/d). We also detected in the photometry the signal of nine more, significant frequencies located in the typical range of Delta Scuti pulsation. The light and radial velocity curves follow a similar, stable double-wave pattern which are not exactly in anti-phase but show a relative phase shift of about 0. 1 period between the moment of minimum velocity and that of maximum light. We considered three different scenarios: binarity, co-existence of both Gamma Doradus and Delta Scuti pulsations and rotation of the stellar surface with an axisymmetric intensity distribution. However, none of these scenarios is capable of explaining all {{of the characteristics of}} the observed variations. We confirm the occurrence of various independent Delta Scuti-type pressure modes in the Kepler light curve. With respect to the low-frequency content, however, we argue that the physical cause of the remaining light and radial velocity variations of this late A-type star remains unexplained by any of the presently considered scenarios.

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} effects of {{convection}} on the theoretical uvby colours of A, F, and G stars. The standard mixinglength theory atlas 9 models of Kurucz (1993), with and without approximate overshooting, are compared to models using the turbulent convection theory proposed by Canuto & Mazzitelli (1991, 1992) and implemented by Kupka (1996 a). Comparison with <b>fundamental</b> Teff and <b>log</b> g stars reveals that the Canuto & Mazzitelli models give results that are generally superior to standard mixing-length theory (MLT) without convective overshooting. MLT models with overshooting {{are found to be}} clearly discrepant. This is supported by comparisons of non-fundamental stars, with Teff obtained from the Infrared Flux Method and log g from stellar evolutionary models for open cluster stars. The Canuto & Mazzitelli theory gives values of (b − y) 0 and c 0 that are in best overall agreement with observations. Investigations of the m 0 index reveal that all of the treatments of convection presented here give values that are significantly discrepant for models with Teff < 6000 K. It is unclear as to whether this is due to problems with the treatment of convection, missing opacity, or some other reason. None of the models give totally satisfactory m 0 indices for hotter stars, but the Canuto & Mazzitelli models are in closest overall agreement above 7000 K. Grids of uvby colours, based on the CM treatment of convection, are presented. These grids represent an improvement over the colours obtained from models using the mixing-length theory. The agreement with fundamental stars enables the colours to be used directly without the need for semi-empirical adjustments that were necessary with the earlier colour grids...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{metallicity}} and evolution on the appearance of the Be phenomenon in the B stars population, we observed several fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) which have different metallicities. Thanks to the FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-fibres spectrograph on the VLT-UT 2, we obtained spectra of 520 stars in the LMC-NGC 2004 and SMC-NGC 330 regions. We used 2 settings at medium resolution: R= 8600 for the red setting which contains Hα and R= 6400 for the blue setting which contains Hγ, Hδ, He I 4026, 4388, 4471 ˚A. The latter setting was used to obtain fundamental parameters of the stars by fitting the observed spectrum with theoretical spectra. We used TLUSTY (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) to compute a grid of model atmospheres with abundance adopted from Korn et al. (2002) for the LMC and from Jasniewicz & Thévenin (1994) for the SMC. Thanks to the GIRFIT code (Frémat et al. 2005 a), we obtained the <b>fundamental</b> parameters Teff, <b>log</b> g, V sin i and radial velocity (RV) for each star of the samples. We took into account {{the effects of}} fast rotation (stellar flattening and gravitational darkening) for Be stars to correct their apparent fundamental parameters. Then we compared the rotational velocities between fields and clusters in the SMC and in the LMC respectively, between the LMC and the SMC, and between the MC and the Milky Way (MW). The results show an increase in Vsini with decreasing metallicity in B and Be stars populations. The evolutionary status and ages of Be stars were also investigated. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
40|$|Stellar {{pulsation}} {{offers a}} unique opportunity to constrain the intrinsic parameters of stars and unveil their inner structure. The Kepler satellite is collecting an enormous amount of data of unprecedent photometric precision, which will allow us to test theory and obtain a very precise tomography of stellar interiors. We attempt to determine the stars' <b>fundamental</b> parameters Teff, <b>log</b> g, v sin i, and luminosity needed for computing asteroseismic models and interpreting Kepler data. We report spectroscopic observations of 23 early-type Kepler asteroseismic targets, 13 other stars in the Kepler field, that had not been selected to be observed. We measured the radial velocity by performing a cross-correlation with template spectra to help us identify non-single stars. Spectral synthesis was performed to derive the stellar parameters of our target stars, and the state-of-the-art LTE atmospheric models were computed. For all the stars of our sample, we derived the radial velocity, Teff, log g, v sin i, and luminosities. For 12 stars, we performed a detailed abundance analysis of 20 species, for 16, we could derive only the [Fe/H] ratio. A spectral classification was also performed for 17 stars in the sample. We identify two double-lined spectroscopic binaries, HIP 96299 and HIP 98551, the former of which is an already known eclipsing binary, and two single-lined spectroscopic binaries, HIP 97254 and HIP 97724. We also report two suspected spectroscopic binaries, HIP 92637 and HIP 96762, and the detection of a possible variability in the radial velocity of HIP 96277. Two of our program stars are chemically peculiar, namely HIP 93941, which we classify as B 2 He-weak, and HIP 96210, which we classify as B 6 HgMn. Finally, we find that HIP 93522, HIP 93941, HIP 93943, HIP 96210 and HIP 96762, are very slow rotators which makes them very interesting and promising targets for asteroseismic modeling.
