40|$|Objective: Reconstruction of {{a breast}} after mastectomy using the {{contralateral}} lower pole <b>breast</b> <b>flap</b> is an appealing procedure because {{it uses the}} tissues {{that were going to}} be excised during reduction of the sound breast to achieve symmetry. Literature mentioned that these flaps are supplied by the lower internal mammary artery perforators (IMAPs) with no further details. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the site, size, and number of the 4 th and 5 th IMAPs by using preoperative color Duplex ultrasound and intraoperative exploration. Method: Twenty breasts in 10 patients who presented for reduction mammoplasty were included in this study. Preoperative color duplex was used to determine IMAPs in the 4 th and 5 th intercostal spaces. These perforators were localized intraoperatively. Intravenous fluorescein injection was used to determine the perfusion of the lower pole <b>breast</b> <b>flap</b> on the basis of these perforators. Results: Statistically, the 4 th IMAPs diameters were significantly larger than the 5 th IMAPs diameters (P <. 05). The lower pole <b>breast</b> <b>flap</b> was perfused through these perforators. Conclusion: Color Duplex ultrasound is an accurate tool to preoperatively determine the 4 th and 5 th IMAPs. Breast reconstruction following mastectomy is a feasible option to help in restoring the body’s shape and image of the afflicted women. There are multiple surgical procedures for the reconstruction of the female breast, including the use of a mammary prosthesis (implant) or various autologous tissues. Theoretically, regarding autologous reconstruction, the lowest donor site morbidity could be achieved by using tissue that would be otherwise rejected during an operation necessary for a different reason. Adoption of this principle was the cause behind the introduction of the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous <b>flap</b> for <b>breast</b> reconstruction. 1, 2 Likewise, in properly selected postmastectomy patients in whom th...|$|R

40|$|Breast {{reconstruction}} with autologous free tissue {{transfer is}} a widely established technique con-sidered to be the “gold standard. ” 1, 2 The leading cause of return to theater after deep inferior epi-gastric flap reconstruction is hematoma occurring in the chest wall, reported in 1. 2 – 2 % 1, 3 cases. Most breast reconstructive surgeons would therefore con-sider suction drains under the newly reconstructed breast a mandatory step to minimize this complica-tion from occurring, as a hematoma could compress the flap pedicle compromising venous output and possibly even arterial input leading to partial or total flap necrosis. The drains are commonly placed away from the pedicle and site of anastomosis; however, the drain tubing can in theory migrate directly injur-ing or compressing the pedicle and/or causing dam-age through the suction forces. We describe a simple technique to safely secure the breast drain tubing to prevent migration and hence protect the anastomotic site and pedicle af-ter free tissue transfer breast reconstruction. In this technique, two 10 -gauge suction drains are used, one for the upper <b>breast</b> mastectomy <b>flap</b> {{and one for the}} lower <b>breast</b> mastectomy <b>flap.</b> The drains are inserted before vessel exposure and after achiev-ing meticulous hemostasis of the <b>breast</b> mastectomy <b>flaps.</b> Each drain is secured to the inner aspect of the <b>breast</b> mastectomy <b>flap</b> by a loose loop of absorbable monofilament 3 / 0 suture under direct vision.

40|$|Introduction: Women {{undergoing}} unilateral deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction may {{be offered}} a contralateral symmetrisation {{either at the}} time of reconstruction (simultaneous/immediate) or at a later stage (delayed). Simultaneous contralateral breast symmetrisation may be more beneficial to patients and healthcare institutions by avoiding staged surgery, although there is limited evidence on which to base practice. This deficit formed the rationale for our study. The primary outcome was the overall rate of revision surgery. Methods: Over a 6 -year period, this prospective cohort study recorded the demographics, cancer treatments and operative outcomes of all consecutive unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstructions with or without contralateral symmetrising surgery. Patients were categorised into three groups: (1) simultaneous symmetrisation, 2) delayed symmetrisation and (3) no symmetrisation for comparative analysis. Results: During the study period, 371 women underwent unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction 194 (52. 3 %) were not symmetrised, 155 (41. 8 %) were simultaneously symmetrised and 22 (5. 9 %) underwent delayed symmetrisation. Simultaneous symmetrisation of the contralateral breast and unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction increased the mean total operative time by 28 min. There were no differences in the rates of peri-operative complications. There were significantly higher rates of all-cause revision surgery (OR 3. 97 [1. 58, 9. 94], p = 0. 003) in women undergoing delayed symmetrisation, because of higher rates of revision lipomodelling, scar revision and revision contralateral symmetrisation. Conclusion: Simultaneous contralateral breast symmetrisation was associated with a lower risk of all-cause revision surgery.

40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{postoperative}} radiotherapy following autologous <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction is controversial. The {{aim of this}} study was to measure whether adjuvant radiotherapy following immediate deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) free <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction affected <b>flap</b> volume. Methods: Sixty-eight women underwent immediate autologous DIEP flap reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. Twenty-two of the 68 received postoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks). Intraoperative flap volume data were collected prospectively. Volumetric assessment was carried out a minimum of 1 year after surgery. Patients who had volume adjustment surgery after initial reconstruction were analysed separately. Results: The mean age of the women was 52 (range 37 - 69) years and median follow-up was 3. 5 (range 1 - 10) years. There was no statistically significant difference in volume change between patients who had and those who did not have postreconstruction radiotherapy for the whole cohort (median reduction 65 versus 0 ml) or when women who had undergone further volume adjustment surgery were excluded. Conclusion: In this study postoperative radiotherapy did not significantly affect breast volume after DIEP flap reconstruction.

No studies have investigated what impact {{the use of the}} internal mammary artery in free abdominal <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction has on abdominal skin perfusion. We hypothesized that harvesting the internal mammary vessels (IMV) has a negative effect on abdominal skin perfusion. Methods:. The abdomen and anterior thoracic wall of 17 patients scheduled for secondary free abdominal <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction using IMV was pre-, intra-, and postoperatively examined with dynamic infrared thermography. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the rate and pattern of recovery in Huger’s vascular zones were made with each patient being its own control. Zone III on the side where IMV were used was numbered zone IV. The contralateral zone III was used as reference. Results:. Postoperative abdominal skin perfusion in zone IV was always significantly reduced compared with zone III (1 -tailed t test, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Compromised {{perfusion}} in autologous breast reconstruction {{results in}} fat necrosis and flap loss. Increased flap weight with fewer perforator vessels may exacerbate imbalances in flap perfusion. We studied deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) and muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (MS-TRAM) flaps to assess this concept. Methods: Data from patients who underwent reconstruction with DIEP and/or MS-TRAM flaps between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011 (n = 123) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were collected, including flap fat necrosis and donor/recipient site complications. Logistic {{regression analysis was}} used to examine effects of flap weight and perforator number on <b>breast</b> <b>flap</b> fat necrosis. Results: One hundred twenty-three patients who underwent 179 total flap reconstructions (166 DIEP, 13 MS-TRAM) were included. Mean flap weight was 658 ± 289 g; 132 (73. 7 %) were single perforator flaps. Thirteen flaps (7. 5 %) developed fat necrosis. African American patients had increased odds of fat necrosis (odds ratio, 11. 58; P < 0. 001). Odds of developing fat necrosis significantly increased with flap weight (odds ratio, 1. 5 per 100 g increase; P < 0. 001). In single perforator flaps weighing more than 1000 g, six (42. 9 %) developed fat necrosis, compared to 14. 3 % of large multiple perforator flaps. Conclusions: Flaps with increasing weight have increased risk of fat necrosis.

40|$|Although {{success rate}} of deep {{inferior}} epigastric perforator (DIEP) <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction has greatly improved, complications still occasionally occur. Perfusion-related complications (PRCs) (ie, fat necrosis and partial flap necrosis) are the most frequent concern, affecting aesthetic final result of the reconstructed breast. The aim of our study was to retrospectively investigate 287 consecutive DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstructions to investigate predictive and protective factors for PRCs. From May 2004 to February 2012, 287 DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstructions were performed on 270 patients; 247 unilateral flaps, including Holm vascular zones I to III, were retrospectively selected and analyzed. Tobacco use, mean blood pressure over the first postoperative 48 hours, superficial epigastric vein drainage, medial/lateral row perforator, nulliparity, crystalloid versus combined crystalloid/colloid intravenous fluid infusion therapy, and learning curve were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Perfusion-related complications occurred 32 (12. 9 %) times, 79 (31. 9 %) patients were smokers, 48 (19. 4 %) showed postoperative mean blood pressure less than 75 mm Hg, 29 (11. 7 %) were nulliparous, and 173 (70 %) had superficial epigastric vein drainage. Selected perforators were 110 (44. 5 %) from lateral row, 137 (55. 5 %) from medial row; 91 (36. 8 %) received crystalloid fluid infusion, whereas 156 (63. 2 %) combined crystalloid/colloid fluid infusion. From univariate analysis emerged significance of nulliparity, perforator row and intravenous fluid infusion for PRC. Nevertheless, multivariate model confirmed only nulliparity as a significant risk factor (P = 0. 029), although variable correlations to other predictors were found: both medial row perforator and combined crystalloid/colloid fluid infusion potentially decrease the PRC risk of 11. 6 % and 27. 6 %, respectively. Learning curve did not show significant decrease of PRC risk over time. Our study first proved nulliparity as a statistically significant predictor for PRCs in DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction, possibly due to different superficial abdominal perfusion between pluriparous and nulliparous women, with potential weaker pattern of perforators and smaller angiosomes in the latter.

40|$|Abstract: Breast {{reconstruction}} is {{an integral}} part of treatment of breast cancer. Immediate reconstruction is breast reconstruction that is done at the same surgery as the mastectomy, whereas delayed reconstruction is done months or years after the mastectomy. Im-mediate and delayed reconstruction can be accomplished with au-tologous tissue <b>flaps</b> or prosthetic <b>breast</b> implants. The esthetic result, psychosocial effect, and cost of breast reconstruction are better with immediate reconstruction, but the risk of surgical com-plications is less with delayed reconstruction. Although immediate reconstruction is oncologically safe and esthetically advantageous, nationwide less than 20 % of patients having a mastectomy have immediate breast reconstruction. Radiation treatment before or after mastectomy has a negative impact on the outcome of breast recon-struction and is one important factor to be considered in determining the optimal timing for breast reconstruction.

Immediate reconstruction is more attractive from an economic perspective since it only requires one operation, one anaesthetic procedure and one recovery period in hospital. From the perspective of health care budget management, assessing the possible cost savings from immediate reconstruction yields interesting results. Since charges {{do not reflect the}} real costs of providing care, we calculated resource costs using the micro-costing method. About 95 per cent of the initial mastectomy costs could be saved when performing an immediate breast reconstruction. This was about 35 per cent of total standard direct and indirect costs due to mastectomy and delayed breast reconstruction. In a growing cost conscious environment of managed care, the economic evaluation should therefore encourage the trend towards more immediate reconstructions.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the feasibility, surgical planning and its outcome following NSM. 18 patients underwent NSM reconstructions. Mean time of follow-up was 29 months. The technique was indicated in patients with small/moderate volume <b>breasts.</b> <b>Flap</b> complications were evaluated and information on aesthetic results and patient satisfaction were collected. 83. 3 % had tumors measuring 2 cm or less (T 1) and 72. 1 % were stage 0 and 1. All patients presented peripherally tumors located (at least 5 cm from the nipple). Skin complications occurred in 11. 1 %. One patient (5. 5 %) presented small skin necrosis and a wound dehiscence was observed in one patient (5. 5 %). The aesthetic result was good/very good in 94. 4 percent and the majority of patients were very satisfied/satisfied. No local recurrences were observed. All complications except one were treated by a conservative approach. DCPI-BEIS is a simple and reliable technique for NSM reconstruction. The success depends on patient selection, coordinated planning with the oncologic surgeon and careful intra-operative and post-operative management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

These self-anchoring sutures incorporate evenly spaced barbs in a circumferential distribution along their length, facilitating knotless wound closure and even distribution of tension along the suture line. In this study, we evaluated postoperative complications {{associated with the use}} of unidirectional barbed sutures compared with standard sutures for closure of the abdominal incision in deep inferior epigastric perforator <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction. Methods: A consecutive series of 142 patients undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction were identified at a single institution. The abdominal closure in the first 71 patients was performed using standard suture materials. In the subsequent 71 patients, closure was performed using unidirectional barbed sutures. Patient demographics, complications, procedure time, and costs were compared between standard and barbed suture groups. Results: Demographic characteristics and comorbidity profiles were similar between the 2 groups. Overall, there was a significantly higher incidence of complications in the standard suture group (17 vs 7 complications,P =. 0423).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Breast {{reconstruction}} {{is associated}} {{with high levels of}} patient satisfaction. Previous patient satisfaction studies have been subjective. This study utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to objectively evaluate "sense of self" following deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction in an attempt to better understand patient perception. METHODS: Prospective fMRI analysis was performed on four patients before and after delayed unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction, and on four patients after immediate unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction. Patients were randomly cued to palpate their natural breast, mastectomy site or breast reconstruction, and external silicone models. Three regions of interest (ROIs) associated with self-recognition were examined using a general linear model, and compared using a fixed effects and random effects ANOVA, respectively. RESULTS: In the delayed reconstruction group, activation of the ROIs was significantly lower at the mastectomy site compared to the natural breast (p< 0. 01). Ten months following reconstruction, activation of the ROIs in the reconstructed breast was not significantly different from that observed with natural breast palpation. In the immediate reconstruction group, palpation of the reconstructed breast was also similar to the natural breast. This activity was greater than that observed during palpation of external artificial models (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Similar activation patterns were observed during palpation of the reconstructed and natural breasts as compared to the non-reconstructed mastectomy site and artificial models. The cognitive process represented by this pattern may be a mechanism by which breast reconstruction improves self-perception, and thus patient satisfaction following mastectomy...|$|R

Primary predictor was facility in which the procedure was performed. Secondary predictors included operative, demographic, and comorbidity data. Primary outcomes were flap take back rate and flap failures. Secondary outcomes were total time from adverse event noticed in the flap to returning to the operating room (OR) and total time from decision made to return to the OR to returning to the OR (decision made). Tertiary outcomes were length of stay, operative times, and blood loss. Results:. Patients at the TCF were generally less healthy than SSH patients.

40|$|Background. The {{demand for}} {{bilateral}} breast reconstructions is rising worldwide. In the UK, approximately 30 % {{of breast cancer}} patients undergoing mastectomy choose autologous tissue breast reconstruction. Although the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is gaining popularity, bilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction remains a complex procedure and reliable outcome data are lacking. In the absence of clinical trials, evidence from cohort studies is needed to better inform clinicians and patients. Methods. Over a 6 -year period, all consecutive patients undergoing DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction were prospectively included and categorized as unilateral or bilateral reconstruction for comparative analyses of outcomes and complications, with the patient as the unit of analysis. Results. Overall, 565 DIEP flaps were performed on 468 women (371 unilateral and 97 bilateral reconstructions [194 flaps]). Postoperative complications requiring reoperation were twice as likely for bilateral reconstructions (risk ratio [RR] 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 3. 4, p = 0. 002) and were mainly due to venous congestion (RR 3. 1, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 7. 5, p = 0. 011). The risk of total flap loss was six times greater in bilateral reconstruction (RR 6. 4, 95 % CI 1. 6 – 26, p = 0. 011). The rates of revision breast and abdominal surgery were similar between groups. Conclusions. Both unilateral and bilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstructions are safe, with a low risk of complications; however, bilateral reconstruction {{was associated with a}} higher risk of complications and total flap loss. This information should be highlighted to patients requesting bilateral breast reconstruction, particularly those requesting risk-reducing mastectomy and reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{outcomes}} of patients who had prior abdominal operations and underwent DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction and to describe technical strategies to insure well-vascularized flap-harvest minimizing abdominal donor-site complications. All patients who underwent DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed and divided into a control group (CG) and a scar group (SG). Patient demographics, operative details, flap and donor-site complications were analyzed and compared. For all of the scars, DIEP flap design was not modified, but a standardized approach was developed according to the type and location of the scar, available vascular pedicle, perforator locations, and the required <b>flap</b> tissue for <b>breast</b> reconstruction. Two hundred and eighty patients underwent 292 flaps in CG and 107 underwent 111 flaps in SG. Pfannenstiel, McBurney, laparoscopic, midline and subcostal were the most common previous incisions. There were no significant differences between groups regarding demographics, flap and mastectomy weight, active smoking, or radiation status (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). No significant differences were observed in DIEP flap loss (P[*]=[*] 0. 909), partial flap loss (P= 0. 799), or fat necrosis (P= 0. 871) and in the rate of abdominal donor-site complications between groups (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). SG had a significantly higher mean operative time than CG (P= 0. 034). Medial raw was a negative risk-factor for flap complications, while BMI (> 25. 1 kg/m(2)) and smoking-history were significant predictors for donor-site complications. With careful preoperative planning and appropriate technical strategies, successfully DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction can be performed without increased flap and donor-site complications in patients with preexisting abdominal scars. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The deep {{inferior}} epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap {{is widely}} used in autologous tissue breast reconstruction because it offers a large volume of soft tissue without sacrificing the rectus muscle, with fewer complications such as hernia or bulge formation. 1, 2 To optimize cosmetic outcomes in unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> reconstruction, an ad-equate volume of flap tissue with good blood flow should be prepared and molded into a shape simi-lar to the contralateral breast. For an inexperienced surgeon, however, surgery planning (eg, single- or double-pedicle) and intraoperative breast shaping can be difficult. Recent advances in 3 -dimensional (3 D) body sur-face imaging enable us to digitally quantify complex breast regions noninvasively. 3, 4 Models built with a personal 3 D printer have also been used to aid various reconstructive surgeries. 5, 6 We recently used these technologies, and in this report, we document our experiences with unilateral DIEP <b>flap</b> <b>breast</b> re-construction with 3 D surface imaging to improve surgery planning and 3 D-printed molds to shape a breast symmetrical to the contralateral breast...|$|R
50|$|The officers' uniform changed though significantly, {{adopting}} {{the changes that}} were already implemented by King Constantine and his staff in their private tunics, plus {{a return to the}} German-style cap that Constantine preferred. The new tunic was more practical for campaign, closer to the modern French and British styles. Wider-cut, it had bigger, external pockets pleated on the <b>breast,</b> scalloped <b>flaps</b> and stand and fall collar. The pipings were replaced by a pair of branch-colour collar tabs with metal buttons and the Russian boards were replaced by smaller straps. The highly visible cap metal pipings were replaced with subdued rank stripes of brown colour. The old-style leather equipment was replaced by a fashionable Sam Browne and a Webley revolver-style holster.|$|R
