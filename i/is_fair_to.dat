Over the past half century the educational attainment of the US population has significantly increased.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{since the}} Supreme Court has {{recognized}} voting {{as a fundamental}} right, the Equal Protection Clause places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.|$|E

In many penannular brooches, {{the gap between the}} terminals is now too narrow for the pin to pass through; whether this was always the case is uncertain.|$|E

As neither principle was actively supported by successful politicians of either party, either before or after his term as governor, it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> attribute the principles to him personally, and to note that he was out-of-step with his nineteenth century contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Critique by Fritz Lehman: Given {{that this}} book is {{intended}} as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates, Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief preserver of separate Islamic identity in India, yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given. Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the most revealing. The tone of the book in general is more reasonable and moderate than such earlier publications.

25|$|In bidding, Beasley adopted many of Culbertson's ideas, but was displeased {{with the}} strong twos and their {{negative}} response of two no trumps. As a result, so he claimed, he was the inventor (in 1936) of the artificial strong two clubs opening bid with its negative response two diamonds. For many years all the British bidding systems used this method of dealing with strong hands: Acol (both standard and Benjaminised), CAB, Two Clubs and Baron systems all used it. However, it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> mention that others have also claimed authorship of this fruitful idea.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{allegedly}} overly unrealistic {{assumptions are}} one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. It <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E

We do not think it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E

25|$|Hephaestion’s {{exact age}} is not known. No concise {{biography}} {{has ever been}} written about him, likely stemming {{from the fact that}} he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion’s age as being similar to Alexander’s so it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assume that he was born about 356BC. He is said to have become a page in 343BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.|$|E
25|$|R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, {{ex parte}} Coughlan is a seminal case {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1999 which {{clarified}} the court's role in relation to cases which involve substantive legitimate expectations. The Court held that when reviewing a decision of a public authority which is contrary to a prior assurance or representation by the authority, its role is not always limited to assessing if the decision is Wednesbury unreasonable or irrational. In some situations, it is entitled {{to determine whether it}} <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> compel the authority to fulfil its representation, or whether there is a sufficient overriding public interest which justifies allowing the authority to depart from the promise made.|$|E
25|$|The American middle class, {{at least}} those living the lifestyle, has become known {{around the world for}} {{conspicuous}} consumption. To this day, the professional middle class in the United States holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances, and most automobiles. In 2005, the average new home had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent {{a small portion of the}} housing stock in the US, with most suburban homes having been built in the 1970s when the average square footage was 1,600, it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class.|$|E

25|$|Cassiodorus devoted much of {{his life}} to {{supporting}} education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted. His Variae show that, like Augustine of Hippo, Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the Psalms, which the untrained reader would need to begin with because of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods. By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assess that as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.|$|E
500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing." [...] William L. Rowe has written [...] "granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for {{the view that the}} existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say, however, {{that if he}} had died at Llanbadarn {{there would have been a}} shrine, traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn Garreg), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn, Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [...] ), if he didn't establish them himself.|$|E
