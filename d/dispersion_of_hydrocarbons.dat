30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the use of}} the biosurfactant {{significantly}} enhanced degradation of all alkane species, including recalcitrant iso-alkanes. These results suggested that biosurfactant-mediated <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> played a very important role in the degradation of saturated compounds (Neu 1996; Bruheim and Eimhjellen 2000; Noordman and Janssen 2002), regardless of the metabolic strategy used by the bacterial population. In the case of iso-alkanes, biosurfactant-induced emulsions probably compensated the reduction of hydrocarbon solubility caused by methyl branching, which would have lowered substrate availability to cells. Highly volatile alkanes showed the highest hydrocarbon loss in the abiotic systems, and hence, the lowest demonstrable degradation in the biotic systems. Contrary to what we expected, the biosurfactant did not seem to affect volatilization of low molecular weight hydrocarbons. According to these results we suggest that the biosurfactant increased the low solubility caused either by methyl branching or by the carboxylic derivative obtained at the initial oxidation steps of alkanes when they became slow-moving compounds.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: PAMAM (polyamidoamine) dendrimers {{have been}} {{recently}} exploited as efficient and biocompatible unimolecular micelles for oil spill remediation utilizing their robust encapsulation capability. However, experimental evidence suggested that contrasting <b>dispersion</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> PAMAM exist toward different types <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> ligands, including linear and polyaromatic oil molecules. Specifically, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>hydrocarbons</b> by PAMAM {{was found to}} violate the unimolecular micelle convention by forming molecular complexes orders of magnitude larger than a single PAMAM. It is, therefore, essential to re-examine the <b>dispersion</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> PAMAM toward different types of ligands {{in order to facilitate}} dendrimer applications in environmental remediation, catalysis, and nanomedicine. Here, we applied atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations to study generation-four (G 4) PAMAM dendrimers dispersing hexadecane (C 16) and phenanthrene (PN), two representative linear and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in crude oil.

40|$|Abstract—Diesel is {{a complex}} mixture {{containing}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which persist after a spill, pass readily from water into tissues, and are toxic to early life stages of fish. The bioavailability and chronic toxicity <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> dissolved into water from floating diesel (water-accommodated fraction) and chemically dispersed diesel (chemically enhanced water-accommodated fraction) were measured by the extent of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and by the severity of blue sac disease in embryos. The water-accommodated fraction of floating diesel was virtually nontoxic to embryos at nominal concentrations up to 1, 000 mg/L, causing only small weight changes. Liver EROD induction in juvenile trout was only observed at the highest nominal water-accommodated fraction concentration (10, 000 mg/L). Chemical dispersion increased the bioavailability and toxicity of diesel to trout by 100 -fold. Diesel chemically enhanced wateraccommodated fraction induced EROD activity, caused blue sac disease, and impaired development and growth of embryonic trout at nominal concentrations as low as 10 mg/L; 88 % mortality occurred at 100 mg/L. However, when total hydrocarbon concentrations were measured, differences between dispersed and undispersed diesel disappeared, with a median lethal concentration of 8 mg/L <b>of</b> total <b>hydrocarbons</b> and sublethal median effective concentrations ranging from 1. 3 to 6. 1 mg/L. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> diesel by highenergy mechanical mixing was recently reported to cause acute lethality to juvenile trout between 40 and 200 mg/L.

40|$|Abstract Background Microorganisms {{have devised}} ways {{by which they}} {{increase}} the bioavailability of many water immiscible substrates whose degradation rates are limited by their low water solubility. Hexadecane is one such water immiscible hydrocarbon substrate which forms an important constituent of oil. One major mechanism employed by hydrocarbon degrading organisms to utilize such substrates is the production of biosurfactants. However, much of the overall mechanism by which such organisms utilize hydrocarbon substrate still remains a mystery. Results With an aim to gain more insight into hydrocarbon uptake mechanism, an efficient biosurfactant producing and n-hexadecane utilizing Pseudomonas sp was isolated from oil contaminated soil which was found to produce rhamnolipid type of biosurfactant containing a total of 13 congeners. Biosurfactant action brought about the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> hexadecane to droplets smaller than 0. 22 μm increasing the availability <b>of</b> the <b>hydrocarbon</b> to the degrading organism. Involvement of biosurfactant was further confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Biosurfactant formed an emulsion with hexadecane thereby facilitating increased contact between hydrocarbon and the degrading bacteria.
