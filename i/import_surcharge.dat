40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and simulation models {{to study the}} impact of temporary and permanent <b>import</b> <b>surcharges</b> on the U. S. balance of trade. The analytical model of a two-country, two-commodity, two-period endowment economy brings out the intersectoral and intertemporal substitution effects generated by <b>import</b> <b>surcharges.</b> This model shows that the trade balance impact of these initiatives is ambiguous in sign even under restrictive assumptions. We therefore apply a simulation model to gauge the effects under realistic values for parameters. The simulation model differs from others that have analyzed <b>import</b> <b>surcharges</b> in combining sectoral disaggregation with an integrated treatment of current and capital account transactions. The combination is {{made possible by the}} model's attention to both intra- and intertemporal aspects of household and producer decisions. Simulations are performed under different assumptions about the sources of the U. S. trade deficits and the timing of the surcharge. In each case, surcharges strengthen the trade balance in the short run but worsen subsequently. The results highlight the usefulness of analyzing the crade balance effects of commercial policies with a dynamic framework that incorporates intertemporal balance of payments constraints. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Nixon Shock {{has been}} widely {{considered}} to be a political success, but an economic mixed bag in bringing on the stagflation of the 1970s and leading to the instability of floating currencies. The dollar plunged by a third during the '70s. According to the World Trade Review's report [...] "The Nixon Shock After Forty Years: The <b>Import</b> <b>Surcharge</b> Revisited", Douglas Irwin reports that for several months, U.S officials could not get other countries to agree to a formal revaluation of their currencies. The German mark appreciated significantly after it was allowed to float in May 1971. Further, the Nixon Shock unleashed enormous speculation against the dollar. It forced Japan’s central bank to intervene significantly in the foreign exchange market to prevent the yen from increasing in value. Within two days August 16-17, 1971, Japan’s central bank had to buy $1.3 billion to support the dollar and keep the yen at the old rate of 360 Yen to the dollar. Japan’s foreign exchange reserves rapidly increased: $2.7 billion (30%) a week later and $4 billion the following week. Still, this large-scale intervention by Japan’s central bank could not prevent the depreciation of US dollar against the yen. France also was willing to allow the dollar to depreciate against the franc, but not allow the franc to appreciate against gold (Page 14 Douglas).

40|$|Although many {{countries}} have adopted freer trade regimes {{or are in}} the pro-cess of reforming quantitative restrictions, such reforms are not without short-term costs. Sudden removal of quantitative restrictions can release a surge of demand for imports that can deplete foreign exchange reserves and force rapid adjustment by domestic industries. Five methods to more gradually liberalize quantitative restrictions are discussed: raising quota ceilings until they are non-binding; eliminating quotas product by product; converting quotas to equiva-lent tariffs and then reducing them; auctioning quota licenses; and converting quotas to tariff quotas, and then liberalizing these. The various instruments are evaluated according to their implications for the adjustment period, for gov-ernment revenue, for the balance of payments, and for {{the extent to which}} they are likely to produce political disruptions. M any developing countries have resorted to trade restrictions to limit imports as a whole, to ration scarce foreign exchange (limiting it to payments for essential imports), or to protect particular domestic in-dustries as part of a development program. Countries have used a seemingly baffling variety of policy instruments that have constrained and distorted trade: lists of banned <b>imports,</b> tariffs, <b>surcharges,</b> stamp fees, prior import de-posits, import quotas, tariff quotas, discretionary import licensing, foreign ex-change controls, multiple exchange rates, and local content requirements.

40|$|Includes bibliographySummary Following {{a period}} of {{economic}} growth, political stability and poverty reduction spanning two decades (1960 - 1979), Costa Rica experienced {{at the beginning of}} the 1980 ´s the worst recession in its most recent history. In 1981 and 1982 gross domestic product (GDP) fell by - 2. 3 % and - 7. 3 %. Analysts pinpoint to short term economic factors and long run structural problems as the main causes of the recession. Short term economic factors comprise the end of the coffee price bonanza and the second oil shock. Long run structural factors are rooted in the economic imbalances generated by the adoption of import substitution strategies. In 1985 the authorities undertook a change of regime which mixed free market with state intervention policies. Free market policies aimed at getting the prices right" by liberalizing trade through tariff and traditional export tax reduction, and by eliminating trade barriers. State intervention policies were encapsulated into non-traditional export promotion schemes and a target real exchange rate tending to favour export performance. These government policies were justified on the grounds of compensating the anti-export bias that guided the commercial policy of Costa Rica during the import substitution era. The implementation process was very gradual and began with export promotion policies followed by reduction of import and export barriers. From 1986 to 1994 trade liberalization policies were followed on a systematic basis. The tariff ceiling was substantially reduced, and tariff dispersion as well as effective protection diminished. Taxes levied on non traditional exports disappeared, while taxes on traditional exports were significantly lowered. Finally, most non tariff barriers were eliminated as quantitative import restrictions were replaced with tariffs in compliance with the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. During 1995 - 1996, the country experienced temporary interruptions in its tariff reduction and trade liberalization commitments in part due to a recession caused by internal contractionary policies and external factors (i. e., "the Tequila effect"). In 1997 as GDP growth overcame its trough, the authorities continued their outward oriented efforts. The policy centered mostly on a national tariff reduction schedule that would comply with the Central American Common External Tariff. The country plans to reach this tariff schedule in the year 2000. While trade liberalization has eliminated <b>import</b> <b>surcharges</b> and lowered, to great extent, the weight of export taxes in fiscal revenue, the same cannot be said about import duties. Export taxes represented 23. 3 % of total revenue in 1983. By 1994 - 1998, they represented 2. 1 %. The reduction of fiscal dependence on export taxes has shielded the fiscal accounts from the volatility of primary commodity price fluctuation. Import duties have, however, increased their weight in fiscal revenue. They accounted for 5. 6 % of total revenue in 1983 and for 13. 2 % for 1994 - 1998. The greater dependency of fiscal equilibrium on import duties is due both an increase in the import tax base as a consequence of liberalization and perhaps to a shift in the propensity to import. If trade reform has allowed a better allocation of resources by liberalizing import prices, it has also placed a restriction on output growth by increasing the possibilities of a balance-of-payments constraint scenario. Export promotion policies materialized into tax exemption schemes such as the CAT (tax redemption certificates). CATs were equivalent to an income tax deduction and represented 1. 9 % of total expenditure in 1985 and 4. 2 % by 1994 - 1998. The government has stopped the issue of new CATs and their fiscal impact will vanish by the year 2000. This will certainly be a source a fiscal respite and a basis on which to further reduce import duties without compromising internal equilibrium. ...|$|R

Initial adoption of exchange controls was generally an ad hoc response to external events. The optimal resource allocation dictum [...] that the marginal cost of earning foreign exchange should be equated with the marginal cost of saving foreign exchange [...] was generally abandoned in favor of saving foreign exchange at all costs. An export-oriented development strategy generally entails relatively greater use of indirect, rather than direct, interventions. There is considerable evidence from the individual country studies that direct intervention may be considerably more costly than is generally recognized. Export rebates, tariffs, <b>surcharges,</b> <b>import</b> entitlement schemes, {{and a host of}} other devices are generally employed under quantitative restrictions regimes, and they lead to a wide dispersion in effective exchange rates by commodity categories. The effect of liberalization is often to induce a recessionary tendency rather than the traditionally feared inflationary impact.

40|$|Excerpt] Although the United States has {{complied}} with adverse rulings in many past World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes, {{there are currently}} 11 cases in which rulings {{have not yet been}} implemented or the United States has taken action and the dispute has not been fully resolved. Under WTO dispute settlement rules, a WTO Member will generally be given a reasonable period of time to comply with an adverse WTO decision. While the Member is expected to remove the offending measure {{by the end of this}} period, compensation and temporary retaliation are available if the Member has not acted or taken sufficient action by this time. Either disputing party may request a compliance panel if there is disagreement over whether a Member has complied. Remaining unsettled are long-standing disputes with the European Union (EU) regarding a music copyright statute (DS 160) and a statutory trademark provision affecting property confiscated by Cuba (DS 176), as well as a dispute with Japan over a provision of U. S. antidumping law (DS 184). The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (“Byrd Amendment”), which was held WTO-inconsistent in January 2003 and repealed effective October 2005, remains the target of sanctions by complainants EU and Japan due to continued payments to U. S. firms authorized under the repeal legislation (P. L. 109 - 171) (DS 217 /DS 234). Congress placed limits on funds that are available for these distributions in December 2010 (P. L. 111 - 291, § 822). In addition, the United States and Antigua have been consulting on the resolution of outstanding issues in Antigua’s challenge of U. S. online gambling restrictions (DS 285). Compensation agreements entered into by the United States with various WTO Members in exchange for the withdrawal by the United States of its WTO gambling commitments, an action taken by the United States to resolve the case, will not enter into effect until issues with Antigua are resolved. Congress repealed a WTO-inconsistent cotton program at issue in Brazil’s 2002 complaint over U. S. cotton subsidies in P. L. 109 - 171, but other programs were also successfully challenged and the United States was later found not to have fully complied (DS 267). The United States since made statutory and administrative changes affecting the export credit guarantee program faulted in the case. While Brazil obtained authorization from the WTO to retaliate in the case, the two countries entered into a preliminary agreement in April 2010 that forestalled the imposition of sanctions and signed a framework agreement in June 2010 aimed at permanently resolving the dispute. The latter includes Brazil’s pledge not to impose sanctions during the life of the agreement and contemplates possible legislative resolution of the dispute in the 2012 farm bill. Brazil had earlier announced that it was entitled to impose $ 829. 3 million in annual retaliation, $ 591 million of which would consist of <b>import</b> <b>surcharges</b> on U. S. goods. Five pending cases involve the U. S. practice of “zeroing,” under which the Department of Commerce (DOC), in calculating dumping margins in antidumping (AD) proceedings, disregards non-dumped sales. The U. S. practice was successfully challenged by the EU (DS 294 /DS 350), Japan (DS 322), Mexico (DS 344), and South Korea (DS 402), resulting in broad WTO prohibitions on U. S. use of the practice. The United States took administrative action to resolve one aspect of DS 294 by abandoning zeroing in original AD investigations as of 2007. It has yet to fully comply, however, either in this case or in DS 350, DS 322, or DS 344. While the EU and Japan requested the WTO to authorize sanctions, each agreed to suspend U. S. -requested arbitration of their proposals in 2010 on the understanding that the United States would resolve outstanding issues in a timely fashion. To this end, DOC in December 2010 proposed to eliminate the use of zeroing in later stages of U. S. AD proceedings. A compliance panel proceeding is currently under way in the dispute with Mexico (DS 344). An adverse panel report was adopted in Korea’s challenge (DS 402) on February 24, 2011...|$|R

40|$|The author {{examines}} the eroding tax base facing transitional economies by employing {{a framework that}} allows risk factors in assessing tax instruments. In an uncertain world, the author asks, which tax instruments should be used? The author examines Eastern Europe's revenue problem, including the implications for public revenue of different causes of uncertainty - and investigates which taxes are"better"at generating revenue. The author defines a"better"tax as one that has greater stability in a risky environment (that is, less variation in generating a target revenue) and has the least adverse impact on the economy (for example, on consumption). The author employs the framework to explain much of the output and revenue fall in transitional economies. The term-or-trade shocks from {{the collapse of the}} CMEA trade as well as the rigid but uncertain economic responses in transitional economies are all important factors. The results of the authors modelindicate that import tariffs are more effective than other traditional tax instruments in raising revenue, especially if real revenue is defined in dollar terms (the price anchor). The contraction in domestic output and prices and the devaluation of the real exchange rate needed in the transition are significant reasons that favor imports as a tax base over other revenue sources. To emphasize the transitory nature and reversibility of the policy recommendation, import tariffs should be implemented {{in the form of a}} temporary uniform <b>import</b> <b>surcharge.</b> This conclusion seems to hold whether the government formulates tax policy with correct or incorrect expectations. But the choice of revenue target matters. All tax instruments will do almost equally well if the commonly used tax-to-Gross Domestic Product ratio is the target. But it is a misleading measure since the ratio does not reflect the immense erosion of domestic tax bases in the economy and how real revenue in absolute level may actually be decreasing rapidly as a result. The revenue decline and uncertainty can also be viewed as a necessity toward downsizing the large state sector and in redirecting trade away from former nonmarket partners. The results emphasize that restoring revenue should never lead to maintaining subsidies toward nonprofitable state enterprises or other public spending no longer relevant in market system. Doing so will only lead to unreasonably high taxation. No less important is moving assets out of collapsing sectors, privatizing them, and making them productive again.
