There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying what it had been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated <b>in</b> <b>Burma</b> for several years and had never heard of Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship.|$|E

5|$|The Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} {{lives in}} both lowland and highland secondary rainforest, swamps, and cloud forests. It inhabits hilly areas close to water, particularly steep upper valleys with copious undergrowth. The Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited a continuous range {{as far north}} as Burma, eastern India, and Bangladesh. Unconfirmed reports also placed it in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. All known living animals occur in Peninsular Malaysia, the island of Sumatra, and Sabah, Borneo. Some conservationists hope Sumatran rhinos may still survive <b>in</b> <b>Burma,</b> though it is considered unlikely. Political turmoil <b>in</b> <b>Burma</b> has prevented any assessment or study of possible survivors. The last reports of stray animals from Indian limits were in 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The war was one {{of several}} near {{simultaneous}} wars waged by the Mongol Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century.

5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation.

This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya.

5|$|Following the {{fighting}} at Tobruk, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} front and placed in reserve. When Japan entered the war, the division was transferred to India. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible Japanese landings while it trained in jungle warfare. It {{also served as a}} police force, protecting railways and being used to suppress civil disobedience caused by the Quit India Movement. While it was requested that the division be sent to the front line <b>in</b> <b>Burma,</b> it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the Chindits. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and Lieutenant-General William Slim (who led the British troops <b>in</b> <b>Burma)</b> believed that the division could have had a greater impact against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.|$|E
