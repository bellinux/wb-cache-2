Based {{on double}} yield {{elastoplastic}} model, one viscoelasto-plastic model is {{dealt with in}} detail. The method of transferring to <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> wall is introduced when soft soil is treated by plastic drainage plate. The viscoelasto-plastic model and modified Cam-Clay model are applied into the finite element calculation of soft foundation treatment of a tailing dam. By comparison, it can be got that the displacement calculated by the viscoelasto-plastic model is closer to monitoring data than that calculated by modified Cam-Clay model. It demonstrates the reasonableness and efficiency of the viscoelasto-plastic model...|$|E

The tests included a series of uni-directional near wall measurements of mean velocity. These tests were conducted in a channel covered with two types of roughness elements: i) bed covered with spherical aggregates with a diameter between 4 and 9. 5 mm ii) bed covered with triangular elements (an idealization of rippled beds) with a height of 13. 6 mm. The result shows that <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> roughness associated with aggregate is {{of the order of}} the magnitude of the grain size. For rippled-like beds, the result of this study shows that this type of roughness can be adequately described with only one length scale (such as Nikuradse <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> roughness) and that Dirling's empirical relation can best predict this length scale...|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the results of}} an attempt to develop a {{transfer}} function of cone resistance measured in medium over-consolidated sands (< 2 MPa) toward relative soil density and absolute porosity solely based on in-situ testing. In a sand pit, a water saturated, Late Pleistocene fluvial section of 15 m thick-ness with homogeneous grain size distribution and comparable emax and emin values, but highly variable cone resistance was selected for testing. Two ~ 25 m deep sampling holes, six CPTs and two approximately 40 m deep neighboring flush drilled holes for downhole logging with a horizontal distance of 2. 5 m to the CPTs were used in this study. Relevant downhole logging parameters are wet bulk density derived from active gamma logs and porosities derived from neutron-neutron logs. The results show a straightforward stratigraphic picture with clear soil package boundaries. However, within the sand formation of interest fluvial foresets bars, top sets and incised channels with local unconformities lead to changes of stratigraphic height over short horizontal distances challenging in turn the correlation of logging and CPT data. Despite these difficulties, the project resulted in a new transfer function for glacially overconsolidated sands not only linking tip values to relative density but also directly to porosity, making sampling at least for stratigraphic <b>equivalent</b> <b>sands</b> no longer a requirement...|$|R

In this study, we tested the relevance of three formulations of the chronic detachment term in a simple model for the biomass dynamics of periphyton. Numerical simulations of the periphyton biomass dynamics were performed by using three different descriptors for the flow conditions: the discharge Q, the friction velocity u⁄, and the roughness Reynolds number k+ = u⁄ks/m (where m is water kinetic viscosity and ks is the Nikuradse <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> roughness). Comparisons of numerical simulation results with experimental data from literature revealed chronic detachment to be better simulated by taking the roughness Reynolds number as the external variable of detachment. These results support the idea that transport phenomena that occur in the nearbed layer, e. g. chronic detachment of periphyton matter or vertical transport of nutrients and pollutants in submerged aquatic canopies, are not related to a single turbulence descriptor such as the friction velocity u⁄. Its description requires at least two descriptors, here the friction velocity u⁄ and the Nikuradse <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> roughness ks, which depend on the initial form and dimensions of the colonized substratum, and its changes owing to the thickness, resistance, and composition of the epilithic matter...|$|E

Asphalt and cement concrete are among the main engineering materials which are wasted in vast quantities every year due to the reconstruction and demolition of highways and buildings. Recycling of these materials would be an efficient measure for protection of environment and preservation of natural resources. In this research, the viability of using crushed waste asphalt and cement concrete as a replacement of primary aggregate in unbound base layer of flexible pavements has been investigated. Different portions of the natural aggregate have been replaced with the recycled materials and the physical properties of each mixture have been investigated. The physical properties including <b>sand</b> <b>equivalent,</b> toughness, water absorption, density, soundness and compaction have been evaluated for the mixtures.

40|$|The distribution, biomass, and {{diversity}} of living (Rose Bengal stained) deep-sea benthic foraminifera (> 30 μm) were investigated with multicorer samples from seven stations in the Arabian Sea during the intermonsoonal periods in March and in September/October, 1995. Water depths of the stations ranged between 1916 and 4425 m. The distribution of benthic foraminifera was compared with dissolved oxygen, % organic carbon, % calcium carbonate, ammonium, % silica, chloroplastic pigment <b>equivalents,</b> <b>sand</b> content, pore water content of the sediment, and organic carbon flux to explain the foraminiferal patterns and depositional environments. A total of six species-communities comprising 178 living species were identified by principal component analysis. The seasonal comparison shows that at the western stations foraminiferal abundance and biomass were higher during the Spring Intermonsoon than during the Fall Intermonsoon. The regional comparison indicates a distinct gradient in abundance, biomass, {{and diversity}} from west to east, and for biomass from north to south. Highest values are recorded {{in the western part}} of the Arabian Sea, where the influence of coastal and offshore upwelling are responsible for high carbon fluxes. Estimated total biomass of living benthic foraminifera integrated for the upper 5 cm of the sediment ranged between 11 mg Corg m− 2 at the southern station and 420 mg Corg m− 2 at the western station. Foraminifera in the size range from 30 to 125 μm, the so-called microforaminifera, contributed between 20 and 65 % to the abundance, but only 3 % to 28 % to the biomass of the fauna. Highest values were found in the central and southern Arabian Sea, indicating their importance in oligotrophic deep-sea areas. The overall abundance of benthic foraminifera is positively correlated with oxygen content and pore volume, and partly with carbon content and chloroplastic pigment equivalents of the sediment. The distributional patterns of the communities seem to be controlled by sand fraction, dissolved oxygen, calcium carbonate and organic carbon content of the sediment, but the critical variables are of different significance for each community...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP’s) {{are easier}} to apply and more rapidly collect {{velocity}} data than traditional current-meter instruments. However, flow discharge estimates in natural rivers and canals based on ADCP measurements rely on extrapolations of the measured velocity profiles into the unmeasured zones of the flow. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of ADCP’s have not been rigorously tested and formal protocols for discharge measurements with ADCP’s have not been developed. Therefore, {{a comparison of the}} velocity profiles measured with an ADCP with theoretical velocity distributions is necessary. The analysis of two sets of approximate two-dimensional open-channel velocity distributions collected with a fixed ADCP at the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC) at Romeoville, Illinois, is presented here. These measured velocity distributions are compared with the logarithmic- and power-law velocity distributions. The shear velocity and Nikuradse’s <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> roughness were estimated by fitting the data to the logarithmic law.

The exponent of the power law was estimated to be very close to 1 / 6, which links the power law with Manning’s equation. Furthermore, the values of Nikuradse’s sand roughness of both data sets are equivalent to a Manning’s n ≈ 0. 030, which seems consistent with the channel surface and bed conditions of the CSSC at Romeoville...|$|E
40|$|An intermittency {{model that}} is {{formulated}} in local variables is proposed for representing bypass transition in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computations. No external data correlation {{is used to}} fix transition. Transition is initiated by diffusion, and a source term carries it to completion. A sink term is created to predict the laminar region before transition and vanishes in the turbulent region. Both the source and sink are functions of a wall-distance Reynolds number and turbulence scales. A modification is introduced to predict transition in separated boundary layers. The transition model is incorporated with the k − ω RANS model. The model is validated with several test cases. Decent agreement with the available data is observed {{in a range of}} flows. An extended model for roughness-induced transition is proposed based on this intermittency model. To predict roughness effects in the fully turbulent boundary layer, published boundary conditions for k and ω are used. They depend on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> grain roughness height, and account for the effective displacement of wall distance origin. Similarly in our approach, wall distance in the transition model for smooth surfaces is modified by an effective origin, which depends on <b>equivalent</b> <b>sand</b> grain roughness.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure the bearing {{capacity}} and durability of road pavements in cold climate areas, {{it is necessary to}} use materials which are resistant to harmful frost impact, known as frost heaving. Frost heave cause adverse volume changes, the upwards swelling of a pavement after freezing and deterioration of the bearing capacity of the structure after thawing. In winter, road carriageway temperatures may reach tmin = − 30 ˚C under Polish conditions, which results in the freezing of the structural pavement and subgrade layers. Due to frost penetration into the pavement and the subgrade, heaves may form in soils and unbound pavement structural layers. Road bases made of unbound mixtures of continuously graded aggregates may be frost susceptible. Potential frost susceptibility of road materials and soils is determined by laboratory testing. Frost susceptibility is connected directly with the content and quality of fine particles in an aggregates. Frost heave can be predicted on the basis of different properties of soils or aggregates. The article presents the results of laboratory tests of 14 typical natural aggregate road mixtures, continuously graded 0 / 31. 5 mm and practically applied to road base courses. Frost susceptibility of the aggregates was determined during laboratory testing of the following properties: content of fine-grain fractions < 0. 002 mm, < 0. 02 mm, < 0. 075 mm, plastic limit, liquid limit and <b>sand</b> <b>equivalent.</b> The aggregates were also compacted and frozen in a cylinder and then their frost heave value was determined.
