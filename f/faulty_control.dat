It features an unconventional design that reduces its size and increases fuel economy over more conventional transmissions, but increases its complexity. The initial release of the Cherokee was delayed several weeks citing quality concerns with the transmission, and multiple reports of issues with shift quality and reliability surfaced shortly after launch. Both 2014 and 2015 Cherokees have {{a high number of}} consumer complaints on safecar.gov and carcomplaints.com compared to similar models of its class, with the vast majority of complaints being related to the transmission. FCA's chief quality officer was forced to leave shortly after a poor Consumer Reports review on the dependability of models including the Cherokee, and so far Chrysler has released 3 software updates for the 2014-2015 Cherokee transmission. The company continues to assert that the problem is software related. However, Chrysler is repairing some Cherokee models' transmission [...] "snap ring" [...] to address durability concerns. Multiple vehicles that use the same ZF model transmission, such as the Range Rover Evoque, Honda Pilot, Acura TLX, Chrysler 200, and even the similarly built Jeep Renegade have had issues of varying severity as well.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} new concepts and methods for checking the correctness of control flow instructions during {{the execution of}} programs in embedded CPUs. Detecting and avoiding the execution of <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> flow instructions {{is a problem of}} growing importance w. r. t. reliability and security. On the other hand, hardware cost overheads and an easy integration into the design flow are of utmost important for cost sensitive embedded systems. Our proposed methodology is able to monitor all direct jumps and branches as well as calls and returns form subroutines autonomously during program execution. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate an implementation of an autonomous checker unit which is closely coupled to the processor and can detect and even avoid the execution of a <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> flow instruction. Upon detection of a faulty instruction, we propose a method to refetch and reexecute the incorrect jump or branch instruction. Other benefits of this novel approach are that the application code must not be changed or augmented by signatures or additional instructions, and that there is no measurable performance impact in terms of execution latency. From the user point of view, our approach is completely transparent to a program developer. ...|$|E
40|$|Effective bug {{localization}} {{is important}} for realizing automated debugging. One attractive approach is to apply statistical techniques on a collection of evaluation profiles of program properties to help localize bugs. Previous research has proposed various specialized techniques to isolate certain program predicates as bug predictors. However, because many bugs may not be directly associated with these predicates, these techniques are often ineffective in localizing bugs. Relevant control flow paths that may contain bug locations are more informative than stand-alone predicates for discovering and understanding bugs. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generate such <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> flow paths that link many bug predictors together for revealing bugs. Our approach combines feature selection (to accurately select failure-related predicates as bug predictors), clustering (to group correlated predicates), and control flow graph traversal in a novel way to help generate the paths.

40|$|Abstract- Stiction {{in control}} valves is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the control valve to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the control valves to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the control valve sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> valve, especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> valves...|$|E

40|$|Coverage metrics, which {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} a test sequence to detect design faults, are essential to the validation process. A key source of difficulty in determining fault detection is that the control flow path traversed {{in the presence of a}} fault cannot be determined.

We present a coverage metric that determines the propagation of fault effects along all possible <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> flow paths. The complexity of exploring multiple control flow paths is greatly alleviated by heuristically pruning infeasible control flow paths using the algorithm that we present.

We show that this approach is correct, and illustrate it with realistic examples where the CPLEX tool is used to solve the IP formulations. Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be extended to handle a variety of new constraints, as well as to support new workflow patterns. Its features complement those of existing approaches...|$|E
40|$|In a VAV (variable air volume) system, the {{set point}} of the static {{pressure}} (usually measured at 213 downstream of the main supply air duct) is maintained by modulating the fan speed or inlet guide vane position. The set {{point of the}} static pressure is often set at a constant value, which is adequate to provide design flow to each room. This method consumes more fan power than necessary under partial load conditions. The fan speed or inlet guide vane can also be controlled based on the maximum damper position of the terminal boxes. This method is called air volume control logic. Under this control logic, terminal box airflow requirements are met with reduced static pressure. Fan power consumption is minimized. However, the actual system performance also depends on other factors, such as inaccurate temperature or flow sensors, <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> valves, unbalanced loads, etc. This paper discusses the existing air volume control logic, its reliability and an improved air volume control logic...|$|E

By way of illustration, special emphasis is devoted to isolated Heisenberg-coupled chains of spin- 1 / 2 particles. In particular, for nearest-neighbor interactions, two types of decoupling cycles are contrasted: inefficient averaging, whereby the number of control actions increases exponentially with the system size, and efficient averaging associated to a fixed-size control group. The latter allows for analytical and numerical studies of efficient decoupling schemes created by exploiting and merging together randomization and deterministic strategies, such as symmetrization, concatenation, and cyclic permutations. Notably, sequences capable to remove interactions up to third order are explicitly constructed. The consequences of <b>faulty</b> <b>controls</b> are also analyzed. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

Such failures as jamming, vibration, extreme run out and performance decrease are covered. It is proved that {{in case of an}} actuator failure or flight control structural damage, the aircraft performance decreases significantly. Commercial aircraft frequently appear in the areas of military conflicts and terrorist activity, where the risk of shooting attack is high, for example in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan etc. Accordingly, it is necessary to create and assess the fault model to identify the flight control failures. The research results demonstrate that the adequate fault model is the first step towards the managing the challenges of loss of aircraft controllability. This model is also an element of adaptive failure-resistant management model. The research considers the relationship between the parameters of an i th state of a control surface and its angular rate, also parameters classification associated with specific control surfaces in order to avoid conflict/inconsistency in the determination of a <b>faulty</b> <b>control</b> surface and its condition.

The TGP 3 cDNA encodes a 365 amino acid protein that is homologous to TGP 1 (34 % identity and 44 % similarity). The proteins share a sequence pattern that contains two novel repetitive and homologous motifs flanking an extensively hydrophilic and basic region. A nuclear fractionation experiment showed that TGP 1 and TGP 3 activities are localized predominantly in the nuclear fraction. To further investigate the biological roles of the proteins in vivo, we have generated separate macronuclear gene knockout (KO) strains (TGP 1 KO and TGP 3 KO) {{for each of the}} two genes. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the macronuclear copies of each gene were completely disrupted. Mobility shift assays showed that the corresponding G-DNA-binding activity for each protein was abolished in the KO strains.

Based on the peptide sequences obtained from direct internal peptide sequencing, the cDNAs coding for the genes were cloned. Deduced protein sequences showed that TGP 1 and TGP 3 are novel proteins but share significant homology with each other. Furthermore, the two proteins contain an intriguing sequence pattern with two repetitive and homologous motifs flanking an extensively hydrophilic region. We suggest that this shared sequence pattern may represent a novel G-DNA binding motif,;To address the biological functions of these two novel G-DNA binding proteins, we have employed a newly-developed gene knock out technique and generated Tetrahymena strains {{with each of the}} two genes completely disrupted in the macronucleus. Both knock-out strains (TGPlKO and TGP 3 KO) grow normally suggesting that neither of the genes is essential for cell growth and survival.
