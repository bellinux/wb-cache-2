40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{investigations of}} statistical relations between main design {{parameters of the}} SWATH ship hull shapes, carried out on bibliographical data of more than eighty ships. The statistical relations are presented {{in the form of}} histograms of: ship length L, length to breadth ratio L/B, length to depth ratio L/H, length to pontoon diameter ratio L/D. Also approximated expressions are presented of the relations between the ship length and vertical clearance Gap and between <b>draught</b> <b>T</b> and pontoon di-ameter D. The presented statistical expressions, supplemented with assumptions about relations between main dimensions and derived dimensions, may be used for determination of the fast SWATH ship main design parameters at the preliminary design stage or may be a basis for rational selection of the range of variation of main dimensions in a SWATH ship hull shape series...|$|E

The development of the cargo transport in river traffic depends directly on technical-exploitative characteristics of the network of inland waterways. Research of navigational abilities of inland waterways always comes before building ships or making a transport schedule. It is known that the size of the vessel’s <b>draught</b> (<b>T)</b> is usually the limiting value in project tasks and it depend on the depth of the waterway or certain ports condition. This is the reason why navigation characteristics of rivers have to be determined as precise as possible, especially from the aspect of determination of the possible draught of vessels. Unfortunately, risks in water transport are perhaps an under researched area and consequently, this article outlines a rationale, why it is necessary to develop competence about risk in water transport. Climate changes require special attention and global monitoring. Current risk assessment methods for water transport just consider some dramatic events. We present a new method for the assessment of risk and vulnerability of water transport where river depth represents a crucial part. The analysis of water level changes in the middle Danube was done during the last sixty years...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a high speed catamaran model test program jointly performed at INSEAN (Rome Towing Tank) and at Naples University facilities. Systematic calm water tests were carried out on three geosims (model scale λ = 7, 13 and 26) of s hard chine symmetric catamaran operting in the Naples Gulf, whose dimensions at designed load condition are: length L = 35. 867 m, breadth B = 11. 334 m (demihull B = 3. 30 m); <b>draught</b> <b>T</b> = 1. 58 m, displacement Δ = 137 t, separation length ratio s/L = 0. 224. The greatest model of 5. 12 meters was tested in the Rome Towing Tank (453 m x 13. 5 m x 6. 5 m), the other two models were tested in Naples Towing Tank (140 m x 9 m x 4. 20 m). The experimental research carried out on the catamaran and on its demihull was undertaken with the goal to obtain indications of the effect of towing line position, on the resistance components scale effects, on the resistance interference phenomena, on the most suitable ship-model correlation and on the methodology for the evaluation of additional resistance due to appendices. The results obtained, analysed and discussed, can be considered a contribution to the solution of the above mentioned problems...|$|E

Clinical signs most typically {{occur at the}} lower part of the limbs, including a progressive soft tissue swelling, fibrosis and deformation associated with skin surface aberrance. A partial genetic susceptibility is suspected. In the Belgian Draught Horse, there is no uniform CPL diagnosis methodology, which hampers the calculation of disease prevalence and the estimation of genetic parameters. If CPL is hereditary, ideally, selection should be based on molecular markers. Therefore, in present work, the necessary steps were taken to investigate the current state of matter on CPL in the native population of Belgian Draught Horses, and, to explore the genetic background of the disease susceptibility by means of quantitative and molecular genetic research. A CPL evaluation system (using clinical scores) was assessed, standardizing clinical diagnosis. Using this system, clinical scores were collected in Belgian Draught Horses at official contests (Belgium) and stable visits (Flanders, Belgium) from 2009 to 2011. Clinical CPL prevalence approximated 61 % in our total sampling group including a large proportion of young and subclinically affected horses. In a subset of horses older than 3 years of age, implying more phenotypic certainty (CPL = chronic disorder), prevalence amounted to 86 %. First lesions occurred from 1 year of age in a very mild condition, whereas distinct lesions were generally seen from 3 years of age. Clinical severity increased with age, though faster in stallions than in mares. Factors possibly associated with clinical scores, skin fold thickness and hair diameter, were recorded as well. The latter 2 traits are objectively measurable and could enhance future multivariable genetic models and/or function as a direct diagnostic aid next to clinical examination. Factors (e. g. age and gender) possibly associated with clinical scores, skin fold thickness and hair diameter were identified using statistical (mixed) models, which served as a basis for the quantitative genetic part of the project. A laboratory test for CPL would confirm clinical scores and assist in diagnosis. Furthermore, such test values offer an extra objective trait in genetic models. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was described previously and proposed as a diagnostic aid for CPL in draught horses. Using this ELISA, blood anti&# 8209;elastin antibodies (AEAb) were demonstrated previously in Belgian Draught Horses whereby a clinically healthy group had significantly lower AEAb than 3 clinically affected groups (mild, moderate and severe symptoms). We evaluated the use of this AEAb ELISA as an in vitro diagnostic aid in individual, clinically examined Belgian <b>Draught</b> Horses. <b>Test</b> reproducibility was assessed performing assays in 2 different laboratories. Factors (e. g. gender and pregnancy) possibly associated with AEAb were analyzed using statistical (mixed) models. Even when a high AEAb cut&# 8209;off was handled to obtain a reasonable specificity of 90 %, a low sensitivity (21 %) of AEAb for CPL diagnosis was obtained. Therefore, the described AEAb ELISA procedure was shown to be of no use as a diagnostic aid for CPL per horse, hence the obtained AEAb values were not included in further analyses. Genetic parameters for CPL were estimated using a multi-trait animal model, including clinical scores, skin fold thickness and hair diameter. A separate bi&# 8209;variate analysis was performed to estimate the genetic correlation between clinical scores of fore and hind limbs. Due to the uncertainty of the clinical scores in younger (possibly subclinically) affected horses, analyses were based on 2 sets of data. A restricted dataset (D_ 3 +) was formed, excluding records from horses under 3 years of age from the complete dataset (D_full). Both fixed (e. g. age) and random (permanent environment and date of recording) effects were included. Heritabilities (s. e.) for clinical scores for D_full and D_ 3 + were 0. 11 (0. 06) and 0. 26 (0. 05) respectively. A large proportion of the variance in clinical scores was attributed to the permanent environmental effect in D_full, but less in D_ 3 +. Date of recording explained a proportion of variance (s. e.) from 0. 09 (0. 03) to 0. 61 (0. 08). Additive genetic correlations between clinical scores and both skin fold thickness and hair diameter showed that the latter 2 traits cannot be used as a direct diagnostic aid for CPL, whereas their use in the full model has to be examined further on a larger dataset. The additive genetic correlation between scores of fore and hind limbs was high (93 %). Due to the moderate heritability of the clinical scores, and, in the absence of molecular markers, selection against CPL should focus on estimated breeding values (from repeated clinical examinations of only the fore limbs). Histological skin elastin alterations have been demonstrated in draught horses of susceptible breeds compared to those of a non&# 8209;susceptible breed. Therefore, elastin gene (ELN) aberrance was suggested. We sequenced the full ELN in clinically affected Belgian Draught Horses. The equine ELN reference of a Thoroughbred mare was analyzed in silico. ELN regions in the Belgian Draught Horse that included polymorphisms were confirmed in a lymphedema negative breed (Vlaams Paard). If Vlaams Paard polymorphisms were different from those in the Belgian Draught Horse, they were confirmed in Thoroughbred Horses. Formerly unknown regions in the ELN reference were annotated de novo. We confirmed polymorphisms previously reported and described new ones. No polymorphisms were unique in the Belgian Draught Horses. However, completeness of the equine ELN reference can be disputed, based on the high similarity between the genomic region 3  of the equine reference ELN and human reference cDNA. Furthermore, exploratory sequencing of a genomic fragment 3  of ELN revealed high similarity (81 %identical nucleotides) to human ELN exon 31, suggesting a longer equine ELN coding region. Although this study does not support ELN as a candidate for CPL, future perspectives for equine cDNA characterization and new possibilities in the application of ELN as a candidate in elastin related pathologies are offered. In conclusion, CPL in the Belgian Draught Horse is a multifactorial disorder. Horses are born clinically healthy with a genetic load and pass through a subclinical stage. Clinical disease onset can occur early in life, already from 1 year of age, CPL signs afterwards progressively deteriorate. Clinical diagnosis should ideally be supported with a laboratory diagnostic aid that also enables early detection. This however does not exist. Clinical scores are influenced by permanent environmental effect as well as date of examination. Histology showed marked dermal elastin aberrance in susceptible breeds and molecular analysis could not refute ELN as a candidate for CPL, mainly due to uncertainty on the horse ELN reference sequence. Therefore, future perspectives reside in ELN cDNA characterization for the assessment of elastin related disorders in horses. In the absence of molecular markers, and, due to the moderate heritability coefficients for clinical scores, selection against CPL in the Belgian Draught Horse should ideally be based on estimated breeding values. The necessary data are clinical scores, obtained by a scoring system from repetitive clinical examinations of the fore limbs.
