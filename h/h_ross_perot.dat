A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with <b>H.</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E

25|$|The USAF Weapons School Robbie Risner Award, created September 24, 1976, was {{donated by}} <b>H.</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> {{as a tribute}} to Risner and all Vietnam era Prisoners of War, and is {{administered}} by the Tactical Air Command (now by Air Combat Command).

The trophy is permanently displayed at the United States Air Force Academy, with each winner’s name inscribed. A miniature replica, also donated by Perot, is presented to each year’s recipient as a personal memento. An identical casting, measuring four feet and weighing 300 pounds, was installed in the foyer of the USAF Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in October 1984.|$|E
25|$|As the {{commemorative}} coin act legislation was pending, the DAV announced in March 2008 an additional donation of $600,000—half of {{which came from}} the state chapter in California, and half {{of which was a}} matching donation by the DAV. But although the national DAV had pledged to match state donations up to $3 million (for a total DAV state and national contribution of $6 million), $2.4 million of the pledge was still unfulfilled by early 2008. A second major memorial donation came in April 2008 when businessman <b>H.</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> agreed to give three annual payments of $1 million each to the DVLMF. Perot's contribution (the largest yet from an individual or group not already associated with the memorial foundation) brought the total amount of funds raised for construction and maintenance to $55.1 million. At this point, the DVLMF still claimed they only needed $65 million to begin construction. News sources reported that the foundation intended to begin and finish construction in 2010.|$|E
