5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from the <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
