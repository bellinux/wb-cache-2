FFA members welcomed the implementation of electronic solutions for improved data management, but reiterated the need to ensure the migration of capacity from the regional to the national level over time. In addition, the importance of demonstrating the effectiveness of new technology before reducing funding for existing systems was emphasized. 309. The EU also supported the IMS and continued assistance to SIDS for programmes such as debriefer training and observer data management. 310. WCPFC 9 adopted TCC 8 recommendations contained in paras. 184 - 185 of the TCC 8 Summary Report concerning the Commission’s Information Management System. (the text of the TCC 8 recommendation is included in Attachment N) The TCC recommendations included the following: 184. TCC 8 recommended to WCPFC 9 that it task the Secretariat, {{in cooperation with the}} scientific services provider, to consider electronic data entry for ROP as a priority. 185. TCC 8 recommended to WCPFC 9 that coastal States developing Information Management Systems receive assistance, including training of de-briefers, to improve their ability to meet their national obligations in providing observer data. 189. TCC 8 recommended to WCPFC 9 that the Secretariat be tasked with undertaking a more comprehensive analysis of future options for ROP data management, including options raised in the Cost Recovery and Optimizatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the context}} of the BioCreative competition, where {{training}} data were very sparse, we investigated two complementary tasks: 1) given a Swiss-Prot triplet, containing a protein, a GO (Gene Ontology) term and a relevant article, extraction of a short passage that justifies the GO category assignement; 2) given a Swiss-Prot pair, containing a protein and a relevant article, automatic assignement of a set of categories. Methods Sentence is the basic retrieval unit. Our classifier computes a distance between each sentence and the GO category provided with the Swiss-Prot <b>entry.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Text</b> Categorizer computes a distance between each GO term and the text of the article. Evaluations are reported both based on annotator judgements as established by the competition and based on mean average precision measures computed using a curated sample of Swiss-Prot. Results Our system achieved the best recall and precision combination both for passage retrieval and text categorization as evaluated by official evaluators. However, text categorization results were far below those in other data-poor text categorization experiments The top proposed term is relevant in less that 20 % of cases, while categorization with other biomedical controlled vocabulary, such as the Medical Subject Headings, we achieved more than 90 % precision. We also observe that the scoring methods used in our experiments, based on the retrieval status value of our engines, exhibits effective confidence estimation capabilities. Conclusion From a comparative perspective, the combination of retrieval and natural language processing methods we designed, achieved very competitive performances. Largely data-independent, our systems were no less effective that data-intensive approaches. These results suggests that the overall strategy could benefit a large class of information extraction tasks, especially when training data are missing. However, from a user perspective, results were disappointing. Further investigations are needed to design applicable end-user text mining tools for biologists. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It has {{frequently}} been observed that domain experts {{are not necessarily}} ontology experts, and that the production of ontologies would be aided if they could read and edit axioms in natural language. The SWAT Tools Verbaliser is available, via a web interface, for verbalising OWL ontologies as texts in a controlled fragment of English. Taking as input any OWL ontology, the verbaliser creates a lexicon containing <b>entries</b> for all <b>the</b> entities in the input, and uses it to generate an English sentence corresponding to each logical axiom. These sentences are then organised into a document structure {{similar to that of}} an encyclopaedia, with an entry providing a definition, typology and examples for each entity. The output is either organised, easily-navigable English text encoded in XML, or a copy of the input OWL in which each entity is annotated with its description <b>entry.</b> <b>The</b> generated <b>texts</b> have been evaluated {{in a number of ways}} which are briefly presented here. ...|$|R
