500|$|Following an eleven-year hiatus {{producers}} asked Dennis {{to return}} to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episodes. But their talks resulted in Dennis agreeing to return full-time. Alan Dale who played his on-screen father, Jim Robinson helped Dennis {{to make the decision}} to return. Dennis has since admitted that he made a mistake quitting Neighbours in 1992. He explained [...] "I was stupid. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to go to Hollywood and conquer the world, and I didn't." [...] Dennis' return made Paul the only original character still appearing on Neighbours. The actor continued to publicise his commitment to staying on the show long-term.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|During her {{audition}} for the show, Thorne read the {{lines from the}} Pembleton character in a previous episode. She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So {{what do you want}} me to do? Do you want me to be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't want to say that but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E

500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger, {{star of the}} {{preceding}} three films in the series, initially remarked that Terminator Salvation was [...] "a great film, I was very excited", but later reversed this position {{and said it was}} [...] "...awful. It tried hard, not that they didn't try, the acting and everything. It missed the boat." [...] Terminator series creator James Cameron considered it an [...] "interesting film" [...] that he [...] "didn't hate as much as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to", and praised Sam Worthington's performance, but also said he would not return to the franchise: [...] " [...] has kind of run its course [...] frankly, the soup's already been pissed in by other film makers". He also felt his two films were better than either of the later films. Linda Hamilton, who portrayed Sarah Connor in The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day and lent her voice to Terminator Salvation, wished the film [...] "all the best" [...] but expressed her opinion that the series [...] "was perfect with two films. It was a complete circle, and it was enough in itself. But there will always be those who will try to milk the cow".|$|E
500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die. [...] We were going flat out {{and all of a sudden}} I heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never heard so much fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A few of us were feeling quite lucky last night... at the same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. <b>I</b> <b>thought...</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the end of}} the debate, Mitt Romney remarked, [...] "This is a {{lot like}} 'Law & Order,' senator. It has a huge cast, the series seems to go on forever and Fred Thompson shows up at the end." [...] Romney was making a {{reference}} to Fred Thompson's role on Law & Order. Thompson replied, [...] "And to think <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be the best actor on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{often cited}} {{the fact that}} had 10 votes swung from the Conservatives to the Liberals in the riding of Kennebecasis {{there would have been}} a 27-27 tie which may have led to a Liberal {{minority}} government supported by the New Democrats whose one member would have held the balance of power. [...] Graham was quoted on election night saying [...] "until five minutes ago, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be premier".|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, a {{woman who}} was three months {{pregnant}} went to Sowell's home voluntarily. When she tried to leave, he bound her hands and feet with a tie and belt, then gagged her with a rag. The victim told police: [...] "He choked me real hard because my body started tingling. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die." [...] Sowell was charged with kidnapping, rape and attempted rape. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted rape, and as a result he served 15 years in prison. He was released in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I {{thought they were going to}} shut us down, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be out of a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{coach in the}} NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E

2500|$|In {{front of}} a sold-out crowd of 20,510, Álvarez won the fight by a shutout {{unanimous}} decision in dominating fashion. All three judges scored it 120-108 for Álvarez. Chávez was very cautious throughout the fight. At times, he came forward and also had Álvarez against the ropes, but failed to throw any punches. This led to jeers from {{the crowd in the}} later rounds due to lack of action. Álvarez spoke to HBO's Max Kellerman in the post fight interview, speaking of his fighting style, [...] "Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself." [...] CompuBox Stats showed that Álvarez landed 228 of 604 his punches thrown (38%) and Chávez landed 71 of 302 (24%). By the end of round 5, Álvarez landed 102 punches compared to Chávez's 25 landed. Early figures revealed that the fight generated at least 1 million buys. A replay was shown on regular HBO a week later and drew an average of 769,000 viewers. This was the first boxing match to generate over 1 million PPV buys that didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya since 2002, which saw Lennox Lewis retain his heavyweight world titles against Mike Tyson. Later sources confirmed the fight did close to 1.2 million buys, which means it would have generated around $80 million.|$|E
