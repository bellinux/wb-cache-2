40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis {{is concerned with the}} problem of <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> in international trade and with attempts by the EEC to deal with this problem with legislation. Particular attention is paid to the 1984 EEC Code which builds on previous EEC legislation. By examining the 1984 Code and the changes that are incorporated within it the evolution of Community, antidumping/ anti-subsidies policy and practice is explained. Where appropriate, reference is made to specific cases, in order to illustrate the analysis of the Code and comparative reference is also made to relevant legislation in the United States. As well as providing definitions of <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> subsidisation and a brief history of individual countries attempts to deal with the problem, the thesis also presents a detailed analysis of EEC activity against <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> from 1968 to 1983.

40|$|Over {{the past}} four years, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”) has, as it has done since its {{establishment}} in 1982, exercised its jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1295 (a) (5) to review decisions of the United States Court of International Trade (“CIT”) regarding U. S. regulation of international trade. While trade cases currently make up only about six percent of the docket of the Federal Circuit, decisions in these cases can have a significant discernable impact on the day-to-day investigation and regulation of trade matters of the three U. S. agencies featured most prominently in the trade decisions of the Federal Circuit—United States Customs and Border Protection (“Customs”), the United States Department of Commerce (“Commerce”), and the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC” or “Commission”) —and on the parties involved in trade disputes before these agencies. This article covers all cases decided by the Federal Circuit in 2006, and selected cases from 2003 - 2005, dealing with international trade matters from tariff classification to investigations of <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies,</b> <b>and</b> jurisdictional issues related to appeals of these matters.

50|$|The Indian {{administration}} {{along with}} the European Union and six other countries (Brazil, Chile, Japan, South Korea and Mexico) {{filed a complaint with}} the WTO against the Byrd Amendment which was formally known as the Continued <b>Dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Offset Act of 2000 legislated by the US. The essence of this act was that non-US firms which sell below cost price in the US could be fined and the money is given to the US companies who made the complaint in the first place. The act adversely affected the commodities business of the complainant states and has since been repealed after WTO ruled the act to be illegal.|$|E

The inverse relationship observed between filings and the real external value of the U.

40|$|Abstract: The way rubbish {{is handled}} is often {{restricted}} {{by the development}} level of a country and the urban economy. Before the 1980 's, rubbish was mostly <b>dumped</b> <b>and</b> buried {{on the outskirts of}} cities in China. There was no sanitation control in the municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial site. Since there is neither capping {{on the top of the}} site nor means to prevent the leakage at the base of the <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial site, the rubbish is in contact with the earth's surface and the leachate infiltrates through soil. At present, the Chinese government is constructing modern landfill in accordance with the international standards for sanitation landfill. Municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial sites will be closed and remediated. The geological environment problems of municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial must be studied in order to close and remediate them successfully. The rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial sites and the combined relevant rubbish materials were investigated in China. The impact of leachate from rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial sites on surface water, soil and rock, and groundwater water was analysed, together with gas movement and enrichment in the geological environmental. As a result, the geological environmental problems of municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial were understood. The study provides a basis for municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial site remediation in the cities of China.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{findings}} in this case deals with the appropriate method to determine material injury when imported products are subject to simultaneous anti-dumping and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations. Along with addressing a number of legal issues concerning CVD investigations, the Appellate Body clarified restrictions on cross-cumulation of injury, essentially prohibiting the current US practice, and implicitly raising {{the burden of proof}} for parallel claims of dumping and subsidies. This decision is justified on economic grounds, where cumulation imposes a counterfactual scenario against which marginal damages of dumping and subsidies by each country cannot be properly evaluated. However, what the legal rulings by the Appellate Body did not recognize is the economic reality that many like products produced by the firms alleged to have received subsidies were selectively absent from the investigation, which more generally complicates the assessment of injury in <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Continued <b>Dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Offset Act (CDSOA), {{also known}} as the Byrd Amendment, allows the US {{government}} to distribute revenues from antidumping duties to domestic firms alleging harm. Prior to the amendment these revenues were not distributed to firms. In this article, we formally test the hypothesis that the Byrd Amendment effectively provides double protection to US firms {{to the extent that it}} further restricts US imports, as argued by the EU and 11 other US trading partners. Using a rich panel of 362 US manufacturing industries for the period 1998 to 2003, we find that whether or not the Byrd Amendment restricted US imports depends crucially on the level of competitiveness in the import-competing industry. Specifically, we find that the Byrd Amendment served to restrict imports only in industries where competition is relatively weak, while the amendment is associated with an increase in imports in more competitive industries.

50|$|Issues {{involving}} <b>subsidies</b> <b>and</b> {{trade barriers}} on such crops have become controversial {{in discussions of}} globalization. Many developing countries take {{the position that the}} current international trade system is unfair because it has caused tariffs to be lowered in industrial goods while allowing for low tariffs <b>and</b> agricultural <b>subsidies</b> for agricultural goods. This makes it difficult for a developing nation to export its goods overseas, and forces developing nations to compete with imported goods which are exported from developed nations at artificially low prices. The practice of exporting at artificially low prices is known as <b>dumping,</b> <b>and</b> is illegal in most nations. Controversy over this issue led to the collapse of the Cancún trade talks in 2003, when the Group of 22 refused to consider agenda items proposed by the European Union unless the issue of agricultural subsidies was addressed.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} and discuss recent developments in the worldwide use of anti-dumping (AD) policy as a possible strategic counterpoint to trade liberalisation. First, we review briefly the original intended purpose of AD policy, and reflect on its secondary position on the agenda of current international trade negotiations. Second, we discuss the escalating - and perhaps strategic - use of AD policy, particularly in the developing world, and highlight the roles of both interest groups and the state in determining policy outcomes. Next, we review the state of affairs of AD policy with the world's most active user, the US. In particular, we introduce and discuss the latest important development, the implementation of the 'Continued <b>Dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Offset Act of 2000 ', which incorporates monetary compensation for petitioners, potentially offering more opportunities for strategic policy behaviour by firms, industries and the state. We conclude the article with a short discussion of directions for future research and some general concerns about the use of AD policy.

40|$|This brief {{article is}} a report of an {{international}} decision of the World Trade Organization Appellate Body on January 16, 2003, concerning the United States’ Continued <b>Dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Offset Act of 2000 (WT/DS 217 2 ̆ 6 234 /AB/R). Eleven WTO members—Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Communities, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Thailand—filed {{a challenge to the}} Byrd Amendment in the summer of 2001. A WTO dispute settlement panel, agreeing with the complaining parties, made two major findings. First, the panel concluded that the Byrd Amendment constitutes an impermissible specific action against dumping and subsidization under the Antidumping and SCM Agreements. 9 Second, the panel concluded that the Byrd Amendment is inconsistent with the Agreements 2 ̆ 7 requirement that investigations of dumping and subsidization have the support of a domestic industry. The panel reasoned that many firms might file or support applications for relief from dumping and subsidization, even if they were not really affected by import competition, simply in order to qualify for Byrd Amendment distributions. The United States might thus initiate an investigation even though actual support in domestic industry was lacking. On appeal, the Appellate Body upheld the panel 2 ̆ 7 s holding that the Byrd Amendment constitutes an impermissible action against dumping or subsidization, but reversed the panel 2 ̆ 7 s holding on the industry-support question. With respect to the first issue, the Appellate Body noted that the Antidumping and SCM Agreements provide that 2 ̆ 2 [n]o specific action against 2 ̆ 2 dumping or subsidization may be taken by a member except as authorized by WTO rules. The Appellate Body easily concluded that the Byrd Amendment constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 specific action 2 ̆ 2 for these purposes. Payments under the Byrd Amendment, it explained, 2 ̆ 2 are inextricably linked to, and strongly correlated with, 2 ̆ 2 a determination of dumping or subsidization. Without a determination of dumping or subsidization, there would be no antidumping or countervailing duties to distribute...|$|E

ChangConcerns {{over the}} {{possible}} loss of government revenue resulting from tariff reductions under trade liberalization have triggered {{many developing countries}} to opt for a strategy of raising destination-based consumption taxes on tradable goods. The first essay analyzes the welfare effects of a coordinated tariff reduction and domestic tax reform when the objective of a reforming country is to keep its government revenue unchanged. Assuming imperfect competition in an import-competing industry, we find that revenue-neutral reform involving tariff reduction {{and an increase in}} domestic tax rate may reduce domestic welfare under plausible assumptions. It also discusses the scenario in which the reforming country's objective is to keep domestic profit (or production) unchanged. We further identify the conditions under which a profit-neutral tariff and tax reform may be welfare-improving or welfare-deteriorating. The second essay uses a reciprocal-dumping model to examine the welfare effects of the Byrd Amendment (i. e., the Continued <b>Dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Offset Act, or CDSOA). It analyzes the differences in optimal tariffs set by the home and foreign governments when the home (i. e., the U. S.) government redistributes anti-dumping duties to its domestic firm under the new trade law, as compared to the traditional antidumping policy under which these duties are government revenues. We derive conditions under which the CDSOA may raise or lower the price of an import-competing good in the U. S. market. The results show that the CDSOA is an instrument of protectionism and strictly improves the home country welfare when markets are less competitive than in Cournot equilibrium. We find that under the same market characteristics, the new trade law strictly reduces foreign country welfare. The CDSOA's welfare effect is shown to be ambiguous, however, when markets are more competitive than Cournot. The third essay modifies the model presented in Essay 2 to allow for the scenario in which the foreign country strategically responds to the home country's CDSOA law by adopting similar trade law. The results show that the foreign country is able to enhance its national welfare when the import-competing markets are less competitive than in the Cournot equilibrium. We also discuss whether it is welfare-improving for the U. S. to voluntarily repeal the Byrd Amendment and restore the traditional antidumping policy, considering that, otherwise, its trading partner may also adopt the CDSOA law. We find that it is still in the best interest to the U. S. not to revoke the Byrd Amendment when markets are less competitive than Cournot. When markets are more competitive than Cournot, however, repealing the Amendment {{may turn out to be}} socially welfare-improving...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Although the United States has {{complied}} with adverse rulings in many past World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes, {{there are currently}} 11 cases in which rulings {{have not yet been}} implemented or the United States has taken action and the dispute has not been fully resolved. Under WTO dispute settlement rules, a WTO Member will generally be given a reasonable period of time to comply with an adverse WTO decision. While the Member is expected to remove the offending measure {{by the end of this}} period, compensation and temporary retaliation are available if the Member has not acted or taken sufficient action by this time. Either disputing party may request a compliance panel if there is disagreement over whether a Member has complied. Remaining unsettled are long-standing disputes with the European Union (EU) regarding a music copyright statute (DS 160) and a statutory trademark provision affecting property confiscated by Cuba (DS 176), as well as a dispute with Japan over a provision of U. S. antidumping law (DS 184). The Continued <b>Dumping</b> <b>and</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Offset Act of 2000 (“Byrd Amendment”), which was held WTO-inconsistent in January 2003 and repealed effective October 2005, remains the target of sanctions by complainants EU and Japan due to continued payments to U. S. firms authorized under the repeal legislation (P. L. 109 - 171) (DS 217 /DS 234). Congress placed limits on funds that are available for these distributions in December 2010 (P. L. 111 - 291, § 822). In addition, the United States and Antigua have been consulting on the resolution of outstanding issues in Antigua’s challenge of U. S. online gambling restrictions (DS 285). Compensation agreements entered into by the United States with various WTO Members in exchange for the withdrawal by the United States of its WTO gambling commitments, an action taken by the United States to resolve the case, will not enter into effect until issues with Antigua are resolved. Congress repealed a WTO-inconsistent cotton program at issue in Brazil’s 2002 complaint over U. S. cotton subsidies in P. L. 109 - 171, but other programs were also successfully challenged and the United States was later found not to have fully complied (DS 267). The United States since made statutory and administrative changes affecting the export credit guarantee program faulted in the case. While Brazil obtained authorization from the WTO to retaliate in the case, the two countries entered into a preliminary agreement in April 2010 that forestalled the imposition of sanctions and signed a framework agreement in June 2010 aimed at permanently resolving the dispute. The latter includes Brazil’s pledge not to impose sanctions during the life of the agreement and contemplates possible legislative resolution of the dispute in the 2012 farm bill. Brazil had earlier announced that it was entitled to impose $ 829. 3 million in annual retaliation, $ 591 million of which would consist of import surcharges on U. S. goods. Five pending cases involve the U. S. practice of “zeroing,” under which the Department of Commerce (DOC), in calculating dumping margins in antidumping (AD) proceedings, disregards non-dumped sales. The U. S. practice was successfully challenged by the EU (DS 294 /DS 350), Japan (DS 322), Mexico (DS 344), and South Korea (DS 402), resulting in broad WTO prohibitions on U. S. use of the practice. The United States took administrative action to resolve one aspect of DS 294 by abandoning zeroing in original AD investigations as of 2007. It has yet to fully comply, however, either in this case or in DS 350, DS 322, or DS 344. While the EU and Japan requested the WTO to authorize sanctions, each agreed to suspend U. S. -requested arbitration of their proposals in 2010 on the understanding that the United States would resolve outstanding issues in a timely fashion. To this end, DOC in December 2010 proposed to eliminate the use of zeroing in later stages of U. S. AD proceedings. A compliance panel proceeding is currently under way in the dispute with Mexico (DS 344). An adverse panel report was adopted in Korea’s challenge (DS 402) on February 24, 2011...|$|E

As national law product, the new customs law has specific things which are not covered by previous customs law determined by Netherland Colonial Government and Material Penal Provisions (KUHP) and Formai Penal Provisions (KUHAP). Based on the above reason, the matter lodged in this research is how effective Las No. 10 / 1995 on law perception and to accomodate national needs, matter of objection and appeals, as customs law enforcer, the expeditious flow of goods process, also customs duty income. To solve and describe the above matter the research using normative juridical approach and completed with sociological approach and quantitative analysis. Therefore, the research besides observed law in books also observed law as law in action. The discoveries of the research are : The effectiveness of law No. 10 / 1995 may look by the outcome of law produd, i. e. three previous customs law become one customs law which based the phyiosophies on Pancasila and UUD 1945. The outcome of the quality/effectiveness of the product of Law No. 10 / 1995 may look by the successful' to make a) the smoothness of the flow of goods by seff assessment system, application of selective examination, also release of goods is not tied to payment process. b) the smoothness of customs declaration whether export declaration or- import declaration by the provisions of Law No. 10 / 1995. Besides lodgment of customs declaration by form, also lodgment of Customs declaration by disket or via electronic data interchange. So the effectiveness may look by the time needed for the process. c) the using of high technology container X-ray for physically inspections. The effectiveness of special programme to reach certain outcome may outlook by the using of profiling, targeting, verification and auditing, so the control system focused on investigating of book keeping and Wing of documents and correspondence concerning imports and exports. Thing which can not be ignored is possibility of argue. In this matter, the users of customs services are provided With rights to file objections, appeals against decisions made by the customs officials. The objections and the appeals besides regulated in provisions of national law also regulated in statements or agreement which conducted by several nations such as ASEAN Agreement on Customs, ASEAN Customs Vision 2020 Vision Statement also International Convention on the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures. The argue which can not be ignored needs fair solution which needs fast, cheap and simply process and procedure. The effectiveness of law enforcement also covered by Law No. 10 / 1995 which include administrative sanction for the violation of customs administration by fine punishment which the amount of flne ang things of violation written inarticles of Law No. 10 / 1995 also the violation of customs penal provisions which are fiscal violations described dearly in Law No, 10 / 1995. Specificaly, Law No. 10 / 1995 regulated different things such as : concerning formai penal : 1) 	Penal threat against trial is equal to final penal. 2) 	Imprison punish ment subtitute by fine penalty in case of criminal prosecution is directed to a legal person as written in article 108 La No. 10 / 1995. 3) 	The fine which is not paid by the sentence, asset and/or eaming of the sentence shall be taken as the subtitute, as written In article 110 paragraph 1 Customs Law. 4) 	Expiration of the law suft as regulated in article 111 customs law. Things related with formal penal are : 1) 	The termination of the investigation for the state revenue purposes is written in article 113 2) 	Passing on the result of the investigation (SPDP) to general Prosecutor as written in article 112 paragraph 3 Customs Law 3) 	Execution for confiscation of goods for the state written in article 109 Customs Law All of things described above besides effected to more effective of law inforcement also state fast services, cheap and simple related to formal penal and considering with Lex Specielis Derogate Lex Generalis. The effectiveness to reach fundamental goal accomadated in law.

Law No. 10 / 1995 about customs has separation of sub systems of imported goods clearance process, revenue collection process, control princip. The three things are separated to warrant the expeditous flow of goods so there is no high cost economy that customs user paid as the wish. The high cost economy may be avoided by Directorate General of Customs and Excise together with Customs Services Users. Concerning the above reason, Directorate General of Customs and Excise may acts one of customs functions as trade facilitator which may smoother the flow of goods. 	Directorate General of Customs and Excise has one of its functions as to prevent violation against customs law and take action on goods in performing the task by virtue of customs law and investigate an offence against customs law.
