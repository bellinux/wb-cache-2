25|$|In 1997, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams told an RTÉ {{journalist}} of his party's {{involvement in}} the dispute:Ask any activist in the north, 'did Drumcree happen by accident?', and he will tell you, 'no'. Three years of work on the lower Ormeau Road, Portadown and parts of Fermanagh and Newry, Armagh and in Bellaghy and up in Derry. Three years of work went into creating that situation and fair play {{to those people who}} put the work in. They are the type of scene changes that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> and develop and exploit.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The electron guns used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond {{the state of the}} art at the time.|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, McGuinness {{said that}} the album was almost {{complete}} and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent {{was no longer the}} likely title. The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... we have to do what we do best and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that." [...] Guetta clarified that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dee, in September 1940 when Rowe {{heard of}} this he {{attempted}} {{to take over the}} project. After a 22 September meeting with Philip Joubert de la Ferte, Rowe built a GL team under the direction of D. M. Robinson using several members of the AIS team, telling them that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the GL problem for the next month or two. This led to increasing friction between Dee and Rowe, and especially Rowe's right-hand-man, Lewis. Dee claimed that Rowe was [...] "seizing this opportunity to try and filch the GL problem from the ADEE" [...] and that [...] "only Hodgkin is carrying on undisturbed with AIS, and Lovell and Ward are fortunately engaged upon basic work with aerials and receivers and are therefore relatively undisturbed by this new flap." ...|$|E
2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> defending myself.|$|E
50|$|Although Germany and {{its allies}} no longer <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> Russia, {{the large numbers of}} American troops and weapons {{reaching}} Europe turned the tide against Germany, and {{after more than a year}} of fighting, Germany surrendered.|$|R
50|$|Growing up, Zah <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> Education and Soccer. He was {{regarded}} as one of the best Midfielders on his School team. He gained the love of so many football supporters in his school and his community.|$|R
50|$|Adolf Loos, {{architect}} of the café´s original furnishings, had the opinion that an architect <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the functional aspects {{and not on the}} artistic ones. He concentrated on a very plain design for the Café Museum, which was revolutionary in the time of its opening.|$|R
50|$|As {{the source}} levels can't be easily modified, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the {{interaction}} between those levels and the noise levels.|$|E

50|$|For example, your {{competitor}} {{in the market}} sells Tea A but you sell Tea B, you will then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> producing Tea B so that your customers find your product to be more appealing (in terms of price, taste and services) compared to your competitor.|$|E
50|$|The rise in {{consumption}} was {{preceded by}} a rise in mass production in which factory size increased dramatically and large corporations began to dominate the economic landscape. Suddenly overproduction became a real concern, and the corporations <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> finding new markets for their products (pp. 15-19).|$|R
50|$|Community volunteers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> {{a screen}} and {{accurately}} identify {{if there was}} a change between series of dots after being fixated on a point {{in the center of the}} screen. Distraction of attention by visual disruptions and the observers' ability <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> potential change were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an effect on attention with change blindness.|$|R
50|$|Soon Ken is romantically {{involved}} with Ann, but he can't be persuaded even by her {{to reveal his}} reasons for not participating in the university basketball. He claims he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> his engineering studies, and this disappoints coach Ambrose, who is eager <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him back on the team.|$|R
50|$|For Christmas, 2013, Coke Zero {{launched}} an interactive website that allowed people to customize {{the designs of}} their Christmas sweater. These knitted items of clothing have {{a significant role in}} United Kingdom Christmas traditions. The concept behind the campaign was to subtly remind people that ads don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the products to convey the warm, inviting essence of the holidays.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, The Moog toured in the United States playing {{shows with}} B-52's. In an {{interview}} with the Hungarian Origo, Szabó said that after the gigs a lot of middle-age women wanted photos with the band. Szabó added that now they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> middle age women as the target audience rather than teenage girls as the band was doing it before.|$|E
5000|$|Mark Hemel: [...] "The next {{generation}} of planners, architects and designers {{will have to get}} used thinking big, so making reference to big environmental challenges and mayor expected world population dynamic. Architects in particular will find themselves less and less powerful. We therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> making our work more [...] "information based" [...] or we might get side-lined and more and more irrelevant".|$|E
50|$|After {{spending}} {{a season in}} the top-tier division, he joined Third Division side Kwun Tong, as he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> academic studies.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the base product, Add-ons are sold by ISV's. Because the base program <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> generic versions of business cases, software products supplementing/modifying NAV functionality are required, sold and distributed as NAV Add-ons, to improve functionality of NAV system or make it applicable in some business spheres.|$|R

5000|$|Teaching {{children}} learned optimism by guiding {{them through}} the ABCDE techniques can help children to better deal with adversity they encounter in their lives. [...] If children are taught early then the thought process of disputation is claimed [...] to become ingrained in them. They do not, then, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> being optimistic, but rather optimism becomes automatic and leads to a more positive life for the child.|$|E
50|$|While {{preparing}} for the Olympics Sha-ri also participated in a few bodybuilding competitions. She placed 2nd at the Nebraska Championships in 1984, and 4th at the 1989 Los Angeles Championships. She quickly {{decided to take a}} break from competing saying that in order for her to be successful at bodybuilding she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> it. Since she was focusing on trying for the Olympics she could not give bodybuilding her full attention at that time.|$|E

50|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Martensen said {{health care in}} the United States left many stakeholders dissatisfied.

40|$|While {{there is}} now {{consensus}} that financial supervision <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the aggregate (macroprudential), {{in addition to the}} individual (microprudential), there is no agreed macroprudential framework for measuring financial imbalances and applying policies to correct such imbalances.

50|$|Nahar says he {{believes}} that every artist or creative person must have his own personality and each artist must have a character. The concept of the mask speaks a lot, {{because it is not}} just about artistic charisma but also has an important message on self-awareness. The message behind the mask is that the form in which God created us in is outside our control, so we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> what we wear and the look we choose to present ourselves in front of others.|$|E
50|$|When Albert Percival Rowe, {{director}} of the Air Ministry's radar teams, heard of the Army efforts in September 1940, he set about creating his own GL development effort using the magnetron.

25|$|A skilled {{player can}} dribble without {{watching}} the ball, using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision {{to keep track}} of the ball's location. By not <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.|$|R
50|$|PGWA matches tend to run 15 to 30 minutes, {{as opposed}} to the usual 5 to 10 minutes often allotted female wrestlers by promoters. This allows wrestlers to display a full range of their abilities, rather than <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a few key moves in the short span of time their match allows.|$|R
50|$|Even though {{quality is}} now {{seen as a}} {{competitive}} advantage, US business organizations in the 1970s tended <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> more <b>on</b> cost and productivity.
