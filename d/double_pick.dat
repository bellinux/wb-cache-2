These faults consist of end-break, mispick, double-end, <b>double</b> <b>pick,</b> oil stain and knots in the fabric. The faulty samples are scanned and processed using image processing. After eliminating the noises from the pictures, carried out by filtration, the pictures are introduced to neural network. In this research a 3 -layer perceptron neural network has been utilized. The transform function {{is based on the}} function of Sigmoid. To train the network, 85 samples were used. Due to the increase of weights and the layers of neurons resulted from the increment in input, the process time will be added. This will result in a decrease in the calculation error...|$|E

30|$|It is more {{important}} for OSAT firms to find the fraction defective during the production process than any others. Double head component enable to inspect the chip unlike single Head. Moreover, there are two pick and place heads on machine, the production efficiency is improved up to more 60 % than with one head. In spite of the innovative input, The K failed because their competitor already developed a similar product. At the end of 2010 s, competition was more heated up for OSAT due to Double Head component. The K established a new organization to implement the innovation beyond the double head component. This led to the dual Flipper Module in the <b>Double</b> <b>Pick</b> and Place machine. With the ongoing expansion of the smart phones, digital cameras and other electronic based products, the flip chip revolution is in full swing. Time to market and volume production are {{more important}} than ever. This flip chip technology drives the need for production equipment including flip chip bonders. A key advantage of flip chip is size. Flip chip does not require peripheral space for the wire bond. They can be made smaller than wire bond packages with a similar Input and Output count. For die with Input and Output count, flip chip technology offers large space savings because the I/O can be arranged in an array on both die and substrate. This eliminates the need for traces to the chip edge form internal interconnect points. A key advantage of dual Flipper is improved performance because it provides improved number of I/O, plus the concentration of more signal, ground and power connections in smaller area, in terms of rotating the <b>double</b> <b>Pick</b> and Places. This process eliminated die attach wire bonding. Assembly time, the total number of process steps, overall capital equipment cost, the number of pieces of equipment as well as other factors effected by flip chip technology resulted in a reduced cost.|$|E

40|$|In this study, six {{different}} woven samples were produced on air jet loom with two different weave designs (i. e. 3 / 1 twill and 1 / 1 plain), three different picking sequences (i. e. single pick insertion (SPI), <b>double</b> <b>pick</b> insertion (DPI) and three pick insertion (3 PI)). All the woven samples were singed, desized, bleached and finished together at industrial scale, {{as a single}} lot. The effect of these factors on the wetting, wicking and air permeability (AP) of the fabric samples was analysed. It was revealed that the fabric weave design and picking sequence has statistically significant effect on fabric wetting time, water spreading speed and AP of the fabric. It was found that fabrics woven in twill weave design and with simultaneous 3 PI give significantly better AP, shorter wetting time and better water spreading rate as compared to plain woven fabrics and those with double or SPI. It could be concluded that the thermophysiological comfort of woven fabrics may be significantly improved simply by selecting a suitable weave design and picking sequence...|$|E

50|$|Most fine coffee {{goes through}} a battery of {{machines}} that sort the coffee by density of bean and by bean size, all the while removing sticks, rocks, nails, and miscellaneous debris that may have become mixed with the coffee during drying. First machines blow the beans into the air; those that fall into bins closest to the air source are heaviest and biggest; the lightest (and likely defective) beans plus chaff are blown in the farthest bin. Other machines shake the beans {{through a series of}} sieves, sorting them by size. Finally, a machine called a gravity separator shakes the sized beans on a tilted table, so that the heaviest, densest and best vibrate {{to one side of the}} pulsating table, and the lightest to the other.The final step in the cleaning and sorting procedure is called color sorting, or separating defective beans from sound beans on the basis of color rather than density or size. Color sorting is the trickiest and perhaps most important of all the steps in sorting and cleaning. With most high-quality coffees color sorting is done in the simplest possible way: by hand. Teams of workers pick discolored and other defective beans from the sound beans. The very best coffees may be hand-cleaned twice (<b>double</b> <b>picked)</b> or even three times (triple picked). Coffee that has been cleaned by hand is usually called European preparation; most specialty coffees have been cleaned and sorted in this way.|$|R
40|$|Fusarium oxysporum forma specialis cubense is a soilborne {{phytopathogen}} that infects banana. The true evolutionary {{identity of}} this so called species, Fusarium oxysporum, is still unknown. Many techniques {{have been applied}} {{in order to gain}} insight for the observed genetic diversity of this species. The current classification system is based on vegetative compatibility groups (VCG 2 ̆ 7 s). Vegetative compatibility is a self non-self recognition system in which only those belonging to a VCG can form stable heterokaryons, cells containing two distinct nuclei. Heterokaryons in turn, are formed from hypha! anastomosis, the fusion of two hyphae. Furthermore, subsequent to heterokaryon formation potential mechanisms exist which may generate genetic variability. One is through viral transfer upon hyphal anastomosis. The other mechanism is a form of mitotic recombination referred to as the parasexual cycle. Very little research has been performed to directly obser. ve the cellular events; hypha! anastomosis, heterokaryon formation, and the parasexual cycle in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. The purpose of this research was to design and use methods which would allow for the detection of hypha! anastomosis and heterokaryon formation, as well as any characteristics surrounding this event, within and between VCG 2 ̆ 7 s in Foe. First, some general growth properties were recorded: the number of nuclei per hypha, the size ofthe hyphal tip cell, the size of the cell adjacent to the hypha! tip (pre-tip) cell, and the number of cells to the first branch point. Second, four methods were designed in order to assay hyphal anastomosis and heterokaryon formation: 1) pairings on membrane: phase or brightfield microscopy, 2) pairings on membrane: fluorescence microscopy, 3) spore crosses: fluorescence microscopy, and 4) <b>double</b> <b>picks</b> in fractionated MMA.
