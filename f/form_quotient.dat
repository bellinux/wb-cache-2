40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the accuracy of taper functions fitted with and without stratification on Pinus sp. trees. Three strata were allocated using diameter at 1. 3 m above the ground, artificial form factor and Schiffel’s <b>form</b> <b>quotient</b> as stratification criteria. Schöepfer, Kozak et al. Hradetzky, Garcia et al., Ormerod and Demaerchalk taper functions were tested and the one which best fitted to the total population was selected by statistics {{standard error of estimate}} in percentage (s yx %), adjusted coefficient of determination (R ² aj.) and residual scatterplots. After this, the selected function was fitted with data stratified and the gain of accuracy was evaluated by two statistical methods. As results, Hradetzky’s function adjusted better when compared to the others. Equations obtained for the total population and for strata are statistically different. Stratification by form factor and by <b>form</b> <b>quotient</b> provide considerable reduction of errors, reaching up to 50 %, however it was not observed expressive reduction for stratification by diameter at 1. 3 above the ground.

Identification of the quantitative and qualitative features of this species is important. In order to investigate the stem form of this species in the Shafaroud forests of Guilan Province, 141 lime trees in 39 plots were analyzed during the four stages of small pole, pole, saw-timber, and maturity. In each plot, stem-diameter at different heights was measured by using the Spiegel Relaskop. Measurements and analyses included diameter at breast height(d. b. h.) and total height. Same parameters was calculated: stem form factor based on diameter, stem form factor based on volume, <b>form</b> <b>quotient,</b> slenderness factor, ratio of stem height to total height, ratio of stem volume to total volume, correlation, and coefficient of determination to describe stem form factor. The results showed that the average stem form factor based on diameter was 0. 554. The average stem form factor based on volume was 0. 576, average <b>form</b> <b>quotient</b> was 2. 32 and slenderness factor was 35. 04 %. The average ratio of stem height to total height was 82. 45. In addition the results indicated a strong relationship between diameter at breast height and trunk coefficient. The ratio of stem volume to total volume revealed that 64. 44 of lime volume is located in {{the bottom half of the}} trunk.

The sampled trees were logged and rigorously cubed, andeight volumetric models were adjusted.

Stoate model presented the best performance to estimate the bole volume and the total wood volume of Pterogyne nitens with bark.

In the study of mathematical structures it is very common to <b>form</b> <b>quotient</b> structures by identifying elements in some equivalence classes. By varying the equivalence relations, the corresponding quotient structures often reveal certain hidden features of the original structure. In this paper, we focus on of the upper semi-lattice of computably enumerable degrees and the equivalence relations are induced by definable ideals. We begin with introducing some notations and terminologies. Let R be the class of computably enumerable degrees or simply c. e. degrees. Definition 1. We say that a nonempty subset I of R is an ideal of R if I is downward closed and closed under join. In other words, the following conditions are satisfied. (a) If a is in I and b ≤ a then b is in I; (b) If a and b are in I, then their least upper bound, denoted by a ∨ b, is in I. We say that an ideal I is definable {{if there is a}} first-order formula ϕ(x) over the partial order language L = {≤} such that a c. e. degree a ∈ I if and only if R | = ϕ(a). Each ideal I of R naturally induced an equivalence relation ≡I as follows. For any two c. e. degrees a and b, define a ≤I b if and only if ∃x ∈ I(a ≤T b ∨ x) ...|$|E

The former stand was established in March 1958 and the latter in 1933. The planting types were planting by individuals (Type A) and planting in clumps (Type B), were the number of trees per clump was from 2 to 6. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. In Stand I, the survival ratio of Type B was {{higher than that of}} Type A. 2. In Stand I, the height growths were not affected by differences of densities or types. But in Stand II, the height growths of Type B were higher than those of Type A. 3. In Stand I, the diameter growths at the ground level of Type A was larger than those of Type B. In Stand II, the diameter growths at the breast height of Type B was larger than those of Type A. 4. The <b>form</b> <b>quotient</b> (height/diameter) of Type A was higher than that of Type B in Stand I. On the other hand, the relationship was reverse in Stand II. 5. The frequencies of height and diameter at the ground level in Stand I and of diameter at the breast height in Stand II had not been affected by competition among individuals. 6. The development of crowns and root systems had been affected by competition among individuals. 7. The growth of Stand I showed that Type B was in a more advantageous position as to the competition with weeds and shrubs. 8. In Stand II, Type B showed better growths than Type A. It seems that the better growths of Type B was related to the fact that Type B had larger surface of the sunny crown than Type A...|$|E

The elastic metric allows for optimal matching of features between curves while path-straightening ensures that the algorithm results in geodesic paths.
