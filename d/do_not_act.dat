5|$|In natural populations, {{genetic drift}} and natural {{selection}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in isolation; both forces are always at play, together with mutation and migration. Neutral evolution {{is the product}} of both mutation and drift, not of drift alone. Similarly, even when selection overwhelms genetic drift, it can only act on variation that mutation provides.|$|E
5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E

25|$|In many societies, men who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in this {{traditional}} masculine way are ostracized {{by their peers}} and considered effeminate. In studies, young males from Cambodia, Mexico, Peru and South Africa, reported that they have participated in incidents where girls were coerced into sex (such as gang rapes) and that they did so {{as a way to}} prove their masculinity to their friends, or under peer pressure and fear that they would be rejected if they didn't participate in the assault.|$|E
25|$|Sloth {{bears are}} {{sympatric}} with Asiatic black bears in northern India, {{and the two}} species, along with the sun bear, coexist {{in some of the}} national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. They are also found together in Assam, Manipur, and Mizoram, in the hills south of the Brahmaputra River, the only places occupied by all three bear species. The three species <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> aggressively toward each other. This may be because the three species generally differ in habit and dietary preferences.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, {{it seems}} to be assumed that all {{ecosystem}} services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as coastal protection from hurricanes by mangroves for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting cattle. The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves {{play a critical role in}} regulating prey populations, the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands have caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.|$|E

25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of the referees is advisory. The {{publisher}} is typically under no obligation to accept the opinions of the referees, though she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The group dynamics are thus substantially different from that of a jury.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{there are}} number of {{secondary}} and tertiary associations of housing co-operatives. The major national organization is the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada (CHF Canada). Most provinces have similar organizations for their area, {{but many are}} stand-alone members of the CHF Canada, {{as opposed to being}} branches of it. Each such organization charges its member co-operatives a fee {{based on the number of}} housing units in the co-op to pay for staff to do its work. This includes advocacy to governments, setting up self-help funding and the like. These organizations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> for individual members, and do not give members advice when the member encounters problems with the Board of their co-op. In most jurisdictions there are no organizations for members of housing co-operatives, in contrast with tenants in a traditional landlord-and-tenant relationship, who can be assisted by various tenant advocacy groups.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicated}} that a substitution at the phthaloyl ring would increase TNF-α inhibition activity (Figure 5). An amino group substitution was tested at various locations on the phthaloyl ring (C4, C5, C6, C7) of thalidomide and EM-12 (previously described). Amino addition at the C4 location on both thalidomide and EM-12 resulted in much more potent inhibition of TNF-α. This also revealed that the amino group needed to be directly opposite the carbonyl group on the isoindolinone ring system for the most potent activity. These analogs do not inhibit PDE4 and therefore <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> by PDE4 inhibition. Other additions of longer and bigger groups at the C4 and C5 position of the phthaloyl ring system of thalidomide, some with an olefin functionality, have been tested with various results. Increased inhibitory effect, compared to thalidomide, was noticed with the groups that had an oxygen atom attached directly to the C5 or C4 olefin. Iodine and bromine addition at C4 or C5 resulted in equal or decreased activity compared to thalidomide. These groups were not compared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide.|$|E

500|$|... "Invasion" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the 6th season of the American {{television}} medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and the show's 107th episode overall. It was written by Mark Wilding and directed by Tony Phelan. The episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on October 15, 2009. In the episode, the physicians of Seattle Grace Hospital must learn to co-operate with new Mercy West residents, who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in a kind manner to them. Other storylines include Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father returning {{to the hospital to}} condemn her homosexuality, and Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) putting her career into jeopardy after administering the wrong treatment to a patient.|$|E
500|$|Changes {{brought on}} by the {{exponential}} growth of human population (at the time of the book's publication, over 6 billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years) and the worldwide scale of resource consumption, have altered the picture, however. [...] Ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed (since the 1980s) nature's capacity for regeneration. [...] We are now using more than 125% of nature's yearly output. [...] "If civilization is to survive, it must live on the interest, not the capital of nature" [...] (129).

500|$|The second part, titled [...] "Partition", is {{preceded by}} the sound of paparazzi camera clicks and a window {{whirring}} up, which separates it from the first part [...] "Yoncé".

Caitlin White, writing for The 405, highlighted that the song details a romantic relationship in which women <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>act</b> as sexual objects during sexual intercourse but rather use [...] "the physical act of love as a form of agency", from which they derive pleasure. [...] "Partition" [...] gained significant attention for its explicit lyrics, with frequent references made to the opening lines of the first verse in which Beyoncé asks her driver to put up the partition.|$|E
