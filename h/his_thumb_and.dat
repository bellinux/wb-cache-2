5|$|Though Shuey {{struggled}} upon {{joining the}} Dodgers, recording a 9.35 ERA {{in his first}} eleven appearances after the trade, he altered his approach and began to obtain better results, allowing no runs in his next five appearances. Shuey played for the Dodgers {{through the end of}} the 2003 season. During spring training prior to the 2004 season, he tore a ligament in <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> reinjured his hip while fielding a bunt during his rehabilitation. Shuey spent the entire season on the disabled list. The Dodgers sued the Hartford Life Insurance Company, who insured Shuey's contract, over Shuey's $3.25 million salary for the 2004 season, saying the insurance company did not honor their claim.|$|E

25|$|As {{the third}} quarter neared a close, Waters {{recorded}} another interception and returned it to the Rams' 20, setting up quarterback Roger Staubach's 4-yard touchdown pass to Scott Laidlaw 58 seconds into the final period. On Waters' interception, Pat Haden's throwing hand hit Randy White's helmet, breaking <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> knocking {{him out of the}} game.|$|E

25|$|Franklin {{missed the}} 2009 NAB Cup after {{undergoing}} surgery on <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> his shoulder in the off-season. On {{his return to}} senior football, his form fell well short of his 2008 performances. He played his 100th game in round 19 against St Kilda at Aurora Stadium in Launceston. During the game, one of Franklin's teeth fell out during a marking contest with Saints defender Zac Dawson.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Gleason was {{initially}} exempt from military service, {{since he was}} a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed {{at the end of his}} coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F, and rejected for military service.|$|E
25|$|Entwistle's playing {{technique}} incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, {{and the use}} of harmonics. He {{changed his}} style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioning his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> forefinger, {{with the rest of his}} fingers outstretched for balance.|$|E
50|$|Ama had his lands {{taken by}} the wealthy coffee {{planting}} family, the Regalados, during which he was hung by <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> beaten. This was {{in the context of}} liberal reforms which stripped the indigenous population of access to their communal lands, which were appropriated by private landowners.|$|R

'Well, {{it was like}} this, my lady,' he began, turning to Lady Georgina, and wriggling to gain time. 'You see, his lordship and Mr. Higginson----' he twirled <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> tried to invent something plausible.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{rose and}} {{approached}} the ape-man, who {{closed his eyes and}} feigned unconsciousness. He felt hairy hands upon him as he was turned over, none too gently.

25|$|In 1939, {{he enlisted}} in the Australian Defence Force after the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and served in the anti-aircraft regiments of the Ninth Division in the Middle East, before being deployed to Papua New Guinea. There, Sergeant Iverson developed an unorthodox method of spinning the ball, which he gripped between <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> middle finger. This enabled him to bowl a wide variety of deliveries, including off breaks, leg breaks and googlies, without any change of action. At this stage he was only playing socially in spontaneous recreation with other army colleagues.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{also took}} place in Manali and Film City in Mumbai. During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? I guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|E
500|$|As a sophomore, Allen {{increased}} his scoring average to 10.9points per game, {{second on the}} team, and again led the team in blocks with 1.56per game. He shot a team-best [...]579 from the floor, and his [...]618 field goal percentage in league games led the Atlantic 10. In addition, he led the team and {{finished third in the}} Atlantic 10 in rebounding with 9.0rebounds per game. He had 14double-doubles on the season. In the Owls' game against Lafayette, Allen broke <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> was forced to miss the next game against Buffalo. His season-high 23points came on February8, when the Owls defeated the Rhode Island Rams 68-62; Allen also had 13rebounds. The following day, Allen received his first Philadelphia Big 5 player of the week honors. He would again be honored as Big5 player of the week on February23, following a 20-point and season-high 18 rebound performance against St. Bonaventure.|$|E

500|$|Roshan was {{not seen}} on screen again until 2006, with three new releases, {{including}} a cameo {{at the end}} of the year in the romance I See You. He co-starred with Naseeruddin Shah and Priyanka Chopra in his father's superhero production Krrish. A follow-up to his family's production Koi... Mil Gaya, it saw him play dual roles—the title superhero and his character from the original film. Before production, Roshan traveled to China to train with Tony Ching for the cable work that would be needed to make his character fly. He sustained several injuries during production. For example, he tore the hamstring in his right leg and broke <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> toe. Krrish was a box office success and became the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006 with a worldwide revenue of [...] It garnered him Best Actor awards at the 2007 Screen and the International Indian Film Academy Awards. Ronnie Scheib of Variety considered Roshan a prime asset of the film, noting that he [...] "pulls off the pic's wilder absurdities with considerable panache".|$|E
500|$|Following the European Grand Prix on 21 May {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions across European circuits between 23–27 May {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. Jordan, Sauber, Benetton, Jaguar and Arrows opted to test at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo circuit which made its Formula One testing début that garnered mixed reviews from the drivers. Frentzen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing, ahead of Sauber test driver Enrique Bernoldi. Jos Verstappen for the Arrows team set the second day's quickest times. Late in the session Fisichella hit the right rear tyre of Jordan driver Jarno Trulli, causing his Benetton to flip over and brought a brief halt to testing. Fisichella suffered minor bruising to <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> Benetton withdrew their second driver Alexander Wurz from testing. Sauber's Mika Salo topped the final days running. Williams and BAR went to the Circuit Paul Armagnac circuit which was where the teams undertook shake down runs and used car set-ups. BAR tested a new control system called [...] "Athena 2000" [...] which managed the software of the car's engine and different sections on the chassis. Ferrari tested at their private test facility, the Fiorano Circuit, for five days where test driver Luca Badoer and Michael Schumacher concentrated on aerodynamic and tyre testing, as well as undertaking different set-ups and running on an artificially wet track.|$|E
500|$|Originally a fast-medium bowler—a {{style to}} which he {{sometimes}} reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. He gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he {{thought it might be}} effective. To deceive the batsman he varied [...] the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His Wisden obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a [...] "fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and The Times described him as [...] "subtle in flight and with artful variations".|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the King {{had a rather}} hard time of it. When he wished to go any place he was obliged to hold {{out in front of}} him, between <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> fingers, the glass eyes, that they might guide his footsteps. This, as you may imagine, made his Majesty look rather undignified, and dignity is very important to every royal personage.|$|R

500|$|When Jon Gruden {{took over}} the head {{coaching}} job of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from Tony Dungy, he made Walker his first draft selection in the 2002 NFL Draft with the 86th overall selection that came {{in the third round}} of the draft. [...] Although Walker was the property of the Buccaneers for the 2002 NFL season, he did not appear in any games. [...] Walker had been behind Keyshawn Johnson, Joe Jurevicius and Keenan McCardell on the Buccaneer 2002 depth chart. [...] Then, he injured his ankle in August and was inactive for the first four games of the season. [...] He was injured in September with torn ligaments in <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> had season ending surgery, which caused the Buccaneers to place him on injured reserve in October. Thus, he was not on the game roster for the Super Bowl XXXVII Champion Buccaneers. [...] He was traded to the Arizona Cardinals for running back Thomas Jones prior to the 2003 NFL season after the Cardinals lost their top three wide receivers (including David Boston and Frank Sanders) to free agency. [...] He was cut by the Cardinals on August 23, 2003 and picked up by the Cincinnati Bengals on August 25, 2003 who released him on August 27, 2003. The Tennessee Titans briefly placed him on their practice squad while trying to convert him to tight end later during the season, and the Miami Dolphins worked him out at different times during the season.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

2500|$|Two of {{his fingers}} {{remained}} paralyzed. By sheer will, he taught himself to overcome his now permanent handicap by using only <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> two fingers.

2500|$|Van Halen also employs tapping harmonics.

In support of his two-handed tapping techniques, Van Halen also holds a patent for a flip-out support device that attaches {{to the rear of}} the electric guitar. This device enables the user to play the guitar in a manner similar to the piano by orienting the face of the guitar upward instead of forward.|$|E
