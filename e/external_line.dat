5000|$|The {{ground floor}} is {{arranged}} about a central room beneath the Long Room with hallways running either side off which offices {{are found in}} the end bays of the building. Generally the ground floor ceiling is of timber boarding, the walls are plastered and modest skirting boards and cornices have been used. Much joinery remains and this is of excellent quality with unusual five panelled doors. Chimney pieces remain in some of the rooms and these are timber framed with tiled and marbled infill panels. Centrally located downstairs is a room formerly known as the Queens Warehouse, a large semi-circular space defined by a curved brick wall, forming the foundations of the porch the internal line of which it is directly above. The <b>external</b> <b>line</b> of the porch is supported on sandstone foundations which form another wall separated from the brick foundation wall by a walkway. The ceiling in this space is clad with small gauge corrugated iron. The Queen's Warehouse houses the [...] "Customs House Discovery Centre". The interpretive centre includes wall mounted display cases, free-standing display cases, the use of crates and sacks and mannequins. The main feature is a reconstructed wharf sub-structure. The free standing cases and exhibits are secured by the placement of weights within the cases. A lightweight grid is suspended from the ceiling toward the northern end of the area, indicating Rockhampton street signs and for possible use in later exhibition design. A wall mounted display case is also located in this area. Some multimedia facilities are included in the interpretation centre.|$|E

These functions have nice and thoroughly studied analytic, geometric and number theoretic properties. They possess Gauss-Manin connection and in conformal case are expressed by iterated integrals.

40|$|We {{consider}} the dimensional regularization of the light-cone gauge type II superstring field theories in the NSR formalism.

In this work, we study the tree-level amplitudes with <b>external</b> <b>lines</b> in the Ramond sector.

With the worldsheet theory, we regularize and define the tree-level amplitudes by analytic continuation. We show that the results coincide with those of the first quantized formulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the calculation of}} all planar master integrals that are needed for the computation of NNLO QCD corrections {{to the production of}} two off-shell vector bosons in hadron collisions. The most complicated representatives of integrals in this class are the two-loop four-point functions where two <b>external</b> <b>lines</b> are on the light-cone and two other <b>external</b> <b>lines</b> have different invariant masses. We compute these and other relevant integrals analytically using differential equations in external kinematic variables and express our results in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. The case of two equal off-shellnesses, recently considered in Ref. [1], appears as a particular case of our general solution.
