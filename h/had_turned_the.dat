5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> game into something more playable.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775-76. Zahir <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.|$|E

5|$|The No.22 Virginia Tech Hokies {{came into}} the 1993 Independence Bowl with an 8–3 regular-season record that {{included}} wins over Pittsburgh and Virginia. The bowl appearance was the first for head coach Frank Beamer, who <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> team around after a 2–8–1 season the previous year. Facing the Hokies were the No. 21 Indiana Hoosiers, who were playing in their first bowl game since the 1991 Copper Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871– January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867– May 30, 1912), {{were two}} American aviators, engineers, inventors, and {{aviation}} pioneers who are generally credited after receiving {{information from the}} government meteorologist stationed there. Kitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from reporters, who <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.|$|E
5|$|Under the Congressional {{calendar}} of the 1860s, {{members of the}} 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863; by the time Blaine finally took his seat that month, the Union <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tide in the war with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. As a first-term congressman, he initially said little, mostly following the administration’s lead in supporting the continuing war effort. He did clash several times with {{the leader of the}} Republicans' radical faction, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, firstly over payment of states' debts incurred in supporting the war, and again over monetary policy concerning the new greenback currency. Blaine also spoke in support of the commutation provision of the military draft law passed in 1863 and proposed a constitutional amendment allowing the federal government to impose taxes on exports.|$|E

5|$|Cofresí's sudden {{success was}} an oddity, {{nearly a century}} {{after the end of}} the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint {{governmental}} efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean into a haven for pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofresí to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|The see of Philadelphia {{had been}} vacant {{since the death}} of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, whose {{province}} included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, Louis de Barth) <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches {{in a part of the}} nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as trusteeism) over the rights of churches' lay trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.|$|E
5|$|A {{ridge to}} the north turned Gordon to the west-northwest, and by November 14 the cloud pattern resembled that of a {{subtropical}} cyclone, with little convection near and the strongest winds well-removed from the center. The storm paralleled the northern coast of Cuba and gradually developed convection near the center. On November15, the broad center crossed the Florida Keys near Key West. An approaching trough turned Gordon {{to the north}}east, bringing it ashore near Fort Myers, Florida on November 16 with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Gordon crossed the Florida peninsula in about nine hours, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach. As it reached the Gulf Stream, a small but intense area of convection developed over the center, and after the Hurricane Hunters reported flight-level winds in excess of 90mph (145km/h), Gordon attained hurricane status late on November17 about 245miles (345km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, it reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the trough that <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> hurricane to the north {{was replaced by a}} ridge. Gordon turned abruptly northwestward, and was briefly expected to cross the Outer Banks as a minimal hurricane. The hurricane turned to the south and south-southeast, weakening into a tropical storm due to stronger shear and drier air. On November19, the storm turned to the southwest and later to the west. Gordon weakened into a tropical depression before striking Florida again near Cape Canaveral on November20. It later turned to the north and dissipated over South Carolina on November21.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E
