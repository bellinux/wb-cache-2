5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI <b>demo,</b> or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game <b>demo</b> {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the <b>demo</b> was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the <b>demo</b> was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The <b>demo</b> itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E

5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song <b>demo</b> tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the <b>demo</b> to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the <b>demo</b> to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E

Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was featured at the E3 games festival in 2004, where there was a playable <b>demo.</b> Only the multiplayer Siege mode and a single-player <b>demo</b> were available but they were enough to get 1UP.com's award for best action game at E3.|$|E
