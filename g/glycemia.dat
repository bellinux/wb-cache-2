25|$|While islet {{transplantation}} {{research has}} made important progress {{and the success}} stories are encouraging, the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure remain unclear. Other concerns {{relating to the field}} include questions about the impact of having insulin-producing foreign cells within the hepatic parenchyma, the long-term consequences of elevated portal pressures resulting from the islet infusion, and the fact that islet recipients can be sensitized against donor tissue types, making it more difficult to find a suitable donor should another life-saving transplant be required in the future. Also, very few islet transplant recipients have remained euglycemic without the use of any exogenous insulin beyond four years post-transplant. Thus, while most islet recipients achieve better <b>glycemia</b> control and suffer less serious hypoglycemia, islet transplantation continues to fall short of the definitive diabetes cure.|$|E
2500|$|It was 1996 {{when three}} Russian {{biomedical}} engineers (Bobylev, Gromova, Toloknov) wrote, [...] "To date, the feedback principle of insulin therapy {{is not fully}} implemented {{because the number of}} monitored physiological parameters is insufficient ...

50|$|Blood glucose {{monitoring}} {{is a way}} {{of testing}} the concentration of glucose in the blood (<b>glycemia).</b> Particularly important in diabetes management, a blood glucose test is typically performed by piercing the skin (typically, on the finger) to draw blood, then applying the blood to a chemically active disposable 'test-strip'. Different manufacturers use different technology, but most systems measure an electrical characteristic, and use this to determine the glucose level in the blood.

5000|$|Selective binding between LANCL2 and ABA {{or other}} ligands {{such as the}} {{benzimidazole}} NSC61610 and piperazine BT-11, lead to elevation of intracellular cAMP, activation of PKA and suppression of inflammation in macrophages. In hepatocytes, LANCL2 regulates cell survival by phosphorylation of Akt through its interaction with the Akt kinase mTORC2. Active mTORC2 causes translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and stimulates glucose uptake. LANCL2 expression in immune cells, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and pancreas, and the potential to manipulate LANCL2 signaling and GLUT4 translocation with ABA make this G protein-coupled receptor a novel therapeutic target for glycemic control. In humans, ABA release was detected with increasing <b>glycemia,</b> although this mechanism failed in people suffering from type 2 and gestational diabetes. Also, plasma ABA concentrations increase after oral glucose load (OGTT) in healthy subjects. ABA stimulates glucose-dependent insulin release from human and rodent pancreatic β-cells. At a low dose (micrograms/Kg body weight) oral ABA significantly reduces both <b>glycemia</b> and insulinemia in rats and in humans undergoing an OGTT [...] indicating that ABA reduces the amount of insulin required to control hyperglycemia. This insulin-sparing effect suggests that LANCL2 {{can be used as}} a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and diabetes.|$|E
50|$|In February 1922, doctor Frederick Grant Banting and {{biochemist}} John James Rickard Macleod {{from the}} University of Toronto, Canada, published their {{paper on the}} successful use of a different, alcohol based pancreatic extract for normalizing blood sugar (glucose) levels (<b>glycemia)</b> in a human patient. An unsuccessful attempt had been made on January 11, 1922, and a successful administration followed on January 25, 1922.

50|$|Low-carbohydrate diet and/or {{frequent}} small split meals is {{the first}} treatment of this condition. The first important point is to add small meals at {{the middle of the}} morning and of the afternoon, when <b>glycemia</b> would start to decrease. If adequate composition of the meal is found, the fall in blood glucose is thus prevented. Patients should avoid rapidly absorbable sugars and thus avoid popular soft drinks rich in glucose or sucrose. They should also be cautious with drinks associating sugar and alcohol, mainly in the fasting state.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperglycemia during {{pregnancy}} {{is thought to}} cause epigenetic changes in the leptin gene of newborns leading to a potential increased risk for obesity and heart disease. Leptin is sometimes known as the “satiety hormone” because it is released by fat cells to inhibit hunger. By studying both animal models and human observational studies, {{it has been suggested}} that a leptin surge in the perinatal period plays a critical role in contributing to long-term risk of obesity. The perinatal period begins at 22 weeks gestation and ends a week after birth.34 DNA methylation near the leptin locus has been examined to determine if there was a correlation between maternal <b>glycemia</b> and neonatal leptin levels. Results showed that <b>glycemia</b> was inversely associated with the methylation states of LEP gene, which controls the production of the leptin hormone. Therefore, higher glycemic levels in mothers corresponded to lower methylation states in LEP gene in their children. With this lower methylation state, the LEP gene is transcribed more often, thereby inducing higher blood leptin levels. [...] These higher blood leptin levels during the perinatal period were linked to obesity in adulthood, perhaps due to the fact that a higher “normal” level of leptin was set during gestation. Because obesity is a large contributor to heart disease, this leptin surge is not only correlated with obesity but also heart disease.|$|E
50|$|A {{systematic}} review of few human trials examined {{the potential of}} low GI diet to improve pregnancy outcomes. Potential benefits were still seen despite no ground breaking findings in maternal <b>glycemia</b> or pregnancy outcomes. In this regard, more women under low GI diet achieved the target treatment goal for the postprandial glycemic level and reduced their need for insulin treatment. A low GI diet can also provide greater benefits to overweight and obese women. Interestingly, intervention {{at an early stage}} of pregnancy has shown a tendency to lower birth weight and birth centile in infants born to women with GDM.|$|E
50|$|Apelin {{receptor}} {{is expressed}} in several cell types of the gastro-intestinal tract : stomach enterochromaffine-like cells; unknown cells of endocrine pancreas, colon epithelial cells.In stomach, activation of receptors on enterochromaffine-like cells by apelin secreted by parietal cells can inhibit histamine release by enterochromaffine-like cells, which in turn decreases acid secretion by parietal cells. In pancreas, apelin inhibits the insulin secretion induced by glucose. This inhibition reveals the functional interdependency between apelin signalling and insulin signalling observed at the adipocyte level where insulin stimulate apelin production. Recently, receptor expression was also detected in skeletic muscle cells. Its activation is involved in glucose uptake and participates in the control of glucose blood levels <b>glycemia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An article {{summarizing}} {{the view of}} the American Diabetes Association contains the statement: [...] "Sucrose-containing foods can be substituted for other carbohydrates in the meal plan or, if added to the meal plan, covered with insulin or other glucose-lowering medications. Care should be taken to avoid excess energy intake." [...] Sucrose does not increase <b>glycemia</b> more than the same number of calories taken as starch. It is not recommended to use fructose as a sweetener. Benefits may be obtained by consumption of dietary fibre in conjunction with carbohydrate; as Francis (1987) points out, evidence suggests that carbohydrate consumed with dietary fiber will have a lower impact on glycemic rise than the same amount of carbohydrate consumed alone.|$|E
5000|$|Linagliptin {{belongs to}} a class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the hormone {{incretin}} from being degraded, allowing insulin {{to be released from}} the pancreatic beta cells. While incretin remains in the blood stream, the pancreas is stimulated to produce more insulin. Meanwhile, glucagon release from the pancreas is staggered, preventing glucose level increase. In other words, linagliptin, along with diet and exercise, can help the body produce more insulin and lower blood glucose. Managing blood sugar can mean a lower HbA1c, an index for <b>glycemia</b> control that theoretically correlates with glucose level in the blood. However, the use of HbA1c to predict diabetes in patients can sometimes be limited due to other external factors, such as blood transfusion, acute blood loss, or drug interference.|$|E

5000|$|Balk {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a literature search in two databases, for English language clinical trials spanning from the years, 1994 to 2006. About {{three-quarters of the}} 36 studies showed no statistical significance in the measured outcomes. The authors contended {{that the lack of}} statistical significance was not necessarily evidence of the lack of effect. Almost one-half of the studies were considered to be low quality, because there were large variations in the chromium (Cr) formulations, dosages (~5 to ~900µg, majority in the ~hundreds of µg) and test conditions. It was concluded that chromium treatment in type 2 diabetes patients may have an effect on <b>glycemia</b> and dyslipidemia (reducing glycated hemoglobin levels by 0.6% and fasting glucose by 1.0mM), but cautioned against this finding due to the aforementioned problems.|$|E
50|$|DPP-4 is a serine {{protease}} {{located on the}} cell surfaces throughout the body. In plasma, DPP-4 enzyme rapidly inactivates incretins including GLP-1 and GIP which are produced in the intestine depending on the blood glucose level {{and contribute to the}} physiological regulation of glucose homeostatis. Active GLP-1 and GIP increase the production and release of insulin by pancreatinc beta cells. GLP-1 also reduces the secretion of glucacon by pancreatic alpha cells, thereby resulting in a decreased hepatic glucose production. However these incretins are rapidly cleaved by DPP-4 and their effects last only for a few minutes. DPP-4 inhibitors block the cleavage of the gliptins and thus lead to an increasee insulin level and a reduced glucagon level in a glucose-dependent way. This results in a decrease of fasting and postprandial <b>glycemia,</b> as well as HbA1c levels.|$|E
50|$|If severe, parents {{usually take}} {{the child to}} a local {{emergency}} department, where blood is drawn. The glucose is usually found to be between 35 and 60 mg/dl (1.8-3.1 mMol/L).

Ketones can also be measured in the blood at the bedside (Medisense glucometer). Other routine tests are normal. If given intravenous fluids with saline and dextrose, the child improves dramatically and is usually restored to normal health within a few hours. These symptoms are normally seen because of the child being unadapted to using fat as energy, typically when the child's daily glucose intake might be too high (more than 50g/day for a child). This is also associated with fluctuant <b>glycemia</b> throughout the day.|$|E
