25|$|Component {{connections}} {{are critical to}} the structural integrity of a <b>framing</b> <b>system.</b> In buildings with large, clearspan wood trusses, the most critical {{connections are}} those between the truss and its supports. In addition to gravity-induced forces (a.k.a. bearing loads), these connections must resist shear forces acting perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} truss and uplift forces due to wind. Depending upon overall building design, the connections may also be required to transfer bending moment.|$|E
25|$|IGU {{thickness}} is {{a compromise}} between maximizing insulating value {{and the ability of}} the <b>framing</b> <b>system</b> used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further reduce heat loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes.|$|E

40|$|Steel moment {{resisting}} frames with post-tensioned (PT) connections use post-tensioned {{high strength}} strands running {{parallel to the}} beam to compress the beam flanges against the column flange. The post-tensioning produces a resisting moment to service loading and provides a restoring force that returns the frame to its pre-earthquake position. The behavior and design of a PT connection and PT <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> is described, where a PT <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> is a PT frame interacting with the floor system. It is shown that (1) frames with PT connections “expand”, and this expansion requires that the floor system be designed to accommodate the expansion, and (2) {{the interaction of the}} floor system with the PT frame produces axial forces in the beams that add to those caused by post-tensioning. This paper proposes a performance based design approach for steel PT <b>frame</b> <b>systems.</b> Seismic performance levels, seismic input levels, structural limit states, and the structural demands for a PT <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> are defined. The design objectives are outlined, design criteria are proposed, and a step-by-step design procedure is given for PT <b>frame</b> <b>systems.</b> The proposed design approach is evaluated via comparisons with time-history analysis results for PT <b>frame</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|There is little, if any, {{mention of}} the mill, barn or {{farmhouse}} in early histories or maps of the Garrison area.

The <b>framing</b> <b>system</b> of the farmhouse is more commonly found in the lower valley, in areas closer to New York City that were settled earlier, and more study is needed, especially given the high integrity of the structure.|$|E
25|$|The Westinghouse {{turbine engines}} {{developed}} 9,000 driveshaft horsepower at ninety revolutions per minute, which allowed a maximum sixteen knots, a speed never attained before by any modern tanker of her era. Her method of construction was controversial. For some years, {{the issue of}} welding versus riveting had been raging {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. Hull 190 was built using the new-fashioned welded method, with hopes it would prove once and for all its reliability. The ship also had a composite <b>framing</b> <b>system</b> with two longitudinally continuous bulkheads, which divided the ship into twenty-one cargo tanks.|$|E
25|$|From 1912 Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila ("Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company") — {{founded in}} 1909 by Weetman Pearson {{to develop the}} newly found Mexican oil fields, nationalized in 1938 as Pemex — also had its own tanker fleet. They quickly adopted Isherwood's new {{longitudinal}} <b>framing</b> <b>system</b> that allowed much larger ships and a simpler construction process. Just before World War I it owned a fleet of 20 tankers. Standard Oil did not participate directly in the newly discovered oil fields in Texas — such as Spindletop — and Oklahoma, which gave opportunities for new oil companies as Gulf Oil and Texas Fuel Company, later Texaco. Avoiding the use of Standard Oil's pipe line system, they started using tankers to get their oil to the East Coast. In combination with the oil fields discovered in Mexico and Venezuela, this caused {{a rise in the}} demand for tankers, which gave opportunities for the first independents, such as the Norwegian Wilh. Wilhelmsen, that launched its first tanker in 1913.|$|E

40|$|Today, tall {{buildings}} are generally built {{with a central}} core that transfers the loads down to the ground. The central core takes up {{a large part of}} the floor space and there is less room for the actual purpose of the building, such as offices and apartments. The consequence of this is also less rental profit. At a certain height of the building, the central core will not alone manage to keep the building stable. Therefore it needs to be connected with outriggers to withstand the horizontal forces. The Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> developed by Tyréns is designed without the central core and the purpose is to transfer all the loads to the ground via the perimeter of building, making the structure more stable since the lever arm between the loads is maximized. The system has not yet been used in reality. This thesis aimed at testing the efficiency of the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> against conventional systems for {{tall buildings}}. Two different types of the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> were evaluated; TMF Perimeter frame and TMF Mega columns. To begin with, a pre-study was carried out with the purpose of comparing wind deflections and eigenmodes of several conventional systems and Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>systems.</b> The buildings were modeled in the finite element software ETABS. The Core, outrigger and perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> performed best compared to the other conventional systems and was therefore chosen as the conventional system to be tested in the main study. A comparison of the Core, outrigger and perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> and eight different configurations of Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>systems</b> was carried out for several different building heights as a main study, based on the tall building 432 Park Avenue, New York. The deformations due to wind and seismic loading and eigenmodes were compared. Furthermore, the models were controlled for tension at the base and Pdelta convergence. Overall the TMF Perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>systems</b> had the smallest deflections as the building height was increased and could be increased the most without reaching tension at the base. As the top story height of the buildings was increased, the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>systems</b> outperformed the conventional system. For the TMF Perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> it could be seen that belt walls were more efficient than cross walls, and for the TMF Mega columns the smaller the distance between the belt or cross wall levels was, the less deflection was achieved. The Core, outrigger and perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> could be increased to 859 m in height before collapse and the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> that performed best – TMF: Perimeter frame single story belt walls – was increased to 1024 m in height until divergence was achieved...|$|R
