60|$|The tone of President Steyn at {{the meeting}} of the Raad, and the support which he {{received}} from the majority of his burghers, showed unmistakably that the two republics would act as one. In his opening speech Steyn declared uncompromisingly against the British contention, and declared that his State was bound to the Transvaal by everything which was near and dear. Among the obvious military precautions which could no longer be neglected by the British Government, was the sending of some small force to protect the long and exposed line of railway which lies just outside the Transvaal border from Kimberley to Rhodesia. Sir Alfred Milner communicated with President Steyn as to this movement of troops, pointing out that it was in no way directed against the Free State. Sir Alfred Milner added that the Imperial Government was still hopeful of a <b>friendly</b> <b>settlement</b> with the Transvaal, but if this hope were disappointed they looked to the Orange Free State to preserve strict neutrality and to prevent military intervention by any of its citizens. They undertook that in that case the integrity of the Free State frontier would be strictly preserved. Finally, he stated that there was absolutely no cause to disturb the good relations between the Free State and Great Britain, since we were animated by the most friendly intentions towards them. To this the President returned a somewhat ungracious answer, to the effect that he disapproved of our action towards the Transvaal, and that he regretted the movement of troops, which would be considered a menace by the burghers. A subsequent resolution of the Free State Raad, ending with the words, 'Come what may, the Free State will honestly and faithfully fulfil its obligations towards the Transvaal by virtue of the political alliance existing between the two republics,' showed how impossible it was that this country, formed by ourselves, and without a shadow of a cause of quarrel with us, could be saved from being drawn into the whirlpool.|$|E

The methodology of the study starts from the analysis of the relevant case-law of the European Court for Human Rights concerning Romania. The research tries to find the factors that lead to the configuration of the amount of damages, the main one being, naturally, the length of the procedure. On the basis of the case-law, the study exposes proposals concerning the determination of the relevant duration that should be considered. The study shows difficulties in the process of research and outlines the importance of damages indicated in <b>friendly</b> <b>settlements</b> as well as in unilateral declarations, {{due to the fact that}} they are always accompanied by the recognition of the violation.

60|$|The fact is {{that old}} Tom Gaylord, in the autumn previous, had quarreled with Mr. Flint about lumber rates, which had been {{steadily}} rising. Mr. Flint had been polite, but firm; and old Tom, who, with all his tremendous properties, could ship by no other railroad than the Northeastern, had left the New York office in a black rage. A more innocent citizen than old Tom would have put his case (which was without doubt a strong one) before the Railroad Commission of the State, but old Tom knew well enough that the Railroad Commission was in reality an economy board of the Northeastern system, as much under Mr. Flint's orders as the conductors and brakemen. Old Tom, in consulting the map, conceived an unheard-of effrontery, a high treason which took away the breath of his secretary and treasurer when {{it was pointed out}} to him. The plan contemplated a line of railroad from the heart of the lumber regions down {{the south side of the}} valley of the Pingsquit to Kingston, where the lumber could take to the sea. In short, it was a pernicious revival of an obsolete state of affairs, competition, and if persisted in, involved nothing less than a fight to a finish with the army, the lobby of the Northeastern. Other favoured beings stood aghast when they heard of it, and hastened to old Tom with timely counsel; but he had reached a frame of mind which they knew well. He would listen to no reason, and maintained stoutly that there were other lawyers in the world as able in political sagacity and lobby tactics as Hilary Vane; the Honourable Galusha Hammer, for instance, an old and independent and wary war-horse who had more than once wrung compromises out of the Honourable Hilary. The Honourable Galusha Hammer was sent for, and was now industriously, if quietly and unobtrusively, at work. The Honourable Hilary was likewise at work, equally quietly and unobtrusively. When the powers fall out, they do not open up at once with long-distance artillery. There is always a chance of a <b>friendly</b> <b>settlement.</b> The news was worth a good deal, for instance, to Mr. Peter Pardriff (brother of Paul, of Ripton), who refrained, with praiseworthy self-control, from publishing it in the State Tribune, although the temptation to do so must have been great. And most of the senatorial twenty saw the trouble coming and braced their backs against it, but in silence. The capital had seen no such war as this since the days of Jethro Bass.|$|E

Artillery, war munitions, and stores were being accumulated at Volksrust upon the Natal border, showing where the storm might be expected to break. On the last day of September, twenty-six military trains were reported to have left Pretoria and Johannesburg for that point. At the same time news came of a concentration at Malmani, upon the Bechuanaland border, threatening the railway line and the British town of Mafeking, a name destined before long to be familiar to the world.|$|E

40|$|I {{would define}} {{sustainable}} development as the efficient {{allocation of resources}} for the improvement and preservation of life. Life in its varied manifestations has an intrinsic spatial attribute and {{an infinite number of}} others. GIS is a system in which Geographic/Spatial data can be captured in a digital format onto which other attributes can be attached. The system incorporates features which allow for processing, manipulation and collation of data: selective presentation, storage and efficient dissemination of data. GIS can therefore mimic some aspects of life. This paper is an attempt at exploring the possibilities and usefulness of the capabilities of the GIS system in solving the myriad of developmental challenges facing a developing country like Ghana. Ghana has a per capital income of 400 US Dollars, a population of about 18, 400, 000 people and an economy dominated by agricultural production. Presently, the NDPC (National Development Planning Commission) the apex national body responsible for planning would issue a working document dubbed GPRS (Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy), which would be the guiding principle for all other agencies and institutions responsible for planning in the country. Studies and research leading up to the production of this major document has exposed the need for accurate and extensive spatial information for effective and workable management and planning decisions. Major problems of rural and urban development include lack of access to electricity; insufficient supply of potable water; poor planning and land tenure system remaining major constrains on the promotion of efficient and environmentally <b>friendly</b> <b>settlements,</b> flooding, erosion and siltation of drains. These developmental problems obviously cannot be solved without the input of the appropriate and accurate spatial information. GIS, which integrates spatial and attribute data is certainly one of the effective systems to employ in analysing and solving these problems.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{offering}} {{a deeper understanding}} of the phenomenon of settler violence in the West Bank. The purpose is to understand why part of the settler population was radicalized around 2006, and why violence has increased every year since. Three theories explaining civil violence and radicalism are combined in order to produce a thorough analysis of the causes of radicalization and continued increase and diffusion of violence. The study argues that the increase is due to a change in tactics on behalf of some settlers, and concludes that a tightening of the official attitude towards the settlement enterprise in 2005, which included targeting the unauthorized outposts, concluded a long process of delegitimation of the State in the eyes of the settlers. The change of government to a far more <b>settlement</b> <b>friendly</b> one in 2009 was not sufficient to appease the radical settlers, as anti-statism has grown to become a main element of their radicalized religious ideology. The existence of a large settlement supportive network in the political and bureaucratic systems has prevented the government from holding a clear stance towards the illegal actions of these radicals, and has led to very inconsistent state policies, and this has facilitated the observed increase in settler violence...|$|R

Not so much as a single Indian body was ever found, not even a sign of blood. The Indians had made no attempt to storm the stockade. No one in the blockhouse was much interested in venturing out on attack. Both sides had paused for dinner. There were two known fatalities: a young volunteer and a 14-year-old boy, both of whom had neglected to stay behind cover. No one who kept inside the stockade was wounded. A few things do seem clear in this fog of war: nearly all of the local volunteers hardly left the blockhouse, the Navy took no combat casualties in this land battle, and Kamiakim's forces were successfully driven off, but also took few (if any) fatalities. Still, they seem to have drawn the conclusion that attacking a major settlement wasn't worth the trouble. The only remaining major battle of the war was to occur March 10 at Connell's Prairie near Puyallup.|$|R

TRIPS agreement and border enforcement of IPRS [...] Chapter 4. Role of Customs as a border security agency [...] Chapter 5. Socio-economic impacts of IPR enfringement [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion and recommendations. In the present era of rapid globalisation, countries are intrinsically integrated {{with each other}} by way of international trade to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. Trade facilitation is now recognised as a key driving factor in determining export competitiveness of a country. Customs administrations, the frontier border agency responsible for regulating import and export of legitimate goods, are increasingly {{faced with the challenge}} of intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement. In addition to national governments, various international organisations have devised guidelines and tools to facilitate and empower Customs agencies in their fight against IPR infringement. In particular, the multilateral Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) articulates a prescription for border enforcement of IPRs in Articles 51 - 60. In this backdrop, this thesis attempts to answer a very fundamental question: What are the implications of ‘Border Measures’, specified under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, for facilitating international trade? To this end, it critically examines the concepts of trade facilitation, TRIPS and IPR protection to highlight the links that connect them and the missing links that need to be established. Obligations to protect IPR under national and international laws are also scrutinised. Research shows that efforts by WTO, World Customs Organization (WCO) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) have been instrumental in this context. While policy planning at the national level should be the first priority, commitment by the advanced economies to support their less developed counterparts through technology transfer (TT) is of paramount importance. The thesis suggests that TRIPS-plus provisions, if implemented arbitrarily by developed countries, have the potential to undermine the interests of countries with resource constraints. In this context, the thesis analyses the effects and implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreements, and the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC) for the border protection of IPRs. The thesis investigates the socio-economic impacts of IPR infringement and articulates strategies to be adopted and applied at individual, collective, business and government levels to stop trade and use of IPR infringed goods. Drawing on the analysis of the relevant WTO Articles, scrutiny of various border measures put in place by national governments and international bodies, and current state of play under the Doha Development Round (DDR), the thesis puts forward a set of short and long term policy recommendations for all relevant stakeholders. These inclusively include: (i) strengthening risk management procedures; (ii) cooperation and coordination at national and international levels; (iii) awareness raising initiatives; (iv) establishing advanced technologically driven border enforcement system; (v) empowering Customs with effective administrative authority; (vi) IP related technical capacity building within the Customs and business community; (vii) technology transfer to LDCs from developed countries; and (viii) LDC <b>friendly</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> process under the WTO.

The villages saw that it was in their interest to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|R

50|$|In 1998, Daniel Ortega's adopted {{stepdaughter}} Zoilamérica Narváez {{released a}} 48-page report describing how, she alleged, Ortega had systematically sexually abused her from 1979, {{when she was}} 11, until 1990. Ortega and his wife Murillo denied the allegations. The case could not proceed in Nicaraguan courts because Ortega had immunity to prosecution {{as a member of}} parliament, and the five-year statute of limitations for sexual abuse and rape charges was judged to have been exceeded. Narváez took a complaint to the Inter American Human Rights Commission, which was ruled admissible on 15 October 2001. On 4 March 2002 the Nicaraguan government accepted the Commission's recommendation of a <b>friendly</b> <b>settlement.</b> As of 2006 Ortega continues to deny the allegations, but Narváez has not withdrawn them.|$|E
50|$|Being an {{opponent}} of the British colonial policy, he became {{a leader of the}} Sons of Liberty, and was first elected to Massachusetts’s provincial (revolutionary) Congress in 1774. In 1775 the Continental Congress dispatched him to England in an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the differences leading to the Revolutionary War. He returned the following year, convinced that a <b>friendly</b> <b>settlement</b> of the dispute was impossible, and was elected a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777, where he signed the Articles of Confederation in 1778. As a member of the latter body, he became chairman in January 1778 of the committee appointed to visit Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge and confer with him concerning the reorganization of the army. This committee spent about three months in camp, and assisted Washington in preparing the plan of reorganization which Congress in the main adopted. In this year, he was also a member of a committee to consider Lord North's offer of conciliation, which he vigorously opposed.|$|E
50|$|Besides Amnesty International NGOs {{such as the}} International Commission of Jurists and the International Federation of Human Rights and {{international}} bodies like the Council of Europe sent delegations to Turkey to investigate the torture claims. On 1 July 1982 five States (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France and the Netherlands) filed an application against Turkey with the European Commission of Human Rights. They complained in particular about torture, unfair trials and restriction of freedom of expression. In December 1985 a <b>friendly</b> <b>settlement</b> was reached that asked Turkey to shorten the detention period, lift martial law and present periodic reports. Turkey had shortened the maximum length of detention in May and June 1985 from 45 days to 30 days in areas under emergency legislation and to 15 days in areas not under extraordinary rule. Later the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) became the main body to monitor the situation, but other bodies such as the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture (see the section on reports) also visited Turkey in order to evaluate the risk of torture in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|On 22 January 2015 the European Court of Human Rights {{announced}} {{the termination of}} consideration of the case of Yulia Tymoshenko v. Ukraine in connection to an implied <b>friendly</b> <b>settlement</b> between the parties, after Tymoshenko's agreement with the government's declaration admitting that the criminal prosecution against her had been politically motivated. The Ukrainian government, in its exchange with the Court, had acknowledged a violation of Tymoshenko's rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights under articles 3 (prohibition of torture), 6 (right to a fair trial), 7 (no punishment without law), 8 (right to respect for private and family life), partly in conjunction with article 13 (right to an effective remedy), article 18 (political motivation), article 10 (freedom of expression) and article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention (right not to be tried or punished twice). Taking note of the Ukrainian government's declaration and following measures, {{as well as of}} Tymoshenko's agreement with it, the Court struck out the application from its list of cases, as asked by the government, following article 39 of the Convention (friendly settlements).|$|E
