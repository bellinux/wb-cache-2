Both the control and LP activated samples were kept at ambient temperature for 6 h. After 6 h the control and LP activated samples were again divided into two and one of the respective samples was pasteurised at 72 °C for 15 s. All the four samples were analysed for LM ATTC 7644 immediately after LP activation at 0 h, after 6 h of LP activation and after pasteurisation. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese was made with all four samples, i. e. control raw, control pasteurised, LP activated raw and LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> and analysed for LM ATTC 7644 on days 1, 2, 5, and 10. Six hours after LP activation the mean LM ATTC 7644 count for the LP activated milk decreased by log 0. 5 cfu/ml where as the LM ATTC 7644 for the control increased by log 0. 5 cfu/ml. The reduction of LM ATTC 7644 count in LP activated milk when compared to the control shows that <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> lactoperoxidase is capable of reducing L. monocytogenes when stored at ambient temperatures. Furthermore, LM ATTC 7644 count in LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> decreased by log 1. 1 cfu/ml more, compared to the control pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> Therefore, pasteurisation together with LP activation may be more effective than pasteurisation alone in controlling the growth of L. monocytogenes in <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> For the control raw <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese on day 10, the LM ATTC 7644 count was 90 % less than on first day of storage. The LP activated raw <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese count followed a similar trend to the control raw <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese, and reached levels of log 2. 9 cfu/g {{on the last day of}} storage. The control pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese LM ATTC 7644 count on day 10 was 92 % lower compared to day 1 where as the LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese LM ATTC 7644 count was 98 % less than on day 1. The results of this study indicate that the activation of the LPS significantly (p≤ 0. 05) decreased the LM ATTC 7644 count in <b>goat</b> <b>milk,</b> during a period of 6 h. Combined pasteurisation and LP activation had a synergistic effect on the LM ATTC 7644 count in <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> The LM ATTC 7644 count declined in cottage cheese made from both control and LP activated <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> A greater decrease was observed in LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese over the storage period of 10 days at 4 °C.

The Danish forces, accompanied by some British signals specialists, left Camp Bastion on July 21. As they approached Musa Qala from the West, the Pathfinders observed groups of Taliban regrouping to ambush them, and directed a Harrier GR7 against the insurgents, killing several. The Taliban had blocked the road with barrels, and attacked the Danish column from three sides with machine guns and RPGs. The column halted when one Eagle was destroyed by a mine and its three crewmen were wounded, and, after having directed an airstrike from a B-1 bomber against Taliban positions, it withdrew into the desert, much to the dismay of the Pathfinders. The garrison had now run out of food and water, and were reduced to drinking <b>goats</b> <b>milk,</b> while their ammunition was also running low, and they had no more batteries for their night vision devices. The Taliban chose July 24 to launch their largest attack against the district centre, {{in the form of a}} concerted assault by 300 militants against every side of the base. The attack opened with an RPG strike that destroyed one of the sangars, causing a Danish soldier to fall outside the compound. Private Mark Wilson of the Pathfinders used an old bedstead to climb the compound wall and help the injured Dane to safety under enemy fire, for which he was later awarded the Military Cross. Air support took 90 minutes to arrive, during which the base was subjected to continuous fire, which would have been even heavier, if the Danish column hadn't intercepted Taliban reinforcements coming from Now Zad. On July 26, after coalition aircraft dropped six 1000-pound bombs on known Taliban positions, the relief force finally broke into Musa Qala.

5000|$|Tagasaste or Tree Lucerne is used {{extensively}} by small scale Dairy farmers in East Africa, {{for its ability}} to enable commercial milk production levels on a small plot of land planted with a living fence of self replacing Tree Lucerne. It is seen as a low cost self grown alternative to Diary meal and Alfalfa pellets. Treelucerne is used as a boundary fence and hedgerow, acting as a windbreak aimed at stopping fire, wind and yielding privacy, fodder as well as firewood. Branches are typically lopped off by hand, and fed to grazing animals that may typically include 1-3 <b>goats</b> (<b>milk</b> and meat), half a dozen chickens (eggs), 1-2 calves (feedlot fattening) and 1-2 Dairy cows, all on one hectare of land. The Tree Lucerne may be used to fence the property and the house, with the cash crop grown between alleys of Tree Lucerne. Tree Lucerne is thus {{used extensively}} for purposes of biological fertilisation and soil improvement utilizing the alley crop method whereby vegetables, as well as cash crops such as tobacco and maize are planted in the interrow from year 3 onwards. As {{one of the fastest growing}} trees in East Africa the need for firewood for own consumption is a major driver for uptake, with the fodder and fence ability of secondary value. This is now changing due to the discovery that Tree Lucerne can fix up to 587 kg of Nitrogen per hectare per year, roughly half below ground by nitrogen fixation and roughly half when the plant is kept in a permanent juvenile state by lopping off alley crop branches at waist level and using it either as livestock feed (with manure then added as fertilizer and a nitrogen pathway) or with the branches put on top of the soil and covered with soil as a [...] "green manure". Over time substantial increases in crop yields have been achieved this way, in the order of raising 1 ton of Maize production to 8-10 tons, and 700 kg of Burley Tobacco to 3-3.5 tons, per hectare, per year. The level of Biological fertilisation achieved by Tree Lucerne is at the top end of that found in the legume family, and typically consist of about 30-50 grams of Nitrogen per meter of row. The use of Tree Lucerne for Terra Preta purposes was pioneered in Central East Africa on Oxisoil.|$|E

Gelation was induced by acidification with 40  g. L− 1 d-glucono-δ-lactone. Monitoring gel formation by oscillatory rheometry revealed that the incubation of milk with mTGase accelerated gelation, which occurred at a higher pH for cows milk in comparison to <b>goats</b> <b>milk.</b> Electrophoretic analysis revealed that under the same conditions, nearly 31 % of the cows milk proteins were cross-linked by the action of mTGase compared to only 9. 6 % of the <b>goats</b> <b>milk</b> proteins. This resulted in increased gel stiffness and reduced syneresis of the acid gels of both systems, but the extent of the effect depended on the milk source. In general, even with the mTGase treatment, <b>goats</b> <b>milk</b> gels were much weaker than cows milk gels. Despite this fact, the information gained in this study indicates that mTGase might be successfully applied in the production of acidified goat milk products...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} whether CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> {{was able to}} inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin (IL) - 17 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α], RAGE, and caspase- 3 expression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats. A total of 24 Wistar female rats, were randomly assigned into four groups: control group (C), CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> group (CM), CFA-induced RA-rats group (RA), and the RA group treated by CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> (RAM). The severity of erythema and swelling in lower extremities were counted by scoring. IL- 17, TNF-α, RAGE, and caspase- 3 expression in synovial membranes were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and western blotting. Erythema and swelling in the RA group was significantly attenuated by <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> CSN 1 S 2 (p    0. 05). Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of IL- 17, RAGE, TNF-α, and caspase- 3 {{were higher in the}} RA group compared with the control group. CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> decreased RAGE and TNF-α expression, but increased the IL- 17 and caspase- 3 expression. In conclusion, CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> decreased erythema, swelling, and inflammation in lower extremities. The CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> also decreased TNF-α and RAGE expression in the synovial membrane of ankle joints. Unfortunately, CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> may induce the production of IL- 17. Therefore CSN 1 S 2 protein of <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> may provide a nutritional therapy for attenuating the inflammation found in rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Production of <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> has {{increased}} worldwide {{due to its}} numerous health benefits. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> is {{a rich source of}} proteins, vitamins, minerals as well as many short and medium chain fatty acids. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> has better digestibility, lower allergenicity and suitable for those who suffer from lactose intolerance. Considering those health benefits, current study was carried out to produce a <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> yogurt and identify the plausibility use of beetroot juice to mask the goaty flavor. Yogurt samples were stored at 4 o C and physicochemical evaluation was conducted for 21 days at the interval of seven days. Addition of beetroot juice into <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> increased moisture content and lowered total solid content while fat, protein and ash contents were non-significant during the storage. The titratable acidity of plain <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> yogurt and beetroot yogurt decreased from 0. 91 % to 0. 80 % and 0. 85 % to 0. 84 % respectively where as pH increased from 4. 45 to 4. 54 for plain <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> yogurt and 4. 34 to 4. 64 for beetroot yogurt after 21 days of storage. Highest microbial count was observed after 14 days of storage; 18. 70 x 10 6 for plain yogurtand 17. 56 x 1...|$|R
