40|$|This module {{presents}} the LCI and LCA {{for the single}} family home designs located in Atlanta and Minneapolis that simulate construction activity in a cold (Minneapolis) and warm (Atlanta) climate. The LCA compares typical shells constructed of either wood framing or an alternative material: concrete in Atlanta and steel in Minneapolis. The analysis summarizes the environmental effects from resource extraction through to {{the completion of the}} shell on-site. The in-place structural <b>frame,</b> <b>envelope</b> components and interior wall partitions are compared for alternative materials maintaining similar structural capability and code R-values. The Athena ™ Environmental Impact Estimator (EIE) was used to evaluate the impact of product and construction process LCI data. In addition to raw material resource measures, it develops five indices to summarize the large number of output measures. These summary measures include primary (embodied) energy, greenhouse gas potential (both fuel and process related), measures of air and water pollution, and solid waste emissions. Results are provided in terms of building totals by assembly. Additional analyses were concluded on several subassemblies, and the results are also reported here. There are many common materials between the two designs. The primary structural difference between the Minneapolis wood and steel house designs is the use of materials for floors and walls. Both designs share the same basement, roof and window elements. The wooden structure is constructed using 2 x 6 wood studs versus 2 x 4 stee...|$|E

Similarly, the analogue of the former for σ-biframes is proved to provide an equivalence between compact regular σ-biframes and compact regular biframes. As an application we obtain the equivalence between stably continuous σ-frames and compact regular σ-biframes due to Matutu as an easy consequence of its frame counterpart established earlier by Banaschewski and Brümmer.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control scheme using a pulsating high-frequency (HF) signal {{to minimize the}} position detection error and the velocity estimation ripple due to the zero current clamping (ZCC) effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous <b>frame,</b> the <b>envelope</b> of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows avoiding multiple zero-crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At no-load, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the loaded condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control enforces a much better estimation performance during ZCC region without a pre-defined offline commissioning test than the standard pulsating injection scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experimental results.

40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control using a pulsating HF signal to minimize ZCC effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in a synchronous <b>frame,</b> the <b>envelope</b> {{of the resulting}} HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an oscillating pattern with a maximum to zero magnitude. Taking this effect into account, multiple zero-crossings of HF currents around the zero-crossing region can be avoided by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. For this purpose, we develop {{an injection}} axis switching scheme according to the load condition. At no-load, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the load condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control permits the HF current magnitude to be zero at every zero-crossing point. The minimization result leads to an accurate position estimate during ZCC region and the proposed scheme does not require any additional test prior to start-up. Experiments demonstrate {{the superiority of the}} proposed method in suppressing the voltage distortions caused by ZCC effect. I...|$|R

This comprises a set of acoustic models and has similarity to the acoustic modelling used in speech recognition.

40|$|The current {{environmental}} and energetic {{crisis and the}} resulting regulations led to a new interest in using sustainable materials for building applications. Wood can be a material with high sustainable rates because it is recyclable, reusable and naturally renewable. Moreover, its excellent strength-to-weight ratios, thermal insulating and acoustical properties make it useful for different kinds of applications in buildings, ranging from structural beams and <b>frames,</b> insulating <b>envelopes,</b> windows, door <b>frames,</b> to wall and flooring materials and furniture. Although wood is commonly classified as a sustainable material, its real sustainability depends on different issues: appropriate forest management, manufacturing methods and site assembly, distance required for transportation and use of glues. Wood has also good seismic performances due to its lightweight and even if timber elements {{are not able to}} have a ductile behavior, using steel connection allows to build dissipative structure, as well platform frame and X-LAM panels systems. Insulation properties are related to low thermal conductivity values. Furthermore, wooden elements can be used to minimize sound transmission and they can be employed as sustainable materials as several Life Cycle Assessment studies demonstrate. This review paper aims to analyze the structural, thermal, acoustical and environmental properties of wooden materials for building applications; other properties such as fire resistance and durability were also taken into account. The work is completed by several tables and graphs with wood properties and by an updated and thorough reference list...|$|R
40|$|The American/Asian {{genotype}} of Dengue virus type 2 (DENV- 2) {{was introduced}} into the Americas in the 80 ′s. Although there is no data showing when this genotype was first introduced into Brazil, it was first detected in Brazil in 1990. After which the virus spread {{throughout the country and}} major epidemics occurred in 1998, 2007 / 08 and 2010. In this study we sequenced 12 DENV- 2 genomes obtained from serum samples of patients with dengue fever residing in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo (SJRP/SP), Brazil, in 2008. The whole open reading <b>frame</b> or <b>envelope</b> sequences were used to perform phylogenetic, phylogeographic and evolutionary analyses. Isolates from SJRP/SP were grouped within one lineage (BR 3) close to isolates from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Isolates from SJRP were probably introduced there at least in 2007, prior to its detection in the 2008 outbreak. DENV- 2 circulation in Brazil is characterized by the introduction, displacement and circulation of three well-defined lineages in different times, most probably from the Caribbean. Thirty-seven unique amino acid substitutions were observed among the lineages, including seven amino acid differences in domains I to III of the envelope protein. Moreover, we dated here, for the first time, the introduction of American/Asian genotype into Brazil (lineage BR 1) to 1988 / 89, followed by the introduction of lineages BR 2 (1998 - 2000) and BR 3 (2003 - 05). Our results show a delay between the introduction and detection of DENV- 2 lineages in Brazil, reinforcing the importance and need for surveillance programs to detect and trace the evolution of these viruses. Additionally, Brazilian DENV- 2 differed in genetic diversity, date of introduction and geographic origin and distribution in Brazil, and these are important factors for the evolution, dynamics and control of dengue. © 2013 Drumond et al...|$|R
40|$|Objective: While {{there has}} been a recent {{interest}} in novel architectural systems utilizing advanced materials comprising fibers and their combinations, these “textile-based ” systems have been developed almost exclusively for the highest-budget, highest-profile architectural design projects. But can a textile-based system be developed for more modest, widespread, and also urgent architectural applications? We have developed a set of non-woven fabric panels for construction of residential and emergency housing. In conventional residential construction, houses that are assembled on-site consist of a structural <b>frame,</b> a building <b>envelope,</b> and a weather shield, with each subsystem comprising different materials. Our objective is to develop a construction system that can serve as structure, envelope and shield at once. For integration of these functions, we take our inspiration from natural systems: our panel system has robust structural integrity, while being light-weight, with intrinsic acoustic and thermal insulation properties. Incorporation of specialized materials, such as piezoelectric and liquid-wicking fibers, will impart environmental responsiveness to the product.

Four ballonets, two in each of the two lower lobes, were used to maintain the envelope's shape and pressure. These were kept inflated by a metal air scoop mounted in the slipstream of the forward propeller on earlier examples, and at the rear propeller on later versions. The nose of the envelope was made of aluminium sheet reinforced with bamboo canes to prevent it deforming due to the airflow pressure as the airship moved. Three tailfins were used. The two upper ones were mounted in a shallow V-tail configuration and carried the elevators, while the single vertical fin below the envelope incorporated a rudder. Ten main suspensions were incorporated in the Coastal envelope, of which seven supported the weight of the gondola, and the remaining three took the guys that allowed the 196 ft (60 m)-long airships to be handled on the ground. No landing gear was fitted, apart from two wooden skids {{at either end of the}} gondola which also protected the propellers.|$|R
40|$|The {{envelope}} rating system’s {{aim is to}} spot {{elements that}} can objectively identify the level of "quality" of a building envelope. The purpose of this system is to support the design of building envelopes and it wants to clarify if indeed a redevelopment {{may or may not}} be functional in terms of technology in order to reduce energy consumption of buildings. The system can be applied to: -	existing buildings to assess the performance characteristics of the building envelope; -	buildings not yet constrict in order to simulate various scenarios and realize the most suitable type of building envelope. Starting from the study of the national and international rating systems existing, five areas of analysis have been identified in the envelope rating system and each of them has been divided into groups and subgroups. These are: 1. 	building <b>envelope</b> (<b>frames,</b> systems for enhanced daylight control, etc.); 2. 	technological performance (energy class, transmittance, etc.); 3. 	intelligence systems (solar technologies, etc.); 4. 	security systems; 5. 	maintenance. Each area of analysis has received a weighted score according to its level of importance. The representation of the rating system’s results occurs through the use of certain histogram charts in which the maximum achievable scores and those actually achieved for each group and subgroup analyzed before and after redevelopment, are highlighted in absolute value. In conclusion the rating system enables to obtain a total score, expressed in hundredths, that classifies the level of “quality” of the building envelope. Depending on the score obtained, it is possible to associate the building under analysis to a specific code that will define the value of rating. This score is described by a radar chart that represents the marks obtained for each area of analysis given in percentages, made 100 the highest score achievable for each area of assessment...|$|R
40|$|In the Ph. D. thesis, {{the seismic}} effect of {{cladding}} panels and steel shear panels on the reinforced concrete and steel frames is discussed. We limited {{the research of}} sandwich panels to single-storey steel frame buildings, where {{the use of the}} sandwich panels is common. Using multi-storey RC frame buildings, we examined the effect of shear panels, which have bigger shear capacity than the cladding panels. First, we performed extensive tests aimed at determining the capacity of the connection of two shear plates, then we performed nine tests of the systems of cladding panels with dimensions 3. 0 / 2. 6 m. The tests have been examined closely and based on their results we defined a bi-linear envelope for an equivalent diagonal. The diagonal is used to model the cladding panels in <b>frame</b> structures. The <b>envelope</b> is defined {{on the basis of the}} bearing resistance of the steel sheeting, which is a result of shear test of the connection of two steel sheetings. In the cases, where experimental results were not available, we applied the Eurocode 3 formulas for capacity. We used the American standard AISC instructions to define the properties of the equivalent diagonal. We presented the influence of sandwich panels on an industrial steel building of the manufacturer Trimo. Results of numerical analysis show that sandwich panels are able to ensure a proper lateral resistance. However, the measures that insure the proper behaviour of the panels are extremely expensive and therefore economically unjustified. These expenses could only be reduced by developing a new cladding panel with better frame-to-panel and panel-to-panel connections. We examined the influence of the steel shear panels on an old three-storey RC frame building (SPEAR). We also compared its behaviour with the behaviour of four buildings, that were designed in complete or in partial agreement with Eurocode 8. The main purpose was to investigate the possibility for strengthening older constructions that were not designed according to seismic codes. We found that it was possible to ensure the Eurocode 8 seismic resistance, even for older constructions, with relatively simple measures...|$|R
40|$|Beam halo is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} that occurs in most intense particle accelerators, and refers to collections of particles that stray far away from a well-defined central beam core. Often in high-intensity beams, the space charge force induces halo. Even for low intensity accelerators, the beam halo could occur in the injection section before the particles are accelerated to relativistic speed. The most severe effects from beam halo are emittance growth and beam loss. Emittance growth can cause the degradation of beam quality, and beam losses will impose restrictions on the beam current. Although one can use a larger aperture to compensate this, the overall cost will increase exponentially. In this dissertation, we address the halo phenomenon and formation mechanism in intense charged particle beams. Although most of the experiment and simulation study of halo {{is based on the}} University of Maryland Electron Ring, it is applicable {{to a wide range of}} accelerators in the same intensity regime. 	We first discuss a matching procedure and rotation correction for the beam envelope. The gradients of four quadruples in the injection are independently adjust to match or mismatch the beam. The gradients of two skew quadruples in the injection are independently adjusted to correct the beam rotation. We succeed in matching the UMER beams and find out that the envelope mismatch and beam skewness are the major sources for halo formation in UMER. Halo could be drive out even in very early stage such as in 2 or 3 mismatch oscillations with large mismatch or beam rotation. 	We simulate the halo formation in UMER lattice till about 10 mismatch oscillations with higher beam intensity in the <b>frame</b> of two <b>envelope</b> mismatch modes. In experiment, we generate envelope mismatch mode with different mismatch level (parameter) by adjusting the four quadrupoles in the injection. The agreement of the envelope between experiments and simulations is satisfactory for mismatch parameter in the range of 0. 8 - 1. 2. Emittance and beam width are obtained from tomography and adaptive optical masking and imaging method separately for comparisons with the simulation as well as the maximum emittance growth predicted by a free energy model and maximum particle radius predicted by a particle-core model. The experiments confirm the predictions from both the simulation and the theory with reasonable agreement. 	We also further investigate the adaptive masking method for halo imaging, and apply it for halo diagnostics at JLAB FEL facility, and for imaging of the injected beam at the SLAC SPEAR 3 storage ring...|$|R
