It is the value of the benefits derived from the asset's existence alone. For example, a tree can be valued in a number of ways, including its use value (as lumber), an <b>existence</b> <b>value</b> (simply being there), and an option value (value of things that it could be used for). <b>Existence</b> <b>value</b> is separate from the value accruing from any use or potential use of the asset." ...|$|E

Following Ohio v Department of the Interior, the types of damages which {{they were able to}} recover included non-use or <b>existence</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Existence</b> <b>values</b> are unable to be assessed through market pricing mechanisms, so contingent valuation surveys were suggested to assess them.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of ethics and}} fundamental value judgments in environmental economics is high-lighted by discussing the controversial concept of <b>existence</b> <b>values.</b> The social value depends crucially on the social objective, which is not necessarily self-evident, e. g., since some individuals tend to value nature intrinsically. It is shown that the motives behind willingness to pay figures matter for the social value, and the conventional view that people respond to CV questions solely {{in order to maximize}} their own utility or well-being is questioned. The {{importance of}} being explicit about value judgments is emphasized, and it is argued that environmental economics should consider non-conventional assumptions which take the social context into account to a larger degree.

5000|$|Eliade also {{explained}} how traditional man could find value {{for his own}} life (in a vision of where all events occurring after the mythical age cannot have value or reality); he indicated that, if the Sacred's essence lies only in its first appearance, then any later appearance must actually be the first appearance. Thus, an imitation of a mythical event is actually the mythical event itself, happening again—myths and rituals carry one back to the mythical age:"In imitating the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythic hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time."Myth and ritual are vehicles of [...] "eternal return" [...] to the mythical age. Traditional man's myth- and ritual-filled life constantly unites him with sacred time, giving his <b>existence</b> <b>value.</b> As {{an example of this}} phenomenon, Eliade cites church services, by which churchgoers [...] "return" [...] to the sacred time of Scripture:"Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, so the service celebrated inside church marks a break in profane temporal duration.

40|$|<b>Existence</b> <b>Value</b> {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important concept {{as the use of}} cost benefit analysis has spread from traditional applications to attempts to place monetary value on, for instance, a rare wetland habitat. Environmental economists have generally accepted the tensions arising in the <b>existence</b> <b>value</b> concept from the range of recent applications, but it is argued here that their various attempts to resolve the difficulties have largely failed. Critics from outside economics, on the other hand, typically claim that the very notion of <b>existence</b> <b>value</b> as understood in economics is flawed, and urge its abandonment altogether. This paper suggests instead a fundamental redefinition of <b>existence</b> <b>value,</b> which, it is argued, (i) explains a number of diverse problems posed by the usual meaning of the term in economics; (ii) does not strain the intentions of respondents to 'willingness-to-pay' surveys; (iii) is consistent with a more realistic model of rational choice in environmental decision-making; and (iv) is sensitive to criticisms from environmental ethics. <b>Existence</b> <b>value,</b> contingent valuation method, welfare, commitment, altruism, incommensurable choices...|$|E

However, its compatibility with the welfare economic foundations of economic valuation is very limited – it is difficult to logically conceive of changes in existence. Moreover, when applied to biodiversity, the concept of <b>existence</b> <b>value</b> gives rise to an instance of a more fundamental problem of economic valuation, termed here the utilitarian dilemma: it can be argued conceptually that biodiversity cannot have existence value; yet the results of empirical studies suggest that people in stated preference studies can be expected to assign <b>existence</b> <b>value</b> to it. The utilitarian dilemma arises as the analysing economist must deal somehow with ‘erroneous’ preferences.

Evaluation of the changes in economic welfare due to a policy action normally relies on comparisons of the value of resources in alternative uses. The economic value of natural resources has steadily been broadened from a commodity view to one that includes recreation values (Clawson). More re-cently, the flow of benefits from preservation of unique and irreplaceable natural environments has been expanded to include benefits to consumers who wish to maintain the opportunity for future visitation (option value) and consumers who derive satisfaction knowing the resource exists but may never expect to visit (<b>existence</b> <b>value).</b> The various benefits have been aggregated together to form what Randall and Stoll call “total economic value”.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} {{proposes that}} human beings are motivated to protect endangered species for various reasons: consumptive use value, non-consumptive use value, non-use value, and intrinsic value. However, it has been difficult to tease apart these values at the behavioral level. Using an innovative fishing game, we study an important tradeoff between one kind of use value (monetary value) and one kind of non-use value (<b>existence</b> <b>value)</b> of the endangered Steller sea lion. In the fishing game, players make repeated decisions on how much pollock to harvest for profit in each period in a dynamic ecosystem.

40|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to amalgamate the concepts of intrinsic value and ecosystem services, often with a stop-over at the economic concept of <b>existence</b> <b>value.</b> These attempts are based on a confusion of concepts, however. In this article, two types of non-use values are distinguished: warm glow value, related to the satisfaction people may derive from altruism towards nature, and <b>existence</b> <b>value,</b> related to the satisfaction people may derive from the mere knowledge that nature exists and originating in the human need for self-transcendence. As benefits to humans, warm glow and existence values can be considered ecosystem services. Neither warm glow value nor <b>existence</b> <b>value</b> represents benefits to nature itself, however. Intrinsic value lies outside the scope of the wide palette of ecosystem services. Although the concept of ecosystem services does not cover benefits to nature and the intrinsic value of such benefits, intrinsic value is not necessarily incompatible with economic valuation. Although a deontological ethics does not allow economic valuation of nature as an end in itself, consequentialism does. In consequentialism, however, intrinsic value is not attributed to nature itself, but to benefits to nature. These benefits can be economically valued on the basis of benefit transfer...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{species are}} {{non-indigenous}} species that adversely affect the habitat they invade. The adverse impact can be ecological (e. g. extinction of indigenous species), environmental (e. g. altering ecosystem function) and/or economic (e. g. reducing tourism).

Honeydew, produced by an endemic scale insect which inhabits about 1 million hectares of beech forest land, {{is a key}} source of carbohydrate. Wasps also need protein which is sourced from insects and birds in the forest. These abundant invaders compete for food directly with indigenous species. They are also known to kill insects, pollinators, and young birds. Social wasps also impact business and reduce the quality of outdoor recreational activity.

Opinions toward five forms of peatland use and seven peatland ecosystem services were surveyed in Northern Ostrobothnia in northern Finland in 2011. Choice experiment (CE) was used to reveal trade-offs in land use preferences, and groups of respondents were identified using the latent class model (LCM). We identified three classes of respondents in which environmentalists showed a high preference toward the cessation of peat production and increase of peatland restoration, the production-oriented class preferred an increase in timber and peat production areas, and the current use supporters agreed on the present land use policy. However, all respondent classes agreed on the increase of nature protection and the present level of timber production and disagreed on the cessation of restoration. The CE revealed that environmentally minded people who are likely to consider the indirect use <b>values</b> and <b>existence</b> <b>values</b> important are less willing to make trade-offs between ecosystem services than those who emphasize direct use values. Because peatland restoration occurs in commercially unproductive peatlands, it improves both the direct use and <b>existence</b> <b>values</b> without reducing provisioning services of peatlands. Therefore, restoration is commonly accepted by the public, in contrast to management options that involve clear trade-offs between ecosystem services. We conclude that the understanding of preferences and trade-offs can enhance sustainable land use planning.
