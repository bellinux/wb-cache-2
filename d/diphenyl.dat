5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated <b>diphenyl</b> ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
25|$|Because of its odor {{reminiscent}} of scented geranium, {{as well as}} its stability and low price, <b>diphenyl</b> ether is used widely in soap perfumes. <b>Diphenyl</b> ether is also used as a processing aid in the production of polyesters.|$|E
25|$|The <b>diphenyl</b> {{carbonate}} {{was derived}} {{in part from}} carbon monoxide, this route being greener than the phosgene method.|$|E
25|$|Involving similar reactions, <b>diphenyl</b> ether is a {{significant}} side product in the high-pressure hydrolysis of chlorobenzene {{in the production of}} phenol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenyl</b> ether is a {{starting}} {{material in the}} production of phenoxathiin via the Ferrario reaction. Phenoxathiin is used in polyamide and polyimide production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenyl</b> {{carbonate}} {{may be used}} {{in place}} of phosgene. Phenol is eliminated instead of hydrochloric acid. This transesterification process avoids the toxicity and handling of phosgene.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{publication}} is {{the report}} titled, An Assessment of Polybrominated <b>Diphenyl</b> Ethers (PBDEs) in Sediments and Bivalves of the U.S. Coastal Zone. This report investigated the relatively {{new class of}} compounds known as Polybrominated <b>Diphenyl</b> Ethers (PBDEs) which act as flame retardants. These are found in many consumer plastics, textiles, electronics, and furniture cushion material. This report showed the relative levels of contamination geographically and linked high levels of PBDE to areas of high human population density. This has been significant due to the potential threat these compounds pose for global distribution.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of phosgene {{is used in the}} production of isocyanates, the most important being toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate (MDI). These two isocyanates are precursors to polyurethanes.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{application}} of aniline {{is for the}} preparation of methylene dianiline and related compounds by condensation with formaldehyde (as discussed above). The diamines are condensed with phosgene to give methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate, a precursor to urethane polymers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenyl</b> ether is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula O(C6H5)2. The molecule {{is subject to}} reactions typical of other phenyl rings, including hydroxylation, nitration, halogenation, sulfonation, and Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation. This simple diaryl ether enjoys a variety of niche applications.|$|E
25|$|Several polybrominated <b>diphenyl</b> ethers (PBDEs) {{are useful}} flame retardants. Of penta-, octa-, and decaBDE, {{the three most}} common PBDEs, only decaBDE is still in {{widespread}} use since its ban in the European Union in 2003. DecaBDE, also known as decabromodiphenyl oxide, is a high-volume industrial chemical with over 450,000 kilograms produced annually in the United States. Decabromodiphenyl oxide is sold under the trade name Saytex 102 as a flame retardant {{in the manufacture of}} paints and reinforced plastics.|$|E
25|$|Although Clyde {{pollution}} from heavy industry and power generation is falling {{there is evidence}} that man-made {{pollution from}} new synthetic compounds in electrical products and textiles are on the increase. The amounts of sixteen polybrominated <b>diphenyl</b> ether (PBDE) compounds used as flame retardants in televisions, computers and furniture upholstery were measured in sediment cores collected from six sites between Princes Dock and Greenock. Comparison of the amounts of PBDE compounds revealed a decline in certain compounds in-line with the European ban on production of mixtures containing environmentally harmful PBDE with eight and nine bromine atoms and a rise in the less harmful mixture composed of ten bromine atoms.|$|E
25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Of all aldehydes, {{formaldehyde}} {{is produced}} on the largest scale, about 6,000,000 tons per year. It is mainly {{used in the}} production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate ("MDI"), a precursor to polyurethanes. The second main aldehyde is butyraldehyde, of which about 2,500,000 tons per year are prepared by hydroformylation. It is the principal precursor to 2-ethylhexanol, which is used as a plasticizer. Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than 1,000,000 tons per year because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are famously used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as N°5 from CHANEL. These include cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives, citral, and lilial.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{application}} of <b>diphenyl</b> ether is as a eutectic mixture with biphenyl, {{used as a}} heat transfer medium. Such a mixture is well-suited for heat transfer applications because of the relatively large temperature range of its liquid state.

2500|$|Isocyanates {{used to make}} {{polyurethane}} {{have two}} or more isocyanate groups on each molecule. The most commonly used isocyanates are the aromatic diisocyanates, [...] toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate, MDI.|$|E
2500|$|Formaldehyde {{is also a}} {{precursor}} to polyfunctional alcohols such as pentaerythritol, {{which is used to}} make paints and explosives. Other formaldehyde derivatives include methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate, an important component in polyurethane paints and foams, and hexamine, which is used in phenol-formaldehyde resins as well as the explosive RDX.|$|E
2500|$|Methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate, {{most often}} {{abbreviated}} as MDI, is an aromatic diisocyanate. Three isomers are common, varying by {{the positions of}} the isocyanate groups around the rings: 2,2'-MDI, 2,4'-MDI, and 4,4'-MDI. The 4,4' isomer is most widely used, and is also known as 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate. [...] This isomer is also known as Pure MDI. MDI reacts with polyols in the manufacture of polyurethane. It is the most produced diisocyanate, accounting for 61.3% of the global market in the year 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the long}} {{germination}} window for tall waterhemp, a single herbicide application {{is unlikely to be}} an effective control strategy. [...] Michigan State University Extension recommends a preemergence application followed by one or more postemergence applications. Tall waterhemp have been reported resistant to acetolactate synthase inhibiting (ALS) herbicides and the triazines, with some individual weeds being resistant to both herbicides groups. [...] Resistance to acifluorfen and other <b>diphenyl</b> ether herbicides has been reported. Even more alarming is the emergence of waterhemp resistant to the latest generation of herbicides, HPPD inhibitors. Furthermore, waterhemp at a site in Nebraska was found to be resistant to 2,4-D, a phenoxy herbicide.|$|E
2500|$|This {{meant that}} about 75 times the {{propellant}} would immediately ignite {{when exposed to}} flash, {{as compared to the}} U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (RP C/12, handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition. [...] German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite—with one major exception: centralite. This was symmetrical Diethyl <b>Diphenyl</b> Urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene <b>diphenyl</b> diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the nights}} of [...] the Germans {{conducted}} gas bombardments on the Hanebeek, Zonnebeke and Steenbeek valleys. Blue Cross gas (<b>diphenyl</b> chlorarsine, sneezing gas) shells were fired to make men {{take off their}} gas masks and were followed by Yellow Cross (dichlorethyl sulphide, mustard gas), which caused blisters, throat and eye injuries. There were few Allied fatalities but thousands of infantry, gunners and troops in working parties were contaminated and needed medical treatment. Opposite XIV Corps was Gruppe Staden with the 58th Division recently arrived from the Eastern Front, parts of the 3rd Naval Division from Marine-Korps-Flandern and the 26th Reserve Division. Units of the 58th Division began to move up through Houthulst Forest to bolster the 119th Division in Gruppe Staden on 13 October, under frequent British and French artillery and gas bombardment. On 20 October, the Allied preparatory bombardment shifted to the German support lines and two soldiers trapped in an overturned pillbox since 15 October were rescued. Next day, German artillery bombarded the front of Gruppe Staden to disrupt the massing of French and British troops.|$|E
