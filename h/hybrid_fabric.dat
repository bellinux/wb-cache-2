40|$|Until recently, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) were {{predominantly}} developed for {{applications in the}} biomedical and engineering industry, and {{only a limited number}} of applications in textiles are known. Fabrics made of natural fibres (e. g. cotton, flax and their mixtures) present many advantages, such as wearing comfort, but they are subject to creasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of compensating for this disadvantage by using SMAs to create aesthetic low crease flax/cotton fabrics. Body Temperature SMAs (BT SMA) that regain their (straight) form when they are subject to human body temperature were used for this purpose. Clothing and bed sheeting are potential applications of these hybrid structures, which become wrinkle-free when they are exposed to the heat of the body, a hair dryer or that generated by an electrical current. The materials selected to achieve this purpose were the following: (1) textile yarns (e. g. single cotton or flax/cotton yarns, two-fold flax yarns and two types of loop fancy yarns) and (2) BT SMA wires of 300 mu m diameter. A power weaving loom and a hand-weaving shuttle loom were used to embed the SMA wires, and four types of <b>hybrid</b> <b>fabrics</b> were produced.

40|$|Anomalous' {{magnetic}} fabrics in dikes {{that appear}} to indicate flowinto thewall confound many workers. Here, we present extensivemagnetic data on five dikes from Tenerife, Canary Islands, and use these to interpret {{the causes of the}} anomalous fabrics. Comparison of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anhysteretic magnetization (AARM) results show that, in some cases, the anomalous fabrics are caused by single-domain grains, which produce AMS fabrics perpendicular to the grain elongation, whereas AARM fabrics are parallel. To check this, hysteresis experiments were used to characterize the domain state. These show most are mixtures of pseudo-single-domain or single-domain plus multi-domain particles, but many have wasp-waisted hysteresis loops, likely indicating mixed populations of stable singledomain and superparamagnetic grains. First-order reversal curves were used to better characterize this and show mixtures of stable single-domain and superparamagnetic grains dominate the magnetic signal. Magnetic particles at the stable single-domain/superparamagnetic threshold are unstable at timespans relevant to the analytical techniques, so they produce complicated results. This suggests that anomalous AMS fabrics in dikes cannot simply be attributed to elongated stable single-domain particles and that mixtures of the different grain types can produce <b>hybrid</b> <b>fabrics,</b> in which the fabrics are neither perpendicular or parallel to the dike plane, that are difficult to interpret without extensive magnetic analysis.

40|$|The cowoven <b>hybrid</b> fiber <b>fabric</b> {{consisting}} of E-glass and poly(ether ether ketone) fiber was compression-molded {{to obtain the}} hybrid composites. The effect of heat aging at different temperatures (400 C and 500 C) for different time intervals (1, 2, and 5 min) on the microcrystalline properties of the composites has been investigated and {{it was observed that}} heat aging for short time enhances the structure property relationships as reflected in the changes in crystal size and volume. The microcrystalline parameters such as the nanocrystal size (hNi), lattice disorder (g), interplanar distance (dhkl), width of the crystallite size distribution, and surface-weighted crystal size (Ds) were evaluated using wide angle X-ray scattering profiles. The different asymmetric column length distribution functions namely, exponential and Reinhold distribution methods were employed to probe the microcrystalline behavior of the composites and the results were compared. The kinetics of thermal degradation (using Flynn–Wall–Ozawa) revealed that, the activation energy decreased with increase in mass loss up to 15 % and remains constant thereafter...|$|R
40|$|Several nanoscale-computing fabrics {{based on}} novel {{materials}} such as semiconductor nanowires, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc. have been proposed in recent years. However, their integration and interfacing with external CMOS has received only limited attention. In this paper we explore integration challenges for nanoscale fabrics focusing on registration and overlay requirements especially. We address the following questions: (i) How can we mitigate the overlay requirements between nano-manufacturing and conventional lithography steps? (ii) How much overlay precision is necessary between process steps? and (iii) What is the impact on yield if different overlays are used? We propose and evaluate a new 3 D integration approach that combines standard CMOS design rules with nano-manufacturing constraints. For a nanoprocessor design implemented in N 3 ASIC (a <b>hybrid</b> nanowire-CMOS <b>fabric)</b> we show that a 100 % yield is achievable even for overlay precisions achievable with current CMOS manufacturing (3 &#x 03 C 3;=&#x 00 B 1; 8 nm, ITRS 2009) while still retaining 3 X density advantage compared to a projected 16 nm CMOS scaled design...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{montmorillonite}} (OMMT) reinforced phenolic (PF) nanocomposites with OMMT {{contents of}} 2 and 5 wt% were fabricated by the two-step OMMT intercalation process, {{resulting in the}} further increase of interlayer spacing of OMMT from 2. 07 to 4. 27 nm. Prepared OMMT/PF composites were found to possess a mix of intercalated and agglomerated clay structures via X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results obtained via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) revealed that the thermal stability of PF matrices was enhanced by the incorporation of OMMT. With OMMT/PF nanocomposites as <b>hybrid</b> matrices, <b>fabric</b> self-lubricating liners were prepared to evaluate their tribological properties. Effects of OMMT on friction coefficient, wear loss and wear morphology of fabric self-lubricating liner, based on OMMT/PF nanocomposites, were studied via long-term friction and wear tests. Tribological properties of liners with different OMMT contents were investigated by imitating a high-velocity/light-load condition. The addition of OMMT appears to enhance the friction and wear properties of fabric self-lubricating liner, and the preferable OMMT content is around 2 wt%...|$|R
