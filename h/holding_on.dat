5|$|A {{third major}} pulse brought the lahar's {{duration}} to roughly two hours. By that point, 85percent of Armero was enveloped in mud. Survivors described people <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to debris {{from their homes}} in attempts to stay above the mud. Buildings collapsed, crushing people and raining down debris.|$|E
5|$|Television {{coverage}} of the event showed people <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to scaffolding around the building, and some were able to climb down to safety. One worker on the 28th floor said that workers were adding insulation to the building when the fire broke out.|$|E
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conflict}} {{that is part}} of the party's background was the Algerian War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were directly involved in the war), and the right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E

5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to the eggs until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Tide {{play of the}} drive, Alabama was penalized 15 yards for <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to the {{facemask}} of a Virginia Tech player. A running play by Alexander was stopped after a loss of a yard, then Zow threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech's Phillip Summers, who returned {{the ball to the}} two-yard line. After the interception, it took Tech two plays for Pegues to push the football across the goal line for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 177 with 8:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Rather than <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to his {{possessions}} in Asia Minor, Michael chose {{to expand the}} Empire, gaining only short-term success. To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, he forced the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the peasantry hated Michael and Constantinople. The efforts of Andronikos II and later his grandson Andronikos III marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring {{the glory of the}} Empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II would often backfire, with the Catalan Company ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when <b>holding</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> {{as long as possible}} so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} {{continued to}} fire up, keeping the storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning it away from the Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
50|$|This formula {{actually}} {{reflects the}} relation of the gravitational effects on the smaller body from the larger body and from the Sun. The tug-of-war figure for Saturn's moon Titan is 380, which means that Saturn's <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> Titan is 380 times as strong as the Sun's <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> Titan. Titan's tug-of-war value may be compared with that of Saturn's moon Phoebe, which has a tug-of-war value of just 3.5. So Saturn's <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> Phoebe is only 3.5 times as strong as the Sun's <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> Phoebe.|$|R

5|$|Russian forces {{temporarily}} {{occupied the}} Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti, and Gori, <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to these areas beyond the ceasefire. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and {{were responsible for}} an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August; in response, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. In the aftermath, Russia's international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014. Russia has, since the war, occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{in violation of the}} ceasefire agreement of August 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's {{convection}} began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed {{to have been}} an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660miles (1060km) southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} was costly for both sides. Although the Australians halted the advancing Chinese 117th Division and inflicted numerous casualties on them, they also suffered heavy losses. In the aftermath the inexperienced Australian battalion commander—Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh—was relieved {{of his position}} by the British brigade commander, having taken over just six days earlier {{following the death of}} the previous commanding officer at Chongju. Nonetheless, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade succeeded in preventing a Chinese break-through at Pakchon, keeping open vital withdrawal routes across the river and securing the UN left flank. Suffering significant casualties, the Chinese offensive was halted the next day due to logistic difficulties. The Chinese and North Koreans were temporarily forced to withdraw north, while the UN successfully reinforced its positions, <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> the Chongchon Line. Yet by late November the US Eighth Army was again forced to withdraw after the Chinese began their Second Phase Offensive, starting a long retreat south. The UN forces were expelled from North Korea, and withdrew to the 38th Parallel where they sought to re-establish defensive positions.|$|E
