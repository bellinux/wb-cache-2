2500|$|Moore's form had dipped {{enough for}} Ramsey to {{choose not to}} select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being {{replaced}} by Norman Hunter in defense and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant {{he was no longer}} required, to which Ramsey replied: [...] "Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year." [...] It never happened, as England could only draw 1–1. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorzów, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When Kevin Hector finally did come on for Martin Chivers after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to David Miller [...] "you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He <b>just</b> <b>nodded.</b> We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch." [...] Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken. [...] England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager as he was sacked six months later.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{looked a}} little shamefaced. He didn't know just what to say, so he said nothing and <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> his head.|$|E
60|$|Christopher <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> {{for they}} had only met on Ethelberta's stairs. Ladywell nodded more, and spoke. 'The church appears to be interesting,' he said.|$|E
60|$|Yielding to the drowsy calm, Mrs. Pett was <b>just</b> <b>nodding</b> into a {{pleasant}} nap, {{when the door}} opened and Lord Wisbeach came in.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the most}} {{difficult}} guest to interact with, according to Newton was Vic Morrow in 1967. He would just stand there saying nothing, silently handing out the Logies. According to Bert, [...] "every so often, I'd say 'how are you going, Vic?' and he would <b>just</b> <b>nod</b> his head." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unimpressed by Waterhouse's acting ability, Tom Baker {{suggested}} that, [...] "Because of his amazing appearance, Matthew {{should have}} played Adric like Sabu - a little wild boy who couldn't speak. I {{would talk to}} him rather like Basil Fawlty talks to Manuel, and he'd <b>just</b> <b>nod</b> or shake his head. But John Nathan-Turner didn't like that idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{so taken}} aback. I didn't like to refuse. He {{put the money}} in his pocket, <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> said 'Thanks,' and walked out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, after all," [...] the Colonel remarked, [...] "he {{scarcely}} {{knew the}} fellow! <b>Just</b> <b>nodded</b> {{to him on}} the stairs, and that sort of thing. Why, there isn't a shadow of a motive!" ...|$|E
60|$|So far he did {{not seem}} to take much notice. He <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> and began to pour out some of the lotion in which he always bathes his poor eyes the last thing at night.|$|E
5000|$|Gradually, Michele Greco {{sided with}} the Corleonesi and {{according}} to some, {{was no more than}} a [...] "puppet" [...] for Corleonesi boss Totò Riina. The Corleonesi’s decimated their adversaries when the simmering conflict escalated into an all-out war after the killing of Stefano Bontade in 1981. According to Tommaso Buscetta Michele Greco would <b>just</b> <b>nod</b> his head and agree with virtually everything Riina said during meetings between the heads of various Mafia families.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The veil's a rummy thing, father. Yes, like a mist. But {{when one}} {{has been at the}} Front for a bit, you can't think how thin the veil seems to get; just one layer of it. I suppose it seems thin to you out there because one step takes you through it. We {{sometimes}} mix up those who have gone through with those who haven't. I daresay if I were {{to go back to my}} old battalion the living chaps would <b>just</b> <b>nod</b> to me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Greco was a {{powerful}} mafia boss, descended {{from a long line}} of mafiosi, but in the latter part of his criminal career he could be best described as little more than Riina's [...] "puppet boss". According to pentito Tommaso Buscetta, Michele Greco, [...] "given his bland and weak personality, was the perfect person to become head of the Commission so as not to stand in the way of Riina designs." [...] Buscetta explained that during meetings between the heads of various Mafia families, Michele Greco would <b>just</b> <b>nod</b> his head and agree with virtually everything Riina said.|$|R
6000|$|The rabbit {{would have}} liked to ask him why he ate food that he knew would burn him, only he was afraid, and <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> in reply; but when they had gone on a little further, he said to Gudu: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goodman didn't answer 'im because 'e was {{joining in}} the chorus with one side of 'is mouth and keeping 'is cigar alight with the other. He <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> at 'im; but 'e looked so 'appy that Sam {{felt it was a}} {{pleasure}} to sit there and look at 'im.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, well, {{she had had}} no time to go {{deeply into}} the matter just then, with that {{prunella}} silk on her hands; but she was 'very intriguee'--very! She had <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> to Mrs. Soames, to show her that she had seen; and, as she confided, in talking it over afterwards, to her chum Francie (Roger's daughter), [...] "Didn't she look caught out just?..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Piper's {{performance}} has been acclaimed by fans and critics. TV Line named her [...] "Performer of the Week," [...] saying [...] "In last Sunday's episode, the actress delivered the former Brona Croft's mad speech to her army of fallen women with such intensity and conviction that we didn't <b>just</b> <b>nod</b> along as she decreed [...] "We must be bloody or nothing else!" [...] No, Piper had us so drunk on her character's power that, had she given the order, we, too, might have marched {{into the streets}} to retrieve Lily the right hand of a bad man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think you're all {{perfectly}} heartless. Those {{two boys}} were going away for heaven {{knows how long}} on a dangerous journey, and they may never come back, and you and Lucy said good-bye to them just {{as if they were}} going off for a day's golf. I {{was the only one who}} said I was sorry, and that we should miss them dreadfully. I hate this English coldness. When I go to America, it's ten to one nobody comes to see me off, and if anyone does he <b>just</b> <b>nods</b> and says [...] "Good-bye, I hope you'll have a jolly time."' ...|$|R
50|$|In {{elementary}} school, {{the boys}} who liked her bullied her. So she went to an all-girls’ middle school. There the girls defended her against boys from other schools and grades but the girls loved her obsessively. Since then, she rarely speaks and shows little emotions. She <b>just</b> <b>nods</b> or shakes her head. Finally {{she decided to go}} to a co-ed high school. Suiren became interested in Taichi Kawasumi because he was the only boy who didn’t fall instantly in love with her {{on the first day of}} school. He is the first person to hear her speak and smile. She shows more emotions as the series progress, such as crying (chapter 55).|$|R
6000|$|I kept my word to Jacobus. I haunted his home. He was perpetually finding {{me there}} of an {{afternoon}} when he popped {{in for a}} moment from the [...] "store." [...] The sound of my voice talking to his Alice greeted him on his doorstep; and when he returned for good in the evening, ten to one he would hear it still {{going on in the}} verandah. I <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> to him; he would sit down heavily and gently, and watch with a sort of approving anxiety my efforts to make his daughter smile.|$|E
60|$|Hardly was he out {{of sight}} when Peter saw Drummer heading that way, and Drummer looked very much put out about something. He <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> to Peter and flew {{straight}} to Unc' Billy's tree. Then he began to drum. How he did drum! His red-capped head flew {{back and forth as}} Peter never had seen it fly before. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Drummer hardly paused for breath. There was too much noise for Peter, and he kicked up his heels and started for the Smiling Pool, and all the way there he laughed.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{discovered}} that this practice was generally accepted, I <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> to him familiarly when one morning, on {{coming out of}} my room, I found him in the cabin. Glancing over the table I saw that his place was already laid. He stood awaiting my appearance, very bulky and placid, holding a beautiful bunch of flowers in his thick hand. He offered them to my notice with a faint, sleepy smile. From his own garden; had a very fine old garden; picked them himself that morning before going out to business; thought I would like. [...] . He turned away. [...] "Steward, can you oblige me with some water in a large jar, please." ...|$|E
60|$|Big Bill and Anson were <b>just</b> {{beginning}} to <b>nod</b> {{their heads in}} agreement, when Charles stopped them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if I {{did know}} the poor fellow <b>just</b> to <b>nod</b> to," [...] he said, [...] "I don't see that's {{any reason why}} I should talk about him to you {{newspaper}} fellows. You'd better get hold of his relations, {{if you can find}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Everybody <b>nodded.</b> <b>Just</b> then Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted, [...] "Here comes Unc' Billy, Ol' Mrs. Possum and all {{the little}} Possums." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{he was at}} {{the same}} table, with the same heaps of papers about him, and the same hearty, easy way of {{speaking}} his mind to you at once, in the fewest possible words. I explained the business I came upon with some little hesitation and nervousness, for I was afraid he might think I was taking an unfair advantage of his former kindness to me. When I had done, he <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> his head, snatched up a blank sheet of paper, scribbled a few lines on it in his rapid way, handed the writing to me, and pushed me out of the room by the two shoulders before I could say a single word. I looked at the paper in the outer office. It was my security from the great banking-house for the whole amount, and for more, if more was wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{opened my}} eyes I was hauled up {{to my feet and}} put {{alongside}} the mate and six others, all of whom was bleeding more or less. The rest had all been chucked overboard at once. In a minute or two the captain of one of the pirates, a little dapper Frenchman, came up to us. 'You have fought your ship well,' he said to the mate, 'and have killed several of my officers and men; but I bear you no malice, and if you are ready to ship with me I will spare your life.' 'I would rather die a hundred times!' the mate said. The pirate said nothing, but <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> and four of his men seized the mate and flung him over the bulwarks. The same question was asked of each of the men; but each in turn refused, and an end was made of them. I was the last.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly I {{came upon}} a {{staggering}} man covered with blood (I think {{he must have been}} flung clean out of his carriage), with such a frightful cut across the skull that I couldn't bear to look at him. I poured some water over his face and gave him some to drink, then gave him some brandy, and laid him down on the grass, and he said, [...] "I am gone," [...] and died afterwards. Then I stumbled over a lady lying on her back against a little pollard-tree, with the blood streaming over her face (which was lead colour) in a number of distinct little streams from the head. I asked her if she could swallow a little brandy and she <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> and I gave her some and left her for somebody else. The next time I passed her she was dead. Then a man, examined at the inquest yesterday (who evidently had not the least remembrance of what really passed), came running up to me and implored me to help him find his wife, who was afterwards found dead. No imagination can conceive the ruin of the carriages, or the extraordinary weights under which the people were lying, or the complications into which they were twisted up among iron and wood, and mud and water.|$|E
60|$|Grant {{glanced at}} her {{somewhat}} curiously, but both were sensible that other eyes were upon them, and with a <b>just</b> perceptible <b>nod</b> he passed on with Muller into the adjoining room. Clavering and the two Americans followed him with Breckenridge, and Grant who had heard something {{of what had happened}} from the fräulein, asked a few questions.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} ubiquitous {{notion of}} ‘patient centredness’ often causes confusion; indeed instruction received {{on this subject}} often left trainees with only the vaguest notion of {{how it could be}} put into practice, sometimes leading to bizarre interpretations of this idea. For example, one colleague described how he, in an attempt at ‘real’ patient centredness, had attempted a whole surgery without saying anything at all for as long as possible, presumably <b>just</b> <b>nodding</b> and gesticulating to compensate. Although we readily agree that non-verbal expression accounts for a considerable content of communication, this is perhaps taking things just too far. Patient centredness remains a central plank of clinical learning, teaching and assessment and nowadays is also central of policy development in the health service. But what do we mean by patient centredness? Is it really important? How important is it compared to other aspects of the consultation? Does it make a difference...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>just</b> <b>nods</b> {{the least}} bit, wipes {{his fingers on}} the {{plantain}} leaf, puts his hand behind his back, as if to help himself to rise from the ground, snatches his revolver from under his jacket and plugs a bullet plumb centre into Mr. Antonio's chest. See what it is to have to do with a gentleman. No confounded fuss, and things done out of hand. But he might have tipped me a wink or something. I nearly jumped out of my skin. Scared ain't in it! I didn't even know who had fired. Everything had been so still just before that the bang of the shot seemed the loudest noise I had ever heard. The honourable Antonio pitches forward--they always do, towards the shot; you must have noticed that yourself--yes, he pitches forward on to the embers, and all that lot of hair on his face and head flashes up like a pinch of gunpowder. Greasy, I expect; always scraping the fat off them alligators' hides--" ...|$|R
60|$|That {{gentleman in}} the white hat and checked shirt, brown coat and brass buttons, {{lounging}} behind the stage-box on the O. P. side, is Mr. Horatio St. Julien, alias Jem Larkins. His line is genteel comedy—his father’s, coal and potato. He does Alfred Highflier in the last piece, and very well he’ll do it—at the price. The party of gentlemen in the opposite box, to whom he has <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> are friends and supporters of Mr. Beverley (otherwise Loggins), the Macbeth of the night. You observe their attempts to appear easy and gentlemanly, {{each member of the}} party, with his feet cocked upon the cushion in front of the box! They let them do these things here, upon the same humane principle which permits poor people’s children to knock double knocks at the door of an empty house—because they can’t do it anywhere else. The two stout men in the centre box, with an opera-glass ostentatiously placed before them, are friends of the proprietor—opulent country managers, as he confidentially informs every individual among the crew behind the curtain—opulent country managers looking out for recruits; a representation which Mr. Nathan, the dresser, who is in the manager’s interest, and has just arrived with the costumes, offers to confirm upon oath if required—corroborative evidence, however, is quite unnecessary, for the gulls believe it at once.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the film}} was over {{we were unable to}} leave our seats. We <b>just</b> <b>nodded</b> at each other and smiled, and began to whisper. We came close to lifting Roddenberry upon our {{shoulders}} and carrying it out of the room...He smiled, and we returned the smile before we converged on him.|$|E
5000|$|As Abraham was {{preparing}} for his return journey back to Canaan, Hagar asked him, [...] "Did God order you to leave us here? Or are you leaving us here to die?" [...] Abraham did not even look back. He <b>just</b> <b>nodded,</b> afraid {{that he would be}} too sad and that he would disobey God. Hagar said, [...] "Then God will not waste us; you can go". Though Abraham had left a large quantity of food and water with Hagar and Ishmael, the supplies quickly ran out, and within a few days the two began to feel the pangs of hunger and dehydration.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{does the}} fellow want to bow and scrape like that for?" [...] he muttered {{to himself as}} he {{followed}} his guide.

Well I suppose I shall get accustomed to it, and shall take to bowing and scraping as a matter of course." ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{people with}} normal hearing, find that {{entering}} hospital causes them anxiety. For a deaf person, going to hospital {{can be an}} especially traumatic experience. Their inability to hear and to communicate can bring distress, confusion and embarrassment. Not only is {{it difficult for them}} to communicate with the hospital staff and these, with them, but their handicap can isolate them from other patients around them. They can be left out of the general ward which often keeps patients cheerful, despite their illness and which may even aid in their recovery. For patients who are hard of hearing or who are totally deaf, this can be a nerve-shattering experience. The doctors give all their. professional help and the guardian angels, the nurses, give,,wonderful care and attention [...] . but still they find it exasperating when they cannot hear what the doctor is saying to them.
