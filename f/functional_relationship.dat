Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.|$|E

25|$|For example, it {{was useful}} {{to examine the}} <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> between TAP peptide {{transport}} and HLA class I antigen presentation. TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence {{the ability of a}} particular peptide {{to gain access to the}} MHC class I pathway. Artificial neural network (ANN), a computer model was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
25|$|In short, total {{least squares}} {{does not have}} the {{property}} of units-invariancei.e. it is not scale invariant. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line; (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables. This line has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as standardised major axis (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006), the reduced major axis, the geometric mean <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> (Draper and Smith, 1998), least products regression, diagonal regression, line of organic correlation, and the least areas line. Tofallis (2002) has extended this approach to deal with multiple variables.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} law as {{normative}} patterns in a normative field {{was developed by}} Anna Christensen {{in a number of}} published articles following the book Residential Right in the Tenement House (1994). The theory is based on the thesis that different basic normative patterns can be distinguished in the multitude of legal norms. As social life is quite complex, these normative patterns do not make up the ‘hierarchical legal system’ we frequently imagine. Instead, these patterns are being set into play in a normative field as determined by the different basic patterns, which also act as normative poles. Another component of the theoretical framework is the <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> between the legal system and the structure of society and conditions of economic production, elaborated in the work of Professor Ann Numhauser-Henning. The basic normative patterns are held to reflect normative practices functional to society and human relationships. They thus reflect – and codify – social normative conceptions and practices aimed at making long-lasting human relationships and sustainable societies possible, and they are closely related to societal conditions. Changes in the underlying conditions of production provide explanations for many of the movements in the normative field and the new legal institutions, which have arisen to satisfy fundamental normative demands. However, the basic normative patterns all represent enduring legitimate normative conceptions in society, and it is the task of legislators and courts to balance these conceptions within the framework of law.|$|E

500|$|The season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews, after two seasons {{that resulted in}} heavy critical acclaim. Following a positive outlook on the second season, Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment expressed disappointment during the third one, mainly due to the declining quality and lack of realism of the storylines. He noted {{a growing number of}} similarities between the season's arcs and the ones that are developed in soap operas, by stating that [...] "the line which separates primetime television from soap opera is oftentimes razor thin" [...] and admitting that, despite his considering the series [...] "the best drama", he freely admits that it requires some inherent suspension of disbelief, after it [...] "found itself mired in the annoying and absurd". Whereas Monfette acknowledged that the fans would consider the problem to have been a simple case of lazy writing, he noted that over-writing played a main role in the series becoming unexpectedly unrealistic. He also noted the senseless intrigues in the Derek/Meredith relationship, by stating that the season would not have achieved high ratings if a <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> had been introduced: [...] "The season generally opts to stall out for its vast majority, providing Meredith with some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do".|$|E

However, apex graphs are intimately connected to bounded local treewidth: the minor-closed graph families F that have bounded local treewidth are exactly the families that have an apex graph {{as one of their}} forbidden minors. A minor-closed family of graphs that has an apex graph as one of its forbidden minors is known as apex-minor-free.
