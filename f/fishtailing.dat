40|$|General EcologyZebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) {{have had}} {{consider}} ecological effects on many lakes of the Great Lakes Region, including Douglas Lake (Northern Lower Peninsula in Michigan, USA). People inhabiting the University of Michigan Biological Station of Pellston, MI, {{during the summer}} have been cleaning clams along the shores of South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay for five years when the opportunity arises. This study examined whether clams along South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay were healthier than clams {{from other parts of}} the lake, possibly because people clean these clams regularly. Clams from South and North <b>Fishtail</b> Bays were surveyed. The species, length, thickness, mass, and percent coverage by zebra mussels were determined for each clam found. The weight of zebra mussels attached to each clam was also determined. A 1 ‐tailed T‐test was used to analyze whether populations of clams differed in mass, length, or the mass of mussels each clam carried. The Lampsilis siliquoidea from South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay were significantly larger than those from North <b>Fishtail</b> Bay, but this was not the case for Ligumia recta. The lengths of both species were not significantly different between the two bays. Clams from South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay of both species had significantly fewer zebra mussels on them compared to clams from North <b>Fishtail</b> Bay. Results support the hypothesis that South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay has healthier clams than North <b>Fishtail</b> Bay. Clams from South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay are heavier compared to clams from North <b>Fishtail</b> Bay of comparable length. People cleaning the clams may contribute to this observed difference in masses, since clams are regularly cleaned on South <b>Fishtail</b> Bay in the summer and not so in North <b>Fishtail</b> Bay...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fishtailing</b> is {{a vehicle}} {{handling}} problem which {{occurs when the}} rear wheels lose traction, resulting in oversteer.

50|$|Philip's {{first and}} only book <b>Fishtailing</b> was {{published}} in 2010 by Coteau Books after only two previous rejections. She was the 2010 winner of the Governor General's Literary Awards for Children's Literature in Ottawa, Canada. <b>Fishtailing</b> follows the lives of four fictional Vancouver high school students; Natalie, Tricia, Miguel and Kyle. The book switches perspectives between the four characters, showing how they interact and deal with violence, bullying and their desires to fit in. This book is unusual because it is written in verse instead of prose. Therefore, the book switches between the four central characters by displaying poems written by them. This book comes from Phillips’ experiences with students. As a Librarian and teacher, Phillips was exposed to both the positive diversity of different cultures of a multicultural society, {{as well as the}} negative experiences students’ bear at home that affect their school and social behaviour. With an equal representation of students, teachers and school counsellors in her novel, Phillips expresses the conflicts of getting through to students and identifying challenges from each role within the schools.|$|E
