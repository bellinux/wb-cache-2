5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Pinocchio and Jiminy {{find the}} workshop vacant. They soon {{get a letter}} from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out in search of Pinocchio, but was swallowed by a giant sperm whale named Monstro, and is now living <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.|$|E
25|$|Wrynecks whaler {{suffered}} {{two holes}} but was repaired. Her occupants were wet through, her compass was damaged and her drinking water contaminated. Her four oars were serviceable, so Commissioned Engineer Waldron took command and she set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift. Waldron was also nursing a Leading Seaman, George Fuller, who had bullet wounds <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly</b> and thigh.|$|E
25|$|With {{his right}} arm still in a sling, Campbell led the 57th during the Fredericksburg Campaign {{in the winter of}} 1862. At the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, he was again seriously wounded, hit in his abdomen and the same right arm. The wound <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly</b> went through his liver, and Campbell was {{considered}} beyond hope and left for dead. He had been appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army on November 29, 1862, but it was never confirmed and this appointment would expire on March 4, 1863.|$|E

Behind him, to the proper right of the tree stump, is a basket of fruit.|$|R
50|$|Aghasura (Aghāsura) {{the giant}} deadly serpent demon had the powers to glide {{in the sky}} and change its forms. Summoned by his master Kamsa he turned himself into a ghostly cave to allure Krishna and his friends inside with the {{intention}} of swallowing them up. He managed to trick Krishna's friends inside and trapped them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> poisonous <b>belly.</b> Sensing the danger, Krishna came to their rescue as Aghasura sucked Krishna in as well. But just {{as he was about to}} crush Krishna inside him, Krishna tore open Aghasura's abdomen into pieces and brought an end to the great serpent demon.|$|R
500|$|Those still {{conscious}} at {{that point}} might have seen their entrails burned, before their heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered (chopped into four pieces). [...] The regicide Major-General Thomas Harrison, after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open in October 1660, {{was reported to have}} leaned across and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head.

2500|$|After the gunfight in Tombstone, {{during which}} the McLaury {{brothers}} and Billy Clanton were killed, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. They were arrested and released on bail. During a month-long preliminary hearing before Judge Wells Spicer, Clanton told a story of abuse that he had suffered {{at the hands of}} the Earps and Holliday the night before the gunfight. He denied threatening the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open his vest to show he was unarmed. Clanton said Wyatt shoved his revolver <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly,</b> telling him, [...] "You son-of-a-bitch, you can have a fight!".|$|E
2500|$|Murtagh and Thorn {{retreat to}} {{somewhere in the}} north to have some time to themselves. Nasuada, after a heated debate {{with the leaders of}} the Varden, becomes the High Queen of Alagaësia. Arya returns to Du Weldenvarden to help choose a new monarch for the elves after the death of Queen Islanzadí in battle, and is chosen herself. She takes with her the rescued green dragon egg, which soon hatches for her. Thus, Arya becomes a Rider with her dragon named Fírnen. Near the end of the book, Arya reveals this to Eragon, as well as her True Name, while Saphira decides to test Fírnen [...] "to see if he has the iron in his bones, and the fire <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly</b> to match [...] ". The two dragons become mates shortly thereafter.|$|E

In 472 during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung led the final reserve and the beasts of Angband in an attack that prevented the joining of the two Elven-hosts, breaking and routing the Host of the sons of Fëanor, resulting in the total defeat of the Union of Maedhros. During this battle Glaurung was stabbed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> vulnerable <b>belly</b> by the Dwarf-king Azaghâl and fled back to Angband.|$|R
50|$|At other times, Teal and Templar {{maintain}} a cordial relationship bordering on friendship. Indeed, {{in several of}} the early Saint books (including The Holy Terror), Teal states outright that he would consider Templar a friend if they weren't on the opposite sides of the law. For his part, Templar is shown to always have a fresh stick of chewing gum ready to give to Teal during his frequent visits, though Teal is less appreciative of Templar's habit of poking him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> expansive <b>belly</b> whenever he wants to emphasize a point (or sometimes just for the fun of it, as occurs several times in The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal).|$|R
50|$|As {{a part of}} the Run series, he {{is shown}} being turned into a cyborg with an {{enhanced}} physique, partial body armor and a series of flame-spewing nozzles implanted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chest, <b>belly,</b> face, mouth and hands. He further enhances his body by an experimental radioactive infusion process: as a result he gains a metahuman body composed of molten material, able to increase his mass and density at will and radiate high temperature radiations. In this new form he's shown to be unable, whether due to a physical limitation or simply because he is incapable of thinking that way, to reduce his increased mass, becoming in a short while a behemoth so heavy and dense that he loses the ability to move.|$|R
2500|$|On 8 August 1982, at the 1982 World Aquatics Championships in Guayaquil, Prado won a {{gold medal}} in the 400-metre {{individual}} medley, with a time of 4:19.78, establishing a new world record that stood until 23 May 1984. Prado was also in four other finals: placing fourth in the 200-metre butterfly (beating the South American record), and eighth in the 200-metre individual medley, the 200-metre backstroke, and the 4×100-metre medley. Prado had chances to earn a good result also in the 200-metre individual medley, but the conditions were adverse in Ecuador. [...] "The hotel we stayed at was not well attended. It was directly across [...] the Guayaquil bus station. I managed to reach the final of the 200-metre individual medley, but I was weak because food there was terrible, and finished the race in eighth place." [...] Prado landed at home with gold on his neck but a big mycosis <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> Djan Madruga had worse luck: he contracted typhoid fever.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party. Also, he made Fianna Fáil the permanent party of government. They used {{to have all of}} the power most of the time, but now they have most of the power all of the time. All of that takes skill. But I wonder will people talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there any such thing? What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E

60|$|The vice-admiral instinctively grasped his sword-hilt tighter, {{and turned}} in the {{direction}} mentioned by his companion. There, indeed, came a fresh ship, shoving the cloud aside, and, by the clearer atmosphere that seemed to accompany her, apparently bringing down a current of air stronger than common. When first seen, the jib-boom and bowsprit were both enveloped <b>in</b> smoke, but <b>his</b> <b>bellying</b> fore-top-sail, and the canvass hanging in festoons, loomed grandly in the vapour, the black yards seeming to embrace the wreaths, merely to cast them aside. The proximity, too, was fearful, her yard-arms promising to clear those of the Plantagenet only by a few feet, as her dark bows brushed along the admiral's side.|$|R
50|$|One day, the {{criminal}} Jagannath (Kitty) ask Gopal to put two tubes (containing top secret informations) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> horses' <b>belly.</b> Jagannath has {{to send the}} horses to Hong Kong as soon as possible. Gopal refuses to perform surgery on horses in good health and he doesn't want to break the law. Jagannath has no other choice than to kidnap Gopal's daughter. Jagannath's henchmen kidnaps both of his daughters and they lock them up in a room. Sindhu and Nandu {{realize that they are}} sisters, and flee away from the place thanks to Nandu's animals. The girls hide the tubes behind a huge Mariamman statue. The girls want to unite their parents, so the twins swap their places to convince their parents. In the meantime, Jagannath is urged to recover the tubes. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.|$|R
