50|$|The first {{experiment}} with mechanical interlocking in the United States {{took place in}} 1875 by J. M. Toucey and William Buchanan at Spuyten Duyvil Junction in New York on the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad (NYC&HRR). At the time, Toucey was General Superintendent and Buchanan was Superintendent of Machinery on the NYC&HRR. Toucey and Buchanan formed the Toucey and Buchanan <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Switch</b> and Signal Company in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1878. The first important installations of their mechanism were on the switches and signals of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company and the New York Elevated Railroad Company in 1877-78. Compared to Saxby's design, Toucey and Buchanans' interlocking mechanism was more cumbersome and less sophisticated, and so was not implemented very widely. Union Switch & Signal bought their company in 1882.|$|E

40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting up specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactive contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Adamant circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Adamant was only used during a limited ''test'' on a regular plywood crate due to safety considerations of the tool for this application. The Adamant circular saw, a counter-rotating twin-cutter, constructed with blades that work differently than conventional cutting wheels with twin blades, each rotating in opposite directions. It is used to cut wood and metals. Each blade is approximately 8 3 / 4 inches in diameter with a maximum cutting depth of 2 1 / 2 inches. The machine has two rotation speeds: 1, 900 and 2, 900 rotations per minute (rpm). The saw is operated with an interlocked, guarded trigger switch located at the end of the saw opposite the cutting blades. To operate the saw, the safety interlock must be depressed prior to powering the saw with the trigger control. The saw is supported by a handle at the front of the saw near the cutting blades. The top part of the blades is guarded near the handle, with approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades exposed. The Adamant circular saw is an innovative technology used to cut metals and wood. Its safety features include: <b>interlocking</b> <b>switch</b> for powering the saw, overload indicator and shutoff, and an electronic brake that stops the engine immediately when the start button is released. The top part of the blades is guarded near the motor. With approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades open, the operator is exposed to the potential risk of serious and minor cuts and abrasions when using and handling the saw. There is also potential for damage to the blades if the saw is not stored properly. Without guarding on the lower part of the blades, these can be damaged if the saw is dropped or rested on the cutting blades. Based upon the industrial hygiene sampling conducted for the other four saws demonstrated at FIU, noise levels, nuisance dust, and airborne fiberglass may be a problem when using this technology for the cutting of fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. No industrial hygiene sampling was conducted while the Adamant saw was in use. Engineering controls should be used to eliminate these problems whenever possible. Where this is not possible, administrative controls, training, and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Respirators should be used if engineering controls do not sufficiently control the dust or fiberglass generated. Respirators should be equipped with an organic vapor and acid gas cartridge with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|E

To probe these molecules, both individually and in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), a broad set of methods have been developed. These range from low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) via two-terminal break junctions to larger scale SAM-based devices. It is generally found that the electronic coupling between molecules and electrodes has a profound influence on the properties of such molecular junctions. For example, an intrinsically switchable molecule may lose its functionality after it is contacted. Vice versa, switchable two-terminal devices may be created using passive molecules ('extrinsic switching').

40|$|A general {{approach}} to elucidating the molecular basis of enzyme catalysis and regulation {{is the time}} resolution of the complex reaction mechanisms involved into their elementary steps. Both enzyme catalysis and enzyme regulation are initiated by the binding of small molecules to the protein. This association reaction is generally quite rapid and i often followed by a conformational change of the macromolecule. These conformational changes are {{discussed in terms of}} the dynamics of the underlying elementary processes, hydrogen bonding, solvation and hydrophobic interactions, all of which have been studied in model systems. Enzyme catalysis often involves acid—base catalysis. Consideration of the rates of both concerted and sequential proton transfer mechanisms in terms of model systems suggests that the observed turnover numbers of enzymes require that proton transfer steps in the catalytic process occur at close to their maximum possible rates. A general mechanism for enzyme catalysis is pro-posed and is illustrated by the mechanism of action of ribonuclease A. A distinguishing feature of most regulatory enzymes is their multi-subunit nature. The regulation of enzyme activity usually is achieved by alteration of subunit interactions through conformational changes triggered by ligand binding. These conformational transitions are important processes in the cooperative binding of substrates and effectors to regulatory enzymes. As an example, the mechanism of the regulation of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coil is considered: in this case coupled conformational changes appear to be utilized as <b>interlocking</b> on—off <b>switches</b> for the enzymic activity...|$|R

40|$|Every {{switching}} operation {{in a power}} substation must be executed after proper evaluation of its consequence. Often, switching actions for various operating conditions and contingencies are pre determined by using the control engineer's knowledge and previous experience. When the need arises, either a computer or an operator carries out these actions. However, {{it is difficult for}} an operator to know all the operating conditions and contingencies in advance. An on line decision making tool can provide an operator with the most appropriate switching decisions for the present system configuration and system state so the continuity and quality of power supply can be maintained by implementing those switching decisions. Since the circuit configuration varies from one substation to another, such decision-making tools developed for one substation may not be applicable to another substation. This thesis presents a technique to design digital computer based substation switching schemes. The technique is applicable to all practical substations. The rules of <b>interlocking</b> and sequence <b>switching</b> used by the schemes are generalized and are not based upon a particular substation configuration. While being applicable to all substations, these schemes also ensure the most appropriate {{switching operation}}s with minimum operator intervention. The switching schemes ensure the safety of the system before making any switching action. They assist human operators in the evaluation of abnormal circumstances and are easy to integrate with other monitoring, control and protection systems. A software application for developing switching schemes for substations called SSP was developed by using the techniques presented in this thesis. Switching schemes were developed for eight substations by using the semi-automated design tools provided with SSP. The switching schemes were then tested for their correct operation. Results of the tests showed that the technique developed by the work presented in this thesis can provide appropriate switching scheme for a substation of any practical configuration...|$|R
