Therefore, if higher bond pressures are needed to increase the final deformation (flatness) of a compliant bonded gold wire, a higher yielding alloy of aluminum could be employed. The use of a compliant medium also overcomes the thickness variations when attempting to bond a multiple number of conductor wires simultaneously to a gold metalized substrate (Figure 4). It also prevents the leads from being excessively deformed since the compliant member deforms around the leads during the bonding cycle thus eliminating mechanical failure of a bonded wire due to excessive deformation from a hard <b>faced</b> <b>tool</b> (Figure 3) which is employed by thermocompression, and thermosonic bonding.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that {{high-frequency}} activity (HFA) is modulated by the phase of low-frequency activity. This phenomenon of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is often interpreted as reflecting phase coding of neural representations, although evidence for this link is still lacking in humans. Here, we show that PAC indeed supports phase-dependent stimulus representations for categories. Six patients with medication-resistant epilepsy viewed images of <b>faces,</b> <b>tools,</b> houses, and scenes during simultaneous acquisition of intracranial recordings. Analyzing 167 electrodes, we observed PAC at 43 % of electrodes. Further inspection of PAC revealed that category specific HFA modulations occurred at different phases and frequencies of the underlying low-frequency rhythm, permitting decoding of categorical information using the phase at which HFA events occurred. These results provide evidence for categorical phase-coded neural representations and are the first to show that PAC coincides with phase-dependent coding in the human brain. DOI: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTool {{management}} {{is an important}} element in the efficiency of flexible manufacturing systems. This paper improves manufacturing flexibility through integrated computer aided process planning and scheduling with tool management. A new methodology for cutting tool {{management is}} introduced, based on the use of alternative tools. In the methodology proposed, computer aided process planning singles out all possible tool alternatives for each operation. The tool manager is designed to solve interferences between tool alternatives to make them compatible with scheduling. Interferences occur when the same tools are simultaneously needed in various machining operations. We propose a method to reduce tool alternatives. Thus, interferences disappear, and a collection of tool alternatives compatible with the scheduling of the system are obtained for machining operations. Tool management can use these sets of tools to plan tool changes that are necessary to <b>face</b> <b>tool</b> wear and to react to perturbations in the production system. To prove the response of our proposal, computational experiments are performed on randomly generated test problems...|$|R

5000|$|Bottom bracket taps and <b>facing</b> <b>tools</b> are tools used to tap or {{chase the}} threads {{in the bottom}} bracket shell and face the outside edges, respectively. A single tool will {{sometimes}} handle both jobs, and is usually suitable for light-duty bicycle shop use. A separate tap set and facing set is usually employed by frame builders where more robust tooling that is more frequently used is needed. Both tap sets and facing sets are intended for frame finishing work after welding and/or brazing, as the frame tubes tend to deform slightly after this process, and for cleaning out any weld splatter or paint from the bottom bracket threads.

The potential of a range of sensors to detect tool degradation has been investigated and the outputs have been incorporated into a monitoring system. Progressive degradation under nominal rough and finish face milling and rough groove milling has been investigated using a two point grooving tool and four and eight point <b>face</b> milling <b>tools</b> on En 8, En 24 and En 24 T workpiece materials. Rapid degradation of the cutting tool has also been observed under rough milling conditions using four and eight point <b>face</b> milling <b>tools,</b> whilst machining n 8 and En 24 T materials in a variety of simulated and actual tool breakage situations. A limited investigation of the effect of the individual wear geometries associated with both progressive and instantaneous tool degradation has been conducted by simulating these geometries and carrying out rough miffing tests using a four point <b>face</b> milling <b>tool</b> on a workpiece of En 8 material. Similarly, a limited investigation of the effect of machining on different machines has also been undertaken. A number of different sensing technologies have been used, including conventional sensors such as spindle current and cutting force but also novel sensing techniques such as Acoustic Emission. These have been combined using artificial intelligence techniques to provide automatic recognition of the tool wear state.

5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard <b>faced</b> <b>tool</b> thermocompression bonding all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard <b>faced</b> bonding <b>tool</b> and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard <b>faced</b> bonding <b>tool</b> such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.|$|R
