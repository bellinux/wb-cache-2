25|$|Braathens {{introduced}} {{their new}} Fokker F27 Friendship from 9 January 1959. From the summer program it flew two daily flights to Oslo and from 1961 twice per {{day on the}} coastal route. VHF omnidirectional range and distance measuring equipment navigational system were installed in 1963. Ålesund Airport experienced a massive increase in traffic during the 1960s. A third <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> to Oslo was introduced in August 1963 and on the coastal route from 2 May 1964. The latter was extended to Bodø Airport and Tromsø Airport from 1 April 1967, and upgraded to a fourth daily service. Some Oslo services were provided using a Douglas DC-6. A year later the coastal route increased to five daily trips, which was matched by the Oslo route in 1969. That year also saws the installation of a visual approach slope indicator {{and the introduction of}} the Fokker F28 Fellowship in March.|$|E
25|$|Profits on {{the lines}} from Vaasa were on the decline however, and between January and May 1996 Wasa Queen sailed on the fast-growing Helsinki—Tallinn route. For the summer season of 1996 she {{returned}} to Vaasa—Umeå service, but from September 1996 until September 1999 the Wasa Queen served continuously between Helsinki and Tallinn. During this time her timetables varied depending on whether {{she was the only}} Silja Line ship on the route or not. Until April 1997 she sailed alongside MS Silja Festival, with only one departure from each port per day. After Silja Festival stopped sailing on the route, Wasa Queen had two daily departures from each port. Starting from October 1997 GTS Finnjet spent the winter season sailing between Helsinki and Tallinn, and again during this time Wasa Queen had only one <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> (during the times when Finnjet was on the route she also used Finnjets terminal at Katajanokka, not Silja Line's normal Olympiaterminal).|$|E

50|$|An {{index is}} {{assigned}} to each FAA Part 139 certificate holder based {{on a combination of}} the air carrier aircraft length and the average number of <b>daily</b> <b>departures.</b> If the longest air carrier aircraft at the airport has five or more average <b>daily</b> <b>departures,</b> the matching index is used. If the longest aircraft has less than five average <b>daily</b> <b>departures,</b> the next lower index is used. That index determines the required number of ARFF vehicles and required amount of extinguishing agents.|$|R

50|$|Local public {{transport}} {{is provided by}} several companies. Bus Éireann, Ireland's state-owned bus company, operates a range of services subsidised by the National Transport Authority, while a number of provide operators also run commercial bus services in and around Limerick. A new enhanced city bus network was introduced in Limerick City on Sunday 4 December. A new route {{was introduced to the}} network called 304A that connects Raheen and Monaleen to the centre. Later services on all routes were also introduced with the last <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> from the city centre at 23.30.|$|E

50|$|Airport {{ownership}} {{consisted of}} Viborg and Ringkjøbing county council districts and {{the municipalities of}} Herning, Holstebro, Viborg, Skive, Ikast, Karup, Struer, Ringkøbing, Lemvig and Skjern. It was agreed that Det Danske Luftfartsselskab - later SAS - would start flying on the route {{in exchange for a}} subsidy by the owners. In the beginning there was a single <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> with a 15-passenger Heron airplane. The route was a success and {{there was no need for}} the subsidy. On the contrary, the airport's ongoing development was paid for with the operating income and no additional public support aside from the owners' initial deposits.|$|E
50|$|On 16 May 1992 Frans Suell was christened in Malmö by the Swedish {{opera singer}} Birgit Nilsson. The {{following}} day she set on her maiden voyage from Malmö to Travemünde and Lübeck, with only invited guests on board. On 19 May 1992 she began normal {{service on the}} Malmö-Travemünde route, with a <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> from both ports. The service had a troubled start, as marketing had been difficult due to delays {{in the construction of}} the ship. Due to restrictions placed by the city of Malmö on traffic through the city, no trucks could be carried on board, and operating the buffet restaurant on board caused difficulties for the company.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 2013 the company gained further {{diagrams}} on the National Express network including the former Yourbus diagram on route 040. This saw South Gloucestershire operate every journey on the route apart from four Friday/Sunday only diagrams which were operated by Chalfont Coaches. Other services introduced included a seasonal 317 service which operated a once <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> between Bristol and Lymington and a service between London and Leeds Castle. As of September 2013 all of these journeys have now been withdrawn. September also saw South Gloucestershire take on a diagram on service 509 between London and Cardiff which had previously been operated National Express Operations. From November service 302 between Bristol and Northampton has also been taken over from Arriva MK Metro, coincidentally this had previously been operated by FirstGroup.|$|E

5000|$|These VSOE {{services}} {{are not to}} be confused with a regularly scheduled train called the Orient Express, which ran nightly between Paris and Bucharest - in the last years of operation cut back to between Strasbourg and Vienna - until 11 December 2009. This latter was a normal EuroNight sleeper train and was the lineal descendant of the regular Orient Express <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> from Paris to Vienna and the Balkans. While this descendant train was primarily used for every sort of passengers to Central and Eastern Europe, applying only the standard international train fares, the VSOE train is aimed at tourists looking to take a luxury train ride. Fares on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express are high as the service is intended not as an ordinary rail service, but as a leisure event with five-star dining included.|$|E

50|$|On 24 May 1975, the Svea Corona started {{service for}} the Silja Line. She damaged her bow {{thruster}} during the maiden voyage, {{and it was not}} repaired until 10 June of the same year during an extra docking at Vuosaaren telakka, Helsinki. With all three ships in operation, there wasn't enough passenger traffic on the route to support three ships through the entire year. As an initial solution, the Bore Star was chartered to Finnlines for winter seasons 1975-76 and 1976-77 while Svea Corona and Wellamo served the route as a two-ship operation. During the summer seasons, an unusual schedule allowing two daily departures from each port with three ships was adopted instead of the route's normal one <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> per port arrangement. On 14 April 1977 there was a bomb threat on board the Svea Corona, {{but it turned out to}} be false.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{hierarchical regression}} models for circular data using the projected normal distribution, {{applied in the}} development of weights for the Access Point Angler Intercept Survey, a recreational angling survey conducted by the US National Marine Fisheries Service. Weighted estimates of recreational fish catch are used in stock assessments and fisheries regulation. The construction of the survey weights requires the distribution of <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> times of anglers from fishing sites, within spatio temporal domains subdivided by the mode of fishing. Because many of these domains have small sample sizes, small area estimation methods are developed. Bayesian inference for the circular distributions on the 24 -hour clock is conducted, based on a large set of observed <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> times from another National Marine Fisheries Service study, the Coastal Household Telephone Survey. A novel variational/Laplace approximation to the posterior distribution allows fast comparison {{of a large number of}} models in this context, by dramatically speeding up computations relative to the fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo method while giving virtually identical results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relations}} between numbers ofCommon Cranes Grus grus departing on spring migration and weather, progress of season and course of migration were studied at Gallocanta, NE Spain during February-March 1984 and 1985. Rain, cloudiness and strong headwinds were important fac-tors inhibiting migration. Most cranes migrated {{in association with}} the south-western sector of a high or in the warm sector of a low. Given these fair weather conditions, the number of birds departing was mainly correlated with date and with the relative number of cranes that did not migrate the pre-vious day, but not with the number of birds staging and only slightly with the number that arrived the previous day. The average staging period esti-mated for an individual crane (5 - 8 days) was longer than the average duration of adverse weather period without migration (0 - 3 days). The <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> never included 100 % ofthe staging birds (mean 14, 3 %). These facts suggest that the duration of the staging period results from a compromise between the urge to arrive in time at the breeding areas, the inhibiting effect of bad weather, and the tendency to stay longer so as to benefit from favourable feeding conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{reference}} point hypothesis of prospect theory {{is applied to}} commuters' departure time decision-making and to obtain {{a better understanding of}} how commuters use arrival time information in <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> time choice. There are two {{reference point}}s defined in this study: the earliest acceptable arrival time and the work starting time for a given commuter. An arrival is defined as an early-side arrival if the arrival time is earlier than his/her preferred arrival time, and a late-side arrival otherwise. A gain occurs when a commuter experiences an arrival time that is between his/her earliest acceptable arrival time and work starting time; this is assumed to enhance the likelihood of choosing the same departure time. Similarly, a loss is observed when the commuter experiences an arrival time which is outside that range; this is assumed to reduce the likelihood of choosing that departure time. The empirical results indicate that around 20 % of commuters are likely to switch their departure times and routes and most of commuters experience gains, and that preferred arrival times of commuters tend to be near their work starting times. Most importantly, it is shown that, consistent with prospect theory, commuters react asymmetrically to gains and losses. ...|$|E
40|$|The northward {{departure}} of 13 wader species was {{studied in the}} Baie d 2 ̆ 7 Aouatif, Bane d 2 ̆ 7 Arguin, Mauritania, in the springs of 1985, 1986 and 1988. Waders left {{the area in the}} late afternoon. Wind speed and direction were registered near ground level (all years) and at altitudes up to 5 km (in 1988). A total of 31 000 waders were observed heading northwards, with those species wintering locally in largest numbers being most common. The majority of wader species showed fairly short periods of departure and unimodal departure peaks. Redshank and Dunlin departed over extended periods. Average departure dates of species correlated positively with the estimated midpoints of ranges in breeding latitude (ca. 2 d per 0 latitude).   Since winds at ground level did not correlate with winds at higher altitudes, and since {{it is likely that the}} departing waders traveled at great heights, it was not surprising that there is no correlation between the average afternoon tail wind vector at ground level and the <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> intensity. We suggest that the timing ofdeparture from the Bane d 2 ̆ 7 Arguin is largely under internal, instead of under direct environmental, control...|$|E
30|$|The study derives a {{framework}} for assessing airport efficiency through evaluating optimal arrival and departure delay thresholds. Assumptions of airport efficiency measurements, though based upon minimum numeric values such as 15  min of turnaround time, cannot be extrapolated to determine proportions of delay-days of an airport. This study explored the concept of delay threshold to determine the proportion of delay-days as {{an expansion of the}} theory of delay and our previous work. Data-driven approach using statistical modelling was employed to a limited set of determinants of daily delay at an airport. For the purpose of testing the efficacy of the threshold levels, operational data for Entebbe International Airport were used as a case study. Findings show differences in the proportions of delay at departure (μ =  0.499; 95  % CI =  0.023) and arrival (μ =  0.363; 95  % CI =  0.022). Multivariate logistic model confirmed an optimal <b>daily</b> <b>departure</b> and arrival delay threshold of 60  % for the airport given the four probable thresholds { 50, 60, 70, 80 }. The decision for the threshold value was {{based on the number of}} significant determinants, the goodness of fit statistics based on the Wald test and the area under the receiver operating curves. These findings propose a modelling framework to generate relevant information for the Air Traffic Management relevant in planning and measurement of airport operational efficiency.|$|E
