50|$|Crichtons novel {{revolves}} around Malcolms {{team and a}} rival team led by InGens corporate rival, Biosyn, which was written out of the film adaptation in favor of two competing InGen teams. Several characters from the novel {{were excluded from the}} film adaptation, including Lewis Dodgson, the leader of the Biosyn team; and <b>field</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>engineer</b> Doc Thorne, whose characteristics were partially implemented into the films version of Eddie. Spielberg regretted excluding a scene from the script that would have depicted characters on motorcycles attempting to flee velociraptors, similar to a sequence in the novel. An alternate version of the scene was later added into the 2015 film, Jurassic World.|$|R

50|$|In April 1997, Canada's Primary Reserve reorganized into ten brigade {{groups and}} in November 1997, the first reserve combat {{engineer}} regiment {{was created by}} converting an armoured reconnaissance regiment. A number of years later the three <b>field</b> <b>engineer</b> regiments, and seven independent <b>field</b> <b>engineer</b> squadrons were reorganized into combat engineer regiments.

50|$|VIU-55 Munja (en: Lightning) is {{a combat}} {{engineering}} vehicle produced by Serbia. VTI {{has done the}} conceptual design of the Munja general-purpose engineer vehicle and the Čačak-based Overhaul Depot has built the vehicle. The main idea was converting the T-55 tank, using its main structure and subsystems and adding new components, equipment and devices to create a vehicle for entirely different purposes. Good terrain negotiating ability and ballistic protection of T-55 tank were retained, while <b>engineer</b> <b>equipment</b> and armament were refitted. It is the first armoured vehicle for the engineer corps outfitted with special purpose <b>engineer</b> <b>equipment</b> and respectable armament, belonging to the most modern designs of this kind. It is designed to negotiate natural and man-made obstacles, blocking, fortifying and repair of roads and for safe transport of <b>engineer</b> teams and <b>equipment</b> in combat conditions. VTI designers have thoughtfully arranged accommodation for 8 members of the crew (2 permanent members - driver and deputy commander, also gunner of the 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and 7.62 mm machine gun, and a 6-member troop - commander and section of five pioneers). Space is also provided for sets of <b>engineer</b> <b>equipment,</b> for mounting of commander’s and gunner’s cupola and associated equipment.|$|R
