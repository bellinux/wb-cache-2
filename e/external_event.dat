25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an <b>external</b> <b>event</b> follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

He also said Kursk was designed with two autonomous, independent control systems that would have detected a rise in temperature while the torpedo was stored on the racks. The sub was equipped with a special drain system that could rapidly drain hydrogen peroxide fuel from a torpedo into the sea. If a temperature rise was detected in the torpedo tube, the torpedo would have automatically been ejected into the sea. In addition, any fire in the torpedo compartment would have triggered a powerful fire-extinguishing system that would have dumped [...] "tons of water" [...] on the fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the impact of <b>external</b> <b>events</b> on the development of patient advocacy organizations in Hong Kong. I use the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) to explore: (1) the relationship between <b>external</b> <b>events</b> and policy change; (2) the roles and responses of patient advocates towards external events; (3) the changes in resources and strategies of patient advocates following external events; (4) the causal mechanism between <b>external</b> <b>events</b> and policy change. The ACF suggests that <b>external</b> <b>events</b> is one of the factors to explain policy change in the policy making process. However, the framework has not clearly specified the causal mechanism between <b>external</b> <b>events</b> and policy change. It mainly suggests the critical role of minority policy actors in mobilizing resources to advance their belief following <b>external</b> <b>events</b> which may lead to policy change. By analyzing policy responses of patient advocacy organizations to a series of <b>external</b> <b>events</b> between the 1990 s and the present, this study attempts to explore how <b>external</b> <b>events</b> may influence the occurrence of policy change, contributing to this theoretical gap in the ACF. The target of this study includes three patient advocacy organizations, namely Community Rehabilitation Network (CRN), Hong Kong Alliance for Patients’ Organizations (HKAPO), Braincare. Qualitative research method was used. Around twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with leaders and staff of the patient advocacy organizations and professionals who had worked with them. Findings reveal that the origins and development of these patient advocacy organizations were closely tied to the occurrence of <b>external</b> <b>events.</b> The <b>external</b> <b>events</b> mainly related to the governmental policy initiatives in the healthcare and welfare spectrum and the SARS outbreak. In these three organizations, the mobilization of skillful leadership is critical for their formation and policy advocacy, particularly with the role of social work professionals. In their formation stage, these patient advocacy organizations did make use of <b>external</b> <b>events</b> to advance their belief on policy change. When time elapsed, contrary to the ACF assumptions, empirical evidence is found to demonstrate how <b>external</b> <b>events</b> had gradually transformed their original belief on patient advocacy and thus their roles in the policy making process. It was found that CRN has changed from a patient advocacy in the 1990 s to a service provider in the primary care sector from 2000 s onwards; HKAPO shifted its role as a patient advocate to a health policy decision-making stakeholder; Braincare enlarged its mission on patient education into policy advocacy for patients of brain injury. The allocation of resources, specifically, the behavior orientations on seeking resources were critical factors that explained these changes. It is argued that the resource-seeking behavior is the intervening variable between <b>external</b> <b>events</b> and policy change. Through the experiences of these three organizations, the importance of <b>external</b> <b>events</b> do not lay on its role in redistributing their resources, instead, it gradually shaped their beliefs on policy advocacy which affects the path of policy change. published_or_final_versionSocial Work and Social AdministrationMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

6000|$|It {{happened}} {{that the very}} vividness of his impressions had often made him the more enigmatic to his friends, and had contributed to an apparent indefiniteness in his sentiments. His early-wakened sensibility and reflectiveness had developed into a many-sided sympathy, which threatened to hinder any persistent course of action: {{as soon as he}} took up any antagonism, though only in thought, he seemed to himself like the Sabine warriors in the memorable story--with nothing to meet his spear but flesh of his flesh, and objects that he loved. His imagination had so wrought itself to the habit of seeing things as they probably appeared to others, that a strong partisanship, unless it were against an immediate oppression, had become an insincerity for him. His plenteous, flexible sympathy had ended by falling into one current with that reflective analysis which tends to neutralize sympathy. Few men were able to keep themselves clearer of vices than he; yet he hated vices mildly, being used to think of them less in the abstract than as a part of mixed human natures having an individual history, which it was the bent of his mind to trace with understanding and pity. With the same innate balance he was fervidly democratic in his feeling for the multitude, and yet, through his affections and imagination, intensely conservative; voracious of speculations on government and religion, yet loth to part with long-sanctioned forms which, for him, were quick with memories and sentiments that no argument could lay dead. We fall on the leaning side; and Deronda suspected himself of loving too well the losing causes of the world. Martyrdom changes sides, and he was in danger of changing with it, having a strong repugnance to taking up that clue of success which the order of the world often forces upon us and makes it treason against the common weal to reject. And yet his fear of falling into an unreasoning narrow hatred made a check for him: he apologized for the heirs of privilege; he shrank with dislike from the loser's bitterness and the denunciatory tone of the unaccepted innovator. A too reflective and diffusive sympathy was in danger of paralyzing in him that indignation against wrong and that selectness of fellowship which are the conditions of moral force; and {{in the last few years}} of confirmed manhood he had become so keenly aware of this that what he most longed for was either some <b>external</b> <b>event,</b> or some inward light, that would urge him into a definite line of action, and compress his wandering energy. He was ceasing to care for knowledge--he had no ambition for practice--unless they could both be gathered up into one current with his emotions; and he dreaded, as if it were a dwelling-place of lost souls, that dead anatomy of culture which turns the universe into a mere ceaseless answer to queries, and knows, not everything, but everything else about everything--as if one should be ignorant of nothing concerning the scent of violets except the scent itself for which one had no nostril. But how and whence was the needed event to come?--the influence that would justify partiality, and make him what he longed to be, yet was unable to make himself--an organic part of social life, instead of roaming in it like a yearning disembodied spirit, stirred with a vague social passion, but without fixed local habitation to render fellowship real? To make a little difference for the better was what he was not contented to live without; but how to make it? It is one thing to see your road, another to cut it. He found some of the fault in his birth and the way he had been brought up, which had laid no special demands on him and had given him no fixed relationship except one of a doubtful kind; but he did not attempt to hide from himself that he had fallen into a meditative numbness, and was gliding farther and farther from that life of practically energetic sentiment which he would have proclaimed (if he had been inclined to proclaim anything) to be the best of all life, and for himself the only way worth living. He wanted some way of keeping emotion and its progeny of sentiments--which make the savors of life--substantial and strong in the face of a reflectiveness that threatened to nullify all differences. To pound the objects of sentiment into small dust, yet keep sentiment alive and active, was something like the famous recipe for making cannon--to first take a round hole and then enclose it with iron; whatever you do keeping fast hold of your round hole. Yet how distinguish what our will may wisely save in its completeness, from the heaping of cat-mummies and the expensive cult of enshrined putrefactions? ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{mainframe}} {{applications are}} naturally synchronous processes, {{the operating system}} itself is naturally asynchronous, although the system also supports many processes which are naturally synchronous. When an application requests a system service which is naturally asynchronous, such as input/output processing, a mechanism for synchronizing the application and the operating system must be employed. This essential mechanism is through functions which are built into the operating system, or are specifically supported by it, including: WAIT (temporarily halt application processing until an <b>external</b> <b>event</b> has occurred); POST (indicate occurrence of an <b>external</b> <b>event</b> so application processing may continue); and SYNCH (change system processing modes (supervisor to user), while preserving system integrity, and synchronously perform a function {{on behalf of the}} application, after which application processing may continue).|$|E
