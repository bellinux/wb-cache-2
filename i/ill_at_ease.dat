5|$|A {{member of}} the Romanov dynasty, she was the {{daughter}} of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. She spent her childhood in Saint Petersburg, Poland and the Crimea, and married King George I of Greece in 1867 at the age of sixteen. At first, she felt <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> in the Kingdom of Greece, but she quickly became involved in social and charitable work. She founded hospitals and help centers, but her attempt to promote a new, more accessible, Greek translation of the Gospels sparked riots by religious conservatives.|$|E
25|$|On 8 August 1792, <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> {{and shocked}} by the course of events, Vaublanc {{delivered}} a speech before the Assembly, in which he defended, vigorously, and courageously, against the lively opposition of the Jacobins who dominated the Assembly and {{of the man in}} the street, General La Fayette, who stood accused of violating the Constitution. He later claimed to have succeeded (with the help of Quatremère de Quincy) in rallying 200 undecided deputies to his position. La Fayette was acquitted, by 406 votes out of 630.|$|E
60|$|So {{having no}} choice Leo mounted the throne, where {{notwithstanding}} his splendid presence, enhanced {{as it was}} by those glittering robes, he looked <b>ill</b> enough <b>at</b> <b>ease,</b> as indeed must any man of his faith and race. Happily however, if some act of semi-idolatrous homage had been proposed, Ayesha found a means to prevent its celebration, and soon all such matters were forgotten both by the singers who sang, and us who listened to the majestic chant that followed.|$|R
6000|$|Cyril, whose {{conscience}} was <b>ill</b> enough <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> that morning, felt abashed before Raphael's dry {{and quiet}} manner, which bespoke, as he well knew, reproof {{more severe than}} all open upbraidings. So looking down, not without something like a blush, he ran his eye hastily over the paper; and then said, in his blandest tone-- 'My brother will forgive me for remarking, that while I acknowledge his perfect right to dispose of his charities as he will, it is somewhat startling to me, as Metropolitan of Egypt to find not only the Abbot Isidore of Pelusium, but the secular Defender of the Plebs, a civil officer, implicated, too, in the late conspiracy, associated with me as co-trustees.' ...|$|R

Even if it should so insist, would [...] it not be arrested by the confusion of tongues, which is already [...] only too perceptible and too inconvenient in natural history? [...] Besides, it is utility that circumscribes all. It will be utility [...] that in a few centuries will set bounds to experimental physics, as [...] it is on the eve of setting bounds to geometry. I grant centuries [...] to this study, because the sphere of its utility is infinitely more [...] extensive than that of any abstract science, and it is without [...] contradiction the base of our real knowledge."[212] ...|$|R
25|$|Helene was a pious, quiet young woman, {{and she and}} Franz Joseph felt <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> in each other's company, but he was {{instantly}} infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but defied his mother and informed her {{that if he could}} not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in Vienna at the Augustinerkirche on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a dower equal to today's 240,000 USD.|$|E
25|$|Some saw The Old Gold Comedy Theater {{as being}} a lighter version of Lux Radio Theater, and it {{featured}} some of the best-known film and radio personalities of the day, including Fred Allen, June Allyson, Lucille Ball, Ralph Bellamy, Linda Darnell, Susan Hayward, Herbert Marshall, Dick Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Jane Wyman, and Alan Young. But the show's half-hour format—which meant the material might have been truncated too severely—and Lloyd's sounding somewhat <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> on the air {{for much of the}} season (though he spent weeks training himself to speak on radio prior to the show's premiere, and seemed more relaxed {{toward the end of the}} series run) may have worked against it.|$|E
25|$|The {{negotiations}} dragged on, and Colonel Zorbas {{lacked the}} political skills {{to keep up}} with the seasoned veterans on the government side. Mavromichalis, in securing passage of a large number of mildly reformist bills, implemented part of the programme demanded by the Military League, this time under threat of an actual military takeover. Thus, the general staff was reorganised and those close to Constantine (such as Ioannis Metaxas) were removed while budget cuts were made in order to finance army modernisation. But his government clearly showed that the old system endured: only Finance Minister Athanasios Eftaxias had reformist ideas. With the revolution running out of steam, the League began to crumble. It was not a real political movement: its ideology and programme lacked coherence; its leaders were popular but unskilled. They were above all soldiers <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> outside their barracks. The League had known how to link its corporatist demands to public discontent by using populist and nationalist slogans, but it unsettled the bourgeoisie. Although it saw the necessity of modernising the country, the middle classes feared the drift towards a military dictatorship, considered deleterious to the normal progress of affairs.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sir Matthew Hope {{told me so}} as plainly as was proper," [...] she said; [...] "standing there, {{near the}} fire, before dinner. He makes himself very agreeable, the great doctor. I don't mean his saying that has {{anything}} to do with it. But he says such things with great tact. I had told him I felt <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> my <b>ease,</b> staying here <b>at</b> such a time; it seemed to me so indiscreet--it wasn't as if I could nurse. 'You must remain, you must remain,' he answered; 'your office will come later.' Wasn't that a very delicate way of saying both that poor Mr. Touchett would go and that I might be of some use as a consoler? In fact, however, I shall not be of the slightest use. Your aunt will console herself; she, and she alone, knows just how much consolation she'll require. It would be a very delicate matter for another person to undertake to administer the dose. With your cousin it will be different; he'll miss his father immensely. But I should never presume to condole with Mr. Ralph; we're not on those terms." [...] Madame Merle had alluded more than once to some undefined incongruity in her relations with Ralph Touchett; so Isabel took this occasion of asking her if they were not good friends.|$|R
500|$|Ranaut {{followed}} {{the success of}} Tanu Weds Manu by starring {{in a series of}} brief, glamorous roles in four other films of 2011: Game, Double Dhamaal, Rascals and Miley Naa Miley Hum. With the exception of Double Dhamaal, none of these films performed well. In a review for Rascals, the critic Gaurav Malani wrote: [...] "Kangana Ranaut is <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> in comedy. She struggles to hold her own and emerges as a bimbo in her act." [...] Ranaut later said that she did some of these films due to a dearth of film offers. The following year, Ranaut portrayed a supporting role opposite Ajay Devgn in Priyadarshan's action thriller Tezz, another box office flop.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Glancey {{referred}} to Crawford as [...] "a compelling if decidedly cantankerous anti-hero" [...] and an [...] "essentially Victorian eccentric". Hauser characterised him as [...] "a very British {{combination of a}} snob and a rebel", also noting that he was [...] "no great intellectual". Similarly, Clark expressed the view that [...] "Crawford's achievements" [...] stemmed from his [...] "moral integrity and singleness of mind" [...] rather than [...] "any outstanding intellectual brilliance". The journalist Neal Ascherson described Crawford as [...] "not conventionally intellectual". Ascherson added that Crawford was [...] "withdrawn, generally <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> {{with other members of}} the human species except on paper, and suspicious of personal celebrity", in this way contrasting Crawford with his [...] "gregarious" [...] contemporaries Wheeler and Daniel.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1987, in order to {{complete}} his college diploma, Lépine took three courses, obtaining good marks in all of them, and in February 1988, began a course in computer programming at a private college in downtown Montreal, funding his studies with government student loans. He moved into a downtown apartment with his old high school friend, and {{in the winter of}} 1989 took a CEGEP night-course in solution chemistry, a prerequisite course for the École Polytechnique. Lépine wanted a girlfriend, but was generally <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> around women. He tended to boss women around and show off his knowledge in front of them. He spoke out to men about his dislike of feminists, career women and women in traditionally male occupations, such as the police force, stating that women should remain in the home, caring for their families. Lépine applied again to the École Polytechnique in 1989; however his application was rejected as he lacked required courses. [...] In March 1989 he abandoned the course in computer programming, though he performed well in the CEGEP course, obtaining 100% in his final exam. In April 1989 he met with a university admissions officer, and complained about how women were taking over the job market from men.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the breakfast}} was over, the table on which it had been eaten, was {{converted}} into a rude altar, and the ceremony was commenced. Jacques Chapeau and Annot, whose turn was immediately to follow, stood close up to the table, opposite to their master and mistress; but Michael Stein and his two sons, who of course were to be present at Annot's marriage, and who had prepared to seat themselves on the stairs till their presence should be required, had also been invited to attend; and they now sat but very <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> their <b>ease,</b> on three chairs, in the very farthest corner of the room. Michael Stein, though chance had thrown him among the loyal Vendeans, had in his heart but little of that love and veneration for his immediate superiors, which was the strong and attractive point {{in the character of}} the people of Poitou. Though he had lived all his life in the now famous village of Echanbroignes, he had in his disposition, much of the stubborn self-dependence of the early republicans; and he did not relish his position, sitting in the background as a humble hanger-on in the family of a nobleman and an aristocrat. He was, however, unable to help himself; his sons were Vendeans; his daughter was just going to marry the confidential follower of the Vendean Commander-in-Chief; and he himself had been seen fighting for La Vendée: there he sat, therefore, quiet, though hardly happy, between his two stalwart sons, with his thin hair brushed over his forehead, and his huge swarthy hands crossed on his knees before him.|$|R

500|$|As Bacon's work {{moved from}} the extreme subject matter of his early {{paintings}} to portraits of friends in the mid-1960s, Dyer became a dominating presence in the artist's work. Bacon's treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject's physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender. More than any other of the artist's close friends portrayed during this period, Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies. The paintings gave him stature, a raison d'être, and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer's [...] "brief interlude between life and death". Many critics have cited Dyer's portraits as favourites, including Michel Leiris and Lawrence Gowling. Yet as Dyer's novelty diminished within Bacon's circle of sophisticated intellectuals, the younger man became increasingly bitter and <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease.</b> Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him, he did not pretend to understand or even like them. [...] "All that money an' I fink they're reely 'orrible", he observed with choked pride. He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism. Bacon's money allowed Dyer to attract hangers-on who would accompany him on massive benders around London's Soho. Withdrawn and reserved when sober, Dyer was insuppressible when drunk, and would often attempt to [...] "pull a Bacon" [...] by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle. Dyer's erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin—with his cronies, with Bacon, and with Bacon's friends. Most of Bacon's art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance—an intrusion {{into the world of}} high culture to which their Bacon belonged. Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent. By 1971, he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover.|$|E

That year she sang four performances of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice at Covent Garden, with Miriam Licette, under the baton of Sir Thomas Beecham. [...] According to The Times she was <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> on stage, and in the most famous number, [...] "Che farò", her [...] "attempt to sing it dramatically made her play {{fast and loose with}} the time and spoil the phrasing". It was her only appearance on the professional operatic stage.|$|E
2500|$|Parizeau {{resigned}} {{and was replaced}} by Bouchard. The sovereigntist option was pushed aside until they could establish [...] "winning conditions". Bouchard was suspected by hard-line sovereigntists as having a weak commitment to Quebec independence. Bouchard, in turn, was <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with the ardent nationalism of some elements in the Parti Québécois. He eventually resigned over alleged instances of anti-Semitism within the hard-line wing of the party, {{and was replaced by}} Bernard Landry. Tensions between the left wing of the party and the relatively fiscal conservative party executive under Bouchard and Landry also {{led to the formation of}} the Union des forces progressistes, another social-democratic sovereigntist party that later merged with other left-wing groups to form Québec solidaire.|$|E

He {{took part in the}} Oxford disputes against Cranmer, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley; but he was <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with the brutality of some measures put in force against the Church of England. Feckenham employed his influence with Mary [...] "to procure pardon of the faults or mitigation of the punishment for poor Protestants". He was sent by the Queen to prepare Lady Jane Grey for death and when the future Elizabeth I of England was sent to the Tower on 18 March 1554, Feckenham interceded for her life and liberty, even at the cost of displeasing the queen.|$|E

Additionally, Smochină described the 1941 Odessa massacre, ordered by Antonescu in retaliation for a supposed Jewish plot against the Romanian command, as a grave error on the Romanians' part: as he noted, both he and Pântea had been informed that the building supposedly bombed by Jewish activists had in fact been mined by the retreating Soviets. Smochină also claimed that Ion Antonescu saw Hitler's war on the [...] "three occult forces" [...] (Jews, Freemasons and the Catholic Church) as a [...] "great mistake" [...] which could lose Germany the war.

2500|$|There {{are a few}} {{mentions}} {{of paintings}} and their location in sources from the decades after his death. [...] Vasari's Life is relatively short and, especially in {{the first edition of}} 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers [...] "he is clearly <b>ill</b> <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> with Sandro and {{did not know how to}} fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from Cimabue to Michelangelo". [...] Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with Francesco Botticini, another Florentine painter of the day. [...] Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day. [...] Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation. [...] He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli.|$|E
