40|$|Two recent studies, from France (Nataf et al., 200614. Nataf, R., Skorupka, C., Amet, L., Lam, A., Springbett, A. and Lathe, R. 2006. Porphyrinuria in {{childhood}} autistic disorder: Implications for environmental toxicity. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 214 : 99 – 108. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®] View all references) and the United States (Geier & Geier, 20079. Geier, D. A. and Geier, M. R. 2007. A prospective study of mercury toxicity biomarkers in autistic spectrum disorders. <b>J.</b> <b>Toxicol.</b> <b>Environ.</b> Health, A, 70 : 1723 – 1730. [Taylor & Francis Online], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®] View all references), identified atypical urinary porphyrin profiles {{in children with}} an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These profiles serve as an indirect measure of environmental toxicity generally, and mercury (Hg) toxicity specifically, with the latter being a variable proposed as a causal mechanism of ASD (Bernard et al., 20012. Bernard, S., Enayati, A., Redwood, L., Roger, H. and Binstock, T. 2001. Autism: A novel form of mercury poisoning. Med. Hypoth., 56 : 462 – 471.

Neuroendocrinol. Lett., 26 : 439 – 446. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®] View all references). To examine whether this phenomenon occurred {{in a sample of}} Australian children with ASD, an analysis of urinary porphyrin profiles was conducted. A consistent trend in abnormal porphyrin levels was evidenced when data was compared with those previously reported in the literature. The results are suggestive of environmental toxic exposure impairing heme synthesis. Three independent studies from three continents have now demonstrated that porphyrinuria is concomitant with ASD, and that Hg may be a likely xenobiotic to produce porphyrin profiles of this nature...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{xenobiotics}} of most concern {{currently under}} discussion by regulators and treatment experts is N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). NDMA is a carcinogen known to induce cancer {{in a variety}} of animals, causing DNA damage at low doses. Human exposure occurs through cigarettes, food, personal care products, and drinking water, in addition to endogenous formation in the stomach. NDMA is produced when water containing precursors is treated (in particular during disinfection or advanced oxidation) and recycled water contains a significant amount of precursors. The topic is becoming increasingly relevant as recycled water is considered as a source of potable water, directly or indirectly. The daily tolerable limit for intake has been identified to be 4. 0 – 9. 3 ng/(kg day) [D. J. Fitzgerald, N. I. Robinson, Development of a tolerable daily intake for N-nitrosodimethylamine using a modified benchmark dose methodology, <b>J.</b> <b>Toxicol.</b> <b>Environ.</b> Health A 70 (2007) 1670 – 1678. ]. Water at the WHO proposed guideline value of 100 ng/L would contribute about 2. 9 ng/(kg day) of this intake, while intake from food varies from 5. 7 to 44. 2 ng/(kg day). Smoking and the workplace are additional exposure routes. This outlines that the exposure is often higher than tolerable limits. In the food and drinks industry, this has in recent decades resulted in improved manufacturing processes. Awareness of the presence of NDMA in drinking water is a relatively recent issue. NDMA stems from precursors in raw water and can be generated during treatment. Generally removal of precursors is more achievable than the removal of NDMA itself. For example, the potent NDMA precursor dimethylamine is rapidly removed in biological pretreatment, while many other precursor amines are more persistent. These precursor amines include some ion exchange resins and coagulants, used in water treatment processes, which have been shown to generate NDMA during chlorination. Ozonation has also been shown to produce NDMA in treatment. UV oxidation is the preferred method for removal of NDMA in water treatment, although reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are possible alternatives if effective retention can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{composting}} sites in Europe is rapidly increasing, due to {{efforts to reduce}} the fraction of waste destined for landfill, but evidence on possible health impacts is limited. This article systematically reviews studies related to bioaerosol exposures within and near composting facilities and associated health effects in both community and occupational health settings. Six electronic databases and bibliographies from January 1960 to July 2014 were searched for studies reporting on health outcomes and/or bioaerosol emissions related to composting sites. Risk of bias was assessed using a customized score. Five hundred and thirty-six papers were identified and reviewed, and 66 articles met the inclusion criteria (48 exposure studies, 9 health studies, 9 health and exposure studies). Exposure information was limited, with most measurements taken in occupational settings and for limited time periods. Bioaerosol concentrations were highest on-site during agitation activities (turning, shredding, and screening). Six studies detected concentrations of either Aspergillus fumigatus or total bacteria above the English Environment Agency’s recommended threshold levels beyond 250 m from the site. Occupational studies of compost workers suggested elevated risks of respiratory illnesses with higher bioaerosol exposures. Elevated airway irritation was reported in residents near composting sites, but {{this may have been}} affected by reporting bias. The evidence base on health effects of bioaerosol emissions from composting facilities is still limited, although there is sufficient evidence to support a precautionary approach for regulatory purposes. While data to date are suggestive of possible respiratory effects, further study is needed to confirm this and to explore other health outcomes. Waste management policy is rapidly evolving, largely because European countries are running out of space for landfill sites. Further, poor waste management contributes to climate change and threatens environmental sustainability. It is estimated that each tonne of food waste diverted from landfill to composting reduces greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 0. 4 to 0. 7 tonnes of carbon dioxide (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA], 2011 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. 2011. Government Review of Waste Policy in England 2011 : Action Plan 2011. [URL] (accessed January 8, 2015). [Google Scholar]). Responding to the urgent need to improve waste management, the European Commission set tighter standards on Biodegradable Municipal Waste (BMW) destined for landfill (Council Directive, 1999 Council Directive. 1999. Council Directive 1999 / 31 /EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste. The Council of the European Union. [URL] (accessed January 8, 2015). [Google Scholar]). Under the proposal, targets were set to recycle (including composting) at least 33 % of household waste by 2015. During the last decade there has been a {{rise in the number of}} large-scale composting facilities, as well as the introduction of a wide range of more advanced composting technologies. The majority of composting in the United Kingdom is completed in open windrows, and in 2007 approximately 90 % of the total composting in the United Kingdom was undertaken using this method (Sykes et al., 2007 Sykes, P., K. Jones, and J. D. Wildsmith. 2007. Managing the potential public health risks from bioaerosol liberation at commercial composting sites in the UK: An analysis of the evidence base. Resources Conserv. Recycling 52 : 410 – 424. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]). As material is in the open air, the process generates substantial potential emissions and exposures. Newer indoor facilities known as in-vessel composting facilities (IVC) still have some open-air processes, usually as part of the final maturation phase (Smith et al., 2009 Smith, R., E. J. Gilbert, and R. Pocock. 2009. Composting and biological treatment survey/final report. In Market survey of the UK organics and recycling industry— 2007 / 08. Wellingborough, Northamptonshire: The Association for Organics Recycling. Available from [URL] (accessed January 8, 2015). [Google Scholar]). Composting yields significant concentrations of bioaerosols (Wheeler et al., 2001 Wheeler, P. A., I. Stewart, P. Dumitrean, and B. Donovan. 2001. Health effects of composting—A study of three composting sites and review of past data. In RandD Technical Report. Bristol, UK: Environment Agency. [URL] (accessed January 8, 2015).

Bioaerosol releases from compost facilities: Evaluating passive and active source terms at a green waste facility for improved risk assessments. Atmos. Environ. 40 : 1159 – 1169. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]). Bioaerosols are airborne biological particles, microbial fragments and constituents of cells, which may be viable or nonviable, and consist of fungi, bacteria, pollen, and fragments, constituents, particulate matter (PM 10), and by-products of cells (Douwes et al., 2003 Douwes, J., P.

A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) report in 2003 highlighted some studies where site workers demonstrated adverse health effects from occupational exposure to bioaerosols produced during composting (Swan et al., 2003 Swan, J. R. M., A. Kelsey, B. Crook, and E. J. Gilbert. 2003. Occupational and environmental exposure to bioaerosols from composts and potential health effects—A critical review of published data. Health and Safety Executive. [URL] (accessed January 8, 2015). [Google Scholar]). Further, there is increasing public concern regarding potential health impacts within communities surrounding the sites (Clapham, 2008 Clapham, M. 2008. Parliamentary Early Day Motion 269. Windrow composting. [URL] (accessed January 8, 2015). [Google Scholar]; Gray, 2009 Gray, R. 2009. Health fears over council composting schemes. The Daily Telegraph, June 27.

Although the etiology of pulmonary fibrosis is generally unknown, several sources of evidence support the hypothesis that a number of environmental and occupational agents play an etiologic role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The agents discussed in this review include beryllium, nylon flock, textile printing aerosols, polyvinyl chloride and didecyldimethylammonium chloride. The authors also describe a variety of animal models, including genetically modified mice, in order to investigate the molecular mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis, focusing on chemokine receptors, regulatory T cells and transforming growth factor-b and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Overall, we propose the concept of toxicological pulmonary fibrosis as a lung disease induced in response to environmental cues.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed {{that most of the}} tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and CD 34 but negative for podoplanin. In addition, electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of Weibel-Palade bodies in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Based on these findings, this case was diagnosed as a hemangiosarcoma. The splenic masses were larger than the hepatic ones, with tumor cells mainly observed at periportal regions with tumor embolism in the liver, suggesting that primary hemangiosarcoma initially developed in the spleen before metastasizing.

Further accumulation of novel TGx biomarkers {{will lead to more}} efficient, appropriate and cost effective drug risk assessment, reinforcing the paradigm of the conventional toxicology system with a more profound understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity. In this paper, we overview some practical strategies as well as obstacles for identifying and utilizing TGx biomarkers based on microarray analysis. Since clinical hepatotoxicity {{is one of the major}} causes of drug development attrition, the liver has been the best documented target organ for TGx studies to date, and we therefore focused on information from liver TGx studies. In this review, we summarize the current resources in the literature in regard to TGx studies of the liver, from which toxicologists could extract potential TGx biomarker gene sets for better hepatotoxicity risk assessment.

Hematological examination revealed marked lymphocytosis without distinct atypia. Macroscopically, hepatosplenomegaly and partial atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord were observed. Microscopically, neoplastic cells infiltrated into the liver, splenic red pulp, bone marrow and epidural space of the thoracic spinal cord, while no neoplastic cells were observed in the thymus and lymph nodes. Moreover, the spinal cord showed focal degeneration due to compression by marked infiltration of neoplastic cells in the subdural space. The neoplastic cells were generally small-sized round cells that had a round nucleus with/without a single nucleolus and scanty cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for CD 3 and CD 8 and negative for CD 79 α. Judging from these results, the present tumor in this young adult rat was diagnosed as malignant T-cell lymphoma.

40|$|Abstract: Feline {{gastrointestinal}} eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia {{was diagnosed}} in an 8 -month-old Scottish fold {{that had a}} primary gastrointestinal mass involving the stomach, duodenum and mesenteric lymph nodes. Histopathologically, the most characteristic feature of this mass was granulation tissue with eosinophil infiltration and hyperplasia of sclerosing collagen fiber. Immunohistochemi-cally, large spindle-shaped cells were positive for smooth muscle actin and vimentin. This case {{emphasizes the importance of}} feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia as a differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal neoplastic lesions such as osteosar-coma and mast cell tumor in cats.

40|$|Abstract: In {{various kinds}} of glomerulonephritis, {{alteration}} of anionic charge on {{the glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) and podocytes has been controversial for more than decade. To elucidate the relation between glomerular protein leakage and anionic sites on the glomerular wall, we examined the distribution of anionic sites on the GBM and podocytes of rats with active Heymann nephritis (AHN). Urinalysis for protein levels was conducted, and the kidneys were examined using electron microscopic cytochemistry for the assessment of anionic charge with two cationic probes. The anionic sites on podocytes were decreased in number in the AHN rats; however, the distributions of anionic sites on the GBM were similar in density to those seen in the control animals. From these results, we consider that the decrease in anionic charge density on podocytes might be attributable to protein leakage and that the charge barrier of the GBM is irrelevant to the protein leakage in AHN rats.

40|$|Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a {{bioactive}} mediator and induces several biological effects, including cell proliferation, migration, morphogenesis and differentiation. LPA {{interacts with}} at least six G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including LPA receptor- 1 (LPA 1), LPA 2, LPA 3, LPA 4, LPA 5 and LPA 6. These receptors show different biological functions through the binding of LPA, {{depending on the type}} of cells. In human malignancies, a high level of LPA production was found in plasma and ascites in ovarian cancer cases. Moreover, aberrant expression levels of LPA receptor genes were detected in some cancer cells. Therefore, it is suggested that LPA receptors may be involved in the pathogenesis of tumor cells as well as LPA per se. Recently, we have reported that alterations of LPA receptor genes also occur in rodent tumors. In this review, we summarize the recent evidence in the investigations of LPA receptor alterations in rodent tumors by experimental models.

40|$|Abstract: This report {{describes}} a spontaneous nephroblastoma with lung metastasis in a 10 -week-old male Crl:CD(SD) rat. Macro-scopically, a white {{mass in the}} kidney and two white masses in the lung were observed. Histopathologically, the renal mass was located in the cortex of a kidney, and it caused pressure on the surrounding renal parenchyma. Three components could be distinguished in the tumor: blastemal, epithelial (primitive glomerular/tubular structures) and mesenchymal (neoplastic connective tissues) elements. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for Wilms tumor 1 protein (WT 1) and vimentin. Metastasis {{was found in the}} lung. Thus, the case was diagnosed as a nephroblastoma with lung metastasis.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{cases of}} {{spontaneous}} focal hepatic hyperplasia {{were observed in}} young female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Grossly, a single raised nodule was observed in the left hepatic lobe. Histopathologically, the nodule compressed surrounding normal tissue; however, the hepatic cords within the nodule continued {{to those in the}} normal area except in part. Extensive fibrosis and absence of a normal hepatic triad were observed in the nodule. Thin fibrous septa radiating from the dense central stellate scarring and distended vessels were apparent in one animal. Hepatocytes in the nodule lacked cellular atypia, showed frequent PAS-positive eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm and showed higher positive ratios for PCNA. The present cases resembled focal nodular hyperplasia reported in humans and a chimpanzee.

Six-week-old male and female F 344 /DuCrj rats were fed a diet containing up to 2. 0 % PHT for 13 weeks. Microscopical findings including irregular dilation of the distal tubule lumen, foreign body giant cells, inflammatory cell infiltration, and regeneration of renal tubules were observed focally or multifocally in the renal cortex and/or medulla in the 0. 5 % and higher dos-age groups of both sexes. The severity of these lesions increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the urinalysis, an increase in protein and white blood cells or the concentration of tartaric acid was detected in the 0. 5 % PHT and higher dosage groups of both sexes or males, respectively, though conventional blood biochemical analysis did not indicate failure of renal function. These {{results indicate that the}} PHT induces obstructive nephropathy in rats. There were no other treatment-related changes in other organs.

This report describes the histopathological characteristics of emphysematous cystitis found in a diabetic female beagle induced by streptozotocin and alloxan. Macroscopically, multiple cyst-like structures were observed on the cut surface of the urinary mucosa. During fixation, small specimens cut from the mucosa floated {{on the surface of}} the fixative solution. Histopathologically, multiple cysts were lined with a single layer of flattened cells found to be immunohistochemically positive for vimentin, partially positive for α-smooth muscle actin or macrophage scavenger receptor, class A, and thought to be myofibroblasts, fibroblasts or macrophages. Multinucleated giant cells were observed around the cysts, and gram-negative short bacilli were observed in the lumen of the urinary bladder. From these findings, this case was diagnosed as emphysematous cystitis.

However, the data are confounded by numerous cosegregating variables. To cast further light on the relationships between alcohol intake and colon cancer development, 21 -day-old male F 344 /DuCrj rats were fed 200 ppm 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in their diet for 8 weeks and doses of 0, 0. 1, 0. 3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 % of ethanol in their drinking water ad libitum for 16 weeks thereafter. The rats were sacrificed after 24 weeks of experiment, and aberrant crypt foci (ACF), surrogate lesions for colon cancer, were examined under a light microscope at low magnification. Ethanol was found not to affect the ACF formation at any dose compared with the initiated-controls. Furthermore, ethanol did not alter colon epithelial cell proliferation. These data, obtained by analysis of a colon cancer surrogate marker lesion, indicate that ethanol lacks promotion activity for MeIQx-initiated rat colon carcinogenesis.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{an urgent}} {{priority}} to establish in vivo bioassays for detection of hazards related to fine particles, {{which can be}} inhaled into deep lung tissue by humans. In order to establish an appropriate bioassay for detection of lung damage after particle inhalation, several experiments were performed in rats using quartz as a typical lung toxic particle. The results of pilot experiments suggest that Days 1 and 28 after intratracheal instillation of 2 mg of fine test particles in vehicle are most appropriate for detection of acute and subacute inflammatory changes, respectively. Furthermore, the BrdU incorporation on Day 1 and the iNOS level on Day 28 proved to be suitable end-point markers for this purpose. An examination of the toxicity {{of a series of}} particles was performed with the developed bioassay. Although some materials, including nanoparticles, demonstrated toxicity that was too strong for sensitive assessment, a ranking order could be clarified. The bioassay thus appears suitable for rapid hazard identification with a possible ranking of the toxicity of various particles at single concentrations.
