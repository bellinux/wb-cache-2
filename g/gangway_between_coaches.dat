50|$|Once {{communicating}} <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> <b>coaches</b> were introduced, a {{side corridor}} {{was provided to}} allow passengers and staff to {{walk up and down}} the train, while seated passengers in compartments were not disturbed, and thus the various types of side-corridor coaches were developed.|$|R
50|$|The {{trains are}} based on the DB Class 425 design, but made {{to meet the demands of}} the Sprinter. They use Jacobs bogie, which allow for thin and wide <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> each <b>coach.</b> The units were built in Aachen (2400) and Krefeld (2600).|$|R
50|$|The {{first batch}} of 15 were {{delivered}} between March and November 1975 and were numbered 2001 - 2015. These were {{delivered at the}} same time as the last batches of Plan V stock. These are 2 car units. These were to be used on the Zoetermeer Stadslijn and so did not feature first class, a toilet or a <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> each <b>coach.</b> 2014 and 2015 were built with different electric traction, but their trial was unsuccessful and so the units were stored for many years, until 2000 when they were fitted with Insulated-gate bipolar transistor.|$|R
5000|$|It {{involved}} {{replacing the}} existing retractable <b>gangways</b> and couplers <b>between</b> <b>coaches.</b> The cab ends both on Class 458 and on Class 460 driving vehicles were redesigned to {{be compatible with}} the [...] Desiro fleet. The [...] "Darth Vader" [...] nose cones were discarded. New Train Management System software was installed to improve reliability. Internal refurbishment included reconfiguring the seating layout to provide more standing room for passengers.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was completely renewed, with the partitions between each section is now made of glass. The ceiling is now gray and white, {{the floor is}} a dark gray with sparkly floors. The middle coach also gained extra doors, so that each coach has {{the same amount of}} doors. The traction system was also changed, so that the trains can accelerate faster. The conductor's room has also disappeared, allowing for more second class seats. The trains now have an automatic passenger information system, which announces the next station. Scrolling along the screen it shows all the stations called at as well as arrival times. The outside doors shut automatically if nobody has passed through them for a certain amount of time. On the outside of the train, the destination indicators also change, displaying their final destination and their next station. All sets also have new numbers, which are 100 more than previously e.g. 2936 was 2836. The livery also changed. The base colour is white, with blue and yellow. There is a blue bottom, then a yellow section, including yellow doors, then white with blue window surrounds and a blue roof and around the cab windows. This livery is known as vlaflip (after a type of two-tone pudding). In 2006 two Citypendel sets also went to Randers, {{to see if it was}} worthwhile to refurbish these also. It was decided they should and in 2007 the first set left for refurbishment and finished in 2009. These were renumbered with 110 added onto the original numbers e.g. 2001 is now 2111. These sets now have <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> <b>coaches</b> as well as a first class area. Energy usage was also reduced by 25% at this time.|$|R

50|$|Further {{alterations}} to {{the building}} were completed in 1967, when {{the southern end of}} the front portion of the building was extended by a single storey addition, and the <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> the 1913 and 1937 buildings was enlarged to incorporate additional offices and rooms.|$|R
25|$|From 1983-1984 {{the fleet}} was refurbished. Work {{involved}} replacing all compartments with open saloons, and the fitting of <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> vehicles within a unit. The first-class seating was also {{moved from the}} trailer to the non-brake driving trailer. During this period, units were renumbered under the TOPS system to 307101-307132.|$|R
60|$|While some of {{the party}} were busily engaged in {{sweeping}} out and arranging the huts, others shouldered their axes {{and went into the}} woods to cut down a few dead trees for firewood, and when the <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> the ship and the shore was completed the live stock was driven on shore.|$|R
50|$|The {{trains are}} {{designed}} for long-distance Intercity services. Their maximum speed is 160 km/h. Their cabs are on the roof, which initially allowed through <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> sets when coupled together, though the gangways were sealed during their refurbishment. Refurbishment of sets began in late 2006 and completed in 2011. The trains have compartments in the 1st class accommodation.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} Sulzer 8LV31 straight-eight engines placed {{side-by-side}} with a <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> them. This arrangement had been patented by Eugen Zbinden and Sulzer, patent US1632209 of 1927. Each engine delivered 750 hp (continuous rating) making {{a total of}} 1,500 hp. Electrical equipment was by Secheron of Geneva and total power of the traction motors was 1,200 hp.|$|R

Each train has open <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> carriages and an emergency evacuation ramp at each end. The length of each trainset is 128 metres, and their capacity is 1946 passengers, of which 306 are seated, a 25% increase from previous lines.|$|R

50|$|Bombardier Movia is {{a family}} of metro train built by Bombardier Transportation. The {{structure}} and body shell are fully customisable {{for the needs of}} each system that orders it. Unlike most traditional metro trains, they usually have full-width <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> carriages, allowing passengers to walk {{the entire length of the}} train. The design was developed by Adtranz which was acquired by Bombardier in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The first 30 7-carriage trains, {{known as}} the first series, were {{constructed}} in the United Kingdom by Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and delivered between 1956 and 1959. Another 30, the second series, were built by Martin & King in Melbourne, and delivered between 1961 and 1967. From 1966, these were delivered with end doors and <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> carriages, allowing passengers to change carriages.|$|R
5000|$|The Volvo B6BLE was {{presented}} in November 1998 {{as a replacement for}} the B6LE. Compared to the B6LE it had a new lower chassis frame with increased low floor area, independent front suspension giving more than 10 cm wider <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> the front wheel arches, and front end [...] "kneeling", giving a 25 cm entrance height. Like its predecessor, it continued to compete with the Dennis Dart SLF.|$|R
5000|$|From 1981-83, {{the units}} were refurbished, which {{included}} opening out compartments, fitting of <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> carriages, and moving first class seating from the intermediate trailer {{to one of}} the driving trailers, with the same problems as the Class 302 stock of having First class passengers sitting above the Westinghouse CM38 compressor, however the Gresley bogies being retained In this modified form, the technical description of the formation was BDTCOL+MBSO+TSOL+DTSO. Individual carriages were numbered as follows: ...|$|R

Martin Dockerill like a regular Beau Brummel in new white flannels, parading the deck, making eyes at pretty Greaser girls. It's good to be going.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{design of}} the MF 01 {{was the result of}} a design competition, and the winning design is similar to the MP 89. The interior also looks similar to MP 89's interior, carrying on features like interconnecting <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> cars, but with new security features added. The trains are the first rolling stock on the Paris Metro to include air-conditioning. Additionally, the MF 2000 consumes 30% less energy than its older counterparts due to innovations in traction and braking systems.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composite}} coach was a standard coach design {{going back to}} the early days of railways, enabling a railway company to provide multi-class passenger accommodation in a single vehicle and so reduce costs. In the book [...] "Red For Danger" [...] by L.T.C Rolt it is mentioned that the train which came to grief at Wigan on the night of 2 August 1873 featured a Caledonian Railway {{composite coach}}. Early composite coaches did not feature corridors or <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> the vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Another {{new feature}} of the MP 89 is the {{interconnecting}} <b>gangways</b> in <b>between</b> cars, which was achieved with the prototype BOA and later the MF 88. This is described further in the next section, because the type of <b>gangway</b> equipped differs <b>between</b> the CC and CA versions. The gangways were subsequently improved and equipped the later MF 2000 and MP 05 stock trains. (from :fr:MP 89).|$|R
25|$|The Duplex {{was built}} to {{increase}} TGV capacity without increasing train length {{or the number of}} trains. Each carriage has two levels, with access doors at the lower level taking advantage of low French platforms. A staircase gives access to the upper level, where the <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> carriages is located. There are 512 seats per set. On busy routes such as Paris-Marseille they are operated in pairs, providing 1,024 seats in two Duplex sets or 800 in a Duplex set plus a Reseau set. Each set has a wheelchair accessible compartment.|$|R
50|$|The K94EB, K114EB and K124EB {{were the}} only 4-series chassis with {{independent}} front suspension, being the primary choice for premium coaches. They were available as two-axle (4x2), tri-axle (6x2) and tri-axle with steered tag axle (6x2*4). A normal tri-axle coach would have the full designation of K124EB6x2NI, {{but because of the}} independent front suspension it was also available as K124EB6x2LI with low front, which made it possible to have a <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> the front wheel arches and a low driving position, making it suitable for use in double-decker coaches.|$|R
50|$|The trains had a saloon seating layout, {{divided into}} smaller {{sections}} by full height partitions. They {{were provided with}} either two or three sets of hand operated dual sliding doors per carriage side. Later sets were fitted with power doors. Interiors were split into smoking and no-smoking compartments until late 1978, with the abolition of smoking on trains, and carriages were designated as First or Second class until 1958, when one class travel was introduced. The trains were initially delivered without end <b>gangways</b> <b>between</b> carriages, this being a later addition.|$|R
50|$|During two car operations, {{passengers}} cannot walk-through {{the other}} carriage {{as there is}} no <b>gangway</b> in <b>between.</b> The only way is to alight from one car and board the other.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, cab {{cars are}} control cars similar to regular {{passenger}} car, {{but with a}} full driver's compartment built into one or both ends. They can be very similar to regular rail cars, {{to the point of}} including a <b>gangway</b> <b>between</b> cars so that they could be used {{in the middle of a}} passenger train like a regular car if necessary. European railways have used such equipment since the 1920s. In the United States they appeared for the first time in the 1960s. In the United Kingdom, driving trailers may have one or two driving cabs.|$|R
