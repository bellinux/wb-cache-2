25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E
2500|$|One {{apparent}} {{advantage of}} the cable car is its relative energy efficiency. This {{is due to the}} economy of centrally located power stations, and the ability of descending cars to transfer energy to ascending cars. [...] However, this advantage is totally negated by the relatively large energy consumption required to simply move the cable over and under the numerous <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> and around the many sheaves. [...] Approximately 95% of the tractive effort in the San Francisco system is expended in simply moving the four cables at 9.5 miles per hour. [...] Electric cars with regenerative braking do offer the advantages, without the problem of moving a cable. [...] In the case of steep grades, however, cable traction has the major advantage of not depending on adhesion between wheels and rails. [...] There is also the obvious advantage that keeping the car gripped to the cable will also limit the downhill speed to that of the cable.|$|E

Also, when a VHS-C cassette is inserted into the adapter, a small swing-arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard tape path distance between the <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> of a full-size tape. This allows the tape from the miniature cassette to use the same loading mechanism as that from the standard cassette.|$|E

5000|$|A {{new problem}} with {{chemical}} stability became notable in the mid-seventies when two significant tape manufacturers changed their dispersion formulations by introducing a polyurethane binder that, in time, turned hygroscopic and broke down as it absorbed water molecules {{into the long}} hydrocarbon molecular chains. The tape coatings became sticky and shed oxide onto all tape recorder parts in their path, including heads, <b>guides,</b> <b>rollers,</b> and capstans. This is commonly called sticky-shed syndrome. Although the problem was confined {{to two of the}} four major tape manufacturers (neither BASF nor 3M studio tapes suffer from the problem because neither manufacturer used the hygroscopic binder), the reputation of all magnetic tapes has been tainted by the defect.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} designs of draisine. However, certain {{fundamentals}} of railbike design must be adhered to, foremost {{among them the}} reconciliation of a bicycle's stability with adaptation to riding on a railway track: bicycles are kept upright by the rider steering {{in the direction of}} an impending fall, but this ability is sacrificed when the bicycle is constrained by rails. Simply adding flanged wheels to a conventional bicycle would make it impossible to balance, so the typical approach to stabilization is to add an outrigger, with roller(s), across to the second rail from near the bicycle’s rear wheel. Even such an outrigger system is not without its complications, as tracks that are no longer perfectly parallel — common on sections of abandoned track — can result in derailment. Additional <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> can help alleviate this problem at the expense of greater weight.|$|E

Here it turns vertically to the cloth beam. Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the warp beam empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the engraved block, a printing table and colour sieve are required. The table consists of a stout framework of wood or iron supporting a thick slab of stone varying in size according to the width of cloth to be printed.

In March 1998 this program was adapted to run on commercially available computers. Pre-programming on the computer can fulfill the functions originally assigned to the assistant technicians, thus requiring only a single assistant to control the sound [...] In notes for a 2002 performance also using a computerised system, Stockhausen acknowledged the IRCAM version, emphasising that it was done live, but nevertheless concluded that [...] "It will still be a long time until young musicians … will be able to learn the interpretation of SOLO with suitable mobile apparatuses" [...] Bass clarinetist Jason Alder performed [...] "Solo" [...] in June 2010 in Amsterdam, and subsequently in later concerts, in this way.
