40|$|Freshwater {{ecosystem}} degradation in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins is increasing due to rising human population numbers, and large water development projects. Therefore, monitoring ecosystem condition in these rivers of high biodiversity is of global conservation importance. This dissertation evaluated {{the potential of}} using river dolphins as indicators of ecosystem condition in large tropical rivers of South America.  First, population estimates of river dolphins were obtained by line-strip transect surveys and mark-recapture methods on photo-identifications. Using this information, I identified critical habitat, hotspots, and areas of concern for river dolphins, {{as well as the}} relationship between dolphin density and group size estimates with ecological features. Second, I evaluated the relationship between dolphin estimates and human stressors. Higher densities of dolphins occurred in rivers with low indices of overall <b>freshwater</b> <b>degradation,</b> such as rivers with high water quality and the lowest human population numbers. Thus, dolphin density estimates seem to be good indicators of freshwater {{ecosystem degradation}} in the Amazon and Orinoco basins. These top predators not only are indicator species, but also have the potential to act as flagship and sentinel species, indicating freshwater ecosystem degradation and stimulating conservation action.  This dissertation highlights the large changes in the Amazon and Orinoco that are approaching fast. Indicator, flagship and sentinel species can become science-based conservation tools not to only document freshwater ecosystem degradation, but to raise awareness about broader implications of human stressors on biodiversity and river systems.

40|$|Human {{stressors}} {{are currently}} impacting both the Amazon and Orinoco river basins {{and these are}} likely to increase. However, {{there is a lack}} of standardized monitoring programs to track these human stressors in most of the countries that overlap these basins, and no clear ecological indicators have been identified. In this study we investigated the relationships between measures of ecosystem degradation and river dolphins as potential ecological indicators. The presence of human stressors and their distance from the areas surveyed were used to provide an estimate of ecosystem degradation. We tested three ecological indicators of <b>freshwater</b> ecosystem <b>degradation</b> using river dolphins: (i) density of river dolphins, (ii) mean group size of dolphins, and (iii) dolphin sighting rates. We found a strong negative relationship between measures of habitat degradation and river dolphin density estimates in selected locations of the Amazon and Orinoco. Therefore, we suggest that river dolphins are good candidates as ecological indicators, flagship and sentinel species for monitoring the conservation status of large tropical rivers in South America. We suggest that further effort should be directed toward collecting reliable data on human stressors, creating collaborative networks for compiling existing data, and documenting and monitoring current trends in <b>freshwater</b> ecosystem <b>degradation</b> and indicator species in the Amazon and Orinoco basins with the goal of targeting areas for recovery or sustainable management.

In <b>freshwater</b> systems, <b>degradation</b> of adjacent terrestrial vegetation may facilitate introduced species by altering resource availability. Here we examine how the presence of intact riparian cover influences the impact of an invasive herbivorous snail, Tarebia granifera, on nitrogen (N) cycling in aquatic systems {{on the island of}} Trinidad. We quantified snail biomass, growth, and N excretion in locations where riparian vegetation was present or removed to determine how snail demographics and excretion were related to the condition of the riparian zone. In three Neotropical streams, we measured snail biomass and N excretion in open and closed canopy habitats to generate estimates of mass and area-specific N excretion rates. Snail biomass was 2 to 8 times greater and areal N excretion rates ranged from 3 to 9 times greater in open canopy habitats. Snails foraging in open canopy habitat also had access to more abundant food resources and exhibited greater growth and mass-specific N excretion rates. Estimates of ecosystem N demand indicated that snail N excretion in fully closed, partially closed, and open canopy habitats supplied 2 %, 11 %, and 16 % of integrated ecosystem N demand, respectively. We conclude that human-mediated riparian canopy loss can generate hotspots of snail biomass, growth, and N excretion along tropical stream networks, altering the impacts of an invasive snail on the biogeochemical cycling of N...|$|R

Scaling up to include human residents, tightly integrated arctic social-ecological systems (SESs) are believed similarly susceptible to industrial impacts and climate change. In contrast to northern Alaska and Canada, most terrestrial and aquatic components of West Siberian oil and gas fields are seasonally exploited by migratory herders, hunters, fishers, and domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.). Despite anthropogenic fragmentation and transformation of {{a large proportion of the}} environment, recent socioeconomic upheaval, and pronounced climate warming, we find the Yamal-Nenets SES highly resilient according to a few key measures. We detail the remarkable extent to which the system has successfully reorganized in response to recent shocks and evaluate the limits of the system's capacity to respond. Our analytical approach combines quantitative methods with participant observation to understand the overall effects of rapid land use and climate change at the level of the entire Yamal system, detect thresholds crossed using surrogates, and identify potential traps. Institutional constraints and drivers were as important as the documented ecological changes. Particularly crucial to success is the unfettered movement of people and animals in space and time, which allows them to alternately avoid or exploit a wide range of natural and anthropogenic habitats.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to bring about major change in freshwater availability, the productive capacity of soils, and in patterns of human settlement. However, considerable uncertainties exist {{with regard to the}} extent and geographical distribution of these changes. Predicting scenarios for how climate-related environmental change may influence human societies and political systems necessarily involves an even higher degree of uncertainty. The direst predictions about the impacts of global warming warn about greatly increased risks of violent conflict over increasingly scarce resources such as freshwater and arable land. We argue that our best guess about the future has to be based on our knowledge about the relationship between demography, environment and violent conflict in the past. Previous rigorous studies in the field have mostly focused on national-level aggregates. This article represents a new approach {{to assess the impact of}} environment on internal armed conflict by using georeferenced (GIS) data and small geographical, rather than political, units of analysis.

This paper addresses how native aquatic macrophyte communities {{are affected by}} the non-native species Urochloa arrecta, a current successful invader in Brazilian freshwater systems. We compared the native macrophytes colonizing patches dominated and non-dominated by this invader species. We surveyed eight streams in Northwest Paraná State (Brazil). In each stream, we recorded native macrophytes' richness and biomass in sites where U. arrecta was dominant and in sites where it was not dominant or absent. No native species were found in seven, out of the eight investigated sites where U. arrecta was dominant. Thus, we found higher native species richness, Shannon index and native biomass values in sites without dominance of U. arrecta than in sites dominated by this invader. Although difficult to conclude about causes of such differences, we infer that the elevated biomass production by this grass might be the primary reason for alterations in invaded environments and for the consequent impacts on macrophytes' native communities. However, biotic resistance offered by native richer sites could be an alternative explanation for our results. To mitigate potential impacts and to prevent future environmental perturbations, we propose mechanical removal of the invasive species and maintenance or restoration of riparian vegetation, for freshwater ecosystems have vital importance for the maintenance of ecological services and biodiversity and should be preserved...|$|R
5000|$|Habitat - {{the loss}} of {{suitable}} <b>freshwater</b> habitat, especially <b>degradation</b> of stream pools and reduction of suitable material for the excavation of redds has caused a reduction in spawning. Historically, stream pools were, to a large extent, created by beavers (see section below). With their extirpation, the nurturing function of these ponds was lost. Reduced retention of the nutrients brought by the returning adult salmon in stream pools has lowered populations. Without stream pools, dead adult salmon tend to be washed straight back down the streams and rivers, so the nutrients are not available for the hatchlings. The construction of dams, weirs, barriers and other [...] "flood prevention" [...] measures bring severe adverse impacts to river habitat and on the accessibility of those habitats to salmon, particularly in the northwest USA, where large numbers of dams have been built in many river systems, including over 400 in the Columbia River Basin. Other environmental factors, such as light intensity, water flow, or change in temperature, dramatically affects salmon during their migration season. Modern farming methods and various sources of pollution have resulted in loss of invertebrate diversity and population density in rivers, thus reducing food availability. Reduction in freshwater base flow in rivers and disruption of seasonal flows, because of diversions and extractions, hydroelectric power generation, irrigation schemes, barge transportation, and slackwater reservoirs, inhibit normal migratory processes and increase predation for salmon. Agricultural practices, such as the removal of riparian plants, destabilization of stream banks by livestock and irrigation processes, result {{in a loss of}} suitable low-gradient stream habitats.|$|R

40|$|Urbanisation of {{catchment}} areas {{is a major}} cause of <b>freshwater</b> ecosystem <b>degradation</b> worldwide. As catchments become more developed and river ecosystems become increasingly engulfed in various land use activities, there is a growing need to understand these impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Benthic macroinvertebrates are extensively used as indicators of ecosystem health and have been an instrumental tool in ecosystem monitoring and management. The effects of changing land use on macroinvertebrates at a fine scale however, have not been extensively investigated. Therefore an investigation was conducted to compare chemical, physical and biological surface water quality parameters and aquatic macroinvertebrate community composition along the first 8 km of the Hartbeesspruit, which contains multiple land use types, in the upper Apies-Pienaar catchment in Gauteng, South Africa. Five sampling sites corresponding to changes in land use were sampled four times at six-week intervals from September 2013 to February 2014. Influential variables that were recorded included in-stream habitat, riparian cover, flow regime and surface water quality parameters. Physical surface water parameters that were tested in situ included pH, salinity, total dissolved solutes, temperature, clarity and conductivity. Ex situ surface water parameters that were tested included physical parameters (alkalinity and turbidity), chemical parameters (major ions, metal ions and nutrients), and biological parameters (bacteria, coliforms and Escherichia coli). Macroinvertebrates were sampled using Hester-Dendy artificial samplers, which, following a 6 week exposure period, were sampled three times from November 2013 to February 2014. Macroinvertebrates were identified to family level and counted. Macroinvertebrate community composition across sites was assessed through macroinvertebrate abundance, family richness, SASS score, ASPT, Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou s evenness, non-metric multidimensional scaling and Indval analyses. Nineteen families were collected, of which only three made up 80 % of macroinvertebrates sampled. These families were Hirudinea, Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. Indices of macroinvertebrate community composition indicated a general increase in value from upstream to downstream which showed similar comparative variation between sites to physical water quality parameters (except temperature and clarity), major ions (except arsenic), the metal ion magnesium and nutrient sulphate. Surface water parameters showed patterns indicative of effects due to evaporation, dilution and connectivity of water flow along the stream due to the presence of dams and wetlands. Temperature was an important influence on macroinvertebrate abundance and family richness at a temporal scale. On a spatial scale the most influential parameters on macroinvertebrate composition were seen to be depth, turbidity and conductivity, and temperature to a lesser extent. The land use types that showed the greatest association with various assemblages were the urban, recreational and least transformed wetland land uses. Although major influential factors, this pattern was not seen to be strictly due to the input of contaminants arising from associated activities, nor the variation in physical characteristics, but rather the discontinuity in flow regime. It was concluded that at a fine scale, the strongest factors that influenced macroinvertebrate community composition along the Hartbeesspruit, was not land use type but rather the hydrological pathways of connectivity and stream flow that exist within the system. The hydrological pathways influenced values and concentrations of chemical and physical surface water parameters which in turn further influenced macroinvertebrate assemblages present.

40|$|AIM: This work {{is aimed}} at {{extending}} the understanding of urea cycle in <b>freshwater</b> ecosystems. Its <b>degradation</b> rate concerning microorganisms activities was measured in the turbid waters of Pindaré and Turiaçu rivers located on the pre-Amazonian floodplain, Brazil; METHODS: The Pindaré and Turiaçu aquatic systems have distinct dry and rainy periods. The investigation {{was developed in the}} middle of the rainy period, and field activities were carried out in the extensive water bodies from the middle to lower reaches. The rate of degradation in the surface waters of the two aquatic systems was determined with in situ simulation technique using 14 C-labelled urea. Photosynthetic rates were determined by the radiocarbon technique simultaneously with experimental measurements of urea degradation rate; RESULTS: Urea degradation rates (sum of carbon incorporation into particulate matter and CO 2 liberation into water) were 2. 0 mg urea C m- 3 day- 1 in the Pindaré and 17. 1 mg urea C m- 3 day- 1 in the Turiaçu waters. Daylight values were obviously higher than those in the dark, and the urea degradation rates in Turiaçu showed much higher values than those in Pindaré. Most of the urea degradation occurred during the CO 2 liberation phase. The average of chlorophyll a specific urea degradation rate was 0. 13 and 0. 83 mg urea C mg chl. a- 1 day- 1 in both river waters. The ratio of urea carbon degradation to photosynthetic carbon assimilation in both waters averaged 1. 2 and 4. 2 %, respectively. The residence time of urea in the surface water was calculated as 2. 3 to 4. 5 days in the Pindaré and 0. 21 to 0. 50 days in the Turiaçu. Much shorter residence times were obtained in the Turiaçu due to the high degradation rate of urea; CONCLUSION: The correlation coefficient between the urea degradation rate and chlorophyll a or photosynthetic rate showed a statistically significant value in the Turiaçu. This indicates that in the Turiaçu system the urea degradation rate was proportional to the standing crop of phytoplankton and their photosynthetic rate. A strong relationship between the urea carbon incorporation rate and photosynthetic rate in the light bottles was observed, indicating that the carbon incorporation into the phytoplankton cells was also related to the photosynthetic rate. The present brief residence time indicates that the urea was being rapidly recycled in the euphotic zone of the investigated systems in the rainy period...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} salinisation {{is rapidly}} {{becoming one of}} the greatest causes of <b>freshwater</b> habitat <b>degradation.</b> Elevated salinity levels are a substantial threat to freshwater biodiversity, but the effects of increasing salinity on anuran populations remain poorly understood. Global anuran populations are in decline, and therefore studies that specifically examine anuran responses to environmental stressors are vital for effective conservation management of an already at-risk animal group. This PhD project has been designed to expand our understanding of the effects of increasing environmental salinity on anuran populations by investigating the salinity tolerances of native Australian anurans, as well as exploring the non-lethal effects of salinity on anuran development, physiology, ecology and behaviour. I examined the effects of elevated salinity on larval growth, metamorphosis and survival in three Australian frog species. The results indicated that salinity tolerances are species-specific, with two of the species studied (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and Neobatrachus sudelli) showing lower survival in high, but ecologically relevant salinities (5. 6 ppt NaCl equivalent). A higher survival in high salinity treatments compared to freshwater treatments indicated the potential for saline specialisation in one species, Litoria aurea. Differences in larval duration in L. tasmaniensis and L. aurea between salinity treatments indicated that the magnitude of salinity stress can alter the developmental responses of tadpoles. I surveyed the effects of environmental salinisation on anuran distributions and species richness in south-east Australia. Salinity concentration {{was a significant predictor of}} anuran diversity and species distributions at study sites. No anuran species were discovered at sites with salinity levels above 13. 9 ppt, and embryos and tadpoles were absent from sites with salinities above 5 ppt, suggesting that current salinity levels are negatively influencing anuran population structure throughout the region surveyed. When examining how developmental plasticity differed in response to salinity between populations of Litoria ewingii, I confirmed that salinity exposure can affect post-metamorphic morphology, and determined that tadpoles sourced from ecologically distinct populations differed in their developmental responses to environmental stress. Tadpoles sourced from a constantly brackish wetland exhibited no differences in metamorphic timing or morphology between salinity treatments, potentially indicating that tadpoles from this population are no longer able to maximise fitness in freshwater environments. I explored how the magnitude, timing and frequency of temporary salinity fluctuations affected survival, growth and maturation in L. ewingii tadpoles. I confirmed that late-stage tadpoles show higher survival rates in elevated salinity compared to tadpoles exposed to salinity at a younger age, and discovered that higher magnitude salinities suppressed the potential for compensatory growth in L. ewingii. I found that L. ewingii tadpoles exposed to elevated salinity early in development did not significantly differ in their developmental responses to subsequent salinity stress compared to tadpoles that had not been pre-exposed to salinity. Finally I examined the potential short and long-term consequences of developmental saline stress on two species of Australian anuran (L. ewingii and Limnodynastes peronii) by examining changes in tadpole respiration, escape response behaviour (pre- and post-metamorphosis) and foraging ability post-metamorphosis. Elevated salinity treatment did not alter tadpole respiration rates relative to controls. Non-lethal salinity exposure during development impaired larval escape-response behaviour in both early-stage and late-stage tadpoles. Differences in adult escape response and foraging performance were species-specific. Higher salinity during development reduced L. ewingii escape response behaviour immediately after metamorphosis, but significant differences in locomotor performance between salinity treatments were no longer detectable three weeks post-metamorphosis. In addition, L. ewingii reared in higher salinity were significantly faster to catch pray than freshwater controls. The results from this thesis show that salinity levels in Australia are already impacting on anuran survival, and potentially limiting anuran species richness and distributions. Current levels of environmental salinity are also expected to alter developmental processes, physiology and behaviour in a number of native frog species. Considering that salinity levels are predicted to continue to rise, immediate action will be required to mitigate the deleterious effects of elevated salinity on freshwater ecosystems. I emphasise the need for continued studies that examine anuran responses to environmental stress in order to better combat the decline of anuran populations and maintain ecosystem stability...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, protest {{events in}} a range of African {{countries}} have attracted widespread interest and public debate. The sharp increase in world food prices in 2007 and 2008, for example, was associated with the occurrence of a wave of food riots on the continent. In a number of countries, including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, protests erupted against high costs of living and frequently escalated into violence. These actions led to serious concern for political stability in several of these countries. The Arab Spring, which started at the end of 2010 in Tunisia was constituted by large-scale protest movements against authoritarian rulers. Multiple countries experienced opposition in the streets with events in Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia capturing most attention because of the violence which erupted as a result of protests and repression, and their far-ranging political consequences. In Sub-Saharan Africa as well, strong opposition protests recently emerged against political rulers. In Madagascar (2009) and Niger (2010) street demonstrations resulted in military interventions and the ousting of incumbent presidents. In Senegal (2012), protests prevented president Wade from changing electoral rules in his favour and reduced his chances of winning a third term in office. When long-time president Compaoré of Burkina Faso attempted to amend the constitution in 2014 in order to continue his rule, opposition revolt led him to eventually flee the country. A key question that emerges when witnessing such protest movements concerns their causes or drivers. For many commentators, these African protests can be explained by economic discontent among the local population. During the increase in world food prices, for example, Jacques Diouf, then Director-General of the Food and Agricultural Organization, stated that “Naturally people won't be sitting dying of starvation, they will react. ” (in: Pomeroy, 2008). Such arguments correspond strongly to neo-Malthusian views which argue that resource scarcity and resulting poverty fuel animosity and conflict (e. g. Kaplan, 1994). Indeed, reduced access to food, unemployment, and hunger are commonly argued to drive people into the streets and engage in protests and violence. In recent years, the role of economic stressors in fuelling conflict has also led to an increasing body of academic research. The scientific debate on how resource scarcity can lead to conflict mainly goes back to the work of Homer-Dixon (1994, 1999), who held that different environmental stress factors such as land <b>degradation,</b> <b>freshwater</b> depletion, and population growth can lead to economic setbacks and increasing competition between groups. Grievances resulting from resource scarcity would in turn form important motivations for engaging in collective action. Several studies have focused on how different resource scarcity indicators are related to violent armed conflicts (e. g. Hauge and Ellingsen, 1998; Kahl, 2006). Yet researchers have also turned their attention to how different low-scale forms of conflicts, or ‘social disorder’ events are driven by resource scarcity (e. g. Hendrix and Salehyan, 2012; Urdal and Hoelscher, 2012). Widespread concern with African food riots, for example, has led to a substantial research agenda on the effect of food prices on protest and riot occurrence (e. g. Weinberg and Bakker, 2015). Both in public debate and the resource scarcity literature, economic shocks and resulting grievances are hence seen as principal explanations for protest mobilization in Africa. In this thesis, however, I engage critically with the view that resource scarcity is the main cause of protest mobilization and conflict in Africa. While drawing on the social movement literature, I argue that the theoretical and empirical focus on resource scarcity as a cause of conflict is too limiting to understand mobilization dynamics in Africa. The resource scarcity literature primarily relies on the idea that grievances caused by poverty and inequality explain conflict emergence. Yet while motivations to engage in protests form an important explanation for mobilization, the social movement literature demonstrates that motivations alone are often insufficient to explain participation in street demonstrations (e. g. McAdam, McCarthy, and Zald, 1999). Grievances often have to be actively mobilized and organized by group leaders for instance while government reactions to challengers, including repression, can inhibit protest actions. Although social and political contextual factors are recognized within the resource scarcity literature, they are rarely addressed in depth. By contrast, additional socio-political explanatory paradigms for mobilization besides motivations have received substantial attention in the social movement literature. In this thesis, I argue that these paradigms can also be applied to African contexts, and that they are indeed needed to provide crucial insights into the complexity of protest mobilization in Africa. Furthermore, the thesis not only draws theoretically from social movement studies, but also methodologically. Within the social movement literature a number of methodological approaches have been developed and used to investigate a range of research questions pertaining to the study of protest movements. Some scholars focus on individuals and the characteristics that make them more likely to participate in protests, for example, while others focus on the political systems in which protest events are more likely to occur. Too little focus has been directed to methodological insights from social movement studies in the study of African protest movements, however. The first core critique that emerges is that many resource scarcity studies have little methodological focus on the individual level, and that this is highly paradoxical given their theoretical focus on individual motivations. The second critique is that many studies rely heavily on news reports to approach African protests, while neglecting misrepresentations and errors arising from these data. Both critiques are substantiated empirically in the thesis. The thesis itself consists of a collection of articles, and consequently each following chapter can be read as a separate contribution. The red line is formed by the critical engagement with the resource scarcity literature and each chapter contributes to the theoretical and methodological arguments outlined above. Hence, the two main research questions guiding the thesis as a whole are the following: What are the main drivers of African protest mobilizations, and to what extent can social movement theory be applied to explain these protests? How can insights from social movement studies improve data reliability and validity in the study of African protests and mobilization dynamics? Theoretically, the thesis argues that resource scarcity theory as such does not sufficiently improve our understanding of African mobilizations, and that perspectives from the social movement literature are needed to improve our insights. Methodologically, the study of protests in Africa is argued to suffer from crucial shortcomings which jeopardize research findings. A number of these shortcomings have already been raised and addressed earlier in the social movement literature, and can guide further research in African settings. The combination of theoretical and methodological insights in particular demonstrates that there is too little interaction between research on protests in Africa and Western-focused social movement studies, which creates important lacunae in our understanding of protest mobilization on the continent. These arguments are addressed and empirically substantiated in the individual chapters of the thesis. Chapter 2 ‘Food Price Rises and Political Instability: Problematizing a Complex Relationship’ focuses on the occurrence of food riots following the rise in international food prices in 2007. By means of a critical review of the literature on these particular events, the paper highlights major theoretical and methodological gaps in the literature on food price rises and conflict. Specifically, I argue that the food riot literature suffers from a number of crucial shortcomings, focusing on three issues in particular: a lack of precision in the use of concepts such as conflict or political instability, uncritical data collection based on media sources, and presupposed and understudied economic as well as political causal mechanisms. The paper first stresses the need for conceptual distinctions between different types of conflict discussed in the food riot literature. It highlights in particular the distinctions between peaceful protests, riots, and civil war, arguing that the underlying mechanisms leading to each form of conflict can be quite different. Moreover, the occurrence of each of these conflict types cannot simply be equated with political instability. Furthermore, the food riot concept in particular is scrutinized and argued to be a container term for both riots, in which protesters act violently, and (violently repressed) demonstrations. This argument has a crucial link with our empirical understanding of food riots as the term seemingly implies the rise of hungry and violent mobs, whereas in reality most violence seems to have been perpetrated by governments. Indeed, many researchers have taken both protests and riots together in the construction of food riot lists. The second topic addressed in the paper regards the use of news reports to collect empirical data on conflict events. When reviewing data on food riots more closely, it emerges for instance that many researchers make use of different lists in which different events are either included or excluded. Furthermore, besides the use of violence in these events, the protest issue is unclear as well. It seems that many events have simply been framed as food riots by media|$|R
