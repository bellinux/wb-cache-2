5|$|The {{coalition}} army {{then proceeded}} to Amyclae, from whence they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia. The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at Gythium. As the land forces began to <b>invest</b> <b>the</b> city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct siege engines within a few days. Though these machines had a devastating effect on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out.|$|E
5|$|Turley {{began working}} as a {{financial}} planner in 1957, by selling life insurance. He also operated a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore. In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams & Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than cash value life insurance, and <b>invest</b> <b>the</b> money they saved in mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.|$|E

5|$|In 1954 Hamling {{started a}} {{companion}} magazine, Imaginative Tales; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was {{the publisher of}} Rogue, a men's magazine modelled after Playboy. In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, {{but in many cases}} it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with Imagination one of the victims; Hamling closed down both Imagination and its sister magazine to <b>invest</b> <b>the</b> money in Rogue instead. The last issue of Imagination was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of Imagination omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{enrolled}} at Indiana School of Law in late 1915. He {{was a top}} student, and graduated with high honors in 1916. At the commencement ceremony, with {{the state supreme court}} present, he gave a provocative speech criticizing his school. The faculty withheld his degree, but granted it after two days of intense debate. Willkie joined his parents' law firm, but volunteered for the United States Army on April 2, 1917, the day President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. An army clerk transposed his first two names; with Willkie unwilling to <b>invest</b> <b>the</b> time to have the bureaucracy correct it, he kept his name as Wendell Lewis Willkie. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Willkie was sent for artillery training, meaning he did not embark for France until September 1918. In January of that year, he married Edith Wilk, a librarian from Rushville, Indiana; the couple had one son, Philip. The war ended before Willkie reached the front, and he spent his time defending soldiers who had slipped away for time in Paris against orders. He was recommended for promotion to captain, but was discharged in early 1919 before the paperwork went through.|$|E

30|$|For {{two-dimensional}} risk models, {{some authors}} suppose that <b>the</b> insurance company <b>invests</b> <b>the</b> surpluses of {{two kinds of}} insurance businesses in one portfolio; see Fu and Ng [10], Li [20] and Guo et al. [14]. But such an assumption is restrictive in applications. In fact, an insurer often <b>invests</b> <b>the</b> surpluses of different businesses into different portfolios {{in order to avoid}} risks.|$|R

5000|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} diminishing marginal returns {{is that as}} total investment increases, the total return on investment {{as a proportion of}} the total investment (the average product or return) decreases. Suppose, for example, that 1 kilogram of seed applied to a certain plot of land produces one ton of crop, that 2 kg of seed produces 1.5 tons, and that 3 kg of seed produces 1.75 tons. In formulaic terms, the th kg of seeds produces [...] additional tons of crop. <b>The</b> return from <b>investing</b> <b>the</b> first kilogram is 1 t/kg. When 2 kg of seed is <b>invested,</b> <b>the</b> return is 1.5/2 = 0.75 t/kg, and when 3 kg is <b>invested,</b> <b>the</b> return is 1.75/3 = 0.58 t/kg.|$|R

25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to <b>invest</b> <b>the</b> full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to <b>invest</b> <b>the</b> remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E
