50|$|Trade mark {{rights and}} {{royalties}} are often {{tied up in}} a variety of other arrangements. Trade marks are often applied to an entire brand of products and not just a single one. Because trade mark law has as a public interest goal of the protection of a consumer, in terms of getting what they are paying for, trade mark licences are only effective if the company owning the trade mark also obtains some assurance in return that the goods will meet its quality standards. When the rights of trade mark are licensed along with a <b>know-how,</b> supplies, <b>pooled</b> advertising, etc., the result is often a franchise relationship. Franchise relationships may not specifically assign royalty payments to the trade mark licence, but may involve monthly fees and percentages of sales, among other payments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. e-Science is {{scientific}} investigation performed through distributed global collaborations between {{scientists and}} their resources, and the computing infrastructure that enables this. Scientific progress increasingly depends on <b>pooling</b> <b>know-how</b> and results; making connections between ideas, people, and data; and finding and reusing knowledge and resources generated by others in perhaps unintended ways. It is about harvesting and harnessing the “collective intelligence ” {{of the scientific}} community. The Semantic Web {{is an extension of}} the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning to facilitate sharing and reuse, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. Applying the Semantic Web paradigm to e-Science has the potential to bring significant benefits to scientific discovery. We identify the benefits of lightweight and heavyweight approaches, based on our experiences in the Life Sciences. ...|$|R
40|$|We are {{familiar}} with the idea of e-Commerce- the electronic trading between consumers and suppliers. In recent years there has been a commensurate paradigm shift in the way that science is conducted. e-Science is science performed through distributed global collaborations between scientists and their resources enabled by electronic means, in order to solve scientific problems. No one scientific laboratory has the resources or tools, the raw data or derived understanding or the expertise to harness the knowledge available to a scientific community. Real progress depends on <b>pooling</b> <b>know-how</b> and results. It depends on collaboration and making connections between ideas, people, and data. It depends on finding and interpreting results and knowledge generated by scientific colleagues you do not know and who do not know you, to be analysed in ways they did not anticipate, to generate new hypotheses to be pooled in their turn. The importance of e-Science has been highlighted in the UK, for example, by an investment of over £ 240 million pounds {{over the past five years}} to specifically address the research and development issues that have to be tacked to develop a sustainable and effective e-Science e-Infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Clean Sky is a Joint Technology Initiative {{that aims}} to develop and mature {{breakthrough}} ‘clean technologies’ for air transport. The programme {{is made up of}} 6 Integrated Technology Demonstrators (ITD) and the Technology Evaluator (TE), a dedicated evaluation platform. The TE is in charge of assessing the performance of the technologies developed in the ITDs in order to monitor progress towards the ACARE environmental goals and to provide views on aviation footprint in terms of emissions and noise. The assessments are done via a tool suite with state-of-the-art models for simulating air traffic and assessing environmental impacts as well as aircraft models developed specifically by ITDs to represent the environmental performance of their Concept and Reference Technology Aircraft. This reflects an attempt to <b>pool</b> <b>know-how</b> and simulation/modelling capability that exists among industry, research establishments and academia. The approach in the TE is to ‘insert’ 2020 Clean Sky concept aircraft into a number of evaluation scenarios. These concept aircraft are ‘flown’ (i. e. simulation scenarios are run) and the Clean Sky configurations are compared to the most relevant benchmarks: mainly state-of-the-art aircraft of similar size and role in year 2000 (ACARE’s baseline). The comparisons or assessments are performed at three levels: Mission Level (single flight), Airport Level (community impact), and System Level (global fleet footprint) – and quantify reductions wrt. emissions (CO 2, NOx) and noise. This presentation will provide information on the applied methodologies and will embed this into the bigger picture – related to this session – of evolving European assessment capabilities...|$|R
