5|$|The filmography of English actor Robert Bathurst {{comprises}} both {{film and}} television roles spanning almost 30 years. Bathurst made his acting debut for television in 1982 in the never-broadcast pilot episode for the BBC sitcom Blackadder, though his character Prince Henry was recast when the Black Adder series was commissioned. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1980s, Bathurst appeared in episodes of The Lenny Henry Show, Who Dares Wins, The District Nurse, Red Dwarf, and Chelmsford 123, before starring alongside his Cambridge Footlights colleague Stephen Fry in the short-run series Anything More Would Be Greedy. He also appeared in the films Whoops Apocalypse (1986) and <b>Just</b> <b>Ask</b> for Diamond (1988).|$|E
25|$|This era in Horowitz's career {{also saw}} Adventurer (1987) and Starting Out (1990) published. However, the most major release of Horowitz's early career was The Falcon's Malteser (1986). This book {{was the first}} in the {{successful}} Diamond Brothers series, and was filmed for television in 1989 as <b>Just</b> <b>Ask</b> for Diamond, with an all star cast that included Bill Paterson, Jimmy Nail, Roy Kinnear, Susannah York, Michael Robbins and Patricia Hodge, and featured Colin Dale and Dursley McLinden as Nick and Tim Diamond. It was followed in 1987 with Public Enemy Number Two, and by South by South East in 1991 followed by The French Confection, I Know What You Did Last Wednesday, The Blurred Man and most recently The Greek Who Stole Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Holmes was {{originally}} hired on <b>Just</b> <b>Ask</b> Jon Eakes, a home improvement show (also on HGTV and formerly in the US on sister network DIY Network) hosted by Jon Eakes, for some behind-the-scenes work. Mike Holmes approached the show's producers Scott Clark McNeil and Michael Quast {{with an idea}} for a new kind of home improvement show. Holmes did not intend that he appear on camera, but the producers made this a condition of the deal. Although submissions to be on the show were initially few and far between, with Holmes doing work on small botched jobs early on in the series, the number of submissions quickly ballooned by the show's fourth season. In its last season, the show was directed by The Holmes Group's Vice President Pete Kettlewell, who had worked on the show from the first season where he did the show's audio, produced by The Holmes Group's Vice President Michael Quast, who had been with the show since the fifth season, and also produced by Mike Holmes himself.|$|E

25|$|Its story {{focuses on}} the trials of a young cop named Charlie, played by Geoffrey Kennedy, who at the {{beginning}} receives a phone call summoning him for what is presumably his first job. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of him standing next to his older brother Brian, played by Brian Krause, {{who is also a}} cop. The film then begins playing the song “Spore” as Charlie joins his brother and a third cop as they enter a residence where they find a dead girl and arrest two thugs, one played by Todd La Torre, as they return to the scene with a bag full of money. The second thug lunges at Brian when he pilfers some of the cash but Charlie restrains him. Later, the chief of police, played by R.J. Adams, is seen looking through a window as the second thug is telling a detective to <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> Charlie about what Brian did during the bust. The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief to remind him that his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well and picks up the phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged at his brother for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E

[...] He had previously collaborated on other hip hop songs, such as with rappers Ludacris, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Ice Cube on the track [...] "You Ain't Gotta Lie (Ta Kick It)".

It first aired on November 11, 2009, in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode marked the final appearance of Gordon Stoltski, the third grade student who read the morning announcements for South Park Elementary. The day after [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] was originally broadcast, four T-shirts based on the episode were made available at South Park Studios, the official South Park website. All four featured Cartman wearing a suit and tie, saying a quote from the episode.

500|$|Following {{their worst}} weekend in almost ten years, Ferrari were self-critical. Sebastian Vettel {{was quoted as}} {{describing}} his race as [...] "a shit job", and later took full responsibility for his race ending crash, saying that he [...] "probably <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> or want {{a little bit too}} much". Speaking about the collision between Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said: [...] "It's an accident, it's part of the show. I don't want to blame anybody." [...] He went on to describe the weekend as [...] "a good lesson" [...] for the team, taking positive things from the race, such as the good race pace shown by both cars. As a result of their double retirement, both Ferrari drivers lost their respective positions in the Drivers' Championship. While Vettel was overtaken by Rosberg into second place, Räikkönen lost fourth position to Valtteri Bottas. In the Constructors' Standings, Williams moved closer to Ferrari in second place, now trailing them by 131 points.

She comes out to him and he shares with her his longing to be [...] "normal" [...] for a day so that he could lose his virginity and reunite Freddie and Cook. She advises him to <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> for the things he wants, so they visit Freddie to tell him to make up with Cook.

JJ asks Freddie to make up with Cook, but Freddie refuses and tells JJ to choose between him and Cook.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Since its release, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from contemporary music critics. Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly felt the song's [...] "hyper-personal lyrics" [...] were [...] "immediate and affecting". Immediately following its release, Maeve McDermott from USA Today awarded the track [...] "Song of the Week" [...] in October, further adding that [...] "he song's spiritual sibling {{is another of}} Stefani's best works: 1996's No Doubt classic 'Don't Speak'," [...] but noting that [...] "this time around, coming from a more mature artist with fewer things to prove, the pain feels dizzyingly fresh." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator praised {{the fact that the}} singer was [...] "stepping away from the pumped-up vibes of previous tracks like 'Spark The Fire' & 'Baby Don’t Lie', also noting that [...] "eartache is immediately relatable (<b>just</b> <b>ask</b> Adele) and Gwen is often praised for her underrated slow songs , so it is refreshing to witness her jumpstart this current album era with a new vibe." [...] Alex Kritselis of Bustle called it [...] "a fantastic 'comeback single' — a tremendous improvement over 'Baby Don't Lie'," [...] praising that [...] "when she repeatedly sings, 'I don't know why I used to love you,' during the climax, you feel it." [...] Music Times Carolyn Menyes agreed, noting that [...] "we haven't heard a breakup anthem from this girl since her Tragic Kingdom days. After a series of less-than-stellar singles, it's safe to say Stefani is back." [...] In a later review of the parent album, Menyes stated she was [...] "impressed with the vulnerability [...] displayed", comparing it to Stefani's previous singles [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Ex-Girlfriend". Menyes concluded by saying the potential on This Is What the Truth Feels Like is evident on tracks like [...] "Used to Love You".|$|E

2500|$|As a {{psychological}} concept and virtue, {{the benefits of}} forgiveness have been explored in religious thought, {{the social sciences and}} medicine. Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives including forgiving themselves, in terms of the person forgiven or in terms {{of the relationship between the}} forgiver and the person forgiven. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice, and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is [...] or dead).

2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. I <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E
