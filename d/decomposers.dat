As <b>decomposers,</b> they play an essential role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E

Also, idempotent endomorphisms form {{a class of}} (strong) <b>decomposer</b> {{functions in}} groups. Now, if the algebraic structure is a group, then by introducing a type of local homomorphisms we obtain several properties and equivalent conditions for many classes of <b>decomposer</b> functions and get a new result regarding to factorization of a group by its two subsets.

Their solutions are as <b>decomposer</b> functions and play important role regarding to decomposition (factorization) of groups by their two subsets. In this paper, we introduce an important class of strong <b>decomposer</b> functions, namely parter (or cyclic <b>decomposer)</b> functions. As some important applications of this topic, we characterize all periodic, coperiodic functions in arbitrary groups and give general solution of their functional equations: f(bx) = f(x), f(xb) = f(x), f(bx) = bf(x) and f(xb) = f(x) b. Moreover, we characterize all parter functions in arbitrary groups and completely solve the <b>decomposer</b> equation with the condition which its ∗-range is a cyclic subgroup of G. Finally, we give some functional characterization for related projections and b-parts functions and also, we introduce some uniqueness conditions for b-parts of real numbers...|$|R
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or <b>decomposers).</b> Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, <b>decomposers,</b> predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E

25|$|The {{first report}} of {{mycorrhizal}} inhibition of decomposition was in 1971 and came from ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiatia plantations in New Zealand. Authors show that excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi resulted in net carbon loss, {{and that the}} result could not be explained by soil disturbance effects. The mechanism presented is that ectomycorrhizal fungi can compete with free-living <b>decomposers</b> for nutrients, and thereby limit the rate of total decomposition. Since then {{there have been several}} other reports of ectomycorrhizal fungi reducing activity and decomposition rates of free-living <b>decomposers</b> and thereby increasing soil carbon storage. A theoretical ecosystem model recently demonstrated that greater access to organic nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi should slow decomposition of soil carbon by free-living <b>decomposers</b> by inducing nutrient limitation. It should be noted however, that Koide and Wu (2003) made a strong case that the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on reducing decomposition may {{have more to do with}} competition for soil water than soil nutrients.|$|E

25|$|Mycorrhizal fungi are {{nutrient}} rich structures {{compared to}} the roots they colonize, {{and it is possible}} that mycorrhizal colonization of roots leads to increased rates of root decomposition because <b>decomposers</b> would have greater access to nutrients. Evidence is equivocal on this point, as ectomycorrhizal colonization does increase fine root decomposition rates substantially compared to uncolonized roots in some ecosystems, while Pinus edulis roots colonized predominately by ectomycorrhizal fungi from the Ascomycota group have been found to decompose more slowly than uncolonized controls.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{previous}} researches [2, 3] b-integer and b-decimal parts of real numbers were introduced and studied by M. H. Hooshmand. The b-parts real functions have many interesting number theoretic explanations, analytic and algebraic properties, and satisfy the functional equation f (f(x) + y - f(y)) = f(x). These functions have {{led him to}} a more general topic in semigroups and groups (even in an arbitrary set with a binary operation [4] and the following functional equations have been introduced: Associative equations:f(xf(yz)) =f(f(xy) z),f(xf(yz)) =f(f(xy) z) =f(xyz). <b>Decomposer</b> equations:f(f*(x) f(y)) =f(y),f(f(x) f*(y)) =f(x). Strong <b>decomposer</b> equations:f(f*(x) y) =f(y),f(xf*(y)) =f(x). Canceler equations:f(f(x) y) =f(xy),f(xf(y)) =f(xy),f(xf(y) z) =f(xyz), where f*(x) f(x) = f (x) f* (x) = x. In this paper we solve them and introduce the general solution of the <b>decomposer</b> and strong <b>decomposer</b> equations in the sets with a binary operation and semigroups respectively and also associative equations in arbitrary groups. Moreover we state some equivalent equations to them and study the relations between the above equations. Finally we prove that the associative equations and the system of strong <b>decomposer</b> and canceler equations do not have any nontrivial solutions in the simple groups...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the effect of <b>decomposer</b> {{diversity}} on litter decomposition in alpine areas. Especially under the premise that alpine ecosystems are very sensitive to global change and are currently undergoing extensive land-use changes, a better understanding is needed to predict how environmental change will affect litter decomposition. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to compare the effects of the most common and functionally diverse invertebrates (earthworms, millipedes and sciarid larvae) found in alpine soils on decomposition rates and to assess how <b>decomposer</b> diversity affects litter decomposition. Experimental and estimated (i. e. projected to field decomposer-biomass) litter mass loss was 13 – 33 % higher in the three-species treatment. Notably, the variability in decomposition was greatly reduced when <b>decomposer</b> diversity was high, indicating a portfolio effect.

25|$|Of the {{estimated}} 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While {{the full extent}} of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic.

Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes,comprises 7,786 species. Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids.

We investigated {{the effect of}} Tamarix ramosissima invasion on the <b>decomposer</b> fauna and litter decomposition process, {{as well as the}} importance of litter quality in decomposition. Litter decomposition and <b>decomposer</b> communities were evaluated in two monospecific saltcedar forests and two native forests in Argentina, in litterbags containing either local litter (saltcedar or dominant native species) or a control litter. Saltcedar invasion produced an increase in Collembola, Acari, and total mesofauna abundance, regardless of the litter type. Control litter decomposition was higher in the native forest than in the saltcedar forest, showing that increased abundance of <b>decomposer</b> fauna does not necessarily accelerate decomposition processes. Local litter decomposition was not different between forests, suggesting that <b>decomposer</b> fauna of both ecosystems is adapted to efficiently decompose the autochthonous litter.

25|$|Soil carbon {{storage is}} an {{important}} function of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil contains more carbon than plants and the atmosphere combined. Understanding what maintains the soil carbon pool {{is important to understand}} the current distribution of carbon on Earth, and how it will respond to environmental change.

Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5-20% of total plant carbon uptake, and in some ecosystems the biomass of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots. Recent research has shown that mycorrhizal fungi hold 50 to 70 percent of the total carbon stored in leaf litter and soil on forested islands in Sweden.

Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesise. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal <b>decomposers</b> in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes), which share a common ancestor (form a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics.
