5|$|The {{three main}} {{islands of the}} Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are {{connected}} at low tides. It is said {{that at one time}} it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.|$|E
5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E

5|$|The Cal-Neva Lodge {{was built}} in 1926 by real estate {{developer}} Robert P. Sherman. In 1929, Canadian Army Colonel H. H. Betts went missing from his room at the Cal-Neva; his body was found over a year later some <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from the hotel. The lodge was first made nationally famous later that year when actress Clara Bow cancelled checks owed to the casino worth $13,000; she claimed that she had believed that the chips she was using while playing blackjack were worth 50 cents when they were actually valued at $100.|$|E
5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club would have to move to a new stadium <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> in Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time, as, only {{a few days after the}} Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the storage and launching sites listed below, operational facilities included the airfields for Heinkel He 111 H-22 bombers which air-launched the V-1 from low altitude over the North Sea. The ten-day-long aircrew training was at Peenemünde, and the bases were in Gilze Rijen, Holland for launches through 15 September 1944, and in Venlo for launches after the 1st week in December.

50|$|Since much of {{the modern}} city and its environs is built over Roman remains, it is still common to unearth Roman {{artefacts}} several <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> A complete tile kiln was found in Park Street some six miles (10 km) from Verulamium in the 1970s, {{and there is a}} Roman mausoleum near Rothamsted Park <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> (8 km) <b>away.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Phoenix and Valinda had {{scheduled}} a rendezvous in James Bay on San Salvador Island on February 16. The Phoenix {{was there and}} waited all day but the Valinda never showed up. Months later, Earle read in a back issue of Life Magazine that the Valinda had arrived in James Bay the night before ("while we were all asleep aboard the Phoenix, <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> around the point") but was then hijacked by the 21 escapees from the penal colony who forced the crew to sail to Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|Following {{defeat at}} the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, Charles II escaped and headed north into Shropshire and Staffordshire with several companions {{including}} Lord Derby and Henry, Lord Wilmot. A reward of £1000 was offered for {{the capture of}} the King. It {{is likely that the}} King and anyone helping him would have been executed for treason, if caught. The King had a distinctive appearance: very dark and six foot two inches tall (1.88 m). Furthermore, there were cavalry patrols specifically tasked with finding the King. At this time it was illegal for Catholics to travel more than <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from their homes without a pass from the Sheriff of the County. Helping the King would therefore be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|Still in {{the summer}} of 209 BC, while Marcellus was {{fighting}} Hannibal in Apulia, the army under the consul Quintus Fulvius Flaccus effected the submission of northern Lucania. The other consul, Quintus Fabius Maximus, assaulted the city of Manduria, in the Sallentine. It was hardly 35km away from Tarentum. Having disentangled himself from Marcellus, although the army of Fabius was very close to Tarentum, Hannibal hurried to rescue the city of Caulonia (in the farthest corner of southwestern Italy for Bruttium was also under Roman attack). Unopposed by the main Roman forces the Carthaginian commander managed to intercept and destroy near Caulonia an 8,000 strong detachment that had attacked the Bruttians from Regium, and thus retained control over the region. But this fight delayed him and he would not arrive in time to save Tarentum from Fabius' assault. He was <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> when Fabius sacked Tarentum.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{in three}} sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, {{including}} animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of {{dogs and cats}} that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes {{for half an hour}} or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when {{she was on her way}} home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.|$|E
25|$|The vessel {{struck a}} reef off Bass Point, Shell harbour, late on Wednesday night, and was badly holed. As she {{appeared}} likely to founder quickly, she was abandoned, {{and the crew}} of 11 rowed to Kiama, <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Returning to the scene early yesterday morning, they were astonished {{to find that the}} Incoming tide had refloated the vessel, which was rapidly drifting out to sea. The crew, in the ship's dinghy, reached Kiama at 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and Captain James Reid, the master, reported the matter to the police. The men rested until shortly before daybreak, and then set out in a launch owned by Mr. C. Stead to retrieve their personal belongings. As they drew near the spot where the Koraaga had gone ashore they found she had disappeared, and it was feared that she had already foundered. Within a few minutes, however, the vessel was seen about {{a mile and a half}} offshore, drifting southward under the influence of a strong current and a stiff north-easterly breeze. Her trawling flags were still flying, and she gave the appearance of being under control. So much so that, several hours later, two Interstate steamers passed without noticing anything amiss. By noon the trawler, now low in the water, was several miles out to sea. Members of the crew overtook the Koraaga early in the morning and went on board. They found that the engine room was flooded, and the vessel was being kept afloat by watertight compartments. There were then two possibilities, either that she would founder when the weight of water broke down the bulkheads, or that she would go ashore on Gerringong Beach. Word was sent to Sydney, and Cam and Sons, the owners, dispatched the trawler Charlie Cam, equipped with towing gear, to the scene. It was hoped to reach her before she went ashore or sank, and that she would have sufficient buoyancy to enable her to be towed to Sydney. She disappeared, however, before the Charlie Cam had reached the scene, and the salvage trawler was recalled. Worn out by his all day vigil beside the sinking vessel, Captain Reid returned to Kiama at 4 o'clock. He reported that the trawler had heeled over and foundered an hour before, about five miles east of Black Head, Gerringong, 9 miles from Kiama. Captain Reid was on board until just before the foundering. He said that the Koraaga sank in two minutes. The trawling flags and signals were still flying when she disappeared.|$|E

Air traffic control then radioed Flight 663 a similar advisory: at 2 o'clock, <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> travelling, below Flight 663's position.

25|$|The convoy {{anchored}} in the fueling area at 11:52, three hours after the last attack. Willmarth and the other escorts screened the convoy and provided an anti-submarine screen patrol around the valuable auxiliaries. Later that afternoon, Willmarth repulsed an attack made by a lone plane which {{came out of the}} sun in a glide-bombing attack at 14:20. The destroyer escort's gunfire damaged the plane and caused it to spin into the water about <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> (8km) <b>away.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1934, the Air Ministry {{stated that}} Castle Bromwich aerodrome {{could not be}} used for civil {{purposes}} indefinitely, so a new airport was built at Elmdon (some <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> (8 km) <b>away),</b> that is just outside the Birmingham city boundary.

500|$|Corpus Christi Bay is {{a natural}} harbor, and its port {{has contributed to the}} growth of the main port city of Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi is the 5th largest port in the United States, and the deepest on the Gulf of Mexico. The channel to the Gulf was dredged through the bay to the jetties at Port Aransas. Freight {{exchanged}} at the port include seafood, industrial and agricultural goods and petroleum. Six oil refineries and 1,500 wells are located near the bay as well as a large supply of natural gas. [...] In 1987 alone, $277 million of oil and gas were produced in the area. Metals, stone products, glass, chemicals, and gypsum products are also produced near the bay. Ingleside originally focused its economy on agriculture, notably viticulture. Later, industrial plants including those established by the Brauer Corporation, Reynolds Metals (<b>five</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away)</b> and DuPont opened. La Quinta Channel was dredged by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s.|$|E
