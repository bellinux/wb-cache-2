SMEs are expected to be an important vehicle to address the challenges of job creation, sustainable economic growth, equitable distribution of income and the overall stimulation of economic development in South Africa. The study finds that the perception of entrepreneurial opportunities and capabilities has increased since 2001 but still relatively low by international standard. In addition, the rate of business establishment is much lower than the rate of discontinuance. There is a net loss of small businesses. These factors may negatively impact on the ability of SMEs to help in alleviating some of the development challenges facing South Africa.

However, these treatments typically provide only modest benefit. <b>Improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> survival <b>rate</b> for pancreatic cancer patients therefore remains a major challenge in oncology. Inhibition of the key DNA damage response kinase ATR has been suggested as an attractive approach for sensitization of tumor cells to DNA damaging agents, but specific ATR inhibitors have remained elusive. Here we investigated the sensitization potential of the first highly selective and potent ATR inhibitor, VE- 821, in vitro. VE- 821 inhibited radiation- and gemcitabine-induced phosphorylation of Chk 1, confirming inhibition of ATR signaling. Consistently, VE- 821 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of PSN- 1, MiaPaCa- 2 and primary PancM pancreatic cancer cells to radiation and gemcitabine under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. ATR inhibition by VE- 821 led to inhibition of radiation-induced G 2 /M arrest in cancer cells. Reduced cancer cell radiosurvival following treatment with VE- 821 was also accompanied by increased DNA damage and inhibition of homologous recombination repair, as evidenced by persistence of γH 2 AX and 53 BP 1 foci and inhibition of Rad 51 foci, respectively.

However, despite the fact that OsNRT 1 shares a higher degree of sequence identity with the two peptide transporters from plants (approximately 50 %) than with the nitrate transporters (approximately 40 %) of the PTR family, no peptide transport activity was observed when OsNRT 1 was expressed in either Xenopus oocytes or yeast. Furthermore, contrasting the dual-affinity nitrate transport activity of CHL 1, OsNRT 1 displayed only low-affinity nitrate transport activity in Xenopus oocytes, with a Km value of approximately 9 mm.

The number of people over sixty will rise from the present 90 million to an expected 200 million by 2030. Giving the changing demography, family structure and settlements the need for pension products is increasing. This counts particular for women since they live longer and have less opportunities to create a pension by lack of formal labour force participation. This paper focuses on recent initiatives taken in India to analyze {{the improvement of the}} pension coverage and its capacity to prevent women’s old age poverty.

40|$|Hart Prairie is a high-elevation upland {{riparian}} ecosystem on {{the west}} slope of the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona. The location is unique, not only as an upland riparian area in the semi-arid Southwest, but also for having a wet meadow ecosystem dominated by Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana). The ecosystem has experienced {{a high degree of}} change since the time of Euro-American settlement. Along with fire suppression, increased wild ungulate herbivory rates, and conifer encroachment into a historically short-grass prairie, several humaninduced changes have been made to the topography of the watershed. Stock tanks, an earthen berm with associated diversion channels, and a road that cuts perpendicularly across the direction of water flow near the base of the watershed have contributed to the altered drainage patterns and the decreased water availability to the flora and fauna in the area. As a result, the Bebb willows and the associated meadow vegetation are at risk. Most of the willows, which constitute the majority of the canopy in the ecosystem, are at a decadent, over-mature stage that allows a limited recruitment of younger plants (Maschinski 1991, Waring 1992). Under these conditions, the plant community may die off leading to the loss of this rare riparian area forever.

Rape law reform is recognised internationally as having had limited impact to date, in terms of either <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> conviction <b>rates</b> for rape or reducing the systematic re-victimisation of adult female complainers. This issue is discussed within the context of negative social attitudes about rape and rape victims, and the contribution of these to the gap between law and practice in rape cases. The potential influence of different types of prejudicial social attitudes on juror decision-making in rape trials is considered in depth, including {{the extent to which these}} may negatively impact on the outcome of trials. The likely interaction between juror attitudes and the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 means that {{the influence of}} prejudicial attitudes in the jury may largely nullify the progressive intentions of this legislation. Potential measures to counter these negative social attitudes about rape are considered. However, it is argued that the deliberative process is an inadequate safeguard against prejudicial decision-making and that other measures, such as juror education, may be of limited efficacy. This thesis concludes that lay participation should be removed from the decision-making process in rape trials and replaced by a specialised judge based system. This outcome would be in line with the institutional responsibility of the criminal justice system to ensure the objective delivery of the law in practice, and that the cost to the complainer of pursing justice is not re-victimisation...|$|R

Avocado SEs of four cultivars remained healthy and viable in vitro for 11 months on a medium used for mango somatic embryogenesis, compared with 3 - 4 months on Murashige and Skoog medium. Various supplements and media modifications were investigated to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> conversion <b>rate</b> of regenerated plants from avocado SEs reported previously. The one-step system for regeneration of white-opaque somatic embryos (WOSEs) used solid medium only over a period of 12 - 14 weeks (sub-culturing every 6 weeks). Addition of praline and glutamine <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> total regeneration from 0 to 17. 5 % and 10. 5 %, and plant/shoot recovery from 0 to 12. 5 % and 5 %, respectively. A two-step culture system involving the transfer of WOSEs of cultivar 'Reed' after 6 weeks on solid to liquid medium for 12 - 15 days as an intermediate step, followed by subculturing again onto solid medium for 6 weeks improved total regeneration to 29 % and plant/shoot recovery to 18. 3 from 0 % when regenerated by subculturing on solid medium only. Supplementation with proline in the solid as well as liquid medium in the two-step culture system at 0. 4 g/L increased total regeneration to 35 % and plant/shoot recovery to 20 %. We were able to achieve highest regeneration using glutamine at 1 g/L in the two-step culture system in terms of both total regeneration (58. 3 %, including 43. 3 % bipolar regeneration) and plant/shoot recovery (36. 7 %) rates, which were significantly higher than in any other treatment investigated.

STUDY DESIGN [...] Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with follow up for 26 weeks. SUBJECTS [...] 629 smokers who had unsuccessfully attempted to stop smoking by using active transdermal nicotine and brief behavioural counselling. Smokers were motivated to quit smoking {{for a second time}} and smoked > or = 15 cigarettes a day. INTERVENTIONS [...] Twelve weeks' treatment with active transdermal nicotine patches or placebo and brief counselling at monthly visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Sustained smoking cessation for the 28 days before the visit at week 12 verified by expired carbon monoxide concentrations. RESULTS [...] At 12 weeks 21 / 315 (6. 7 %) subjects allocated to active treatment had stopped smoking compared with 6 / 314 (1. 9 %) allocated to placebo (absolute difference 4. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval 1. 6 % to 7. 9 %; P = 0. 003). At 26 weeks the rates were 20 / 315 (6. 4 %) and 8 / 314 (2. 6 %) (3. 8 %; 0. 6 % to 7. 0 %; P = 0. 021).

40|$|The 2004 Indonesia tsunami {{as well as}} the {{increasing}} storm frequency and intensity associated with climate changeâ€“sea-level rise have highlighted the coastal protection function, among the many goods and services that mangrove forests provide. This wider awareness of mangroves has increased national and international rehabilitation efforts, given only 15 million ha remaining and yearly rates of 1 â€“ 3 % loss. Rehabilitation programs employ two strategies: seafront planting and pond reversion. Seafront planting is necessary because coastal populations will not move to safer ground by choice, or cannot move due to poverty, and is also preferred because the sites are open access with no tenurial conflicts. However, former sites of fringing mangroves are difficult to rehabilitate as their lower intertidalâ€“subtidal levels are not optimal for mangroves (due to frequent inundation and wave action). Planting in tidal flats and seagrass beds is also ecologically misguided. This chapter evaluates the relevant mainstream and gray literature (on site and species selection, propagule sources, nursery protocols, outplanting techniques, biophysical/anthropogenic threats, and novel interventions, e. g., integrated approaches using barriers) to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> survival <b>rates</b> of seafront planting. However, this strategy should not preclude the long-term relocation of coastal communities to safer ground and the politically difficult option of pond reversion. Given thousands of hectares of underutilized and abandoned brackish water ponds in Southeast Asia, this option holds greater potential for rehabilitation of wide areas of mangroves and greater species diversity. It is ecologically easier as it merely requires restoring hydrology (by breaking pond dikes); mangrove recruitment and succession naturally follow (if propagule sources are present) in these ponds located at mid-upper intertidal levels where mangroves naturally occur. The Philippines, with its long history of mangroveâ€“pond conversion and problematic enforcement of laws that mandate mangrove reversion of idle ponds, is examined as a case study.

40|$|Background: In resource-poor settings, where {{health systems}} are {{frequently}} stretched to their capacity, access to emergency care is often limited. Triage {{systems have been}} proposed {{as a tool to}} ensure efficiency and optimal use of emergency resources in such contexts. However, evidence on the practice of emergency care and the implementation of triage systems in such settings, is scarce. This study aimed to assess emergency care provision in the Burao district hospital in Somaliland, including the application of the South African Triage Scale (SATS) tool. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken. Routine programme data of all patients presenting at the Emergency Department (ED) of Burao Hospital during its first year of service (January to December 2012) were analysed. The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) indicators were used as SATS targets for high priority emergency cases (“high acuity” proportion), overtriage and undertriage (with thresholds of > 25 %, < 50 % and < 10 %, respectively). Results: In 2012, among 7212 patients presented to the ED, 41 % were female, and 18 % were aged less than five. Only 21 % of these patients sought care at the ED within 24 hours of developing symptoms. The high acuity proportion was 22. 3 %, while the overtriage (40 %) and undertriage (9 %) rates were below the pre-set thresholds. The overall mortality rate was 1. 3 % and the abandon rate 2. 0 %. The outcomes of patients corresponds well with the color code assigned using SATS. Conclusion: This is the first study assessing the implementation of SATS in a post-conflict and resource-limited African setting showing that most indicators met the expected standards. In particular, specific attention is needed to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> relatively <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> of true emergency cases, delays in patient presentation and in timely provision of care within the ED. This study also highlights the need for development of emergency care thresholds that are more adapted to resource-poor contexts. These issues are discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{currently}} a need to assess the reasons for non-entry of eligible patients into surgical randomized controlled trials to determine measures to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> recruitment <b>rates</b> in such trials. METHODS: Reasons for non-entry of all eligible patients not recruited into the Australasian Laparoscopic Colon Cancer Study were prospectively recorded using a survey completed by the participating surgeons {{for a period of}} 6 months. RESULTS: In the 6 -month period of the study, 51 (45 %) out of 113 eligible patients examined by the 18 actively participating surgeons were recruited into the trial. Eighty-nine reasons were recorded for the non-entry of the 62 eligible patients. The most commonly recorded reason was preference for one form of surgery (42 %) or the surgeon (31 %) by the patient (45 patients (73 %) in total). This was followed by lack of time (10 patients (16 %)), hospital accreditation (7 patients (11 %)) or staffing/equipment (6 patients (10 %)). Concern about the doctor-patient relationship or causing the patient anxiety was recorded for three (5 %) and two (3 %) patients, respectively. Recruitment was positively associated with the availability of a data manager (chi 2 = 19. 91; P < 0. 001, odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 9. 50 (3. 53 - 25. 53)) and negatively associated with an increased caseload (more than five eligible patients seen by the surgeon in the study period) (continuity adjusted chi 2 = 16. 052; P < 0. 001, odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 11 (0. 04 - 0. 30)). CONCLUSION: Having a preference for one form of surgery by the patient or the surgeon was the most common reason for non-entry of eligible patients in the Australasian Laparoscopic Colon Cancer Study. Concern about the doctor-patient relationship played a minimal role in determining the outcome of recruitment. Patient and surgeon preferences, caseload and the distribution of supportive staff such as data managers according to patient population density should be considered in the planning of future trials.

5000|$|Richard Sander {{claims that}} artificially {{elevating}} minority students into schools they otherwise {{would not be}} capable of attending, discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students. For example, about half of black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of their classes, black law school graduates are four {{times as likely to}} fail bar exams as are whites, and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation; thus, blacks and Hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched. He claims that the supposed [...] "beneficiaries" [...] of affirmative action - minorities - do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy. Sander's claims have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism. A group including some of the country's lead statistical methodologists told the Supreme Court that Sander's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the Court would be wise to ignore them entirely. [...] A 2008 study by Jesse Rothstein and Albert H. Yoon confirmed Sander's mismatch findings, but also found that eliminating affirmative action would [...] "lead to a 63 percent decline in black matriculants at all law schools and a 90 percent decline at elite law schools." [...] These high numbers predictions were doubted in a review of previous studies by Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim. Their 2016 article found a strong indication that racial preference results in a mismatch effect. However, they argued that the attendance by some African-American law students to less-selective schools would significantly <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> first attempt <b>rate</b> at passing the state bar, but they cautioned that such improvements could be outweighed by decreases in law school attendance.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a revised technique of percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy for third occipital headache. Methods: The revisions included using a large gauge electrode, ensuring minimum separation between the three electrode placements, and holding the electrode in place by hand. The revised technique was used to treat 51 nerves in 49 patients diagnosed as suffering from third occipital headache {{on the basis of}} controlled diagnostic blocks of the third occipital nerve. The criteria for successful outcome were complete relief of pain for at least 90 days associated with restoration of normal activities of daily living, and no use of drug treatment for the headache. Results: Of the 49 patients, 43 (88 %) achieved a successful outcome. The median duration of relief in these patients was 297 days, with eight patients continuing to have ongoing relief. Fourteen patients underwent a repeat neurotomy to reinstate relief, with 12 (86 %) achieving a successful outcome. The median duration of relief in these patients was 217 days, with six patients having ongoing relief. Side effects of the procedure were consistent with coagulation of the third occipital nerve and consisted of slight ataxia, numbness, and temporary dysaesthesia. No side effects required intervention, and they were tolerated by the patients in exchange for the relief of headache. Conclusions: Use of the revised procedure greatly <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> rather <b>low</b> success <b>rate</b> previously encountered with third occipital neurotomy. Although the relief of headache is limited in duration, it is profound and can be reinstated by repeat neurotomy. No other form of treatment has been validated for this common form of headache...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} early fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline (NaCl, 0. 9 %) on uncontrolled hemorrhage in rats under different anesthetic conditions. SUMMARY/BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that administration of fluids to patients during uncontrolled hemorrhage may produce adverse effects, and a postponement of resuscitation until surgical control of bleeding was recommended. Past clinical trials were inconclusive, and the results of recent experimental studies were affected by use of vasoactive anesthetics. METHODS: One hundred thirty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: group 1 [...] unanesthetized; group 2 [...] anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital; and group 3 [...] anesthetized with a mixture of droperidol and ketamine. Uncontrolled hemorrhage was initiated with a 75 % tail resection, and each group was further subdivided into three subgroups for the following treatment: (A) no resuscitation; (B) 40 mL/kg of isotonic saline; or (C) 80 mL/kg of isotonic saline, administered 15 minutes after the initiation of hemorrhage. Blood loss volume and survival time were recorded, and animals were observed up to 360 minutes. RESULTS: At 6 hours, nonresuscitated animals of all groups exhibited the highest mortality rates (93 %, 73 %, 100 % in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Resuscitation significantly <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> survival; <b>lowest</b> mortality <b>rates</b> were observed after resuscitation with 80 mL/kg in groups 1 and 3 (33 %) and 40 mL/kg in group 2 (40 %). Fluid infusion increased hemorrhage rates in all anesthetized rats. No such increases in bleeding were observed in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation with isotonic saline improved mortality in uncontrolled hemorrhage, even with concomitant increases in hemorrhage rates, under all three anesthetic conditions tested. Unanesthetized rats bled less than the animals under anesthesia and did not exhibit an increased blood loss in response to fluid infusion...|$|R
40|$|Objectives—This report {{presents}} preliminary 1995 data on {{births and}} {{deaths in the}} United States from a new statistical series from the National Center for Health Statistics. U. S. data on births are shown by age, race, and Hispanic origin of mother. National and State data on marital status, prenatal care, cesarean delivery, and low birthweight are also presented. Mortality data presented include life expectancy, leading causes of death, and infant mortality. Methods—Data in this report are based on 80 – 90 -percent samples of 1995 births and deaths. The records are weighted to independent control counts of births, infant deaths, and total deaths registered in State vital statistics offices during 1995. Final data for 1995 may differ from the preliminary estimates. Results—Preliminary data show that births and birth and fertility rates generally declined in 1995, especially for teenagers (3 percent); the teen rate was 56. 9 births per 1, 000 women aged 15 – 19 years. The number, rate, and ratio of births to unmarried mothers all declined, {{the first time all}} measures have dropped simultaneously since 1940. For the sixth consecutive year, the cesarean delivery rate declined and the rate for prenatal care utilization <b>improved.</b> <b>The</b> overall <b>low</b> birthweight <b>rate</b> was unchanged at 7. 3 percent. The 1995 preliminary infant mortality rate reached a record low of 7. 5 infant deaths per 1, 000 live births, with record <b>lows</b> achieved for <b>the</b> white and black populations. Life expectancy matched the record high of 75. 8 years attained in 1992. The largest declines in age-adjusted death rates among the leading causes of death were for homicide, Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and accidents. Mortality also decreased for firearm injuries, drug-induced deaths, and alcohol-induced deaths. The age-adjusted death rate for diabetes increased. For the first time, the age-adjusted death rate for Human immunodeficiency virus infection did not increase...|$|R
5000|$|Sander {{is known}} for his {{research}} on affirmative action, which claims that it actually causes more negatives than benefits for African American law students by hurting them due to the overly competitive environments in more prestigious schools, through what he calls the [...] "mismatch effect". He published his research in a 2004 article in Stanford Law Review where he claimed that if minority students had been admitted into less-competitive schools for which they would qualify for without affirmative action, they would have been more successful. He has also published studies suggesting that law firms' efforts to promote diversity sometimes led to them hiring underqualified black lawyers, leading to these lawyers being more likely than their better-credentialed white counterparts to leave the firm. His research is controversial and has been widely criticized, including by Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks. Ayres and Brooks published a study in 2005 finding that eliminating affirmative action would not increase the number of black lawyers by 7.9 percent, as Sander's study had claimed, but that it would instead reduce the number of lawyers by about 12.7 percent. A 2008 study by Jesse Rothstein and Albert H. Yoon confirmed Sander's mismatch findings, but also found that eliminating affirmative action would [...] "lead to a 63 percent decline in black matriculants at all law schools and a 90 percent decline at elite law schools." [...] These high numbers predictions were doubted in the National Bureau of Economic Research article by Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim; a lower, 32.5 percent was another decrease cited and considered in the article. Their 2016 article found a strong indication that racial preference results in a mismatch effect.

40|$|Abstract Background In Ethiopia {{where there}} is no strong {{surveillance}} system and state of the art diagnostic facilities are limited, the real burden of tuberculosis (TB) is not well known. We conducted a community based survey to estimate the prevalence of pulmonary TB and spoligotype pattern of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A total of 30040 adults in 10882 households were screened for pulmonary TB in Gilgel Gibe field research centre in Southwest Ethiopia. A total of 482 TB suspects were identified and smear microscopy and culture was done for 428 TB suspects. Counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS was done for all TB suspects. Spoligotyping was done to characterize the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Results Majority of the TB suspects were females (60. 7 %) and non-literates (83. 6 %). Using smear microscopy, a total of 5 new and 4 old cases of pulmonary TB cases were identified making the prevalence of TB 30 per 100, 000. However, using the culture method, we identified 17 new cases with a prevalence of 76. 1 per 100, 000. There were 4. 3 undiagnosed pulmonary TB cases for every TB case who was diagnosed through the passive case detection mechanism in the health facility. Eleven isolates (64. 7 %) belonged to the six previously known spoligotypes: T, Haarlem and Central-Asian (CAS). Six new spoligotype patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not present in the international database (SpolDB 4) were identified. None of the rural residents was HIV infected and only 5 (5. 5 %) of the urban TB suspects were positive for HIV. Conclusion The prevalence of TB in the rural community of Southwest Ethiopia is low. There are large numbers of undiagnosed TB cases in the community. However, the number of sputum smear-positive cases was very <b>low</b> and therefore <b>the</b> risk of transmitting the infection to others may be limited. Active case finding through health extension workers in <b>the</b> community can <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> case detection <b>rate</b> in Ethiopia. A large scale study on the genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Ethiopia is crucial to understand transmission dynamics, identification of drug resistant strains and design preventive strategies. </p...|$|R
