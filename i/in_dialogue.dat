40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{differences}} between the prefaced expressions used <b>in</b> <b>dialogues</b> and readers' letters to newspaper editors. Based on research, we found the following differences. First, considering the use or non-use of prefaced expressions, it is obvious that many kinds of such expressions are used <b>in</b> <b>dialogues,</b> regardless of the status of the participants or the context of the communication. However, in letters to the editor, there are no prefaced expressions of apology or explanation. Second, after counting the number of prefaced expressions used, we found that those phrases expressing consideration (or care, respect, attention, etc.) for the addressee appear more frequently <b>in</b> <b>dialogues</b> than <b>in</b> letters. By contrast, the frequency of use of phrases expressing communication context is lower <b>in</b> <b>dialogues</b> than <b>in</b> letters...|$|R

5|$|Numerous {{others have}} been {{referenced}} <b>in</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Several former companions of the Doctor are referenced in the story Death of the Doctor, and the episode also includes brief on-screen flashbacks showing the Third, Fourth and Tenth Doctors. Companion Harry Sullivan is referenced separately <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> on several occasions and {{a photograph of the}} character is visible in one episode. In an issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Sophie Aldred was read an email from Russell T. Davies, in which he declared his plans to bring Ace into a story had the show continued. The episode Sky was originally to have featured the Eleventh Doctor, but Matt Smith was not available.|$|E

Belarus has trade agreements with several European Union member states (despite other member states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials), including neighboring Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Travel bans imposed by the European Union have been lifted in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups <b>in</b> <b>dialogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Morales {{appeared}} in the miniseries Spider-Men, in which he encounters the Spider-Man of the mainstream Marvel universe. In June 2013, the character {{appeared in}} the climax of Age of Ultron #10, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or Earth-616 {{as it is known}} <b>in</b> <b>dialogue,</b> the story depicts major changes to the space-time continuum {{as a result of the}} time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the coming of the mainstream Marvel Galactus, an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian film {{director}} Abbas Kiarostami {{is known for}} uses of certain themes and cinematic techniques that are instantly recognizable in his work, {{from the use of}} child protagonists and stories that take place in rural villages, to conversations that unfold inside cars utilizing stationary mounted cameras.

5|$|The film {{features}} heavy product placement, with American Airlines, Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels all featured prominently. Competing brands {{are displayed}} as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms <b>in</b> <b>dialogue.</b> However, the brands {{did not pay}} for the exposure; rather, they waived the fees for the producers to shoot on location, such as at AA's airport areas and inside Hilton hotels. Reitman expressed his desire to use actual brands as he finds them less distracting.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad.

5|$|While Kline was {{concerned}} with lighting, print quality, and color, Bonnie Prendergast, the script supervisor, took notes that would be written up after the company had finished for the day. Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving {{as fast as possible}} and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.|$|E

5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game.

As in the first three Broken Sword games, the death of the player character is possible in The Angel of Death.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

25|$|The 'doctrine of reserve' <b>in</b> the <b>dialogues.</b> There are {{numerous}} passages <b>in</b> the <b>dialogues</b> <b>in</b> which an especially important theme is introduced but then not further discussed. In many cases, the conversation breaks off just where it approaches {{the crux of}} the issue. These often concern questions which are of fundamental significance for philosophy. The defenders of the Tübingen School interpret these instances of 'reserve' as pointers to the content of the unwritten doctrines, which cannot be directly handled <b>in</b> written <b>dialogues.</b>|$|R
5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's guilt over her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her guilt over the affair, she is unable to express her love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage <b>in</b> <b>dialogue</b> with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action choices in the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E
50|$|Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, is {{the oldest}} {{independent}} journal <b>in</b> Mormon Studies. <b>Dialogue</b> was originally {{the creation of a}} group of young Mormon scholars at Stanford University led by Eugene England, and G.
