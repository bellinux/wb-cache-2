40|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} of enterovirus infection in pediatrics presented with hand–foot–mouth disease and oral ulcers. A {{few of these}} patients had manifestations of polio like encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis. Aim of the work: The aim of our study was to highlight the MR imaging features of enterovirus infection {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. Patients: 25 patients with hand–foot–mouth disease and clinical diagnosis of encephalitis were included in this study. Methods: It is a retrospective study with respect to the confidentiality of the medical record. The patients were exposed to MR imaging with T 1 WI images pre and post contrast, and T 2 WI MR images, FLAIR, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were obtained in all patients. Enterovirus culture confirmation was available in some cases. Results: MR imaging of the 25 patients revealed 5 patients with normal MRI brain examination. T 2 hyperintensity within the brain stem was seen in 16 patients, while 2 patients showed cervical cord lesions and two patients with dentate nuclei lesions. Conclusion: <b>Enterovirus</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> has characteristic lesion locations in the posterior portions of the brain stem, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus and within the anterior horns of spinal cord. Recognition of these findings in the presence of suggestive clinical presentation can help to establish the diagnosis of <b>enterovirus</b> <b>encephalomyelitis...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this Issues Paper are to document existing {{policy and the}} scope of the non-routine analysis of the risks associated with the importation of pig meat, and to identify the hazards to be considered in the import risk analysis. The non-routine import risk analysis of pig meat is ‘generic ’ in that (a) it is not restricted to specific exporting countries, and, (b) import conditions which may be developed will be relevant to each exporting country’s animal health status. Background issues are outlined in the first three sections of this document. Hazard identification is described in the fourth section, and yielded the list of disease agents shown below. In the final section of the document, technical information concerning each identified hazard is provided. It is envisaged that a risk assessment will be carried out for each identified hazard and documented in the ensuing Draft IRA Report. List A Diseases/Agents: Foot-and-mouth disease virus Vesicular stomatitis virus Swine vesicular disease virus Rinderpest virus African swine fever virus Classical swine fever virus List B Diseases/Agents: Aujeszky's disease virus Rabies virus Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) Haemorrhagic septicaemia (Pasteurella multocida) Japanese encephalitis virus Surra (Trypanosoma evansi) Venezuelan, Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis Teschen disease (<b>Enterovirus</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus) Porcine brucellosis (Brucella suis) Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus Transmissible gastroenteritis virus Trichinellosis (Trichinella spiralis) Other Diseases/agents: Cysticercosis (Cysticercus cellulosae...|$|E
