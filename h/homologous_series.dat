25|$|In organic chemistry, an alkyne is an {{unsaturated}} hydrocarbon containing {{at least one}} carbon—carbon triple bond. The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a <b>homologous</b> <b>series</b> with the general chemical formula n2n−2.

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau de Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Any: 2016, Tutor: Joaquín F. Pérez de BenitoMany kinetic studies {{concerning}} <b>homologous</b> reaction <b>series</b> {{report the}} existence of an activation enthalpy-entropy linear correlation (compensation plot), its slope being the temperature at which {{all the members of the}} series have the same rate constant (isokinetic temperature). Unfortunately, it has been demonstrated by statistical methods that the experimental errors associated with the activation enthalpy and entropy are mutually interdependent. Therefore, the possibility that some of those correlations might be caused by accidental errors has been explored by numerical simulations. As a result of this study, a computer program has been developed to evaluate the probability that experimental errors might lead to a linear compensation plot parting from an initial randomly scattered set of activation parameters (p-test). Application of this program to kinetic data for 100 <b>homologous</b> reaction <b>series</b> extracted from bibliographic sources has allowed concluding that most of the reported compensation plots can hardly be explained by the accumulation of experimental errors, thus requiring {{the existence of}} a previously existing, physically meaningful correlatio...|$|R

25|$|In general, the alkaline-earth metals form {{silicides}} {{with the}} following stoichiometries: MII2Si, MIISi, and MIISi2.

25|$|The silanes {{comprise}} a <b>homologous</b> <b>series</b> of silicon hydrides {{with the general}} formula SinH2n+2. They are all strong reducing agents. Unbranched and branched trains are known up to n = 8, and the cycles Si5H10 and Si6H12 are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after eight months have passed). They decompose to form polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen gas. As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more volatile than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitates nucleophilic attack at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si–H bond compared to the C–H bond, {{and the ability of}} silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's activation energy.|$|E

40|$|Most {{operations}} {{decisions are}} based {{on some kind of}} forecast of future demand. Thus, forecasting is definitely a very traditional area in the operations and inventory management literature. While literature concerning forecast explores the adoption ofvarious qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper tries to design new solutions to improve forecasting accuracy by focusing on the forecasting process that uses such algorithms. In particular, when forecasting demand one should always make clear exactly what he/she is trying to forecast, in terms of the time bucket (i. e., the period oftime over which demand is aggregated), the forecasting horizon, the set ofitems the demand refers to (e. g., forecasting demand for a single item can be much harder than forecasting demand for a group of items), the set of locations the demand refers to (e. g., demand at the single store level is much less predictable than the demand for a whole chain ofstores). Traditionally, these features ofthe final output off orecasting also influence the forecasting process. Indeed, when one wants to forecast demand at single store single item single day level it seems natural to analyse demand and causal factors at the same level of aggregation. On the contrary, in this paper we aim at showing that, first of all often aggregating and/or disaggregating data in the forecasting process can lead to substantial improvements; second, the choice ofthe appropriate level ofaggregation depends on the underlying demand generation process. In addition, most forecasting algorithms tend to focus on a single demand variable. On the contrary, we can analyse analogous time series to improve the effectiveness of the forecasting process. Clustering techniques can be used to identify such <b>homologous</b> time <b>series.</b> Such clusters of <b>homologous</b> time <b>series</b> can provide, on the one hand, the sample size required to gain good statistical confidence and, on the other hand, relatively homogeneous data.

40|$|We {{describe}} a computational solvation model called semi-explicit assembly (SEA). SEA water captures {{much of the}} physics of explicit-solvent models but with computational speeds approaching those of implicit-solvent models. We use an explicit-water model to precompute properties of water solvation shells around simple spheres, then assemble a solute’s solvation shell by combining the shells of these spheres. SEA improves upon implicit-solvent models of solvation free energies by accounting for local solute curvature, accounting for near-neighbor nonadditivities, and treating water’s dipole as being asymmetrical with respect to positive or negative solute charges. SEA does not involve parameter fitting, because parameters come from the given underlying explicit-solvation model. SEA is about as accurate as explicit simulations as shown by comparisons against four different <b>homologous</b> alkyl <b>series,</b> a set of 504 varied solutes, solutes taken retrospectively from two solvation-prediction events, and a hypothetical polar-solute series, and SEA is about 100 -fold faster than Poisson–Boltzmann calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{specificity}} of interactions between pairs of molecules cannot be explicitly given by experimental transport coefficients such as intra- or mutual diffusion coefficients.

The analysis based on these novel DDCs is designed to study intermolecular interaction between macromolecule and solvent.
