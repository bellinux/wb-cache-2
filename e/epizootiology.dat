40|$|In practice, <b>epizootiology</b> {{deals with}} how parasites spread through host populations, how rapidly the spread occurs {{and whether or}} not {{epizootics}} result. Prevalence, incidence, factors that permit establishment of infection, host response to infection, parasite fecundity and methods of transfer are, therefore, aspects of <b>epizootiology.</b> Indeed, most aspects of a parasite could be related in sorne way to <b>epizootiology,</b> but many of these topics are best considered in other contexts. General patterns of transmission, adaptations that facilitate transmission, establishment of infection and occurrence of epizootics are discussed in this chapter. When life cycles are unknown, little progress can be made in understanding the epizootiological aspects of any group of parasites. At the time Meyer 2 ̆ 7 s monograph was completed (1933), intermediate hosts were known for only 17 species of Acanthocephala, and existing descriptions are not sufficient to permit identification of two of those. Laboratory infections of intermediate hosts had apparently been produced for only two species. Study at that time was primarily devoted to species descriptions, host and geographical distribution, structure and ontogeny. Little or nothing was known about adaptations that promote transmission and the concept of paratenic hosts was unclear. In spite of the paucity of information, Meyer (1932) summarized pathways of transmission among principal groups of hosts, visualized the relationships among life cycle patterns for the major groups of Acanthocephala, and devised models for the hypothetical origin of terrestrial life cycles from aquatic ones. Nevertheless, most of our knowledge regarding <b>epizootiology</b> has been recently acquired...|$|E
40|$|Intensive cattle {{breeding}} implies {{the implementation of}} contemporary technological - organizational principles {{and the use of}} specialized genotypes of cattle with high production potential. The objective of our investigations was to determine, through epizootiological analysis of quarantine facilities for imported breeding pigs and internal sales of pigs the faults which lead to economic damages or even the spread of contagious diseases. Epizootiological investigations were carried out in four quarantine facilities for imported breeding pigs. Epizootiological investigations were conducted also in eight cases of internal sales. The following factors were considered during the epizootiological investigations: epizootiological observations of quarantine conditions minute records of <b>epizootiologies</b> and minute records of the republican veterinary inspector...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Chlamydia pecorum and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in two free-range koala populations {{was assessed using}} genus-specific PCR combined with species-specific DNA probe hybridisation. Population A had a very high overall level of chlamydial infection (85 %) with significantly more of these infections being due to C. pecorum (73 %) compared to C. pneumoniae (24 %). The second population had a much lower {{prevalence of}} infection (10 %) with equal levels of both species. An important {{finding of this study}} was that, while five of 24 C. pecorum-infected koalas had clinical signs of the disease (both ocular and urogenital sites), none out of seven C. pneumoniae-infected koalas had signs of clinical disease. This suggests that C. pecorum may be the more pathogenic of the two chlamydial species infecting this host. The level of infection (assessed by intensity of the specific hybridisation signal) also differed between chlamydial species, with C. pecorum infections ranging from low to high grade whereas C. pneumoniae infections were always low grade. When the age of infected koalas was examined, 58 % of young, sexually immature koalas were found to have C. pecorum infections, increasing to 100 % of koalas in the older age groups. This suggests that, in this population at least, young koalas are readily infected with C. pecorum from their mothers. While the infection levels with C. pneumoniae were too low to be statistically significant, again, sexually immature koalas were found to be infected. The recent separation of chlamydial infections in koalas into two species is beginning to indicate different <b>epizootiologies</b> for koala C. pecorum compared to koala C. pneumoniae.

40|$|Populations of wildfowl {{have been}} {{categorised}} taxonomically into five families: Phasianidae, Tetraonidae, Scolopacidae, Otidae and Anatidae. They {{are of particular}} importance for agriculture, forestry and the game economy, and certain species also {{have an important role}} in the <b>epizootiology</b> of parasitic infections in domestic fowl and fish. That is why it is extremely important for the process of promoting the system of animal health protection to have knowledge regarding the etiology and <b>epizootiology</b> of parasitic infections in wildfowl. Diseases in wildfowl caused by protozoa are histomoniasis, trichomoniasis, malaria, coccidiosis, cryptosporidiosis, sarcocystosis, toxoplasmosis, and giardiasis. The most represented helminthiases in wildfowl are singamosis, capillariasis, trichostrongyliasis, ascaridiosis, heteraciosis, nematodosis of the glandular stomach, cestodoses and trematodoses. The most significant ectoparasites in wildfowl are mites, ticks, and fleas. The reduction of populations of certain widlfowl species in nature could present a major problem, having in mind the important role of these birds in ecosystems and biocenosis.

40|$|Ecological <b>epizootiology</b> is {{the study}} of {{environmental}} influences on the health of animals including disease incidence, persistence and transmission. It is a conceptual approach that unifies molecular biology, environmental sciences, and epidemiology for the purpose of identifying causes, classifying risks, and controlling health problems. Ecological <b>epizootiology</b> has been successfully applied in terrestrial systems, but its adaptation to marine ecosystems is relatively new. My dissertation uses this approach to evaluate the role of marine aggregates (i. e., marine snow, organic aggregates, flocs) in the ecology of Quahog Parasite X (QPX), a disease of northern quahogs (=hard clam), Mercenaria mercenaria. Marine aggregates are a ubiquitous feature of aquatic ecosystems, but have no terrestrial counterpart. They have the potential to serve as a link between aquatic pathogens (e. g., QPX) and benthic hosts (e. g., hard clams) in two ways: (1) as environmental reservoirs for pathogens embedded in aggregates; and (2) as vectors for aggregate-bound pathogens transported between hosts. The results of this research include the descriptive <b>epizootiology</b> of QPX disease in hard clams, along with the first quantitative assay for the QPX organism, and data to support QPX as a facultative pathogen. Evidence that QPX is facultative is critical because it supports that once QPX is established in a location, eradication will be difficult because QPX is capable of surviving on environmental resources other than hard clams. In this research, marine aggregates were characterized using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of suspended aggregates in modified settling cones. The results provide a starting point for determining the temporal and spatial scales at which aggregates influence persistence and transmission of aquatic pathogens. Overall, these results have important implications for the way in which aquatic pathogens are collected, quantified, and monitored for water quality assessments in shallow-water ecosystems. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a comprehensive process-based model simulating the <b>epizootiology</b> and agronomic efficacy of baculoviruses used for biological control of beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, in greenhouse chrysanthemum. The model is built to help understand, evaluate, and predict the effects of genetic modification, formulation, and application strategy of a baculovirus on its <b>epizootiology</b> and agronomic efficacy in a greenhouse cropping system. The model was constructed such that the impact of detailed aspects of the virus–host relationship, cropping system, spraying regime, and insect ecology on control could be evaluated. The resulting model is highly detailed, covers four spatial scales, from the leaf to the greenhouse, and addresses spatially explicit processes at the individual level and spatially averaged population processes. Submodels {{describe the}} crop production system and plant growth, the distribution and dispersal of insects within the crop canopy, spray deposition, uptake of virus, the probability of death and survival time of infected insects, and vertical and horizontal transmission.
