40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{behavior of}} osmotic dehydration and mass transfer of tilapia fillet in sucrose solution, the changes of moisture content (MC), solid gain (SG) were quantitatively determined during osmotic treatments of fresh tilapia fillets with the sucrose solution concentration (20 - 40 %), temperature (20 - 30), fillet thickness (1 - 5 mm) and osmotic time (1 - 8 h) {{as the independent}} treatment factors. Results were as follows: First, MC of <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> decreased, and SG of <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> increased with increasing of the concentration of sucrose solution. Second, the osmotic dehydration of <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> was fast during the first hour and slowed during the 2 nd or 4 th hour. Third, the dehydration and SG of <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> increased with increasing of treatment temperature, but influence of temperature on osmotic dehydration and SG was decreasing with increasing of the concentration of sucrose solution. Finally, a thinner fillet was found to own higher of dehydration and SG than a thicker one...|$|R
