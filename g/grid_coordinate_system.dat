50|$|In this method, {{proposed}} by Philipp Lindner and Gerd Wanielik, laser data is processed using a multidimensional occupancy grid. Data from a 4 layer laser is pre-processed at the signal level and then processed {{at a higher}} level to extract the features of the obstacles. A combination 2- and 3-dimensional grid structure is utilized and the space in these structures is tessellated into several discrete cells. This method allows a huge amount of raw measurement data to be effectively handled by collecting it in spatial containers, the cells of the evidence grid. Each cell is associated with a probability measure that identifies the cell occupation. This probability is calculated by using the range measurement of the lidar sensor obtained over time and a new range measurement, which are related using Bayes' theorem. A two dimensional grid can observe an obstacle in front of it, but cannot observe the space behind the obstacle. TO address this, the unknown state behind the obstacle is assigned a probability of 0.5. By introducing the third dimension or in other terms using a multi-layer laser, the spatial configuration of an object could be mapped into the grid structure to a degree of complexity. This is achieved by transferring the measurement points into a 3 dimensional grid. The grid cells which are occupied will possess a probability greater than 0.5 and the mapping would be color coded based on the probability. The cells which are not occupied will possess a probability less than 0.5 and this area will usually be white space. This measurement is then transformed to a <b>grid</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> by using the sensor position on the vehicle and the vehicle position in the world coordinate system. The coordinates of the sensor depends upon its location on the vehicle and the coordinates of the vehicle is computed using egomotion estimation, which is estimating the vehicle motion relative to a rigid scene. For this method, the grid profile must be defined. The grid cells touched by the transmitted laser beam are calculated by applying Bresenham's line algorithm. To obtain the spatial extended structure, a connected component analysis of these cells is performed. This information is then passed on to a rotating caliper algorithm to obtain the spatial characteristics of the object. In addition to the lidar detection, RADAR data obtained by using two short range radars is integrated to get additional dynamic properties of the object, such as its velocity. The measurements are assigned to the object using a potential distance function.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Three small scales of CIR photography were interpreted {{to determine the}} number of bark beetle-killed trees detected in each of six spot size categories. A procedure was developed to predict the probability of detecting spots in each spot size category and in turn to estimate the number of infestations and dead trees even on the smallest scale. Statistical tests of the data indicated that the linear model did not fit the data and that other models should be tested. As a result of daily monitoring of Black Hills radiometric instruments it was possible to show the spectral energy relationships in the ponderosa pine ecosystems over time. These data have been helpful for comparison with radiance signatures extracted from ERTS- 1 bulk 70 mm using precision microdensitometry. Effects of atmospheric interference were shown by a 30 percent increase in scene radiance on channel 4 of the satellite imagery.

40|$|The GOES-R Flight Project has {{developed}} an Image Navigation and Registration (INR) Performance Assessment Tool Set (IPATS) for measuring Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) INR performance metrics in the post-launch period for performance evaluation and long term monitoring. For ABI, these metrics are the 3 -sigma errors in navigation (NAV), channel-to-channel registration (CCR), frame-to-frame registration (FFR), swath-to-swath registration (SSR), and within frame registration (WIFR) for the Level 1 B image products. For GLM, the single metric of interest is the 3 -sigma error in the navigation of background images (GLM NAV) used by the system to navigate lightning strikes. 3 -sigma errors are estimates of the 99. 73 rd percentile of the errors accumulated over a 24 hour data collection period. IPATS utilizes a modular algorithmic design to allow user selection of data processing sequences optimized for generation of each INR metric. This novel modular approach minimizes duplication of common processing elements, thereby maximizing code efficiency and speed. Fast processing is essential given {{the large number of}} sub-image registrations required to generate INR metrics for the many images produced over a 24 hour evaluation period.

Specifically, a two-stage BD-based optimization problem is designed to handle data uncertainties. In the first stage, the nonlinear OPF model for AC/DC grids is reformulated as a master problem and solved by a large-scale nonlinear programming solver, i.e., the interior-point optimizer (IPOPT). Nevertheless, the SOCP formulation for a natural gas system is considered a subproblem and is solved by a convex optimization solver, i.e., the Gurobi. It is noteworthy that each subproblem represents a gas-supply scenario; as a result, the effects of gas-supply uncertainty on GFUs can be evaluated. In addition, owing to the SOCP formulation of the subproblems, the original nonconvex and nonlinear formulation is transformed to a convex optimization problem and can be solved in polynomial time.|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{modeling}} {{requires the}} delineation of system boundaries and interior features. Quite often, these components {{are complex and}} difficult to accurately represent. A rectangular grid is used to represent the study and adjacent non-study areas in most cases. When the non-study area occupies {{a large portion of}} the grid, computer memory is wasted, and computational time increases. An elliptical grid generator for non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates is used to generate a boundary-fitted grid for a landscape model. In a boundary-fitted <b>grid</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system,</b> one coordinate axis follows the landscape domain boundary and is non-orthogonal to the second axis. The boundary-fitted grid uses elliptic partial differential equa- tions to distribute grid points inside the landscape domain. Although the boundary-fitted grid follows the domain boundary, the grid pattern and point allocation reinain structured. Thus, a landscape model can use a boundary-fitted grid without changing the model's data structure or the computational scheme. In this study, a boundary-fitted grid and a raster-based grid were applied to the Everglades Landscape Fire Mod- el. Use of the boundary-fitted grid decreased simulation time by about one fifth and computer stor- age by 58 % relative to the raster-based grid. Also, the linear characteristics of interior geographical fea- tures such as rivers and airboat trails were preserved by the boundary-fitted grid, but not by the based grid.

40|$|Global river {{models are}} an {{essential}} tool for both earth system studies and water resources assessments. As advanced physical processes {{have been implemented}} in global river models, increasing computational cost has become problematic for executing ensemble or long-term simulations. To improve computational efficiency, we here propose {{the use of a}} local inertial flow equation combined with a vector-based river network map. A local inertial equation, a simplified formulation of the shallow water equations, was introduced to replace a diffusion wave equation. A vector-based river network map which flexibly discretizes river segments was adopted in order to replace the traditional grid-based map which is based on a Cartesian <b>grid</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> The computational efficiency of the proposed flow routing and river network map was tested by executing hydrodynamic simulations with the CaMa-Flood global river model. The simulation results suggest that the computational efficiency can be improved by more than 300 % by applying the local inertial equation. It can be improved by a further 60 % by implementing the vector-based river network map instead of a grid-based map. It is found that the vector-based map with evenly distributed flow distances between calculation units allows longer time steps compared to the grid-based map because the latter has very short flow distances between calculation units at high latitudes which critically limit time step length. Considering the improvement in simulation speed, the local inertial equation and a vector-based river network map are preferable in global hydrodynamic simulations with high computational demands such as ensemble or long-term experiments...|$|E

Every element of n-th level (n ≥ 0) is in partial order relation with every element of the (n + 1) -th level but it’s not with any element from the level in which he lies (n-th level) except from it.
