Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: [...] "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make sure you <b>get</b> <b>plenty</b> of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ida Skelton, {{who held}} {{multiple}} jobs {{to support her}} family {{after the death of}} her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but [...] "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined [...] "Doc" [...] R.E. Lewis's traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>plenty</b> to eat, and we sleep in the wagon." ...|$|E

500|$|Hall of Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 14 reviews. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly positively compared the album {{to the late}} 90's releases by Bad Boy and said that Big Sean easily outshines all the featured artists on the album. At USA Today, Edna Gunderson called this, an [...] "outstanding second album" [...] that he [...] "occasionally stumbles" [...] in an effort that is a [...] "smart set of slick club thumpers, tear-jerkers and introspective yarns." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented saying, [...] "The Detroit MC gets over on congeniality and crisp delivery, even when his lyrics are pro forma." [...] He also praised the album's production. At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff noted that [...] "Hall of Fame is still a solid, confident and diverse set that shows how much he's grown as both an MC and a writer since 'Finally Famous' came out in 2011." [...] Andrea Aguilar of HipHopDX summarized the album stating, [...] "As a whole, the feel-good album's set of eclectic beats doesn't disappoint, but it lacks diversity. Most of Sean's content still teems with predictable material risking leaving listeners disinterested. Random skits also slightly interrupt {{the flow of the}} album, but if you're looking for motivational music centered on the money, the cars, the clothes and hoes, this album is sure to <b>get</b> <b>plenty</b> of replays on your iPod and local radio stations alike." ...|$|E

As a form of treatment, the unnamed woman is forbidden from working, and is encouraged to eat well and <b>get</b> <b>plenty</b> of exercise and air, so she can recuperate from what he calls a [...] "temporary nervous depression – a slight hysterical tendency", a diagnosis common to women in that period. She hides her journal from her husband and his sister the housekeeper, fearful of being reproached for overworking herself. The room's windows are barred to prevent children from climbing through them, and there is a gate {{across the top of the}} stairs, though she and her husband have access to the rest of the house and its adjoining estate.|$|E

2500|$|Howard & King {{claim that}} the TRPF was mostly [...] "neglected" [...] in Marxist {{theoretical}} discussions during the 1920s, and Callinicos & Choonera {{claim that the}} TRPF actually played a [...] "marginal" [...] role {{in much of the}} whole history of Marxist economics. During the British general strike of 1926, for example, {{there was no evidence of}} English discussion about the TRPF. In [...] the non-English Marxist literature, however, the TRPF did <b>get</b> <b>plenty</b> attention, except that the TRPF was never seen as the [...] "be all and end all" [...] of crisis theory. When Henryk Grossman published his famous 1929 breakdown theory, he intended to correct faults in the 1920s theoretical debates among Nikolai Bukharin, Otto Bauer, Rosa Luxemburg, Fritz Sternberg and others about the dynamics of capitalist growth. [...] "Unlike Marx's diagrams, Bauer's diagram includes the rising organic composition of capital, a falling rate of profit, a rising mass of profit, and the faster development of Department I – the department that produces the means of production – relative to Department II – the branch that produces the means of personal consumption." ...|$|E
