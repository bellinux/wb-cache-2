5|$|After Archer {{recklessly}} foils an Irish terrorist's {{attempt to}} assassinate a British nobleman, Malory begins {{to suspect that}} Lana's feelings for her son are resurfacing. Hoping to readjust Lana's desires so they are steered towards her current boyfriend, Cyril, she asks Archer to train {{him to be a}} field agent. Archer <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> their scheme though, and tries to set Cyril up to fail to sabotage his relationship with Lana, Archer's ex. At one point, Cyril inquiries about Archer’s lack of ethics, and ease of deception. To which Archer’s replies “lying is, like, 95% of what I do.” One of his sessions involves trying to kill an assassin (portrayed by Archer's butler, Woodhouse) and using a dance partner (played by a prostitute Archer has befriended) as a human shield. During the session, however, Cyril accidentally poisons the prostitute and both he and Archer pronounce her deceased.|$|E

The compound ascaridole in epazote inhibits the growth of nearby plants, so {{it would be best to}} relegate this plant at a distance from other inhabitants of the herb garden. Even though this plant has an established place in recipes and in folklore, it <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> use only the leaves, and those very sparingly, in cooking.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{historical}} {{sources for}} The Mercenary War {{suffers from the}} same problem as any history of Carthage: Few primary sources of Carthaginian history exist, except as fragments in translation quoted by Roman and Greek historians. The main extant account of the Mercenary War is that of Polybius, a Greek historian writing many years after the events portrayed here. While {{it is likely that}} he based much of his account on now-lost works of prior Greek and Roman historians, it is unlikely that they had an unbiased view of Carthage and its history. When reading such history it <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> take this into account. We have the best historical reconstruction that we can derive, but we must also remember that its balance and objectivity is in question.|$|E

25|$|The last group {{match was}} a thrilling {{match for the}} both teams, where Sri Lanka came as the {{favorites}} to win the match. Skipper Chandimal was out of play due to some injuries, so Lasith Malinga captained the match. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is not a huge task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, and Corey Anderson. During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started pretty well with Guptill and Kane Williamson. At this time, Malinga decided to go with Rangana Herath, who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner {{is not at all}} interested. The bowler <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. he stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals.|$|E
500|$|Sam then meets Rebecca Howe, {{who is the}} {{new manager}} of Cheers and almost {{immediately}} turned off by him based on the rumors of Sam's [...] "sexual prowess". Rebecca uses Sam's former office as her own and, {{although it has been}} completely renovated, Sam is able to use Carla's tricks to overhear Rebecca talking to her boss Evan Drake, on whom she has a crush. Evan knows Sam as a baseball player and wants to hire him to be a bartender. Sam is then hired, but one of the two current bartenders must be sacked to make room for him. The bar regulars want Wayne to go, but Rebecca wants to fire Woody. A competition then ensues to see if Wayne actually knows how to make every drink known. If Wayne loses the bet, he agrees to leave, but if he wins the bet, then he gets Sam's now-damaged sailboat. The gang plays a prank to cause Wayne to lose over the then-fictional cocktail [...] "Screaming Viking" [...] and he walks out, though Rebecca <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> their game, gives Sam his severance check and tells Sam to leave. Sam then promises nothing of the sort will occur again and is provisionally re-hired on the understanding that this is his last chance as Rebecca uses a seductive baseball metaphor-pun about having two outs, two strikes and [...] "no balls".|$|E
500|$|In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse {{concentrated}} on the moral arguments in the book, and agreed with Hitchens that [...] "to determine {{what is right and}} what is wrong without God, is difficult". [...] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book [...] "tries to do two things at once. One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, [...] "One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing that so-called [...] "religious" [...] wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion." [...] In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, [...] "Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently", but [...] "makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that [...] "atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, [...] "Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that [...] "it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God"; and that [...] "atheist states are not actually atheist". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as [...] "a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture".|$|E

2500|$|Ferdowsi did {{not expect}} his readers to pass over {{historical}} events indifferently, but asked them to think carefully, to see the grounds for {{the rise and fall}} of individuals and nations; and to learn from the past in order to improve the present, and to better shape the future. [...] Ferdowsi stresses his belief that since the world is transient, and since everyone is merely a passerby, one <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> avoid cruelty, lying, avarice, and other evils; instead one should strive for justice, honor, truth, order, and other virtues.|$|E

2500|$|Players {{raised on}} {{international}} chess often make poor use of drops, but dropping {{is half the}} game. If a player {{has more than a}} couple of captured pieces in hand, it is likely that dropping attacks are being overlooked. However, it <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> keep a pawn in hand, and often to exchange pieces if necessary to get one. [...] Compared with international chess players, shogi players are more likely to sacrifice pieces, even powerful ones, if the resulting capture can be dropped back into play for a specific purpose.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, Emmet Keeler and Joel Spencer {{considered}} {{the question of}} when to double or accept a double using an idealized version of backgammon. [...] In their idealized version, the probability of winning varies randomly over time by Brownian motion, {{and there are no}} gammons or backgammons. [...] They showed that the optimal time to offer a double was when the probability of winning reached 80%, and it <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> accept a double only if the probability of winning is at least 20%. [...] As their assumptions do not correspond perfectly to the real game, actual doubling strategy may vary, but the 80% number still provides a possible rule of thumb.|$|E
2500|$|The Seven Years' War (1756–63) began {{somewhat}} inauspiciously for the Navy, with a French {{siege of}} Minorca {{and the failure}} of Admiral John Byng to relieve it; he was executed on his own quarterdeck. Voltaire famously wrote, in reference to Byng's execution, that [...] "in this country it <b>is</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> kill an admiral {{from time to time to}} encourage the others" [...] (admirals). (Today the French phrase [...] "pour encourager les autres" [...] used in English euphemistically connotes a threat by example.) Minorca was lost but subsequent operations went more successfully (due more to government support and better strategic thinking, rather than admirals [...] "encouraged" [...] by Byng's example), and the British fleet won several victories. The French tried to invade Britain in 1759 but their force was defeated at Quiberon Bay off the coast of Brittany. Spain entered the war against Britain in 1762 but lost Havana and Manila, though the latter was given back in exchange for Florida. The Treaty of Paris that ended the war left Britain with colonial gains, but isolated strategically.|$|E
