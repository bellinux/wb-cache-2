50|$|Stoplogs are {{hydraulic}} engineering control {{elements that are}} used in floodgates to adjust the water level or discharge in a river, canal, or reservoir. Stoplogs are sometimes confused with flashboards, as both elements are used in bulkhead or crest gates. Stoplogs are typically long rectangular timber beams or boards that are placed {{on top of each other}} and dropped into premade slots inside a weir, gate, or channel. Present day, the process of adding and removing stoplogs is not manual, but done with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>stop</b> log lifters and hoists. Since the height of the barrier can only be adjusted through the addition and removal of stoplogs, finding a lighter and stronger material other than wood or concrete became a more desirable choice. Other materials, including steel and composites, can be used as stoplogs as well. Stoplogs are designed to cut off or stop flow through a conduit.|$|E

50|$|Largely {{because of}} its mass, a train {{transfers}} {{an enormous amount of}} kinetic energy in a collision with a buffer stop. Rigid buffers can only safely cope with very low-speed impacts (i.e., nearly stationary). To improve stopping performance, a way of dissipating this energy is needed, through compression or friction.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} power steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than {{hydraulic power}} steering, since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of {{hydraulic power steering}} fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas <b>hydraulic</b> assistance <b>stops</b> working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R
40|$|Like {{many small}} coastal {{towns in the}} UK, Sidmouth in Devon was founded on the valley sides {{adjacent}} to a river outfall that provided a natural harbour. Subsequent expansion of the town in the late 18 th and early 19 th centuries, when living by or visiting the sea became popular for health reasons, involved the entrainment {{of the river and}} building on land that was subject to marine flooding. Engineering works in the 19 th and 20 th centuries that were designed to protect the low-lying parts of the town included the construction of sea walls, and groynes and offshore bunds to protect a ridge of storm-beach gravels that acts as a natural sea defence. These works have collectively had an effect on erosion rates in the cliffs of Triassic sandstone and mudstone {{on the east side of}} the town. Natural landslide mechanisms in the cliffs adjacent to Sidmouth include rock-block and toppling failures induced by marine undercutting, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>stoping</b> along faults and major joints at the foot of the cliffs. The principal landslide mechanism is the collapse of unconsolidated Head deposits and deeply weathered mudstones in the highest (mostly 3 to 5 m) part of the cliff. The falling material commonly destabilises the underlying well-jointed sandstones and mudstones. Artificial factors that have influenced erosion rates in the cliffs east of the River Sid outfall in the last 100 years have included the refraction of waves adjacent to the end of the river wall, and interference with the easterly longshore drift of the beach gravels. A secondary factor has been the destabilising influence of a Victorian railway tunnel that was dug parallel to and up to 25 m from the cliff face on the east side of the town. In the absence of quantitative monitoring data, published estimates of the rates of cliff erosion are significantly higher than those obtained in the present study from a comparison of maps made between 1802 and 2006...|$|R
40|$|The {{greater than}} 1. 4 Ga old Wernecke Supergroup is subdivided, from oldest to youngest, into the Fairchild Lake Group, the Quartet Group and the Gillespie Lake Group. The 4 km thick Fairchild Lake Group, is fine siliciclastic sediments with some {{intercalated}} carbonate. Locally phyllites and schists are present. This sequence is tentatively subdivided into five formations: F- 1, F- 2, F- 3, F- 4 and F-TR. F- 1, F- 2 and F- 3 were deposited in a basin supplied by abundant fine-grained detritus {{from a major}} river. F- 4 was probably deposited on a shallow marine shelf. F-TR accumulated in an anoxic basin partially fringed by a carbonate shelf.;The approximately 5 km thick Quartet Group is siltstone, fine sandstone, mudstone and claystone. Fine-grained, carbonaceous sediments comprising Q- 1 accumulated in an anoxic, stagnant basin. The thick Q- 2 was deposited on a broad, shallow marine shelf.;There is a gradational contact between Q- 2 and the overlying 4 km thick Gillespie Lake Group which is dolomite, dolomite-terrigenous admixtures, limestone, and fine-grained siliciclastics. This sequence is tentatively subdivided into seven units of formational rank: G-TR, G- 2, G- 3, G- 4, G- 5, G- 6 and G- 7. Facies changes are common. G-TR to G- 4 is finegrained siliciclastic-carbonate admixtures deposited in a progressively deepening basin. G- 5 records the evolution from a gentle carbonate slope fringed by a stromatolite reef complex to an intertidal and subtidal regime.

Yet, the potential effects of tidal restriction have been poorly studied in European marshlands. We analysed the long-term effects of tidal restriction on the fish assemblage of Atlantic marshlands. Multivariate and univariate analyses detected significant spatial and temporal differences in the structure and functioning of fish assemblages between an impacted marshland and control sites. Abundance and biomass values in the impacted marshland were 3 to 4 times higher than in controls, and the fish assemblage was dominated by exotic invasive species, while the control marshlands were dominated by native species. Generalist freshwater and estuarine guilds were dominant in the impacted marshland with respect to controls, where guilds were evenly represented. The diversity of feeding mode functional groups in controls was significantly higher than in the impacted marshland, which was strongly characterized by omnivorous species.

50|$|Hydraulic mining benefited California {{in three}} ways; it filled the state coffers, lined {{the pockets of}} mining {{corporations}} and fueled the boom of the mountain mining towns. Downstream, it was another story. Tons of sediment and detritus from the mining operations destroyed farmland and riparian land. It also {{changed the course of}} rivers in the Sacramento Valley. Once out of the steep slopes of the hills and mountains, the river water in the valley ran slower, allowing the debris to settle. Silt began to accumulate {{on the bottom of the}} Yuba and Feather rivers, making the channels significantly more shallow, which threatened to end the vital riverboat traffic and subsequent trade with Sacramento and San Francisco. Citizens of the downstream towns and cities such as Marysville became alarmed at the increased risk of flooding the shoaling of the rivers presented. Eventually a system of levees would enclose Marysville to combat the new threat, permanently limiting the growth of the city. Besides threatening urban communities, valuable farmland became buried under the mining debris. Farmers began to see more frequent and devastating flood losses, and soon a legal battle erupted to <b>stop</b> <b>hydraulic</b> mining once and for all.|$|R

Word leaked out that gold had been found, and within two years Sterlingville was home to over 800 people. Buildings in the town included general stores, a warehouse, boarding houses, a bakery, a casino, a dance hall, saloons, a blacksmith shop, a barber shop, and many houses.At its peak Sterlingville had a population of over 1,500.The Sterlingville School District was created in 1869. In 1877, the newly founded Sterling Mine Company built the Sterling Ditch, diverting water 23 mi from Little Applegate River for hydraulic mining of gold and chromite.Sterling Mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States. As the source of Sterling Ditch was 120 ft above the mine, it used gravity to propel water through three 5-inch (13 cm) nozzles. Captain A. P. Ankeny, owner of the Sterling Mine Company, collected over $64,000 from gold. The Sterlingville post office was built in 1879, but as the gold ran out, {{the population of the}} town declined.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} gold-mining process {{used during}} the California Gold Rush and {{in many developing countries}} today contributes enormous amounts of sediment to rivers and streams. Commonly, accompanying this sediment are contaminants such as elemental mercury and cyanide used in the gold extraction process. We show that some of the mercury-contaminated sediment created by hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada, between 1852 and 1884, ended up over 250 kilometers (km) away in San Francisco Bay; an example of the far-reaching extent of contamination from such activities. A combination of radionuclide dating, bathymetric reconstruction, and geochemical tracers were used to distinguish the hydraulic mining sediment from sediment deposited in the bay before hydraulic mining started (pre-Gold Rush sediment) and sediment deposited after <b>hydraulic</b> mining <b>stopped</b> (modern sediment). Three San Francisco Bay cores were studied as well as source material from the abandoned hydraulic gold mines and river sediment between the mines and bay. Isotopic and geochemical compositions of the core sediments show a geochemical shift in sediment deposited during the time of hydraulic mining. The geochemical shift is characterized by a decrease in εNd, total organic carbon (TOC), Sr and Ca concentrations, Ca/Sr, and Ni/Zr; and, an increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, Al/Ca, Hg concentrations, and quartz/plagioclase. This shift is {{in the direction of the}} geochemical signature of sediments from rivers and gold mines in hydraulic mining areas. Mixing calculations using Nd isotopes and concentrations estimate that the hydraulic mining debris comprises up to 56 % of the sediment in core sediments deposited during the time of hydraulic mining. The surface sediment of cores taken in 1990 were found to contain up to 43 % hydraulic mining debris, reflecting a continuing remobilization and redistribution of the debris within the bay and transport from the watershed. Mercury concentrations in pre-Gold Rush sediment range between 0. 03 and 0. 08 μg g- 1. In core sediments that have characteristics of the gold deposits and were deposited during the time of hydraulic mining, mercury concentrations can be up to 0. 45 μg/g. Modern sediment (post- 1952 deposition) contains mercury concentrations up to 0. 79 μg/g and is likely a mix of hydraulic mining mercury and mercury introduced from other sources...|$|R

5000|$|Past {{problems}} with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic {{destruction of the}} cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible catastrophic failure. The code previously permitted only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders. In {{the event of a}} cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. Two commercially available are known by the marketing names [...] "LifeJacket" [...] and [...] "HydroBrake". The plunger gripper is a device which, {{in the event of an}} uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of NOx, soot and other emissions in aero or industrial gas turbines are engage by {{the concept of}} new combustion system such as the lean premixed pre-vaporized system. Which brings with it several engineering solutions such as combustion instabilities, flashback and autoignition. An experimental test rig named Sheffield Rapid Compression Machine (Shef-RCM) is designed to investigate the autoignition chemistry of alternative fuels relevant to gas turbine plant and to handle high boiling point long chain hydrocarbon fuels. The Shef-RCM incorporates a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>stopping</b> mechanism, piston release mechanism, an optimal crevice piston design and a reactor chamber is designed which utilises the direct test chamber method for easy admittance of fuels. The machine is pneumatically driven and hydraulically stopped. The novelty {{in the design of}} the Shef-RCM is the introduction of a piston release mechanism (brake) pneumatically operated use to hold the reactor piston in position at its bottom dead centre. A computational fluid dynamics study on crevice piston was undertaken to produce the best-optimized crevice piston head design that will suppress the roll-up vortex to enhances the homogeneity of the temperature field of the reactor chamber. The simulation used a 2 -Dimensional computational moving mesh axisymmetric in the commercial code of Ansys fluent. The model adopted for this calculation was the laminar flow. Appropriate choice of the model parameter was taken into consideration during the simulation to reduce errors caused by a poor mesh quality. These parametric studies examine the time step size and the mesh density, which was been deemed necessary for running the simulation to handle errors of negative cell volume. The parameters maintained for the model are a constant stroke length of 142 mm with a volume clearance height of 17 mm. Further optimisation of a 282 mm 3 crevice volume on the width resulted to five different crevice widths of 3 mm, 5 mm, 7 mm, 9 mm and 12 mm respectively. The widths of the piston head crevice of 5 mm gave a better result regarding the peak pressure profile and maintained a homogeneous temperature field at the end of the TDC at post compression time of about 40 ms. Performance characterization of the Shef-RCM, using inert gases, N-Heptane and Jet A- 1 showed that the experimental data obtained was highly reproducible and repeatable. The machine is vibration free, allows for fast compression, less than 35 ms, an obtainable compressed gas pressure of 22 bar. The estimation of the compressed gas temperature at the top dead centre using numerical modelling was 698 K; the heat loss implemented in the model used an effective volume approach, which showed a perfect match for the model with experiment. Ignition delay time measurement for Jet A- 1 are reported for low to intermediate temperatures regime (734 ≤ TC ≥ 815) K, compressed gas pressure, PC = 6 and 10 bar and equivalent ratios, ф= 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 in air. Jet A- 1 exhibited Arrhenius behaviour at 6 bar and 10 bar except for some suspected traces of NTC at ф = 0. 5,which needed to be fully established. No evident of Negative Temperature Coefficients (NTC) behaviour at a higher pressure of 10 bar. The kinetic modelling conducted for Jet A- 1 used Ranzi et al. [1] model with Dooley et al. [2] and Aachen[3] surrogate mixture. At a compressed pressure of 6 bar, ф= 0. 75, the model predicted a shorter ignition delay time and displayed a two stage ignition delay time for Jet A- 1 fuel, and the model was in agreement with the experiment. The Shef-RCM facility has also been used to measure the combustion behaviour of Banner-Solvent at low to intermediate temperature regime (718 ≤ TC ≥ 916) K at compressed pressure, PC = of 6 and 10 bar, and equivalence ratios, ф= 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 in air. Various diluent mixtures were carried out to alter the end gas temperature, it was found that ignition delay within the temperature range of 718 – 916 K exhibited NTC behaviour at lean condition and stoichiometric. Banner-Solvent reacts faster compare to Jet A- 1, and this showed some trend of Negative Temperature Coefficient behaviour at a compressed gas pressure of 6 bar. Experimental measurement of the ignition delay response of UCO-HEFA at low to intermediate temperature regime (680 ≤ TC ≥ 777) K at compressed gas pressure, PC = 6 and 10 bar, and equivalence ratios, ф= 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 in air was studied. The effects of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio and oxygen concentration on the ignition delay time was investigated. The overall reactivity of the three fuels showed that Banner-Solvent had showed a higher reactivity than Jet A- 1 and UCO-HEFA at 10 bar compressed gas pressure. At 6 bar compressed gas pressure, UCO-HEFA showed some signs of NTC behaviour. The uncertainty for the three fuels was considered and this was seen to be within the limits compared in literature. The global correlation for Jet A- 1 and UCO-HEFA were derived for both fuels. ...|$|R

The rhizosphere effect of these two dominant shrubs was investigated during both the rainy season and dry season by studying the soil microbial structure, composition and activity. This was done by: 1) profiling microbial communities through phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE); 2) assaying enzymes (acid phosphatase, β-glucosidase, cellulase, chitinase, urease); and 3) measuring microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and mineral nitrogen dynamics. Decomposition studies were conducted to determine the potential of nonthermal management of shrub residues. This was done by determining the influence of shrub canopy, macrofauna, and residue type on shrub litter decomposition and microbial dynamics under field and laboratory conditions. Microbial communities were more diverse, more active and had greater biomass in shrub rhizospheres. The rhizosphere communities during the dry season were similar to the rhizosphere and bulk communities during the wet season. This suggests that shrub rhizosphere provide root exudates and/or water via hydraulic redistribution that supports microbial communities during the dry season. PLFA and enzyme activities were highly correlated and were more sensitive than DGGE in distinguishing the communities temporally and spatially. PLFA profiling showed that the rhizosphere effect was dominated by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria communities, and stimulated acid phosphatase and β-glucosidase activities.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{greatest}} concerns that the public has with large-scale adoption of CCS technology is the potential risk of carbon dioxide leakage from sequestration reservoirs. Among other things, addressing these concerns will require developing intervention and remediation strategies that can be quickly and effectively implemented should leakage occur. The three main methods proposed for remediation of leakage from carbon storage reservoirs are: (1) termination of CO 2 injection activities, (2) injection of a chemical or biological sealant {{to act as a}} flow barrier [1] or (3) the development of hydraulic barriers [2 – 4]. Creating hydraulic barriers relies on the injection of water in the overlying aquifer with or without injection or production of fluid from the injection reservoir in order to manipulate the pressure field to stop or reverse leakage. Here we first investigate the effectiveness of passive remediation (stopping CO 2 injection), and then determine its effectiveness in combination with a variety of different hydraulic controls such as injection of water above the fault, injection of water below the fault and production of brine in the lower reservoir. Regardless of when the leak is detected, simulation results show that passive remediation (stopping injection) almost immediately reduces the leakage rate by an order of magnitude. Depending on the degree of residual trapping, leakage can be even further reduced. For example, with a maximum residual CO 2 saturation of greater than 20 %, leakage rates drop by another factor of 4 or more. In many cases stopping injection may reduce the leakage to the extent that is so small that it reaches an acceptable level. However in the case where further reductions are desired, for example, in order to completely stop leakage, the implementation of hydraulic controls may be necessary. The most effective method for completely stopping leakage is to inject water into the overlying aquifer near the breach in the caprock. Drawbacks of using this method alone is that while it stops leakage during water injection, leakage resumes after the cessation of water injection. In order to prevent leakage from continuing after water injection ends, the CO 2 plume in the injection reservoir must be displaced away {{from the bottom of the}} fault zone. Displacing the CO 2 plume away from the fault is accomplished by injection of water below the fault while injecting water above the fault, and by producing reservoir brine on the opposite side of the CO 2 plume. Reservoir brine production helps pull mobile CO 2 away from the bottom of the fault. In this study, production rates are established by balancing water injection rates, therefore reducing costs and surface storage issues associated with leakage remediation. The most effective <b>hydraulic</b> controls for <b>stopping</b> CO 2 leakage combine brine extraction from the storage reservoir with water injection into the overlying aquifer and storage reservoir near the fault. Overall this study demonstrates that temporally limited, multi-stage remediation strategies using a combination of <b>stopping</b> injection and <b>hydraulic</b> controls can permanently terminate leakage while having the additional benefit of dissolving most of the CO 2 in the overlying aquifer into the resident brine. This finding should provide assurances to industry, policy makers, and the public that intervention measures can quickly and effectively mitigate the risks of leakage should leakage occur...|$|R
