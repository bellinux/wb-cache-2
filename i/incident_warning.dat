40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{potential}} impacts of real-time personal road traffic in-vehicle information systems on injury accidents in such a way that the results can be used when deciding on the participation of the public sector in implementing road traffic in-vehicle information systems in Finland. Additional aims were to determine other impacts of in-vehicle information systems on traffic flow, emissions and choice of travel mode. A literature review and an expert survey were used to measure the safety impacts. The results indicate that a weather and road condition warning service and a well-implemented route and service guidance system would improve traffic safety and reduce the number of injury accidents in Finland. <b>Incident</b> <b>warning</b> systems do not have a notable safety impact in due to the small number of incidents on Finnish roads, but their primary purpose is to improve traffic flow...|$|E
40|$|RHAPIT was a {{pilot project}} for {{integrated}} inter-urban traffic management {{and focused on the}} Rhine-Main area in the centre of Germany with one of the densest motorway networks in Europe and cities such as Frankfurt, Offenbach, Wiesbaden, Mainz, and Darmstadt. Due to various traffic problems many control systems had been installed and connected with the traffic control centre at Ruesselsheim. A traffic control system with congestion and <b>incident</b> <b>warning,</b> speed control and weather warning via more than 140 variable message signs (VMS) was implemented on the A 5 motorway. At eight major interchanges variable direction signalling systems were installed. More than 1, 200 loop detectors collected traffic and congestion information and transmitted them to the traffic control centre which, after processing the data, transfered the data to radio broadcasters for dissemination by a system called ARIAM (Automatic Radio Information via Actual Measurements).

40|$|The study investigates how {{companies}} {{comply with}} the requirements of Paragraph 11 a of the German Hazardous Incident Ordinance concerning the information of the public, and how hazardous incident information affects residents' knowledge about hazardous <b>incident</b> <b>warnings</b> and appropriate emergency behaviour. It turns out that many information booklets distributed by companies are imcomplete with regard to formal requirements. Concerning the design and distribution of hazardous incident information, most companies follow the recommendations given by the Umweltbundesamt. With regard to the efficacy of hazardous incident information in turns out that it can contribute to more knowledge about hazardous <b>incident</b> <b>warnings</b> and appropriate emergency behaviour. However, information campaigns have to be repeated regularly, since often hazardous incident information is not (correctly) recalled, in particular, when there is a long time span between the distribution and the use of information. Negative effects of hazardous incident information on residents' risk perception did not arise in the study. Rather, the findings suggest that informing the public about risks can increase trust in a company. Based on these results a guide with recommendations for giving hazardous incident information to the public is presented. (orig.)

40|$|The {{objective}} of this accident review is to check what proportion of accidents recorded in the past could in principle have been prevented by using an <b>incident</b> <b>warning</b> system (IWS). The accident review was carried out for all three IWS test sites {{that are part of}} the HOPES evaluation study.

It is assumed that the IWS prevents only those accident types that are related to the warning messages given. Traffic safety is expressed in both the total number of accidents, and in relation to risk exposure. A general safety description regarding the total traffic amount is given for both the experimental sections and for control sections. The accident files differed considerably between the three projects, both in the amount of detail and in the categories used to score the accidents.

40|$|Recently, many {{efforts have}} been made to develop more {{efficient}} Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols for on-demand route planning according to observed traffic congestion or incidents, as well as for safety applications. Because practical experiments are often not feasible, simulation of network protocol behavior in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) scenarios is strongly demanded for evaluating the applicability of developed network protocols. In this work, we discuss the need for bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic microsimulation for evaluating IVC protocols. As the selection of a mobility model influences the outcome of simulations to a great extent, the use of a representative model is necessary for producing meaningful evaluation results. Based on these observations, we developed the hybrid simulation framework Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation), composed of the network simulator OMNeT++ and the road traffic simulator SUMO. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate its advantages and the need for bidirectionally coupled simulation based on the evaluation of two protocols for <b>incident</b> <b>warning</b> over VANETs.

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{society is}} built on good roads and {{efficient}} transportation systems. Road safety has become the primary development issue within road infrastructures. Safety and mobility can, however, be jeopardized by poor highway design and construction or by operating procedures which allow unsafe driving conditions e. g. construction work zones, incident management or response to emergencies caused by adverse weather. During recent years weather conditions in winter, especially when rapidly changing, have been an important factor behind numerous disastrous traffic accidents in northern regions of Europe and America {{as well as in}} the Alpine region in Europe. Information about hazardous weather conditions is often potentially available but difficult, or sometimes even impossible, to deliver to the drivers in the target area.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of advanced {{driver information systems}} sets new chal-lenges {{in the area of}} traffic modelling and simulation. The use of tech-niques such as autonomous route guidance, advanced <b>incident</b> <b>warning</b> or information channels dedicated to traffic information must be incor-porated in a new generation of traffic models. This paper first discusses the impact of these new systems on modelling methodology, with an em-phasis on some important issues to make the new models both realistic and adaptable to technological and sociological evolution. The main issues are the avoidance of the "steady state", "perfect in-formation " and "uniform behaviour " assumptions commonly made in traffic simulation. The need of an explicit model for traffic information flow and of behavioural routing methods allowing for the real time use of this information are introduced as consequences of this first conclu-sion. These in turn have consequences on more technicallevels, such as network representation and traffic metaphors. The argumentation developed is then illustrated using the definition of some of the modelling concept within the P ACSIM model for traffic assignment. The dynamic nature of the simulation, the concepts of "packets " (considered as a traffic metaphor) and multi-level network, the structure of the information network (as distinct from the road network itself) and finally the bi-level behavioural routing methodology applied in P ACSIM are shown to be coherent with the requirements discussed {{in the first part of}} the paper. 965...|$|E
40|$|Road traffic {{management}} is an umbrella term. It encompasses all measures that (re) direct traffic flows {{over the road}} network, so that the movements of people and goods are optimised for reliability, safety and environmental sustainability. The levels of road mobility continue to increase year on year. In fact, the mobility demand is increasing faster than any increases in overall road capacity. As a result, developments in {{traffic management}} become increasingly important to accommodate demand. Traffic management is generally seen as linked to main arterial roads and involves motorised traffic, but it also relates to minor roads and non-motorised traffic. Traffic management consists {{of a variety of}} measures that are applied for multiple purposes. Modern technologies make current traffic management more dynamic and flexible and hence, in theory, more effective. Four clusters of traffic management measures can be distinguished: * Dynamic speed management: e. g., dynamic speed limits, variable message signs. * Local dynamic warning or informative systems: e. g., <b>incident</b> <b>warning,</b> local queue warning, weather warnings. * Local traffic flow management: e. g., lane closures, peak hour lanes, overtaking prohibition for trucks, merging measures, ramp metering. * Network-wide traffic flow management: e. g., dynamic route information, multimodal information. Traffic management measures aim to influence traffic flows over the road network. However, traffic flow consists of numerous individual road users travelling from A to B, so traffic management aims to influence human behaviour. Consequently, the effect of a traffic management measure largely depends on the capabilities or motivations of these road users to comply with the measures. If designed and applied without accounting for human factors, effective traffic management measures may not have the intended effect. Human factors in national or international legislation Some human factor aspects are explicitly taken into account and integrated into (inter) national legislation. For example, human limitations in vision and information processing are accounted for in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Road Signs and Signals and the European Agreement on Road Markings. These acts of legislation clearly prescribe the locations, size and material of signs and markings. However, beyond accommodating visual capabilities, there is minimal integration of human factors principles (such as decision making, behavioural adaptation, distraction etc.) into road traffic legislation. As a consequence, road traffic practitioners, including traffic managers, are not always fully aware of the important role played by human factors. This booklet targets national road administrations and their traffic managers. It provides concise information about the human factors in general and the crucial role they play in traffic management. This information gives a level of insight into how human factors influence the effectiveness of traffic management measures. The booklet presents: * A human perspective on road traffic management; * An introduction to the four key human factors; * A view on individual differences and unintended side-effects of these factors; and * Consideration of these factors in-vehicle traffic management information Background and sources The booklet is based on research performed in the CEDR project METHOD.

Modern engineering products—from planes, cars, and industrial plants down to refrigerators and coffee machines—routinely test themselves while they operate. The goal is to detect possible deficiencies and to avoid <b>incidents</b> by <b>warning</b> the users of needed maintenance actions. This self-testing capability {{is an integral part of}} the design of such artifacts. The lesson that their builders have learned is to design for testability. This concept was not always understood: With cars, for example, we used to have no clue (save for the oil gauge) that major mechanical trouble might be imminent; if we wanted to know more, we would take our car to a mechanic who would check every component from scratch, not knowing what actually happened during operation. Today’s cars, in contrast, are filled with sensors and gauges that perform continuous testing and gather data for maintenance. While software does not physically degrade during operation, its development requires extensive testing (and other forms of verification); yet software design usually pays little attention to testing needs. It is as if we had not learned the lessons of other industries: Software construction and software verification are essentially separate activities, each conducted without much consideration of the other’s needs. A consequence is that testing, in spite of improved tools, remains a labor-intensive activity. AUTOTEST AutoTest is a collection of tools that automate the testing process by relying on programs that contain the instruments of their own verification, in the form of contracts—specifications of classes and their individual routines (methods).

40|$|Botnets are {{compromised}} hosts under {{a common}} {{command and control}} infrastructure. These nets have become very popular because of their potential for various malicious activity. They are frequently used for distributed denial-of-service attacks, spamming, spreading malware and privacy invasion. Manually uncovering and responding to such hosts is difficult and costly. In this thesis a technique for uncovering and reporting botnet activity in an internet service provider environment is presented and tested. Using a list of known botnet controllers, an ISP can proactivly warn customers of likely compromised hosts {{while at the same}} time mitigate future ill-effects by severing communications between the compromised host and the controller. A prototype system is developed to route traffic destined for controllers to a sinkhole host, then analyse and drop the traffic. After using the system in a live environment at the norwegian reasearch and education network the technique has proven to be a feasable one, and is used in a <b>incident</b> response test-case, <b>warning</b> two big customers of likely compromised hosts. However, there are challenges in tracking down and following up such hosts, especially ``roaming'' hosts such as laptops.

Considering that the list used represents only part of the actual controllers active on the internet, the need for an automated incident response seems clear. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a compilation of}} methods to consider when mapping steering functions and results as vehicle dimensions change. It is concluded that some final tuning inevitably will be required as major changes are performed. It is however possible to create qualified starting points using a set of simple rules as presented. Considered properties are steering wheel size, wheelbase, steering ratio, and understeer gradient. An investigation of driver behaviour when a sudden yawing disturbance is acting on the vehicle is also presented. Two examples, automatic braking on split friction and front tyre blow-out, are studied in detail. For automatic braking of a heavy truck it is concluded that current legal requirements and technology for split friction conditions are sufficient for an alert driver, but may create some problems for a driver being distracted. Most heavy trucks have positive steering-axis offset at ground, also known as kingpin offset at ground. This can induce a destabilising steering wheel torque when a front tyre is damaged. The effect from this is investigated using a qualitative approach. For an active driver {{it is found that}} elimination of the destabilising steering wheel torque has a small, yet statistically significant, effect on lateral deviation. And furthermore that the lateral deviation increases as the driver exhibits higher admittance. A general conclusion from the analysis, on driver behaviour at yawing disturbances, is that lateral deviation will reduce substantially when driver reaction time is reduced. This can be achieved by warning the driver prior to the <b>incident.</b> Hence, the <b>warning</b> phase, that commonly precedes automatic brake activation, is of high importance. Another method is to use steering support in the initial phase of the incident...|$|R

The Nabi Musa festival of April that year passed without <b>incident,</b> despite al-Husseini's <b>warnings</b> of possible <b>incidents.</b> Chancellor thought his power was waning, and after conferring with London, admitted to al-Husseini on 6 May that he was impotent to act decisively in the matter. Al-Husseini replied that, unless the Mandatory authorities acted, then, very much like Christian monks protecting their sacred sites in Jerusalem, the sheikhs {{would have to take}} infringements of the status quo into their own hands, and personally remove any objects introduced by Jews to the area. Chancellor asked him to be patient, and al-Husseini offered to stop works on the Mount on condition that this gesture not be taken as a recognition of Jewish rights. A change of government in Britain in June led to a new proposal: only Muslim works in the sector near where Jews prayed should be subject to mandatory authorisation: Jews could employ ritual objects, but the introduction of seats and screens would be subject to Muslim authorisation. Chancellor authorised the Muslims to recommence their reconstructive work, while, responding to further Zionist complaints, prevailed on the SMC to stop the raucous Zikr ceremonies {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. He also asked the Zionist representatives to refrain from filling their newspapers with attacks on the government and Muslim authorities. Chancellor then departed for Europe where the Mandatory Commission was deliberating.|$|R
