When the particles are introduced, often through a side tube, the smaller particles are carried over in the fluid stream while the large particles settle against the upward current. If we start with low flow rates small less dense particle attain terminal velocities, and flow with the stream, the particle from the stream is collected in overflow and hence will {{be separated}} from the feed. Flow rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges. Further size fractions may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such tubes can be arranged in series.|$|E

These correlations facilitate the use of respirable surface area determined by diffraction size-frequency analysis as a direct measure-ment of dust hazard. By using the correlations and any reputable respirable mass formula, a specific maximum respirable surface area for a dust cloud of known free silica can be formulated.

25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal <b>elutriators,</b> and large pore membrane filters.|$|R

Elutriation is a process for [...] separating a mixture of minerals into two or more products and utilizes the difference in [...] settling velocity between particles to effect this separation. An upward flow of water runs countercurrent to the material flow in a hollow elutriation column. Particle separation is affected by particle density, size and shape and the upward water velocity. It was felt that the design and demonstration of a low cost, functional and efficient unit for the concentration of coarse, heavy minerals would be of benefit to the placer mining industry. Industrial efficiency can be improved by the additional recovery of byproduct heavy minerals with market potential. Elutriation provides an inexpensive method for processing + 1 / 4 inch, sluice box concentrate to recover by-product heavy minerals. <b>Elutriator</b> design emphasized the use of materials which are inexpensive and readily available to the average placer gold mining company.

40|$|A {{large number}} of samples are {{required}} to characterize a site contaminated with asbestos from previous mine or other industrial operations. Current methods, such as EPA Region 10 ’s glovebox method, or the Berman <b>Elutriator</b> method are time consuming and costly primarily because the equipment is difficult to decontaminate between samples. EPA desires a shorter and less costly method for characterizing soil samples for asbestos. The objective of this was to design and test a qualitative asbestos sampler that operates as a fluidized bed. The proposed sampler employs a conical spouted bed to vigorously mix the soil and separate fine particulate including asbestos fibers on filters. The filters are then analyzed using transmission electron microscopy for presence of asbestos. During initial testing of a glass prototype using ASTM 20 / 30 sand and clay fines as asbestos surrogates, fine particulate adhered {{to the sides of}} the glass vessel and the tubing to the collection filter – presumably due to static charge on the fine particulate. This limited the fines recovery to ~ 5 % of the amount added to the sand surrogate. A second prototype was constructed of stainless steel, which improved fines recovery to about 10 %. Fines recovery was increased to 15 % by either humidifying the inlet air or introducing a voltage probe in the air space above the sample. Since this was not a substantial improvement, testing using the steel prototype proceeded without using these techniques. Final testing of the second prototype using asbestos suggests that the fluidized bed is considerably more sensitive than the Berman <b>elutriator</b> method. Using a sand/tremolite mixture with 0. 005 % tremolite, the Berman <b>elutriator</b> did not segregate any asbestos structures while the fluidized bed segregated an average of 11. 7. The fluidized bed was also able to segregate structures in samples containing asbestos at a 0. 0001 % concentration, while the Berman <b>elutriator</b> method did not detect any fibers at this concentration. Opportunities for improvement with the fluidized bed include improving reproducibility among replicates, increasing mass recovery, improving the lid gasket seal...|$|E
40|$|This type of {{technology}} {{is a part of}} the group of air pollution controls collectively referred to as “precleaners, ” because they are oftentimes used to reduce the inlet loading of particulate matter (PM) to downstream collection devices by removing larger, abrasive particles. Elutriators are mainly used in non-pollution control processes to separate particle sizes. 2. Type of Technology: Removal of PM by gravitational settling. 3. Applicable Pollutants: Elutriators are used to control larger sized PM, primarily PM greater than 10 micrometers (Fm) (PM 10) in aerodynamic diameter. 4. Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: The control efficiency of elutriators is similar to that of settling chambers, the difference being that elutriators are designed to remove PM greater than a specified particular size. The collection efficiency of an <b>elutriator</b> varies as a function of particle size and <b>elutriator</b> design. <b>Elutriator</b> efficiency generally increases with (1) particle size and/or density, (2) decrease in flow velocity, and (3) number of vertical tubes or towers. Gravitational force may be employed to remove particles where the settling velocity is greater than about 13 centimeters per second (cm/s) (25 feet per minute (ft/min)). In general, this applies to particles larger than 50 Fm if the particle density is low, down to 10 Fm if the particle density is reasonably dense. Particles smaller than 10 Fm require excessive vertical flow distances, which lead to excessive device height. Collection efficiency for PM 10 is very low, typically less than 10 percent (Wark, 1981; EPA, 1998) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} <b>elutriator</b> {{has been}} used as a baby machine by loading the chamber with a population of mixed-generation daughter cells and allowing this population to grow, divide and age under continuous washing-out of newborn daughter cells. Clear peaks in the number of elutriated cells were reproducibly obtained for at least ten generations. The parent cells growing in the chamber continued to divide at the steady-state generation time of 95 - 100 min, showing no change in cycle time during aging. The washed-out daughter cells increased in volume during the first five generations from their steady-state value of 17 micro 3 to a maximum of 34 micro 3. As to be expected, the generation times of these large daughters, determined in a synchronous batch culture, were shorter (130 min) than that of the steady-state daughters (240 min), even when derived from 15 -generation parents. No indication for a volume increase of daughter cells without bud was observed when a population was allowed to grow in the chamber without washing-out the smaller daughter cells. The 15 -generation parent population, recovered from the chamber, had an average volume of 80 micro 3 and consisted of: (i) 71 % cells with more than ten scars, (ii) 13 % cells with one to nine scars, and (iii) 17 % daughter cells.

40|$|A {{significant}} part of ambient dust consists of fine particles derived from natural soils. Because many toxic constituents are concentrated in the smallest particle fractions, and because these small particulates are the most easily inhaled, the fine-particle fraction of soil (PM 10 and smaller) is what presents the greatest health concern. Assessing the potential risk of a soil requires examining its chemical content, its biological and mineralogical composition, its sedimentological characteristics, detailed data on grain size distribution, and other information. This analysis requires a relatively large mass of appropriate size fraction(s), obtained by dry extraction. Most methods for extracting fine particulates from soil collect only small amounts of sediment, or use wet extraction. This paper describes the Soil Fine Particle Extractor, a setup for dry extracting large volumes (dozens of grams and more) of fine particulate matter (PM 10 and smaller) from bulk soil samples. Separation takes place in two steps. Primary separation in a cylindrical separator 70 cm high and 40 cm in diameter removes all coarse particles from the sample. The remaining sediment then flows through a 200 cm long and 7 cm diameter inclined <b>elutriator</b> connected to a three-engine vacuum cleaner. The setup allows extraction of different size fractions depending on the adjustment of the control parameters (suction rate, length, diameter and inclination of the <b>elutriator,</b> thickness of the sediment layer drawn in by the system). The article presents examples of extractions from soil collected in loess and desert environments, ranging from PM 2. 5 to PM 10. It also evaluates {{the efficiency of the}} technique by investigating the extraction efficiency for a large number of particle sizes, varying from 0. 1 to 70 μm.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if work area measurements of endotoxin and/or cotton dust {{obtained from the}} vertical <b>elutriator</b> (VE) {{can be used to}} predict levels of personal endotoxin exposure as measured by the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) inhalable dust sampler in the cotton textile industry. Methods: Fifty-six work area cotton dust samples were collected from 14 areas and 82 per-sonal cotton dust samples were collected from 41 workers in three textile mills (Mills A, B and C) in Shanghai, China. Cotton dust concentrations were determined gravimetrically from sam-ple filters, of which endotoxin concentrations were determined using a kinetic chromogenic modification of the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Linear regression models were used to de-termine the association between log IOM personal endotoxin concentration and log VE area endotoxin concentration. Results: Median cotton dust and endotoxin concentrations measured from VE area samples in the three mills were 0. 36 mg m 23 and 1280. 76 endotoxin units per cubic meter (EU m 23), respectively, compared to 1. 74 mg m 23 and 2226. 83 EU m 23 from IOM personal samples. Ex-cluding samples from weaving processes, we observed linear associations between VE are...|$|E
