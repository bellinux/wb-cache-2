[...] After the New Journeymen called it quits as a band in early 1965, Elliot was invited into the formation of a new band, which became [...] "The Magic Cyrcle". Six months later in September 1965, the group signed a recording contract with Dunhill Records.

The non-response of both sources has left me rather high and dry--though not so much so as when I first read Scribner's letter. I have recovered the perspective and proportion of things--I have committed, thank God, no anticipatory follies (the worst is having made out my income-tax return at a distinctly higher than at all warranted figure!--whereby I shall have early in 1909 to pay--as I even did last year--on parts of an income I have never received!)--and, above all, am aching in every bone to get back to out-and-out [...] "creative" [...] work, the long interruption of which has fairly sickened and poisoned me. (That is the real hitch!) I am afraid that moreover in my stupidity before those unexplained--though so grim-looking!--figure-lists of Scribner's I even seemed to make out that a certain $211 (a phrase in his letter seeming also to point to that interpretation) is, all the same, owing me. But as you say nothing about this I see that I am probably again deluded and that the mystic screed meant it is still owing them! Which is all that is wanted, verily, to my sad rectification!
