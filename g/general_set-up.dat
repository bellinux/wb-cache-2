In a more <b>general</b> <b>set-up</b> the restrictions are replaced with pullbacks; fibred categories then make a good framework to discuss the possibility of such gluing. The intuitive meaning of a stack {{is that it is}} a fibred category such that [...] "all possible gluings work". The specification of gluings requires a definition of coverings with regard to which the gluings can be considered. It turns out that the general language for describing these coverings is that of a Grothendieck topology. Thus a stack is formally given as a fibred category over another base category, where the base has a Grothendieck topology and where the fibred category satisfies a few axioms that ensure existence and uniqueness of certain gluings with respect to the Grothendieck topology.|$|E

The operators we consider are "defect changing operators", which change the scalar coupled to the Wilson loop. We first perform the computation at two loops in <b>general</b> <b>set-ups,</b> and then study a special scaling limit called the ladders limit, {{in which the}} spectrum {{is known to be}} described by a quantum mechanics with the SL(2,R) symmetry. In this limit, we resum the Feynman diagrams using the Schwinger-Dyson equation and determine the structure constants at all order in the rescaled coupling constant. Besides providing an interesting solvable example of defect conformal field theories, our result gives invaluable data for the integrability-based approach to the structure constants.

It faces the challenges to reproduce Guidance, Navigation and Control's space conditions in a laboratory, passing trough all the phases of a laboratory's equipment design,testing and scenario-scaling. The author wants to underline {{the importance of the}} testing phase, especially in space mission design procedure: everything in space has to be reliable and robust. But not only, the testing phase is fundamental to design innovative algorithms and solutions. So the script is articulated in the phases described below.

5000|$|Early notable {{results of}} Bowditch include {{clarifying}} the classic notion of geometric finiteness for higher-dimensional Kleinian groups in constant and variable negative curvature. In a 1993 paper Bowditch proved that five standard characterisations of geometric finiteness for discrete groups of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space and hyperbolic plane, (including the definition {{in terms of}} having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron) remain equivalent for groups of isometries of hyperbolic n-space where n ≥ 4. He showed, however, that in dimensions n ≥ 4 the condition of having a finitely-sided Dirichlet domain is no longer equivalent to the standard notions of geometric finiteness. In a subsequent paper Bowditch considered a similar problem for discrete groups of isometries of Hadamard manifold of pinched (but not necessarily constant) negative curvature and of arbitrary dimension n ≥ 2. He proved that {{four out of five}} equivalent definitions of geometric finiteness considered in his previous paper remain equivalent in this <b>general</b> <b>set-up,</b> but the condition of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron is no longer equivalent to them.|$|E

As a special case, we obtain a very <b>general</b> <b>set-up</b> {{for the study of}} Whittaker modules, which includes, in particular, Lie algebras with triangular decomposition and simple Lie algebras of Cartan type. We describe some basic properties of Whittaker modules, including a block decomposition of the category of Whittaker modules and certain properties of simple Whittaker modules under some rather mild assumptions. We establish a connection between our <b>general</b> <b>set-up</b> and the <b>general</b> <b>set-up</b> of Harish-Chandra subalgebras in the sense of Drozd, Futorny and Ovsienko. For Lie algebras with triangular decomposition, we construct a family of simple Whittaker modules (roughly depending on the choice of a pair of weights in the dual of the Cartan subalgebra), describe their annihilators, and formulate several classification conjectures. In particular, we construct some new simple Whittaker modules for the Virasoro algebra. Finally, we construct a series of simple Whittaker modules for the Lie algebra of derivations of the polynomial algebra, and consider several finite-dimensional examples, where we study the category of Whittaker modules over solvable Lie algebras and their relation to Koszul algebras...|$|E
