5|$|In the two-woman event, {{defending}} {{world champion}} Nicole Minichiello of Britain had her sled <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> after turn 12 {{during the third}} run, but both Minichiello and her brakeman Gillian Cooke {{walked away from the}} crash. Minichiello and Cooke decided not to start the final run. In the final run, Russia-2's sled crashed which kept them at their finishing position of 18th. Meanwhile, the Germany-2 sled of Cathleen Martini and Romy Logsch was in fourth place after the third run, but was disqualified after Martini crashed in turn 13 of the final run, causing Logsch to be ejected from the sled. Both Martini and Logsch walked away from the crash by themselves. Before this incident, Martini had never crashed before in her career. Canada's Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse won the event.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie Bill Masterton {{became the}} first, and to date, only player to die {{as a result}} of {{injuries}} suffered during an NHL game. Early in a game against Oakland, Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> backwards and land on his head. Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets, and starting in the 1979–80 season, the league mandated all players entering the league wear them.|$|E
5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5000|$|Next, when {{a player}} <b>flips</b> <b>over</b> an attack card (such as a joker, {{or the same}} suit as the last card <b>flipped</b> <b>over,</b> the same number as the last, etc) each player quickly takes their hand from {{the outside of the}} circle and piles it up on the <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> card's inside the ring of cards. This is called [...] "attack".|$|R
5000|$|Of all {{the player}}s, the {{player with the}} hand on the top (that is, the slowest player) has {{to take all the}} cards that have been <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> until the attack happened. If a player tries to attack on the wrong card and touches the <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> cards, that player must take all the {{currently}} <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> cards. The loser is {{based on the number of}} cards held at the end of the game.|$|R

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a handicap match- a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted a worm on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the guillotine choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} bulky rear wing that was affixed {{to the rear of}} the car from 2007 to early 2010 {{increased}} the severity of many on-track incidents by causing cars to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> or go airborne at high speeds.|$|E

25|$|At the 2010 Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta– {{the second}} to last race to use the rear wing– Carl Edwards made {{deliberate}} contact with Brad Keselowski (in retaliation for several events including the Talladega race the prior season), causing Keselowski to turn backwards and once more <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> despite the roof flaps being deployed. Keselowski flipped over once and crashed on his side door. Edwards was parked {{for the rest of}} the race and put on three-race probation.|$|E
25|$|Dealing {{does not}} have to be {{strictly}} this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.|$|E
25|$|In the Fall, Earnhardt {{took his}} second {{restrictor}} plate win as {{he won the}} EA Sports 500 at Talladega as a crash unfolded on the back straightaway that caused Bobby Labonte to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> and also collected 15 other cars. The Talladega victory earned Earnhardt a Winston No Bull 5 $1 million bonus. He was docked 25 points, however, after his car failed post-race inspection. With this win, DEI swept {{three of the four}} restrictor plate races for 2001, only failing to win the spring Talladega race. He finished the 2001 season eighth in the points standings with three wins, nine Top 5's, and fifteen Top 10's, as well as two poles.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 2000, Spirit of Vancouver Island {{collided}} with the 9.72 m (about 32ft) Star Ruby while attempting to overtake the vessel in a narrow channel. The collision occurred approximately 1km (about ½mi) from the Swartz Bay Terminal, where the ferry had departed from. Spirit of Vancouver Island struck Star Ruby on its port side, causing the pleasure craft to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> and eventually right itself, though swamped and heavily damaged. According to the accident report, the pleasure craft ignored all warning blasts from the approaching ferry and then made a sharp turn towards the ferry just prior to impact. Two passengers aboard Star Ruby later {{died as a result}} of injuries sustained by the collision.|$|E
25|$|Because it is a small, stable protein whose {{structure}} {{had been}} determined at high resolution by 1975, {{it was the}} first macromolecule of scientific interest to be simulated using molecular dynamics computation, in 1977 by J. Andrew McCammon and Bruce Gelin, in the Karplus group at Harvard. That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from too fast to measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups {{in the center of the}} β sheet, and those values also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dynamics simulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} of the V-173 was on 23 November 1942 with Vought Chief Test Pilot Boone Guyton at the controls. The aircraft's most {{significant}} problem concerned its complicated gearbox that routed power from the engines to its two long propeller shafts. The gearbox produced unacceptable amounts of vibration in ground testing, delaying the aircraft's first test flight for months. Flight testing of the V-173 went on through 1942 and 1943 with 190 flights, resulting in reports of UFOs from surprised Connecticut locals. Charles Lindbergh piloted the V-173 during this time and found it surprisingly easy to handle and exhibiting impressive low-speed capabilities. On one occasion, the V-173 was forced to make an emergency landing on a beach. As the pilot made his final approach, he noticed two bathers directly in his path. The pilot locked the aircraft's brakes on landing, causing the aircraft to <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> onto its back. Remarkably, the airframe proved so strong that neither the plane nor the pilot sustained any significant damage.|$|E

25|$|In {{part because}} of its {{advances}} in technology and a top speed greater than existing Navy aircraft, numerous technical problems had to be solved before the Corsair entered service. Carrier suitability was a major development issue, prompting changes to the main landing gear, tail wheel and tailhook. Early F4U-1s had difficulty recovering from developed spins, since the inverted gull wing's shape interfered with elevator authority. It was {{also found that the}} Corsair's right wing could stall and drop rapidly and without warning during slow carrier landings. In addition, if the throttle were suddenly advanced (for example, during an aborted landing) the left wing could stall and drop so quickly that the fighter could <b>flip</b> <b>over</b> with the rapid increase in power. These potentially lethal characteristics were later solved through the addition of a small, -long stall strip to {{the leading edge of the}} outer right wing, just inboard of the gun ports. This allowed the right wing to stall at the same time as the left.|$|E
25|$|An Iraqi {{survivor}} {{from the}} same boat, Zainab Abbas, who also lost two children from the disaster, told reporters that Abdullah had been presented to her as the 'captain', that he was driving the overcrowded boat too fast, causing it to <b>flip</b> <b>over,</b> and that he pleaded with her {{while they were still}} both in the water not to report him to anyone in authority. Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and she was angry because all the media attention was on Aylan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they can escape Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account.|$|E
