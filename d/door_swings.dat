25|$|For {{most of the}} world, <b>door</b> <b>swings,</b> or handing, are {{determined}} while standing on the outside or less secure {{side of the door}} while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).|$|E
25|$|Opening upwards, {{the doors}} evoke {{the image of}} a seagull's wings. In French they are portes {{papillon}} (butterfly doors). The papillon door, slightly different in its architecture from a gullwing door – designed by Jean Bugatti in 1939 Type 64, 14 years before Mercedes-Benz produced its similar, famous 300SL gullwing door – is a precursor, but is often overlooked when discussing gull-wing design. Conventional car doors are typically hinged at the front-facing edge of the door and the <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> outward in a horizontal plane.|$|E
25|$|The 747-400F has a {{main deck}} nose {{door and a}} {{mechanized}} cargo handling system. The nose <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> up so that pallets or containers up to 40ft (12 m) can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers. An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M (Combi)) allows loading of dimensionally taller cargo modules. A lower deck ("belly") side door allows loading of unit load devices (ULD) up to 163cm in height. Boeing delivered 126 Boeing 747-400F aircraft with no unfilled orders as of November 2009. The last −400F was delivered to Nippon Cargo Airlines on August 2, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} sex swing exist: traditional <b>swing,</b> <b>door</b> <b>swing,</b> body swing, and fantasy swing. The body swing is suspended from one partner's body. The <b>door</b> <b>swing</b> {{is mounted on}} a <b>door.</b> The fantasy <b>swing</b> is suspended from an eye bolt in the ceiling. In popular culture, sex swing is mostly associated with BDSM practices.|$|R

2500|$|A {{model for}} this is the hinges on a door. When the door is shut, the hinges are flush against the wall. As the <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open, one side of the door remains pressed against the wall as space opens up on the other side. Removing just a small wedge of bone can [...] "swing" [...] the knee open, {{pressing}} the healthy tissue together as space opens up between the femur and tibia on the damaged side so that the arthritic surfaces do not rub against each other.|$|E
25|$|Since its closure, {{reports of}} unexplained clanging sounds, screams, and crying {{have often been}} {{reported}} in the prison blocks. Unexplained footsteps and moaning have been reported in both A and B blocks. C-Block is reputedly haunted by the spirit of former inmate Abie Maldowitz (nicknamed Butcher) who was murdered in the laundry room. On September 5, 1984, a ranger spent the night alone on the island and was awakened by a heavy <b>door</b> <b>swinging</b> in C-Block, but found no cause for it; the <b>door</b> <b>swinging</b> continued on other nights.|$|R

60|$|Then the man steps {{across the}} stage and presses a button. A bell rings.

5000|$|Because {{the doors}} {{stay within the}} car's track {{throughout}} their range of movement, they are useful when parking in tight spaces. A gullwing door style offers similar visibility, but the <b>doors</b> <b>swing</b> out from the car's area slightly.|$|R

6000|$|Drumcliff and Rosses were, are, {{and ever}} shall be, please Heaven! places of unearthly resort. I have lived near by them and in them, time after time, and have {{gathered}} thus many a crumb of faery lore. Drumcliff {{is a wide}} green valley, lying {{at the foot of}} Ben Bulben, the mountain in whose side the square white <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open at nightfall to loose the faery riders on the world. The great St. Columba himself, the builder of many of the old ruins in the valley, climbed the mountains on one notable day to get near heaven with his prayers. Rosses is a little sea-dividing, sandy plain, covered with short grass, like a green tablecloth, and lying in the foam midway between the round cairn-headed Knocknarea and [...] "Ben Bulben, famous for hawks": ...|$|E

6000|$|But at {{this moment}} there were heard loud cries and {{shouting}} as in tones of great gladness, in the outer hall of the palace, <b>doors</b> <b>swinging</b> to and fro {{and the sound of}} many running feet. One heard above all the call, [...] "It has come! It has come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{the wise}} peasant the green hills and woods round him {{are full of}} never-fading mystery. When the aged countrywoman stands at her door in the evening, and, in her own words, [...] "looks at the {{mountains}} and thinks {{of the goodness of}} God," [...] God is all the nearer, because the pagan powers are not far: because northward in Ben Bulben, famous for hawks, the white square <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open at sundown, and those wild unchristian riders rush forth upon the fields, while southward the White Lady, who is doubtless Maive herself, wanders under the broad cloud nightcap of Knocknarea. How may she doubt these things, even though the priest shakes his head at her? Did not a herd-boy, no long while since, see the White Lady? She passed so close that the skirt of her dress touched him. [...] "He fell down, and was dead three days." [...] But this is merely the small gossip of faerydom--the little stitches that join this world and the other.|$|E
6000|$|A little {{north of}} the town of Sligo, on the {{southern}} side of Ben Bulben, some hundreds of feet above the plain, is a small white square in the limestone. No mortal has ever touched it with his hand; no sheep or goat has ever browsed grass beside it. There is no more inaccessible place upon the earth, and few more encircled by awe to the deep considering. It is the door of faery-land. In the middle of night it swings open, and the unearthly troop rushes out. All night the gay rabble sweep to and fro across the land, invisible to all, unless perhaps where, in some more than commonly [...] "gentle" [...] place--Drumcliff or Drum-a-hair--the nightcapped heads of faery-doctors may be thrust from their doors to see what mischief the [...] "gentry" [...] are doing. To their trained eyes and ears the fields are covered by red-hatted riders, and the air is full of shrill voices--a sound like whistling, as an ancient Scottish seer has recorded, and wholly different from the talk of the angels, who [...] "speak much in the throat, like the Irish," [...] as Lilly, the astrologer, has wisely said. If there be a new-born baby or new-wed bride in the neighbourhood, the nightcapped [...] "doctors" [...] will peer with more than common care, for the unearthly troop do not always return empty-handed. Sometimes a new-wed bride or a new-born baby goes with them into their mountains; the <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> to behind, and the new-born or the new-wed moves henceforth in the bloodless land of Faery; happy enough, but doomed to melt out at the last judgment like bright vapour, for the soul cannot live without sorrow. Through this door of white stone, and the other doors of that land where geabheadh tu an sonas aer pighin ("you can buy joy for a penny"), have gone kings, queens, and princes, but so greatly has the power of Faery dwindled, that there are none but peasants in these sad chronicles of mine.|$|E

50|$|Patented in 1912, the lockrod {{was first}} used to secure {{railroad}} boxcar doors. Today, sometimes confused with locking bars or bar locks, lockrods have evolved to secure virtually every trailer or container that has a <b>swing</b> <b>door</b> (a <b>door</b> that <b>swings</b> open and closed rather than rolls up). Roll up doors are sometimes used in place of <b>swing</b> <b>doors</b> on some trailers that make shorter haul deliveries.|$|R
5000|$|Holynymic/meronymic {{relations}} are considered from {{the paradigm of}} canonical/prototypical relations, i.e. that which is considered an essential component/characteristic/part of the unit in question.

He refers to the former as a [...] "facultative" [...] relationship. A handle represents an optional relation.|$|R
