5|$|Four {{businessmen}} were <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s and 30s boom years— H. Roy Cullen, H. L. Hunt, Sid W. Richardson, and Clint Murchison. Cullen was a self-educated {{cotton and}} real-estate businessman {{who moved to}} Houston in 1918 and soon began oil prospecting. Cullen's success led to his founding the South Texas Petroleum Company (with partner Jim West Sr.) and Quintana Oil Company. Cullen and his wife established the Cullen Foundation, which {{became one of the}} largest charitable organizations in the state, and donated heavily to the University of Houston, the Texas Medical Center, and numerous other causes in Texas, particularly in the Houston area.|$|E
5|$|Cobra Triangle is a 1989 racing, {{vehicular}} combat {{video game}} developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The player controls a weapon-equipped speedboat through 25 levels. Objectives include winning races, saving swimmers, and defusing bombs. The game also includes power-ups and is displayed from a 3D isometric perspective with automatic scrolling {{that follows the}} player's movement. The Stamper brothers designed the game and David Wise wrote its soundtrack. Computer and Video Games highly recommended the game and praised its graphics and gameplay. Later reviewers lauded its level diversity and noted its graphical similarities to previous Rare game R.C. Pro-Am. IGN and GamesRadar ranked Cobra Triangle among their top NES games. The latter considered Cobra Triangle <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NES era's aesthetic. It was also included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Secular {{portraiture}} was {{a rarity}} in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end {{of the market in}} betrothal portraits or royal family commissions. While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed. Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer; his seminal 1432 Léal Souvenir is one of the earliest surviving examples, <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance. His Arnolfini Portrait is filled with symbolism, as is the Madonna of Chancelor Rolin, commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.|$|E

25|$|Increasingly, {{recovery}} became both {{a subject}} {{of mental health services}} research and a term <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient Movement. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> recovery was often defined and applied differently by consumers/survivors and professionals. Specific policy and clinical strategies were developed to implement recovery principles although key questions remained.|$|R

5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} the egg {{was shot in}} post-production. A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason {{the image of a}} hen's egg was used on the poster, and has become <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> franchise as a whole—as opposed to the Alien egg that appears in the finished film.|$|E
5|$|The show is {{a lavish}} event with {{elaborate}} costumed lingerie, varying music by leading entertainers, and set design according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracts hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top fashion models are selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this includes about a half dozen women under contract to the company, known as Victoria's Secret Angels, who help publicize the event. The giant angel wings worn by the models, {{as well as other}} wings of various forms and sizes such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, have become <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victoria's Secret brand.|$|E
50|$|Although {{relatively}} little-known outside France - {{unlike his}} Marseillais fellow citizen Adolphe Monticelli -, Olive {{is one of}} Provence's most iconic painters and an <b>emblematic</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French marine art movement.|$|R

50|$|Calvino emphasises that he {{does not}} intend to exclude or to define as {{inferior}} the opposite, as for example light/heavy, quick/slow; instant deduction is not necessarily better than well-considered thought, the case may be even contrary. It simply communicates something which is only <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> lightness. <b>The</b> balance or tension between the two 'poles' is an important aspect.|$|R
5|$|The temple {{building}} was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculpture, all with religious significance. As with the cult statue, the gods {{were believed to}} be present in these images, suffusing the temple with sacred power. Symbols of places in Egypt or parts of the cosmos enhanced the mythical geography already present in the temple's architecture. Images of rituals served to reinforce the rituals' magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if the rituals ceased to be performed. Because of their religious nature, these decorations showed an idealized version of reality, <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple's purpose rather than real events. For instance, the king was shown performing most rituals, while priests, if depicted, were secondary. It was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies; it was his broader role as intermediary with the gods that mattered.|$|E
5|$|The BJP won 31% of the vote, {{and more}} than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, {{becoming}} the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, {{as well as with}} regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.|$|E

5|$|Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory (née Persse; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932) was an Irish dramatist, folklorist and theatre manager. With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, {{and wrote}} {{numerous}} short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced {{a number of}} books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.|$|R
50|$|As an <b>emblematic</b> group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laetare de Stavelot and symbol <b>of</b> Walloon folklore, <b>the</b> Blancs Moussis {{have so far}} {{existed for}} more than five centuries, but it was not always easy for them.

25|$|The {{flora and}} fauna {{are similar to those}} found in the mid-south and low country regions of South Carolina and Georgia. The palm trees are the more cold-hardy {{varieties}} like the state tree, the Sabal palmetto. Pines, magnolias, hickories, and a variety of oaks are the dominant trees. The Southern Live Oak is perhaps the most <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
25|$|The {{literature}} of New England {{has had an}} enduring influence on American literature in general, with themes that are <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger concerns of American letters, such as religion, race, the individual versus society, social repression, and nature. Famous New England writers include Transcendentalist philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, poets Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Bishop, and novelists Nathaniel Hawthorne and Harriet Beecher Stowe.|$|E
25|$|While Cutten's legacy {{has been}} substantively marred by the espousal {{of what many}} {{consider}} to be racist vitriol, the contributions he made to developing the prestige and facilities of Colgate were significant. Because of this ambiguity, the controversy around Cutten became <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division surrounding how modern American universities should broker their own history with racism, foreshadowing future controversies in the mid-2010s at universities such as Yale University and Harvard University.|$|E

25|$|The Operation Millpond B-26s {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to strike at Kong Le, but the strike was stayed by an event {{on the far side of}} the world. The Bay of Pigs Invasion failed, and that failure gave pause to U.S. actions in Laos. A ceasefire was sought. Simultaneously, the Programs Evaluation Office shed its civilian guise and went above ground to become a Military Advisory Assistance Group. <b>Emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> change, the Hotfoot teams donned their U.S. uniforms and became White Star Mobile Training Teams.|$|E

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with conservation efforts, the Hudson River region has seen an economic revitalization, especially {{in favor of}} green development. In 2009, the High Line was opened in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. This linear park has views of the river throughout its length. Also in 2009, the original Poughkeepsie railroad bridge, since abandoned, was converted into the Walkway Over the Hudson, a pedestrian park over the river. <b>Emblematic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase in green development in the region, waterfront parks in cities like Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and Beacon were built, and several festivals are held annually.|$|E
