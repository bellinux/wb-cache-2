5|$|The game {{opens on}} May 1, 2017, when a {{blackout}} occurs in LeMU, its communications system <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> the park springs a leak; portions of it get flooded, blocking the exit and trapping the characters inside. Due to water pressure, {{the park is}} estimated to implode after 119 hours; the water pressure also ensures that the characters cannot escape by swimming, as it would crush their lungs. If the player plays as Takeshi, he builds a relationship with Tsugumi, who reveals {{that she and her}} pet hamster Chami are carriers of the Cure virus, which has rewritten their genetic code, and halted their biological aging. She and Takeshi have sex, and she is impregnated. Later, Coco becomes sick. It is revealed that a research facility exists under LeMU, called IBF, and that LeMU was created by the Leiblich Pharmaceutical company as a cover for IBF. The facility developed the deadly virus Tief Blau; the LeMU disaster was caused when IBF lost containment of it. Coco was exposed to the virus while visiting her father, an IBF researcher.|$|E

All are typical of the period, with massive colonnades having a very pronounced entasis (widening as they <b>go</b> <b>down),</b> <b>and</b> very wide capitals resembling upturned mushrooms. Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place.|$|E

50|$|The chain {{can have}} two bends, {{so there is}} one at a pole, two on the equator and one at the {{opposite}} pole. None of the triangles of coordinating atoms and the central atom are coplanar. This is termed cis-α (alpha). This arrangement is chiral, so there are two possible mirror images. The arrangement where the chain <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> clockwise <b>and</b> <b>down</b> is termed lambda Λ, <b>and</b> where is <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> anticlockwise <b>and</b> <b>down</b> is called delta Δ.|$|R
25|$|However, {{with recent}} {{advances}} in ecological understanding {{it has become clear}} that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory and its neighbourhood. The draining of the lake completely also caused the watertable in the entire area to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the area becoming arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former lake basin into housing complexes as has already been happening with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or lake basin.|$|E

This is followed by synthesized musical arrangement, as Madonna starts singing the line, [...] "When the lights <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> there's no one left, I can {{go on and on and}} on." [...] An interlude, where Madonna continuously chants the words [...] "Get Stupid", is also present. According to Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice, the song contains elements of the work of Nile Rodgers.|$|E

I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{followed}} the same storyline of Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, {{the first in the}} series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. When writing the second season, Daniel Cerone said that the writers [...] "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" [...] to continue on the path that they hoped to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> chose to depart from Lindsay's second Dexter novel, Dearly Devoted Dexter. Instead, they chose [...] "to turn our biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time, so they're still dented and rocked by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The nice thing with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E

As the mouth is lowered the eyes flash red and fog pours out. Then, a live view of the locker room tunnel with Sharks players is shown on the scoreboard and the goalie leads the team out of the locker room, through the mouth, and onto the ice. The Sharks currently use [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] by Metallica as their entrance song. Previous entrance songs include Metallica's version of [...] "Breadfan" [...] and [...] "Get Ready for This" [...] by 2 Unlimited. The latter song is the current team's goal song in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Bikel viewed then 21-year-old Bob Dylan as one {{of those}} young {{performers}} expressing emotional and social messages through song.

Originally, only Bikel and Seeger were scheduled to perform, but Bikel wanted Dylan to go with them. He told Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, [...] "I'll tell you what. Buy him a ticket.

[...] The college, loosely affiliated with Mennonite Church USA, which is traditionally a peace church, published an online fact sheet stating that [...] "historically, playing the national anthem has not been among Goshen College's practices because of our Christ-centered core value of compassionate peacemaking seeming to be in conflict with the anthem’s militaristic language." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gloria in Excelsis. Toward {{the end of}} the Kyrie, {{the sacred}} ministers walk (still staying in a line) {{to the center of the}} altar. If they have been sitting, all rise, save the celebrant, who waits until his biretta has been {{collected}} by the deacon. The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while he says in a low voice the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie. (Note: The Gloria is omitted from Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, as well as from ferias outside Christmastide, Epiphanytide, and Paschaltide.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> when they come back up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if she has learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E
