After reviewing relevant literature bearing on the subject of telephone surveys, a theoretical telephone survey <b>human</b> <b>service</b> needs assessment of Maricopa County, Arizona is compared with an actual <b>human</b> <b>service</b> needs assessment using the traditional personal survey approach. The results suggest that the two approaches produce similar findings at the aggregate data, or community, level but that the underrepresentation of certain target groups of interest to <b>human</b> <b>service</b> administrators (e. g. low-income and ethnic minorities) may cause disaggregation problems. Methodological techniques to deal with the underrepresentation of these target groups in telephone survey <b>human</b> <b>service</b> needs assessments are discussed. The article concludes by suggesting that the successful utilization of a telephone survey approach to <b>human</b> <b>service</b> needs assessment may ultimately turn more on political rather than methodological concerns...|$|R

Results showed that 38 % of managers took an innovative approach to their work, and characteristics of perceived responsiveness to change and evidence-informed practice network involvement were significantly associated with managerial innovation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Human</b> <b>service</b> {{professionals}} {{are concerned with}} the intervention and empowerment of vulnerable social populations. The <b>human</b> <b>service</b> industry is laden with employment-related stressors and emotionally demanding interactions, which can lead to deleterious effects, such as burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Little attention has been given to developing knowledge of what might enable <b>human</b> <b>service</b> workers to persist and thrive. Cultivating and sustaining resilience can buffer the impact of occupational stressors on <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals. One of the psychological factors associated with cultivating resilience is mindfulness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this current research is to improve our understanding of the relationship between resilience, mindfulness, burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and psychological distress among <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals. METHODS: The current study surveyed 133 <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals working in the fields of psychology, social work, counseling, youth and foster care work to explore the predictive relationship between resilience, mindfulness, and psychological distress. RESULTS: The results showed that higher levels of resilience were a significant predictor of lower levels of psychological distress, burnout and secondary traumatic stress. In addition, higher levels of mindfulness were a significant predictor of lower levels of psychological distress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that cultivating resilience and mindfulness in <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals may assist in preventing psychological distress burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Limitations of this study are discussed together with implications for future research...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} post-industrialism in western {{societies}} saw social theorists pay greater attention to the blurring of traditional work and life conceptual categories and the growing role of service professions. Further, much of the theorisation around the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professions has focussed on occupational stress and professional burnout. This focus on the challenges to worker health has limited considerations of how <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals can thrive, and not just survive, in demanding employment contexts. In response, the paper considers the ‘lifeworld’ as a conceptual resource that can encourage new {{ways of thinking about}} the work of <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals, as well as reworks this resource using the concept of affect to expand consideration of the interconnected, inter-subjective, bodily and emotive nature of <b>human</b> <b>service</b> work. The paper concludes by presenting a heuristic tool that can make these concepts more accessible to professional discourses and can facilitate their use within collaborative research with the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professions. ...|$|R

40|$|Shared {{values and}} norms {{are at the}} core for unifying {{different}} cultures socializing or working to fulfill the goals and mission of organizations. Researchers have not examined how employees representing different cultures socialize via shared norms and values in <b>human</b> <b>service</b> companies. The purpose of this ethnography {{study was to explore}} the process of 8 culturally different employees working together at a <b>human</b> <b>service</b> organization. Using purposeful sampling, multicultural employees were selected from 4 departments within the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> company. Face-to-face interviews, field notes, questionnaire, and participant observation were the tools for collecting the data. Descriptive coding, value coding, and the Ethnograph software was used to identify themes from the data. The analysis of the data evolved from using the approach of the hermeneutic circle, which consisted of examining the parts, such as activities and the connection to the whole, such as core values. According to the study, most employees engaged in sharing the norms and values of the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> company, ultimately fulfilling the goals or core values. However, 2 out of 8 participants engaged in conflict and had a lack of knowledge about 1 out of 4 core values. Knowledge and compliance to the core values were fundamental ingredients for providing quality services. This study leads to positive social change by providing <b>human</b> <b>service</b> organizations information on compliance to the entire core values of the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> company and knowledge of the complete core values of the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> company...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the critical issue {{emerging in the}} implementation of change strategies designed to improve the effectiveness of <b>human</b> <b>service</b> delivery systems. A review of the literature supports the notion that <b>human</b> <b>service</b> organizations have been largely ignored in the development of change and intervention theories. As a result, little specific information is available regarding the implementation of improvement strategies in <b>human</b> <b>service</b> delivery systems. The article describes the process by which change was intro-duced and implemented in a <b>human</b> <b>service</b> organization. Entry activities, data collection techniques, the action planning process, and the evaluation procedures used in the present intervention are discussed. The article concludes with a dis-cussion of the differences in implementing planned change in <b>human</b> <b>service,</b> as opposed to business and industrial, organizations. Suggestions, theoretical guidelines, and a model are provided for future interventions. <b>Human</b> <b>service</b> organizations (HSOs) today face a host of insistent pressures, which are driving them through a jumble of difficult changes. Obvious issues concern deinstitutionalization (Dorwant, 1980), rising expectations regarding medical care (Davis & Lawrence, 1977), cost containment, and escalating medical costs.
