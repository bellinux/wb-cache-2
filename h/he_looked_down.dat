500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at the setlist taped {{to the body of}} the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure {{he was going to do}} it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
2500|$|When Perkins {{played a}} dance on December 4, 1955, {{he noticed a}} couple dancing near the stage. Between songs, he heard a stern, {{forceful}} voice say, [...] "Uh-uh, don't step on my suedes!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> and noted that the boy was wearing blue suede shoes and one had a scuff mark. [...] "Good gracious, a pretty little thing like that and all he can think about is his blue suede shoes", thought Perkins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{people have}} a {{tradition}} {{in connection with this}} region which they implicitly believe. They say [...] "that Christ visited this part of Asia and ascended this summit, whence <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on all the region around. After blessing the country to the northward, he turned towards the south, and looking across the Baikal, he waved his hand, exclaiming 'Beyond this there is nothing.'" [...] Thus they account for the sterility of Daouria, where it is said [...] "no corn will grow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have seen}} the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and [...] "believes in a life after death", {{subsequently}} returning to his personal heaven. When Life photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exupéry told him that one day <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on {{what he thought was}} a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: [...] "I asked him who he was", he replied. [...] "I'm the Little Prince", was the reply.|$|E
2500|$|Henri Pélissier was {{the first}} French winner of the Tour de France since 1911, and ended a series of seven Belgian victories. Desgrange, {{who had been in}} a fight with Pélissier for three years, wrote [...] "The {{mountains}} seemed to sink lower, sunk by the victorious thrust of his muscle. More than a score of times on the most vicious gradients, hands on the tops of the bars, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at the valley bottoms, like an eagle staring at his prey". The French victory was good for the organising newspaper l'Auto: the circulation increased to almost half a million copies, while it peaked at one million the morning after Pélissier's victory.|$|E
2500|$|Several of Károlyi's {{athletes from}} the [...] "six-pack" [...] era have criticized his {{training}} methods. Some {{of his former}} athletes, including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes, have stated publicly that Károlyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. Károlyi's constant critical remarks about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack, have also said they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu, {{who was one of}} Károlyi's final protégés, said: [...] "I'm sure Bela saw injuries, but if you were injured, Bela didn't want to see it. ... You had to deal with it. I was intimidated. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on me. He was six-feet something, and I was four-foot nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{classes at}} Hollywood High, Stephens rushed to Rogers Airport [...] {{at the corner}} of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue to look at the biplanes and to talk with the pilots. (Today, not a trace of the airport remains.) As months passed, the men came to like the lad, and taught him what they knew, even taking him on short hops. Eventually, Jim Webster, airport manager, agreed—with parental permission—to give him flying lessons in {{exchange}} for work around the hangars. In his lessons he was a quick learner, and after logging more cockpit time he finally soloed. This, of course, was an era before the Federal Aviation Administration, with its requisite ground courses and instruction hours. When a pilot first took him aloft, he saw a Los Angeles unrecognizable today. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on a Wilshire Boulevard surrounded by countryside, bordered by [...] "a row of stunted palms." [...] He sometimes flew out of Mines Field, one day to become Los Angeles International Airport.|$|E
