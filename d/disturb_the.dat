5|$|Selenium {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of {{selenium}} deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease.

5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E
5|$|While Roman {{emperors}} {{almost always}} married wives {{who were also}} Roman citizens, the ruling families of the empire's client kingdoms in the Near East and North Africa often contracted marriages with other royal houses to consolidate their position. These marriages were often contracted with the approval, or even at the behest, of the Roman emperors themselves. Rome thought that such marriages promoted stability among their client states and prevented petty local wars that would <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> Pax Romana. Glaphyra of Cappadocia was known to have contracted three such royal intermarriages: with Juba II, King of Numidia and Mauretania, Alexander of Judea and Herod Archelaus, Ethnarch of Samaria.|$|E
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E

5|$|The cheetah is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> activities, such as hunting and feeding, of cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The threat is posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E
5|$|Depicting the {{eyepiece}} of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E
