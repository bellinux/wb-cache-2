25|$|The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is an {{international}} patent law treaty, which provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an <b>international</b> <b>application</b> or a PCT application.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian Civil Aircraft Register {{is one of}} nine {{governmental}} judicial registers in Norway. The register manages several roles. Firstly, it ascertains {{the owner}} of an aircraft, and if different from the owner, the operator. The register {{can also be used}} to register any encumbrances on the aircraft. This has an <b>international</b> <b>application,</b> through Norway's ratification of the Cape Town Treaty. In addition, they register issues aircraft markings.|$|E
25|$|The {{filing of}} an <b>{{international}}</b> <b>application</b> {{results in an}} international search performed by a patent office, accompanied with a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application. An applicant may also request an international preliminary examination performed by a patent office. The PCT does not provide that the searches and examinations are to be performed by one central patent office, as the WIPO does not perform searches and examinations. In contrast, the European Patent Convention (EPC) places the European Patent Office (EPO) in charge of performing searches and examinations for European patent applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{languages of}} the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of <b>international</b> <b>application.</b> Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural {{product of the}} Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the international lingua franca in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into the Romance languages and Ancient Greek into Modern Greek and its dialects. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of Latin and Greek is notable. Ecclesiastical Latin, the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.|$|E
25|$|For instance, the European Patent Office (EPO), {{acting as}} ISA and IPEA, is not {{be obliged to}} search, by virtue of Article 17(2)(a)(i) PCT, or examine, by virtue of Article 34(4)(a)(i) PCT, any <b>international</b> <b>application</b> {{to the extent that}} the EPO {{considers}} that such application relates to subject matter which does not comply with the provisions of the European Patent Convention to such an extent that it is not possible to carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art on the basis of all or some of the claims. The EPO acting as ISA or IPEA in the PCT procedure is therefore not obliged to search or examine some PCT applications when not equipped to do so.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{international}} treaty procedures, {{such as the}} procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) , that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, {{the principles of the}} convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an <b>international</b> <b>application,</b> or PCT application.|$|E
