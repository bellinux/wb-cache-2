40|$|We {{commence}} our {{examination of}} the kaleidoscopic range of connections between Whitman and the daguerreotype with a simple, unpretentious news column by Whitman entitled "Visit to Plumbe?s Gallery". This leads to speculations of how Whitman could not have missed or ignored the profound infusion of the daguerreotype upon nineteenth century American society. In the next chapter we witness Whitman's facination with his own photographic portraits. We also see the revolutionary stagecraft that was employed in his portraits, and how {{there seems to be}} a chronological record of transitions from a Brooklyn journalist, to a proletariat "rough", and then to an enlightened sage. The two chapters that come next examines how Whitman's emphasis on sight and seeing in Leaves of Grass corresponds with key elements in photography, and how the monistic philosophy of Whitman as it relates to the body and the soul is analogous to the <b>direct</b> <b>positive</b> <b>process</b> of early daguerreotypes. Next we are reminded of Whitman's enthusiasm for scientific advancements, and how the advent of photography seemed to fit the grid of the poet's mind perfectly. In addition we discern a kinship between Whitman's democratic leaning and the popularity of photography - how both Leaves of Grass and the art of the daguerreotype were "of the people, by the people, for the people". The final chapter culminates with an {{examination of the}} ways in which Whitman?s prosodical achievements resemble the techniques in photography. His poetic practice of piling line upon line in catalogue stacks bears an uncanny likeness to individual snapshots. Thus this thesis aims to observe Leaves of Grass from a new angle and through a new lens. Hopefully we can gain a little understanding of the genesis of the dozen poems that comprised the thin quarto of 1855...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} how trait aggression relates to individuals' motives and tendencies to participate in various types of gossip; while empirically differentiating between the application of negative and positive gossip within organizations. Based on the association between both gossip and aggression with dominance and power, the current study proposed that individuals' tendency to gossip would {{be a function of}} trait aggression and their motive to gossip. In other words, aggressive individuals possess a strong desire to harm and gain power from others and they are likely to perceive gossip as a means to fulfill this need. Results (N = 353) indicated that there is a relationship between trait aggression and gossip. Specifically, the interaction between implicit and explicit aggression had a <b>direct</b> <b>positive</b> relationship with the tendency to gossip about others' achievements. Additionally, implicit aggression had a <b>direct</b> <b>positive</b> relationship with the motive to gossip for negative influence, information gathering/validation, and group protection as well as the tendency to gossip about social information and others' physical appearance. Moreover, explicit aggression had a <b>direct</b> <b>positive</b> relationship with both the motive to gossip for negative influence and the tendency to gossip about social information. Last, and most intriguing, only the motive to gossip for negative influence had a <b>direct</b> <b>positive</b> relationship with the tendency to gossip about social information, others' physical appearance, others' appearance, and sublimated gossip. Taken together, results imply that trait aggressive individuals gossip more than their non-aggressive counterparts and are motivated to do so {{in order to have a}} negative influence on others. M.
