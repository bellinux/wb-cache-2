40|$|Red-legged {{partridges}} Alectoris rufa {{are one of}} {{the most}} important game species in extensively managed Mediterranean agro-forest systems. Population declines have led to management to increase their populations. This includes the creation of <b>game</b> <b>crops,</b> but their efficacy for red-legged partridges has not been tested. We developed in October 1996 an experimental introduction of 32 100 × 8  m plots in a 6. 46 -km mixed agro-forest system area in Portugal. These plots were planted with either lupin Lupinus sp., vetch Vicea sp. or triticale Triticum aestivum × Secale cereale. The main goal of this study was the evaluation of the potential effect of <b>game</b> <b>crops</b> on partridge distribution and productivity, after controlling for the effect of habitat or other management actions. Partridge abundance and distribution were assessed during spring and summer 1997 by intensive territory mapping. We compared characteristics of territory centres with those of random points in relation to land uses, <b>game</b> <b>crops,</b> and location of water points or supplementary grain sites. The most important variable explaining partridge’s location in spring was the density of supplementary water points. In summer, partridge territories were positively associated with the density of water points and lupin <b>game</b> <b>crops,</b> as well as olive trees. Productivity (number of young per territory in relation to adults observed) increased with the density of lupin <b>game</b> <b>crops,</b> but decreased with density of water points and vetch <b>game</b> <b>crops</b> and proportion of woodland within the territories. Overall, this study suggests that management for partridges in areas of agricultural abandonment, such as those in Mediterranean woodlands, would benefit from the introduction of leguminous <b>game</b> <b>crops</b> and water provision, though more studies are required for a more adequate optimization of these measures of habitat improvement, in particular about the specific cover of the crops and their spatial distribution so they provide adequate resources in summer for nestlings.

When forage is abundant, and game and livestock do not compete for food, the policy change leads to reduced wildlife populations, especially of the relatively more valuable species.

40|$|Bushmeat {{hunting is}} {{identified}} as the major threat to wildlife in sub-Saharan Africa. The trade which includes both rural and urban dwellers is linked to deforestation, and especially the development of roads, which has increased human settlements and provided access to improved transport of animal products. Demand from a burgeoning human population is adding to the unsustainability of the activity. Many wildlife populations in East and Southern Africa have already experienced dramatic declines and range contractions because of illegal hunting. Conservation efforts have largely been directed along two approaches: establishing protected areas and including local people {{in the management of}} wildlife, while sharing wildlife related benefits. However, both strict protected areas, such as national parks, and partially protected areas have not by themselves been able to improve the situation. Moreover, laws and regulations, together with law enforcement have also been unsuccessful at reducing illegal activities. Community-based conservation (CBC) was introduced in recognition of the importance of including local people and partially and unprotected areas as part of wildlife management in the wider landscape context. This has been a widely adopted approach in East and Southern Africa, and Tanzania has also invested considerable efforts to use CBC and buffer zone areas (i. e. partially protected areas) in order to create incentives for conservation and for alleviating poverty. In the Serengeti ecosystem, illegal bushmeat hunting {{is identified as}} the top-most threat to wildlife populations. At the same time, local people bear substantial costs from having large wildlife as neighbours, which cause conflicts and resentment towards protected areas. In the mid 1980 s the Tanzanian government established Serengeti Regional Conservation Project (SRCP) {{as one of the first}} CBCs in the country to tackle the problems experienced in the ecosystem, and in particular that of the western Serengeti, where encroachment and illegal hunting were most severe. However, despite its potential importance little information has been available for evaluating its effect. This thesis focuses on the performance of wildlife conservation efforts in partially protected areas by using the western section of the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania as a case study. The thesis first explores some of the costs and benefits for local people that are associated with wildlife, and the effects of human disturbance onwildlife, then it evaluates some of the efforts implemented to include local people in conservation and to curb illegal activities. The conflict between large predators and people epitomises the struggle of conservation. Local people in the western Serengeti suffer high costs due to livestock loss from large predators and this effect extends relatively far into human settled areas. Not surprisingly, retaliatory killing is widely accepted. Education seemed to reduce the acceptance of killing, and for livestock keepers the perceived effectiveness of livestock protection measures, as well as the number of livestock loss influenced attitudes. Thus, in order to reduce the effect of retaliatory killings on predator populations in the Serengeti, it is vital to improve protection measures for livestock and offer local people improved education, which will also provide them easier access to alternative livelihoods. In accordance with previous studies, illegal bushmeat hunting was widespread in the area outside the Serengeti National Park, both from SRCP and non-project villages. There was also a temporal variation in hunting efforts which increased when the wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) migration travelled through the area. The majority of the harvest was represented by migratory herbivores, but also resident herbivores were targeted. Males were exposed to a higher risk of being killed, probably due to behavioural differences between the sexes, rather than as a result of the hunter’s prey choice. The main reason for hunting was subsistence, although some also had commercial motives. Illegal bushmeat hunting reduced impala (Aepyceros melampus) density, especially in the partially protected areas, as well as probably causing a more female biased sex ratio. In addition, animals became more wary in the areas under high hunting pressure, which indicates that demography and behaviour can be used as indicators of human exploitation. Animals, like Thomson’s gazelle (Gazella thomsoni), appeared not to monitor the expected time a predator would take to reach their location, but instead relied only on distance as a cue to assess when to flee. The <b>game</b> <b>cropping</b> operation (the commercial utilisation of wild animal populations in natural habitats) of SRCP was economically unsustainable. The expected revenue per villager from the cropping program was low compared to the value of the potential income enerated by illegal bushmeat hunting. In addition, the degree of participation in wildlife management was also restricted. One underlying condition for conservation to take place when including local people in benefit sharing, is that communities must be able to reduce threats to biodiversity themselves – that is they must have some control over the area, and can enforce policies to reduce threats through their own activities. Local law enforcement in the project villages showed substantial efforts in curbing illegal activities inside their patrol areas. However, project villages that derived higher benefit levels were more zealous in executing their authority. District level units had a low influence on the probability of making arrests, which suggests that measures must be taken to increase the resources available for enforcement, as well as increasing collaboration, in order to reduce illegal activities.

40|$|This study {{describes}} habitat {{choice of}} the Surinam black spider monkey (Atelespaniscuspaniscus) and clarifies complex temporal and spatial effects of food sources on the behaviour {{of a group of}} spider monkeys in a 350 ha study area in central Surinam in terms of food category, food plant identity and phenology, and in terms of quantity, density and dispersion of {{the most important of these}} food sources. It recognizes the fundamental importance of mature-fruit feeding to spider-monkey foraging strategy and discusses implications of diet to social behaviour, Prom a conservational point of view. this study in essential in emphasizing the extreme vulnerability of the spider monkey to both hunting and habitat destruction, and in providing detailed information on its habitat choice and dietary requirements. so urgently needed in order to assess in a responsible way the mite of areas to protect and the potential of already preposed protected areas. The spider monkey may serve an an important 'indicator' species, reflecting the degree of disturbance of Amazonian tropical rain forests, 1, 2, 3, Among the eight Surinam monkey species, Atelesp. paniscus is the most restricted in habitat. In the Voltzberg region. it occurs exclusively in high forest (92. 6 %), infrequently enters edge habitats (14. 9 %) and is found primarily in the upper levels of the canopy and in emergents (72, 3 %), The understory is rarely used (0. 8 %), and the lower extreme of its vertical range appears to be 12 meters. Among the seven major forest types available in the Raleighvallen-Voltzberg region, spider monkeys are observed only in high rain forest. mountain savanna forest, pine. swamp forest and riverbank high forest. 4. A total of 207 food plant species are used, of which 68. 1 % trees. Most important families, providing the monkeys with food, are Moraceae and Mimosaceae regarding both the number of food species and the percentage of total feeding records. Atelesp. paniscus is mainly frugivorous. feeding on 171 species of fruit, 33 species of flower and 28 species of leaf. Mature fruit makes up 96 % of the total number of fruit feeding records. The occasional feeding on insects (termites and caterpillars) definitively has been ascertained. The average annual food intake in 82. 9 % fruits. 6, 4 % flowers, 7. 9 % flush leaves, 1. 7 % bark and 1. 0 % miscellaneous (e. g., rotten palmsheaths, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, honey, insects). The monthly variation in food choice shows a strong correlation with the phenology. During the first part of the long dry season (July - September), a period of low fruit supply. the monkey compensates its diet with relatively high percen tages of both flowers and flush leaves, while during the long wet season (March - June) fruit abundance causes very low percentages of both flowers and flush leaves in the diet. The percentages are strongly determined individually by its supply in relation to the ecological change, but ripe fruits always are preferred above all. Young seeds play a minor overall role in the diet, except during the period May - June, By ingesting large quantities of young needs# rich in protein and fat, during the peak of the long wet season the monkeys seem to stock up on energy for the coming months of food scarcity (July - October). Ateles appeared to play an important role as dispersal agent for may plant species, and for none species it seemed to be the only disperser. Endozoochorical seed dispersal by spider monkeys took place in 138 plant species (accounting for 93, 5 % of total fruit feeding records), seed dropping was recorded in 10 species (2, 7 %) and seed predation in 23 species 3. 7 %). Ateles belongs to the category of 'specialized frugivores', who derive all or most of their supplies of carbohydrate, lipid and protein from fruits. Large-seeded, nutritious fruits &sea to have coevolved with specialized frugivores an their principal dispersal agents, resulting in a greater quality of dispersal than can be aeon in small-seeded, low nutritious fruits dispersed by a wide array of both 'opportunistic' and 'specialized' fruit-eating animals. This coevolutionary pattern (the high nutritive content of the flesh in large-seeded fruits) way be demon strated in families such as Palmae, Burseraceae. Myristicaceae, Sapindaceae, Loxaniaceael Capparaceae, Sapotaceae and Meliaceae, all producing important fruits for spider monkeys. Among 166 plant species producing edible fruits. used by the spider monkeys in the Voltzberg region, about 80 % in nutritious and large-seeded. Low-nutritious, small-seeded fruits (especially berries and figs), making up only 20 %, were exploited only incidentally on the way from one nutritious fruit source to another, and almost never appeared to influence the daily foraging routes nor ware revisited regularly. These species often produce mass-ripened fruit crops on which the monkeys cannot depend much, The fruiting seasons of the former category, however, in general last relatively long because of wore or lens asynchronous fruit-maturing within and between indivi duals of the species, apparently mince the small number of specialized dispersal agents way be easily overloaded. The competition between these plant species for the high-quality dispersal offered by a small number of dispersers may have evolved in elongated and displaced, but broadly overlapping fruiting seasons as required for the existence of specialized frugivores. 5, Foraging behaviour in spider monkeys in differing strikingly with the seasons. During the long wet season, when fruit is abundant, activity budgets are increased resulting in large day ranges (with a maximum of 5. 000 meters), prolonged feeding times, short resting times and many food sources (especially mature fruits) exploited daily. Foraging often takes place in relatively large subgroups breaking up and reassembling regularly,, the subparties using partly different food sources but follow ing about similar itineraries. During the long dry season, when fruit supply is low and a food scarcity or even a food shortage way exist. activity budgets are lowered to a minimum. resulting in short day ranges (with a minimum of 500 meters), prolonged resting times and short feeding times (tow relatively long feeding bouts), few food sources exploited daily and diet composition differing in much higher percentages of flowers and flush leaves. Finally, mean subgroup size is decreased strongly. Spider monkeys live in medium-sized groups fragmenting into widely dis persed subgroups of varying composition. Daily itineraries and activity patterns of a subgroup mostly are determined by a so-called dominant (usually aged) female with or without offspring, or sometimes by two dominant females alternately. These females appear to possess the beet knowledge of certain parts of the group's range, the so-called core areas, and are capable of preplanning an economic foraging route for the day along an much as 8 to 30 different food sources. By checking regularly potential food sources on their stage of maturing and using a highly developed spatial and temporal memory, these females are able to incorporate these food sources in their foraging routes just after becoming available. The interval between subsequent visits to a particular food source appears to be species specific. depending on the rate of fruit maturing. In some species the last stage of maturing in going fast, offering the monkeys every day enough ripe fruits to feed on together. Many species, however, are exploited in a 2 days cycle. some in a 5 - 8 days cycle or even more. Spider monkeys appear to select for variety. using on average about 14 different food items daily. making up about a quarter of the average monthly number of food items used, Among these. 3 or 4 food items are most important considering the amount of feeding time and the estimated total weight of food ingested, 6, A group of Atelesp. paniscus usually consists of 15 - 20 individuals. although they way never be observed all together at the same place. A group fragments into several subgroups of varying composition, a female with offspring of an age ranging from 0 to about 5 years being the only persistent bond. Sex ratio of adult males to females is 1 : 2 (- 3). The adult males of a group appear to defend a territory with clearcut boundaries, while fema les sometimes visit neighbouring groups and even may emigrate. Spider-monkey social system is characterized by its flexible grouping behaviour and seems to be coevolved with the species food specialism concerning mainly nutritious. large-seeded fruits. The supply of this type of food is varying strongly with the seasons and maturing within and between individual fruiting plants. in general. is rather slow and asynchronous. Moreover, individual mature fruits of this type are short ly available to the monkey. After becoming mature. most fruits moon drop to the ground or when dehiscent, become available to birds. For more than three large-sized spider monkeys these food plants seldom offer enough to feed on together and to make the visit worthwhile in terms of energy expenditure, Consequently, subgroups consisting of three or lens indi viduals are encountered most often throughout the year. However, the high density of particular food plants fruiting during the long wet season, makes it possible for spider monkeys to forage in much larger sub groups, often containing two dominant females and ranging in size up to 9 individuals, using simultaneously about the same itineraries, but ex ploiting partly different food sources. As a result. during this season intragroup social interactions are more frequent. During the following long dry season. when nutritious fruits are scarce and some years even a severe food shortage may exist, the mean subgroup size decreases strongly. in particular effectuated so by the splitting of dominant-female core areas, which show almost no overlap anymore. Non-dominant females and males still may join subgroups led by a dominant female to share ecological knowledge of food sources. but they do so less frequently. Day ranges drop strikingly and the animals are more silent, both factors contributing to the lower chance of encounter. Activity budgets are decreased, in particular in males and non-dominant females. The better knowledge of available food in dominant females may favour them especially during the long dry season. This may be a reason that dominant females seem more successful in rearing offspring than non-dominant females, and perhaps that mortality in adult males seems higher considering the sex ratio. At the end of the long dry season. when preferred fruit in still low in supply, the relatively frequent feeding on flush leaves and flowers. again, sustains foraging in larger subgroups, because of the great amount of food offered at the same time and by mostly large-crowned, flushing or blooming food plants. Adult males do have core areas, which are larger than dominant-female core areas and even may, combine those of two dominant females. They cooperate in territorial defense patrols and long distance agonism in case of boundary conflicts. In this way, spider-monkey males seem to be able to defend wore females than they should in a social system with cohesive bisexual groups, like in many other primates. Spider-monkey social system in unusual among primates and only shown striking similarities with that of the chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes). Both species are largely frugivorous, and show a loose, unstable social structure within distinguishable groups. Subgroup size varies seasonally in relation to food supply and most commonly is small. Individual adults occupy 'core areas' and show capacity for and continual use of a detailed, high developed spatial memory. Also dominance behaviour and sexual behaviour show remarkable similarities between both species. 7. The annual home range of the spider-monkey study group in the Voltzberg study area covered 255 hectares, of which 220 hectares offered suitable habitat, Day range size ranged between 500 and 5. 000 meters, depending on the subgroup size and composition, the weather, the season and the distribution of particular important food sources. In the Voltzberg region, Atelesp. paniscus occurs at a density of 7, 1 individuals per km 2 , or 8. 2 individuals per km 2 when only suitable habitat is considered. Biomass is ranging between 0. 4 and 0. 5 kg/ha, depending on the home range figure choosen. Ateles does not show polyspecific associations with other sympatric primate species. Some short-term associations observed were due to chance or should probably be regarded as companionship. Associations with terrestrial birds and mammals, however, are frequently observed and way be advantageous for one or both of the participant species. The terrestrial animals focus on the noisy foraging spider monkeys to obtain nutritious fruits and/or seeds immediately after dropping, while alarm calls emitted by fleeing terrestrial animals way benefit the spider monkeys, warning them against possible intruders coming into the area. 8. Spider monkeys are extremely vulnerable to hunting and habitat destruction. All over their range they disappear in the face of human entrance. showing little or no adaptability to human intrusion. Emphasizing the important role of specialized frugivores, like spider monkeys, an dispersal agents for many rain forest plants, and the balance between seed disperser. and seed- and seedling predators as they interact with fruits. having a strong impact on structure and composition of primeval tropical rain forest. a suggestion is made to combine interests of both conservationists and exploiters of rain forest treasures in conservational projects, like that of a responsible exploiting of buffer zones surrounding national parks and nature reserves, by increasing density of particular commercially valuable and edible fruit producing trees, and sustaining restricted <b>game</b> <b>cropping</b> of terrestrial seed predators and herbivores, like agoutis, acouchis, peccaries, deer and tapirs...|$|E

Significant differences in estimates for highly valued products (cash <b>crops,</b> <b>game</b> animals, and fish) together with higher respondent confidence in diaries may undermine household models based exclusively on surveys. © 2010 Elsevier B.

Technologies such as Smartphones, virtual reality and augmented reality are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, {{the video game}} industry was still very volatile, with third-party video <b>game</b> developers quickly <b>cropping</b> up, and just as quickly, going out of business. Nevertheless, many casual games and indie games were developed and become popular and successful, such as Braid and Limbo. Game development for mobile phones (such as iOS and Android devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a Facebook game developer, Zynga, has raised in excess of $300 million.|$|R
40|$|The {{first stage}} of research, twenty years ago, on the {{subclass}} of 1 -convex TU games dealt with its characterization through some regular core structure. Appealing abstract and practical examples of 1 -convex games were missing until now. Both drawbacks are solved. On the one hand, a generating set for the cone of 1 -concave cost games is introduced with clear affinities to the unanimity games {{taking into account the}} complementary transformation on coalitions. The dividends within this new game representation are used to characterize the 1 -concavity constraint as well as to investigate the core property of the Shapley value for cost games. We present a simple formula to compute the nucleolus and the τ-value within the class of 1 -convex/ 1 -concave games and show that in a 1 -convex/ 1 -concave game there is an explicit relation between the nucleolus and the Shapley value. On the other hand, an appealing practical example of 1 -concave cost <b>game</b> has <b>cropped</b> up not long ago in Sales’s Ph.

This study enquired as to the reasons for such failure within the Cape Province. The enquiry focused on management, research and marketing aspects of gamefarming. Personal interviews, a questionnaire and a literature analysis provided the information for the study. A description of the overall gamefarming situation is provided. Those management problems identified here found to be largely dependent on individual farmer's methods {{and the intensity of}} game utilisation. The primary uses of game were aesthetic appreciation and sport hunting. Such usages, being of low intensity, were accompanied by low levels of management effort. The lack of a stable economic incentive was found to be the major inhibition against adopting intensive commercial means of <b>game</b> utilisation by <b>cropping,</b> safari hunting and live sale...|$|R

Frontier theory has been put to good use in some recent policy-making. Asymmetric information and strategic behavior, the core of modern micro-theory, are highlighted by the financial scandals of 2001 - 02. The misdeeds of WorldCom and Enron would have been averted if shareholders could see what managers were up to. Even before the scandals broke, Congressman Paul Kanjorski called for disclosure rules “to end the problems of asymmetric information. ” The jargon has spread. A novel set in Wall Street is aptly entitled Moral Hazard. High executive pay, said the Bismarck Tribune, signifies principal-agent problems.

Ranchers have reported their tolerance for big game would increase if the animals could be prevented from using key areas critical for spring livestock use. Likewise, some farmers have high value areas {{that must be}} protected. Fences provide the most consistent long term control compared to other deterrent methods, but are costly to erect. Many designs of woven wire and electric fences are currently used. Costs of erecting deer proof fencing could be greatly reduced if an existing fence could be modified instead of being replaced entirely. This study investigates the possibility of modifying existing fences to prohibit deer and elk crossings. Preliminary results indicate effective modifications {{can be made to}} existing fences for $ 1300 - $ 3500 per mile for materials. Traditional complete construction of game fences cost more than $ 10, 000 per mile. These fences may be used in lieu of compensation programs for ranchers. Also, if farmers and ranchers can keep big game out of important foraging areas, their tolerance for these animals on the rest of their property may greatly increase...|$|R
5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements {{laid out in a}} grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin. The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of <b>game.</b> New <b>crops</b> were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.|$|R

The present study was conducted in Maswa game reserve with the aim of studying land use practices/activities in protected areas using the reserve as a case study. Implications to conservation and the interactions between the local and the reserve were also explored. The objectives of the study were to: identify the land use systems around Maswa game reserve; assess the conservation impact of land use activities around Maswa game reserve and to determine the measures that can address the conservation problem. The study used interviews and questionnaires as data collection procedures and 93 respondents from 3 villages around Maswa game reserve answered the questionnaires. Twenty people were interviewed and these were people working in Maswa game reserve and local leaders. The questionnaire was analyzed using SPSS and interviews through three thematic approaches which included: - types of land use around Maswa game reserve, effects of the identified land use activities and possible solutions to the effects. The findings shows that, land use activities practiced near Maswa <b>game</b> reserve includes <b>crop</b> cultivation; livestock grazing; charcoal burning; hunting and lodging. The results show that land uses activities in the area has adverse effects to Maswa Game Reserve, such effects includes causing desertification; overgrazing; loss of habitat and destruction of ecosystem; land degradation/soil erosion; spread of zoonotic diseases; deter movement of wild animals; human wildlife conflict and poaching...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, night {{cropping}} from {{a vehicle}} is commercially used to <b>crop</b> <b>game.</b> Conventional hunting employs the principles of fair chase and usually consists of hunting on foot during the day. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the meat quality of the impala (Aepyceros melampus) shot utilizing these two methods. No significant differences in pH 45 or pHu were found between the two methods. An exponential decay model (y = a + b -ct) was fitted to the pH data and conventionally hunted animals showed significantly higher rates of pH decline (c = - 0. 385 ± 0. 022 units per hour) than night-cropped animals (c = - 0. 184 ± 0. 019 units per hour) - a phenomenon that may be linked to the ante-mortem stress experienced by the animals, and the cooling rate of the carcasses. Impala conventionally hunted also had significantly higher constants for the pH exponential model (a = 5. 424 ± 0. 039; b = 1. 405 ± 0. 034) than the night-cropped impala (a = 5. 295 ± 0. 033; b = 1. 556 ± 0. 029). No significant differences were found with regards to meat quality between treatments except for slight differences in colour (night-cropped: a* = 10. 56 ± 0. 229, chroma = 12. 81 ± 0. 235; day-hunted: a* = 11. 41 ± 0. 245, chroma = 13. 78 ± 0. 252 : the later being slightly darker). The study therefore found that conventional hunting affected the rate of pH decline of the carcasses but did not adversely affect the meat quality compared to night cropping. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Springbok is {{the most}} {{extensively}} <b>cropped</b> <b>game</b> species in South Africa. The effects of age (adult, sub-adult, lamb), gender and production region on the physical attributes (pH 24, cooking and drip loss, Warner Bratzler shear force and colour) were determined using samples of the M. longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles of 166 springbok. Stressed animals had a higher (P < 0. 05) pH 24 (6. 3 ± 0. 07), as observed in the meat originating from the Caledon region. This meat had lower (P < 0. 05) cooking loss (27. 2 ± 0. 62 %) and drip loss (1. 8 ± 0. 08 %) values in comparison to meat originating from the other regions. Inverse correlations were noted between pH 24 and drip loss (r = - 0. 26, P < 0. 01) and cooking loss (r = - 0. 42, P < 0. 001). Shear force values (kg/ 1. 27 cm diameter) correlated positively (r = 0. 25, P < 0. 01) with pH 24. Age-related effects on tenderness were small in comparison with pH 24 effects. CIELab colorimetric values were typical of game meat and venison (L* < 40, high a* and low b* values). It was noted that pH 24 correlated negatively (r = - 0. 51, P < 0. 001) and positively (r = 0. 33, P < 0. 001) with the hue-angle and the chroma value of colour, respectively. Springbok originating from Caledon had a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher a* value, indicating meat to be more red with higher colour saturation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

30|$|The {{creation}} of a sustainable community of inquiry {{is one of the}} major challenges of citizen inquiry. An increase in the number of nQuire-it sessions per week was observed in year 2, more likely due to the moderation and mentoring of the activity by a Ph.D. student that encouraged participation. This activity declined rapidly by the end of the project suggesting that engaging facilitators to monitor the online activity and scaffold different missions can support participation and sustainability. Participation and community creation could be further enhanced by mechanisms including a reputation system. Reputation systems provide external feedback and recognise and reward specific activities the system asks people to engage with. The iSpot system is a successful example of such an implementation. Offering online badges to experts and social and scientific scores (i.e. scores are obtained when uploading and identifying an observation or when a member agrees with a given identification) facilitated the evolution and maintenance of a large community (Clow and Makriyannis 2011). Another web-based application that has successfully adopted such mechanisms is Stack Overflow ([URL] a question and answer website for professional programmers. In social games such as Farmville, a planting and harvesting <b>crops</b> <b>game,</b> certain accomplishments are rewarded with badges which in turn unlock new game challenges. To promote social recognition and blur the boundaries between gaming and social network sites, special rewards are received when badges are shared socially in networks such as Facebook (Landers and Callan 2011). These examples demonstrate the power of reputation systems to engage users with specific activities and reinforce ongoing participation which is an essential requirement for forming an online learning community. Further to that, it is our intention to engage more users with the platform and initiate the development of a sustainable online community through mechanisms such as (a) the recruitment of ‘young ambassadors’ who would systematically engage with activities on the platform and share news and missions with their social networks, (b) communication with schools to identify ways of using the tools in science teaching and learning, (c) blogging in specialist education press, (d) publication of ‘success stories’ in the form of case studies and analytics indicating depth of engagement, and (e) participation in events to showcase the tools to the wider public.|$|R
