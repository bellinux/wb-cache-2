5000|$|He {{joined his}} first band, the Unknowns, {{at the age}} of thirteen, where he played the {{harmonica}} in an ensemble performing British Invasion inspired music. By the late 1960s, Wells had learned to play the guitar and initially tried to follow the work of artists in the folk revival movement, leading him to Bob Dylan chronologically backwards to Woody Guthrie, then Sonny Terry and Lead Belly. The first authentic Piedmont blues record he heard was a 78 recording of [...] "Lookin' For My Woman," [...] by Blind Boy <b>Fuller.</b> <b>Wells</b> started performing professionally in the Chapel Hill area in the early 1970s. In addition to <b>Fuller,</b> <b>Wells</b> also studied the work of the Reverend Gary Davis. As part of his ongoing musical education, Wells sought out still living Piedmont performers, which led him later to produce work by Big Boy Henry, Algia Mae Hinton and George Higgs.|$|R

But, Stephen {{refused to accept the}} argument that the CPR owed its existence to the government. He became engaged in a very public battle over several years with John Norquay concerning the unpopular monopoly clause, but had to concede to public pressure in 1888, allowing the construction of branch lines south of the CPR main line. Though a financier of undoubted reputation, Stephen did not excel in public debate. He resigned as President of the CPR in 1888 and approved the appointment of Sir William Cornelius Van Horne to succeed him.|$|E
25|$|That same year, Robert F. Kennedy {{was widely}} {{considered}} an impeccable choice {{to run as}} Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn. Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate. Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Johnson, knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> the degree of frustration inherent {{in the office of}} vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, Cartoon Network debuted Krypto {{in his own}} series Krypto the Superdog, with Krypto {{voiced by}} Samuel Vincent. The series sees him team with fellow animal superheroes Streaky the Supercat, the Dog Star Patrol, and Ace the Bat-Hound. In this series, Krypto lives with a young boy named Kevin in a Metropolis suburb, and fights crime against various foes, {{including}} a space cyborg feline named Mechanikat and his feline agents (including his sidekick, the evil genius alien kitten Snooky Wookums), the Joker's pet hyenas Bud and Lou, the Penguin's trained birds (Artie the Puffin, Griff the Vulture, Waddles the Penguin), Catwoman's cat Isis, and Lex Luthor's pet green iguana Ignatius. This version of Krypto shares {{the origin of the}} original comic book version of Krypto, having been launched by Jor-El from Krypton in a similar turn of events, but he did not arrive till after Superman was already grown. Otherwise, the show is an original interpretation created just for this series, and is not based on any of the previous comic book versions. A noticeable change from the original is that this Krypto can talk, as can all of his other animal friends and enemies, and can be understood by his boy caretaker, Kevin, through the use of an ear-implanted translator. In this continuity, Superman knows <b>full</b> <b>well</b> about Krypto's existence but he decided that it was best the dog stay with Kevin, especially after realizing the existing bond between the two.|$|E

Failing {{in an attempt to}} negotiate a purchase or lease of the Hills, the government in Washington {{had to find a way}} around the promise to protect the Sioux in their land, as specified in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, President Grant ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> that not all would comply.

500|$|In 1871, Clayton {{was accused}} of {{deliberately}} tampering {{with the results of}} the U.S. house election between Thomas Boles and John Edwards in the third congressional district. According to Arkansas law, the results were to be certified and given to the secretary of state, then Robert J.T. White. After that, the governor and secretary of state would [...] "take up and arrange" [...] the results and the governor would issue a proclamation declaring the winner and deliver the seal of the state to him. Clayton {{was accused of}} adding around a hundred votes to the final count for Edwards, and declaring him the winner. Boles successfully contested the election and Clayton was indicted by the federal Circuit Court. Although the court found that Clayton did in fact falsify his proclamation and delivered the seal to Edwards knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> that he had not won, this was not illegal. His actions were in no way binding to the Congress and under federal law of the time, state governors were not considered election officials. Boles became a congressman.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{centered}} {{on the concept of}} the record; BBC's Chris Jones said that it is [...] "griping vaguely against 'authority and that [...] "too many buzz words obscure incisive meaning". Steve Kandell of Spin wrote that the humor of American Idiot was [...] "sorely missed" [...] and that the energy of the album seemed [...] "directionless". The Guardians Alexis Petridis indicated that [...] "the storyline becomes impossible to follow". Robert Christgau of MSN Music wrote that [...] "I don't like right-wing Christianists either. But as every oppressed teen in the right-wing orbit knows <b>full</b> <b>well,</b> they're not as garbled and simplistic as Armstrong's anthems insist." [...] Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic was the most critical professional reviewer of the album; he questioned the clarity of the lyrics by calling 21st Century Breakdown [...] "more conceptually vague/ridiculous than American Idiot", and {{he went on to say}} that it [...] "spirals out of control in its own heroic glory and never regains focus, thus ending with a product that Green Day couldn't afford to produce: an average record". Slant Magazine claims that [...] "...an uncanny sense of familiarity hangs over too much of the album. The melodies of several tracks suggest ghosts of older Green Day songs." [...] Kyle Ryan at The A.V. Club gave the album a B+, noting it as [...] "going [...] bolder" [...] than American Idiot. Ryan also declared [...] "21st Century Breakdown reinforces what American Idiot first revealed: Green Day should never be underestimated." ...|$|E
