25|$|At the Australian Grand Prix, {{the cars}} again {{occupied}} {{the back row}} of the grid, with Senna ahead of Chandhok. The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a hydraulic failure, but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of the winner and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race. In Malaysia, Chandhok achieved the F110's best qualifying position without grid rearrangement in 22nd position. In the race both cars ran efficiently and achieved the F110's first double-finish, with Chandhok and Senna finishing in 15th and 16th positions respectively, ahead of the two delayed Lotus drivers. Chandhok finished three laps down, while Senna was another lap behind the leader. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Chandhok received a five-place grid penalty as the team broke the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) seal on his car's gearbox without {{a representative of the}} governing body being present; he was then further penalised for his mechanics changing a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> <b>assembly</b> with parts of a different specification to the originals, and was made to start from the pit lane. In the race, the F110 achieved another double finish, with Senna leading Chandhok home in 16th and 17th positions respectively.|$|E
40|$|As {{interest}} in product recovery, reuse, and recycling rises, planning and evaluating disassembly sequences {{are becoming increasingly}} important. The manner in which a product can be taken apart strongly influences end-of-life (EOL) operations and costs. Early disassembly planning can also inform non-EOL processes including repair and routine maintenance. Recently, research has concentrated on creating optimization algorithms which automatically generate disassembly sequences. These algorithms often require data that are unavailable or estimated with high uncertainty. Furthermore, industries often employ CAD modeling software to evaluate disassembly sequences during the design stage. The combination of these methods result in mathematically generated solutions, however, the solutions may not account for attributes {{that are difficult to}} quantify (human interaction). To help designers better explore and understand disassembly sequence opportunities, the research presented in this paper combines the value of mathematical modeling with the benefits of immersive computing technologies (ICT) to aid in early design decision making. For the purposes of this research, an ICT application was developed. The application displays both 3 D geometry of a product and an interactive graph visualization of existing disassembly sequences. The user can naturally interact with the geometric models and explore sequences outlined in the graph visualization. The calculated optimal path can be highlighted allowing the user to quickly compare the optimal sequence against alternatives. The application has been implemented in a three wall immersive projection environment. A user study involving a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> <b>assembly</b> was conducted. The results suggest that this approach may be a viable method of evaluating disassembly sequences early in design...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the Robust Design Optimization (RDO) of an Electric Pump for Dishwashers. The {{aim of this}} work is to apply RDO techniques {{to the design of}} a large scale product and, in particular, the optimization target is to improve the efficiency and lower the cost of the whole system, as well as to fulfil requirements on the overall dimensions and head. Once an optimized geometry which meets all the requirements is obtained it will become a standard pump listed in the company catalogue. The authors gave a particular attention to the numerical model validations and to the theoretical study of the hydraulic and electromechanical coupling. The parametric model representing the main geometrical features of the water pump was created using the commercial CAD tool, Catia v 5 and it had some simplifications, compared with the model used for the production water pump but it was considered to be accurate enough to provide a good analysis of the hydraulic performance of the pump. A numerical model of the hydraulic part of the water pump was created using the commercial mesh generator, ICEM CFD and CFX 5 was used as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used for the Robust Design Optimization of the electric water pump and the best configuration was selected using a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool over Pareto frontier designs. In spite of the complexity of the operation necessary for the optimization of the electric motor and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> <b>assembly,</b> the optimized electric water pump is more efficient than optimizing just the electric motor, and coupling it with an existing pump. The optimized electric water pump will be validated by experimental tests in the near future...|$|E

Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> reduces fuel efficiency.

An {{electric}} excavator consumes battery {{energy to}} drive {{an electric motor}} attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> to generate <b>hydraulic</b> power. In a conventional hydraulic excavator, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> is controlled by regulators, which are used to optimize the diesel engine efficiency. Because {{of a lack of}} battery energy capacity, an electric excavator controller should consider not only the electric motor efficiency but also the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency. Thus, electric motor and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency maps were constructed. An optimal operating map (OOM) was created based on the most efficient operating points under each input condition. An integrated control algorithm controlled the speed of the electric motor and displacement of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> according to the OOM. To confirm the utility of this algorithm, a model-in-the-loop simulator for the algorithm with an electric excavator was established. The simulation results showed that the integrated control algorithm improved the energy efficiency of an electric excavator...|$|R

In this article, a novel method based on high-frequency harmonic local characteristic-scale decomposition sub-signal separation and discrete cosine transform high-order singular entropy is proposed. In order to reduce noises and other disturbances, the vibration signal is processed by the local characteristic-scale decomposition modified by the high-frequency harmonic. Sub-signal with sensitive information is obtained by blind source separation of the selected intrinsic scale components. Furthermore, the discrete cosine transform high-order spectral analysis algorithm is proposed to extract singular entropies of Shannon and Tsallis to be the degradation features of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> Analysis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is feasible and effective in indicating the performance degradation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
