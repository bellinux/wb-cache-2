This problem admits δ-, δ′-shock wave type solutions, and vacuum states. δ′-Shock is {{a new type of}} singular solutions to systems of conservation laws first introduced in [E. Yu., Panov, V. M. Shelkovich, δ′-Shock waves as a new type of solutions to systems of conservation laws, J. Differential Equations 228 (2006) 49 – 86]. It is a distributional solution of the Riemann problem such that for t> 0 its second component v may contain <b>Dirac</b> <b>measures,</b> the third component w may contain a linear combination of <b>Dirac</b> <b>measures</b> and their derivatives, while the first component u has bounded variation. Using the above mentioned results, we also solve the δ-shock Cauchy problem for the first two equations of the above system. Since δ′-shocks can be constructed by the vanishing viscosity method, they are “natural” solutions to systems of conservation laws. We describe the formation of the δ′-shocks and the vacuum states from smooth solutions of the parabolic problem. The results of this paper {{as well as those of}} the above-mentioned paper show that solutions of systems of conservation laws can develop not only <b>Dirac</b> <b>measures</b> (as in the case of δ-shocks) but their derivatives as well...|$|R

40|$|This work proposes an {{extension}} of a sparse Bayesian learning with dictionary refinement (SBL-DR) algorithm for a super-resolution estimation of time-varying sparse signals. Such signals are represented as a superposition of unknown but fixed number of <b>Dirac</b> <b>measures</b> with a time-varying support; as such the signal is sparse at each moment of time yet locations of <b>Dirac</b> <b>measures</b> are allowed to vary. To recover such signals an optimization framework is proposed that combines SBL-DR techniques and a penalty term that imposes smoothness constraints on the support variations in time. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, which typically combine parameter estimation schemes with some tracking filters, the proposed approach leads to a single objective function that permits a joint recovery of a sparse superposition of time-varying functions (trajectories). A numerical algorithm for efficient optimization of the corresponding cost function is proposed and analyzed; its performance is compared to a Kalman Enhanced Super-resolution Tracking algorithm on an example of estimating parameters of time-varying multipath channels...|$|R
