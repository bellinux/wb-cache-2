50|$|Increase in {{wheel loads}} has {{important}} implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future grain hopper car shipments. The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these wheel loads. As wheel loads increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to <b>handle</b> prolonged <b>rail</b> traffic decreases. Moreover, the ability of a given bridge to <b>handle</b> prolonged <b>rail</b> traffic also decreases as wheel loads increase.|$|R

50|$|With the {{absorption}} of Veneto into Italy in 1866, the Milan-Verona-Venice Railway came under the management of Upper Italian Railways. The size of Porta Vescovo was no longer sufficient in <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> traffic; Porta Nuova was therefore designated as the main station of Verona. In 1900, the building was temporarily enlarged with a central wooden building, while projects were being developing for the new station. Architects initially envisaged the station comprising six platforms with additional tracks for the storage of rolling stock and for freight train operations.|$|R

50|$|Maine Eastern was a {{subsidiary}} of the Morristown & Erie Railway of New Jersey, who won the bid to operate the line in 2003. MERR provided freight service year-round, and passenger service seasonally between Brunswick and Rockland with former New Haven/Amtrak EMD FL-9 locomotives and stainless steel streamlined passenger cars. Maine Eastern was the successor to Safe <b>Handling</b> <b>Rail,</b> which took over operation of the MaineDOT-owned line when the Maine Coast Railroad chose not to bid on a new contract. In September 2015, the Maine Department of Transportation selected the Central Maine and Quebec Railway to operate the line beginning on January 1, 2016.|$|R

50|$|Installations added {{after the}} opening of the dock {{included}} a graving dock, and facilities for <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> born coal shipments. The two coal drops and rail lines were built over {{the far end of the}} dock on timber piers. the first was completed by 1856 at a cost of £3,435, the second, at £3,500, soon after. The 350 ft graving dock was built east of the dock's lock, with an entrance of 70 ft. The design was by Adam Smith, and was contracted to James Taylor (Manchester) for £32,000 in 1855, the work was completed by 1858. Initially a Cornish engine from Perran Foundry (Cornwall) was installed to fill the dock with water from wells, but its use ended when the well's water supply failed.|$|R

40|$|Development of the {{diagnostics}} for ITER tokamak, {{which is}} presently under construction by several international partners at Cadarache in France, {{is a major}} challenge because of severe environment, strict engineering requirements, {{and the need for}} high reliability in the measurements. The diagnostic systems in the upper, equatorial and lower port cells on ITER are designed to be integrated within the interspace and port cell support structures. These structures are interfacing with remote <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> system for the cask operations, thus facilitating the removal and installation of the diagnostics in the port and hence minimizing time for working close to the tokamak. In this paper, the challenges associated with the integration of the diagnostics in the port interspace and port cell, as well as their solutions will be addressed and presented. The interspace and the port cell support structures, as well as their interfaces with the biological shield, will be discussed...|$|R

Furthermore, the Comment will show how the Washington court 2 ̆ 7 s recent approach in interpreting railroad deeds has made recreational trail construction more appropriately a legislative matter, rather than a legal one. Section I of the Comment will begin with an historical overview of railroads in the United States, background on the public 2 ̆ 2 Rails-to-Trails 2 ̆ 2 movement, and {{an explanation of the}} underlying public policy and enabling federal law. Section II will then examine the leading federal case on railbanking.
