50|$|The holotype {{skull of}} Guidraco has {{a length of}} thirty-eight centimetres. It is very {{elongated}} with a <b>hollow</b> <b>profile</b> but not very pointed as the upper edge and {{the line of the}} jaw run nearly parallel over most of their length. The ensuing relative robustness of the snout is reinforced by a short main skull opening, a fenestra nasoantorbitalis with just a quarter of skull length, and a lower jaw equalling the rostrum in depth. The snout lacks a crest. Above the eye sockets however, the line of the top of the snout curves steeply upwards, resulting in a very large crest on the frontals, as high as the posterior part of the skull is deep, ending in a rounded top. Due to the angling of the skull roof the crest slightly points forwards and its base extends {{to the back of the}} roof; however, the parietal is not part of it. In front of the crest large impressions of soft tissue are visible but these are plant remains. Further diagnostic features of the skull include an infratemporal fenestra with a narrow lower end, and a jugal of which the front branch extends no further than the front edge of the fenestra nasoantorbitalis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the past}} two decades, {{problems}} of material process simulations and also dynamic and crash simulations have been considered {{for the design of}} safer lightweight roadside and gantry structures. Recently, large lattice space structural systems using specially-designed <b>hollow</b> lightweight <b>profiles</b> have been developed and manufactured for roadside and gantry systems. In addition to their low weight, these systems are competitive in terms of strength, dynamic performance, total system delivery, high design agility, and possibility of customization. Both continuous and discrete (discontinuous) numerical models can be used to simulate the material processes as well as dynamic performance of these lightweight <b>hollow</b> <b>profiles</b> where an efficient discretized numerical model can be developed. Additionally, to calculate accurate loading conditions during service for large highway structures, a novel numerical technique can be employed. For the research work herein, a novel dynamic mesh Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique along with the advanced Complex Damped Spectral-Eigen Technique (CDSET) for vibration of engineering systems has been developed. The production of high performance lightweight alloys for the design of road infrastructure {{is one of the main}} goals of material processes for mobility applications. The aim is to have materials with better properties and lighter weights. In the research work herein, an attempt has also been made to develop the required sophisticated tools for simulation of material processes to achieve <b>hollow</b> <b>profiles</b> with high strength, minimal defects and good dynamic and fatigue performances.

40|$|A weakly {{magnetized}} expanding hydrogen plasma, {{created by}} a cascaded arc, was investigated using optical emission spectroscopy. The emission of the expanding plasma is dominated by H a emission {{in the first part}} of the plasma expansion, after which a sharp transition to a blue afterglow is observed. The position of this sharp transition along the expansion axis depends on the magnetic field strength. The blue afterglow emission is associated with population inversion of the electronically excited atomic hydrogen states n = 4 - 6 with respect to n = 3. By comparing the measured densities with the densities using an atomic collisional radiative model, we conclude that atomic recombination processes cannot account for the large population densities observed. Therefore, molecular processes must be important for the formation of excited states and for the occurrence of population inversion. This is further corroborated at the transition from red to blue, where a <b>hollow</b> <b>profile</b> of the excited states n = 4 - 6 in the radial direction is observed.
