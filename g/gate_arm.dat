Violators are identified immediately, as the barrier will not permit the violator to proceed.

50|$|The film {{begins in}} a large garage structure, where Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) and Commandant Mauser (Art Metrano) meet up with former cadets, (now Sgts.) Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blankes (Brant van Hoffman). It seems {{one of the two}} police academies is getting the axe due to the state government's unwillingness to {{continue}} financing two academies, and Mauser wants Copeland and Blankes to make sure Lassard screws up. The men agree to the plan, knowing this may be their only chance at revenge at Lassard for (somewhat deservingly) graduating them at the bottom of their class. Afterwards, Mauser and Proctor find themselves and their car stuck inside the garage (as they were forewarned it was closing soon), but when they both get out to try to forcibly open the <b>gate</b> <b>arm,</b> the car falls out of park and starts rolling backwards down the ramp, while Proctor tries futilely to stop it.|$|E

30|$|Advancing {{pedestrian}} {{safety at}} rail grade crossings is a challenging issue for many reasons. Pedestrian crossing incidents occur in different settings requiring {{the coordination of}} different stakeholders with context-sensitive solutions. For example, incidents involving violations at rail grade crossings are different from trespassing incidents away from such crossings. Note that violations in this context can occur in three occasions [33, p. 28]: (a) when a pedestrian enters the crossing when the warning lights are flashing but before the <b>gate</b> <b>arms</b> have begun to move; (b) when a pedestrian enters the crossing when the <b>gate</b> <b>arms</b> are in motion, either in their descent (before train arrival) or ascent (after train departure); and, (c) when a pedestrian enters the crossing after the <b>gate</b> <b>arms</b> are in their horizontal position. On the other hand, trespassing incidents involve individuals who are trespassing on railroad rights-of-way at locations other than authorized grade crossings, including overhead and underground crossings.|$|R

30|$|In California, CalTrain {{developed}} their own design criteria regarding grade crossings and began implementing them in 1999 [6]. These standard practices utilize active warning devices similar to those at vehicular crossings: signal equipment modified from that of vehicular crossing, crossing <b>gate</b> <b>arm,</b> and a crossing configuration which channels pedestrians. Different design criteria apply for pedestrian crossings in general regarding warning time, center fence, warning devices, safety buffer zone, warning assemblies, gate recovery, as well as pedestrian crossings at stations, at stations and roadway, and crossings between roadway crossings.|$|E
40|$|Innovative Rail Ltd. of Cedar Rapids, Iowa {{produced}} a new rail/highway crossing <b>gate</b> <b>arm</b> that shows promise in two areas: a. Minimizing arm breakage, and b. Added target value to motorists. The new gate was demonstrated to the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, and that railroad has requested its use at two crossings on an "experimental basis" {{to determine if}} its installation provides relief in those areas. On April 18, 1986, the Department observed {{a test of the}} material under field conditions with the Transportation Company. The gate received four mid-center strikes at 5 MPH by a company truck while in the lowered position, and showed no damage. In a fifth mid-center strike at 15 MPH, the gate was visibly damaged at the connection to its raising mechanism, but continued to function though at a 5 - 10 degree drop. Several pictures of the gate and its saddle mechanism are shown in Appendix A of this report.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{conformational}} {{changes in the}} <b>gate</b> <b>arm</b> of a three-terminal device is investigated. In the ground state, the gate (triphenyl) arm is nonplanar, where the middle phenyl ring is approximately 30 ° out-of-plane relative to other two rings. At this geometry, the calculated tunnel current (Id) {{as a function of}} external bias (Vds) across the two D−A substituted arms exhibits a typical insulator-semiconductor behavior. Similar Id−Vds characteristics is calculated when planarity of the triphenyl arm is restored. However, a significant increase, by more than an order of magnitude, and a distinct variation in the current are predicted in its operational mode (Vds> 1. 5 V) when additional nonplanarity is induced in the triphenyl chain. Analysis of the results suggest that, unlike in “voltage ” gating, neither the HOMO−LUMO gap nor the dipole moment of the system undergo significant changes due to pure conformational gating, as observed in this study. Instead, the observed conformational gating affects the current via localization/delocalization of the electronic wave function in the conduction channel. Furthermore, the tunneling current corresponding to conformational gating in two different directions appears to exhibit oscillatory nature with a phase factor of π/ 2 {{in the presence of the}} gate field. The current modulation is found to reach its maximum only under exclusive effect of voltage or conformational gating and diminishes when both of them are present. 1...|$|E
40|$|Northern States Power Company (NSP) is {{examining}} various alternatives {{to modify the}} automatic spillway gates at the Wissota Hydro Plant on the Chippewa River at Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. The gates are called "stauwerke" gates. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to assure that the automatic spillway gates operate properly during a probable-maximum-flood (PMF) as required by the Federal Energy Re&ulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The position of the gates must be controllable {{so that they can be}} fully lowered or raised with Lake Wissota at its normal elevation of 898. 0 ft. The gates must also be fully open during a PMF. The spillway has 13 automatic gates each 64 feet wide in the configuration shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows a photo of the prototype spillway with gate 1 starting at the south abutment on the right. Each gate is connected to a 144. 5 ton counterweight through linkages and arms as shown in Fig. 3. Records of openings and closings from 1982 to 1985 show that the gates have operated automatically. Gates 2 through 13 open when the lake elevation is about 0. 6 ft above the normal elevation of 898 ft and close when the elevation drops about 0. 5 ft below normal. Gate 1 is controlled by a chain hoist and can be pulled down to about 6 ft and used to somewhat control the lake elevation. When the gates open automatically, they open a distance of 3. 1 to 3. 6 feet. The maximum opening of the gates was 6 feet in the 1941 flood. The 13 gates were expected to be capable of passing 263, 000 cfs. With the PMF of 363, 000 cfs, other means have to be provided to pass the extra 100, 000 cfs. Therefore, the questions are whether or not the gates will operate properly, and if the anticipated flow can be passed. Presently, in the fully lowered position the gates will be 10 feet below pool El. 898 ft. By removing curbs around the <b>gate</b> <b>arm</b> openings, the gates would be horizontal and thus down 10. 83 feet. It is not possible to test the prototype gates in the fully lowered position. Therefore, NSP proposed to run field tests on Gate 1 of the Wissota Dam spillway, correlate the results with a physical hydraulic model at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, and expand the model studies to test conditions not possible in the prototype.
