5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to {{cause it to}} dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 {{to the north of}} Bermuda. Located over warm waters and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on August 28. Tropical Storm Dean lightly affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is a fire <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> combustible vegetation {{that occurs in}} the countryside or rural area. Depending {{on the type of}} vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E

After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the month, an area of convection persisted in association with a broad low-level circulation about 565km (350mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. The disturbance tracked west-southwestward, and on March 2 the Météo-France (MFR) declared it as a weak depression. Initially <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> moderate wind shear, the system at first failed to maintain deep convection. Early on March 4, convection increased and organized around the center of circulation, and the MFR classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve, about 270km (170mi) southwest of the Agaléga Islands. Initially the MFR forecast that the depression would intensify further before striking Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|R. s. annamiticus, {{known as}} the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros, Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticu or Vietnamese rhinoceros, once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.

In 2006, a single population, {{estimated}} at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam.
