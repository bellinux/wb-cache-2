Their joint works include the Mediterranean Sea Club in Achzib (1960–1961), Dubiner House (1963), the Chaim Laskov Officer Training School (1963–1967) Bahad 1, the main officer training school of the Israel Defense Forces, just later the synagogue (1969–1971) at the same academy, and the Bat Yam city hall (1963–1969). Their designs shared aspects in common with the metabolist movement, borrowing metaphoric shapes from nature for use in planning morphological structures. The modularity of these works, such as the Dubiner House, provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie.|$|E

After university, he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded a decorative arts <b>firm</b> <b>with</b> Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others: the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.

5|$|Baltimore {{was also}} home to the piano-building {{businesses}} of William Knabe and Charles Steiff. Knabe emigrated to the United States in 1831, and he founded the <b>firm,</b> <b>with</b> Henry Gaehle, in 1837. It began manufacturing pianos in 1839. The company {{became one of the}} most prominent and respected piano manufacturers in the country, and was the dominant corporation in the Southern market. The company floundered after a fire destroyed a factory, and the aftermath of the Civil War lessened demand in the Southern area where Knabe's sales were concentrated. By the end of the 19th century, however, Knabe's sons, Ernest and William, had re-established the firm as one of the leading piano companies in the country. They built sales in the west and north, and created new designs that made Knabe & Co. the third best-selling piano manufacturer in the country. The pianos were well regarded enough that the Japanese government chose Knabe as its supplier for schools in 1879. After the death of William and Ernest Knabe, the company went public. In the 20th century, Knabe's company became absorbed into other corporations, and the pianos are now manufactured by Samick, a Korean producer.|$|E

Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R.

5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged <b>firm,</b> <b>with</b> both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{investigation}} of the effectiveness of discretionary accruals in detecting fraud and evaluating internal control weaknesses. Our sample is divided into four subsamples: healthy firms, firms that experienced internal control weaknesses, firms that committed financial reporting fraud, and firms that committed fraud by violating stock options reporting rules. We develop a logistic regression model with discretionary accruals variables and other financial variables, to identify the characteristics of firms that have internal control weaknesses and the two different types of financial statement fraud. The model is 79. 1 % accurate in distinguishing <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> internal control weaknesses from <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> financial reporting fraud; 71. 6 % accurate in distinguishing <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> internal control weaknesses from <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> options reporting; and 87. 5 % accurate in distinguishing <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> financial reporting fraud from <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> options reporting fraud.

50|$|Empirical {{research}} on the profit impact of marketing strategy indicated that <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> a high market share were often quite profitable, but so were many <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> low market share.

Porter’s explanation of this is that <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> high market share were successful because they pursued a cost leadership strategy and <b>firms</b> <b>with</b> low market share were successful because they used market segmentation to focus on a small but profitable market niche. Firms in the middle were less profitable because they did not have a viable generic strategy.|$|R
