5|$|In early September, Huntsman began {{shifting}} campaign {{resources from}} Florida to New Hampshire; by moving staffers, Huntsman {{had the largest}} operational staff there at the time. The development came as the campaign reorganized New Hampshire operations, firing <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> manager {{in charge of the}} state, Ethan Elion. Elion was replaced by Sarah Crawford Stewart, who had served as state-director of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's New Hampshire campaign before he suspended his bid after the Ames Straw Poll.|$|E
5|$|Project Chanology began <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> by {{organizing}} and delivering {{a series of}} denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes.

5|$|The British did {{not attempt}} to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their {{transports}}, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{in its original}} form {{was sponsored by the}} Democratic Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious groups was passed by the United States Senate. The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> against psychiatry.|$|E
5|$|After Croatia {{launched}} the Battle of the Barracks to capture JNA facilities in Croatia on 14â€“15 September, the JNA launched a small-scale operation against Vukovar {{to relieve the}} city garrison. At the same time, it began large-scale mobilization in preparation for <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> in Croatia. It was met with widespread refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26 percent of those called up reported for service.|$|E

5|$|As part of <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> against shipping, {{around each}} full moon from late January 1945 XXBomber Command {{conducted}} minelaying missions. On {{the night of}} 25/26January, 41 B-29s from the 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups laid six minefields in the approaches to Singapore. On the same night other B-29s laid mines off Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay {{as part of the}} largest single aerial minelaying effort in the Pacific up to that time. On the night of 27/28February, twelve B-29s were dispatched to lay mines in the Straits of Johor near Singapore. Ten of these aircraft successfully deployed 55 mines in the target area, and another aircraft mined Penang. During the next full moon period on the night of 28/29March, 22 B-29s laid mines near Singapore. No aircraft were lost during these missions.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} some {{significant}} changes to <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, {{and free}} sale) and {{specifically}} in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E

5|$|In the Peloponnesian War, {{which had}} ended in 404 BC, Sparta had enjoyed {{the support of}} nearly every {{mainland}} Greek state and the Persian Empire, and in the months and years following that war, {{a number of the}} island states of the Aegean had come under its control. This solid base of support, however, was fragmented in the years following the war. Despite the collaborative nature of the victory, Sparta alone received the plunder taken from the defeated states and the tribute payments from the former Athenian Empire. Sparta's allies were further alienated when, in 402 BC, Sparta attacked and subdued Elis, a member of the Peloponnesian League that had angered the Spartans {{during the course of the}} Peloponnesian War. Corinth and Thebes refused to send troops to assist Sparta in <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> against Elis.|$|E

His village renamed its sports complex in his honour and completed a memorial garden, with cairn, in May 2010. The Deputy Provost of Fife Council, Councillor Lizz Mogg, officially unveiled the cairn on the 22nd in the presence of Liddell's widow and other relatives.

5|$|The Luftwaffe was {{detailed}} {{to destroy}} Fighter Command before the planned invasion of Britain could take place. The OKL {{hoped that the}} destruction of the British fighter force would force the British to come to terms by air power alone and the very risky Operation Sea Lion would not be needed. The enormous numerical superiority of British naval forces over their German opponents made a crossing of the Channel very dangerous, even with air superiority. Furthermore, the aircraft losses of the spring campaign had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain, and it could not begin <b>its</b> <b>campaign</b> against Fighter Command immediately. It was forced to wait until it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made in August 1940.|$|E

It lost the last group stage match against the Kings XI.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Adlertag did not deter the Luftwaffe from {{continuing}} <b>its</b> <b>campaign.</b> The assault against RAF airfields continued throughout August and into September 1940.

At first, it attempted to destroy RAF bases, then switched to strategic bombing by day and night. It tried to achieve the destruction of several British industries at the same time, switching from bombing aircraft factories, to attacking supporting industries, import or distribution networks such as coastal ports. An attempt was even made against unrelated targets, such as destroying {{the morale of the}} British population.|$|E
