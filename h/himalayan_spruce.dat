40|$|During {{a recent}} survey of forest tree {{diseases}} in Western and Central Bhutan, Sirococcus shoot blight and an associated Sirococcus sp. were found on saplings and mature trees of Eastern <b>Himalayan</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea spinulosa). Based on morphological characteristics and DNA sequence comparisons of the ITS region of the rDNA operon, representative isolates from Bhutan were unequivocally identified as Sirococcus conigenus. The DNA sequence data also showed that these isolates belong to the P group of S. conigenus. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of Sirococcus shoot blight from the Himalayas or any other part of Asia. Sirococcus conigenus does not appear to cause dramatic damage at the moment, but this fungus has the potential to cause severe disease problems on P. spinulosa in Bhutan.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} – Bhutan is a small, landlocked, densely forested {{country in}} the South-Eastern Himalayas (FAO 1999, 2001). Forests are of immense importance for the ecology, economy and social well-being {{of this country and}} for the livelihood of its people. In mountainous areas at elevations between about 2100 and 4200 m asl., temperate conifer forests form the natural vegetation {{in this part of the}} Himalayas. These forests occupy about 24 % of the total area of Bhutan and they consist mainly of Eastern Himalayan fir (Abies densa), Eastern <b>Himalayan</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea spinulosa), Himalayan hemlock (Tsuga dumosa) and Himalayan Blue pine (Pinus wallichiana) (Grierson – Long 1983, Rosset 1999). Other conifers and various broadleaved tree species (Rhododendron spp., Betula spp., Populus spp., Acer spp., Sorbus spp. and Salix spp.) are often admixed to the aforementioned major conifer species or sometimes dominate forest stands on specific sites (Grierson – Long 1983, Rosset 1999). Another important conifer in Bhutan is Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii), which occurs mainly in sub-tropical and warm temperate forests (Grierson – Long 1983). This pine does, however, not form part of cold temperate conifer forests. In the 1980 's conifer forests in Bhutan were affected by two serious, large-scale fores...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents a}} study on Ceratocystis spp. with hat-shaped ascospores. Previously only six species of Ceratocystis with this spore form were known. These include C. fimbriata, C. pirilliformis, C. albofundus, C. moniliformis, C. moniliformopsis and C. acericola. In this study, we have discovered and tentatively described three new species with hat-shaped ascospores. One of these group with the larger C. fimbriata clade, while the other two reside within the larger C. coerulescens clade. Chapter one provides a concise summary of the literature pertaining to the genus Ceratocystis. The intention of the chapter is to introduce readers to this important genus of plant pathogens {{and to provide a}} background regarding their taxonomy, ecology, biochemistry and variation in species. Emphasis is placed on the distinction of Ceratocystis from Ophiostoma, as ell as on those Ceratocystis spp. with hat-shaped ascospores that negatively impact upon plantation forestry species. This chapter shows how Ceratocystis spp. associated with hardwood species in commercial forestry plantations have increased in number and it provides the background for research presented in the following five chapters. In the second chapter of this dissertation, a new species of Ceratocystis was discovered amongst isolates from the Himalayan mountain range of Bhutan. This fungus, in association with the bark beetle Ips schmutzenhoferi, is responsible for large-scale deaths of <b>Himalayan</b> <b>spruce</b> trees in Bhutan. The fungus is morphologically very similar to C. moniliformis and C. moniliformopsis, but differences in culture morphology, survival at different incubation temperatures and DNA sequence data based on three different gene regions supported {{the fact that this is}} a unique species. The fungus has thus been tentatively described as Ceratocystis bhutanensis prov. nom. In chapter 3, I consider isolates of a Ceratocystis sp. recently discovered associated with dying clove trees in Northern Sulawesi, Indonesia. The fungus was found at a very high level of incidence, but was at first identified as C. fimbriata, based on morphological characteristics. Differences were observed in cultures of this fungus when they were compared with C. fimbriata especially in terms of colony colour and growth at different temperatures. Morphological differences were also observed when the clove fungus was compared with C. fimbriata isolates. When three different DNA gene regions were sequenced and compared, it was clear that this fungus represents a new species. The fungus is, therefore, tentatively described as Ceratocystis polychrome prov. nom. in this dissertation. Ceratocystis polychrome prov. nom. Isolates obtained from cloves in Sulawesi displayed three distinctly different culture morphologies. In Chapter 4 of this dissertation we used DNA sequence data and microsatellite markers to consider whether these differences could be observed at the molecular level. Comparisons of sequence data for the ITS region gave no distinction between any of the morphological groups. A total of 50 isolates were studies using microsatellites markers developed for C. fimbriata. No distinction could be obtained between isolates representing the three different culture morphological groups. The 50 isolates were subsequently treated as one population in further analyses. With the aid of the microsatellite markers, it was shown that this population probably originated from Sulawesi and that it benefits form sexual outcrossing. In chapter five of this dissertation, a study was undertaken to consider the taxonomic status of C. moniliformis. Consideratble variation has been noted in different descriptions of this species. It also has a very wide host and geographic distribution raising speculation that C. moniliformis represents a species complex rather than a single taxon. Based on morphological and DNA sequence data from three gene regions, isolated from Sumatra were described as a new species, which we have tentatively named C. tribiliformis prov. nom. The other C. moniliformis isolates were all the same, despite the fact that they originated from a wide range of hosts and areas. The fungus correctly bearing the name C. moniliformis, C. moniliformis sensu stricto, therefore does not seem to tepresent a species complex. Species such as the closely related C. tribiliformis prov. nom., C bhutanensis prov. nom., C. omanensis prov. nom. and C. moniliformopsis all belong to the larger C. moniliformis sensu lato group, and all have hat-shaped ascospores, conical spines on the ascomatal bases, disc-shaped bases to the ascomatal necks and are phylogenetically closely related to C. moniliformis. Studies presented in this dissertation provide considerable new knowledge regarding various Ceratocystis spp. with hat-shaped ascospores. Three new species are described and I have also been able to show that C. moniliformis sensu stricto is monophyletic. Two of the species (C. tribiliformis prov. nom. and C. bhutanensis nom. prov.) group within the larger C. coerulescens clade while C. polychrome prov. nom. groups within the larger C. fimbriata clade. Studies in this dissertation have also improved our knowledge of the identity of several species previously incorrectly identified as either C. moniliformis or C. fimbriata. What has clearly emerged from this dissertation is the need for a monograph of Ceratocystis to include all new species and to thoroughly consider the population biology and ecology of all species.
