5|$|A {{recently}} excavated site on Stronsay {{has produced}} a thousand pieces of flint and what may be <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temporary camp. With a tentative dating of 7000 BC or older it {{may prove to be}} the oldest settlement site found so far on Orkney.|$|E
5|$|As Carlos moved inland, {{it turned}} to the {{northwest}} {{in response to the}} anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status. By 12hours after landfall, there was little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circulation on satellite imagery. Late on June27, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near Acapulco. The circulation {{turned to the}} southwest and emerged into the Pacific Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E
5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam {{that creates}} a passage through the ice towards {{the source of the}} heat bloom. When the team arrives at the {{abandoned}} whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prehistoric civilization and {{what appears to be a}} sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages.|$|E

5|$|As well as finding {{objective}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime being committed, investigations {{can also}} be used to prove the intent (known by the legal term mens rea). For example, the Internet history of convicted killer Neil Entwistle included references to a site discussing How to kill people.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{identifying}} direct <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime, digital forensics {{can be used}} {{to attribute}} evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents. Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{of these}} pits {{were found to}} contain the remains of human skeletons, which are now stored in the Weston-super-Mare Museum in Weston-super-Mare. Eighteen full skeletons were found, of which ten show <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> violent death (including sword cuts in the skulls). It is {{possible}} that the Romans or the Belgic raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{unable to}} find any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fort in the area, the {{soldiers}} went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg. Dissatisfied with their findings, the soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern Columbia County. They captured a number of residents of Sugarloaf Township on August 31, but these were soon released.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{fractured}} {{hip bone}} {{was found in}} a specimen of Iguanodon, which had an injury to its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called osteophytes.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{have shown}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 12th-century masonry {{building}} {{on the top of}} the hill, which may be from the probable adulterine castle. The side of the mound may have been terraced for agricultural use due to much of the surrounding land flooded on a regular basis during the medieval period.|$|E

5|$|Greenland ice cores show <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large {{volcanic}} eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as {{being associated with}} Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years ago, {{in the early}} Jurassic, provides the first clear <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn {{lies within}} a {{geological}} structure which is interpreted as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> volcanic caldera. This is a semi-circular series of faults which sweep eastwards to encompass Helvellyn, Patterdale, Deepdale and Fairfield, and which abut against a major north-south fault {{to the west}} (along {{the line of the}} A591 road).|$|E
5000|$|It {{purports to}} reveal the {{fundamental}} basis for arithmetic. However, it is our everyday arithmetical practices such as counting which are fundamental; for if a persistent discrepancy arose between counting and Principia, this would be treated as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> error in Principia (e.g., that Principia did not characterise numbers or addition correctly), not as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> error in everyday counting.|$|R

5|$|In 2014, astronomers {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} , an object {{half the size of}} Sedna in a 4200-year orbit similar to Sedna's and a perihelion within Sedna's range of roughly 80AU, which led some to speculate that it offered <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trans-Neptunian planet.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard find was ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard. Both earlier Iron Age and later mediaeval materials were also discovered, but there was no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Roman settlement in the vicinity.|$|E
