5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E

I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> bone flex. And when I {{got to the point}} where I felt like it was going to snap, I had to tap out." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{was among}} those who {{strongly}} supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for [...] "its heedless energy and joy, it reminded me of how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way".|$|E
500|$|Evelyn Waugh, who {{reviewed}} the early novels {{as they appeared}} at two-year intervals, found Widmerpool particularly compelling. He wrote to Powell after reading At Lady Molly's (fourth volume): [...] "In the opening pages <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> void of Widmerpool really aching – I could not have borne another page's delay for his entry. Did you intend him to dominate the series?" [...] After reviewing Casanova's Chinese Restaurant Waugh complained of a [...] "sad disappointment – only three pages of Widmerpool".|$|E

500|$|The {{career of}} the {{character}} Daniel Baciagalupo/Danny Angel in the novel bears numerous similarities to that of John Irving. [...] In an October 2009 interview with the New York magazine, Irving stated: [...] "I tried {{to have fun with}} the self-referential stuff. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to be a little playful, because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me." [...] In his last novel, Until I Find You (2005) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11, by a woman in her 20s.|$|E
500|$|The Ring production, filmed for {{television}} in 1980, initially provoked controversy, but was celebrated after its final performance in 1980 with a 45-minute standing ovation. Chéreau disliked grand opera, but said: [...] "After Bayreuth, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{need to work}} on a theatrical project of some breadth... I have never put on little things. I am interested only in spectacles that rise above themselves". He first considered Goethe's Faust but then directed in 1981 Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt for Villeurbane and Paris, aiming at [...] "an incandescence of theatrical experience, a global spectacle".|$|E
500|$|On 3December 1954, Cresswell led a {{formation}} of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires {{in the shape}} of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its return from Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. His successor as commanding officer of the conversion unit took over on 27March 1956. Cresswell was posted to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as Director of Air Staff Policy. The position put him in line for promotion to group captain but, as he admitted later, [...] "I had itchy feet and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Service had already given me all the operational flying I was likely to get." [...] He decided to resign his commission in December 1956, and was discharged from the RAAF on 30April 1957.|$|E

500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Disney {{began to}} {{consider}} producing a sequel, {{but rather than}} using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. [...] "I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind," [...] Burton explained. [...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it." [...] The 2004 video game [...] did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice, and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Olivier Deriviere, who recorded the score with a 70-piece orchestra, then modified and changed it using electronic equipment. In {{an interview with}} Game Informer, Deriviere said: [...] "During my first contact , I was quite confused by so much information and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> music should reflect this confusion". Deriviere disclosed that players would not hear the main theme {{until the end of}} the game, given that it is scattered in pieces through the rest of the score to reflect the nature of the game and the story of Nilin. For his work, Deriviere was awarded the 2013 IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media. Remember Me was created with Unreal Engine 3 to lessen the workload involved in making a new intellectual property with a nascent studio of just under 100 employees. To evaluate the engine, Dontnod collaborated with Epic Games' engineering team at various stages during production.|$|E

500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> same way”.|$|E
500|$|A {{muscle strain}} forced Mackin {{to miss a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Shrewsbury Town in July 2008 and he returned to pre-season training later that month. He was shown a red card after picking up two yellow cards in his first appearance of 2008–09, which was Wrexham's first match in the Conference Premier, as they beat Stevenage Borough 5–0 at home on 9 August 2008. On reflection, Mackin said [...] "As for the second yellow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> ball was there to be won and I thought that's what I did. Looking back now I know I should have stayed on my feet". He was handed a one-match suspension and returned in a 1–1 draw away to Rushden & Diamonds on 17 August 2008. Mackin scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard shot against Grays Athletic, which was Wrexham's only goal in a 2–1 away defeat on 20 September 2008. Despite starting the season as a regular in the team, he found opportunities hard to come by after the arrival of Dean Saunders as manager.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} an embarrassment for Trueblood and the university. In his memoirs, Handy {{recalled}} being summoned to Trueblood's office: [...] "His desk was {{piled high with}} letters...and clippings...from around the country...and {{he also had a}} copy of the McCutcheon cartoon. (He) was taking all of this as ridicule, although I had publicized the story with sincere enthusiasm for a new advance in education of which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> University of Michigan should be proud." [...] The faculty voted unanimously to suspend Handy for a year for [...] "publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors." [...] In addition to the suspension, Handy was charged as a [...] "faker" [...] in the press: Henry J. Handy, the student-correspondent at the University of Michigan who sent a sensational story to the Chicago newspapers, relating how Professor Thomas C. Trueblood had a class in love-making, has been suspended for one year and the story has been branded as a 'fake.' [...] Handy based the story on an incident that occurred during the rehearsal of a drama, when Professor Trueblood showed one of the students how to kneel to propose.|$|E

500|$|After {{four years}} in the role, Irving decided to leave Holby City and return to {{performing}} in theatre. He stated: [...] "I've had four great years but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> time had come to leave. The show has gone from strength to strength so now seems a good time to go." [...] Of his decision to leave, Irving explained that, while he enjoyed Meyer's sureness and confidence, he found it difficult to [...] "switch off" [...] the character outside of work, and had been forced to [...] "put {{the rest of his life}} on hold" [...] whilst part of the series, deeming it to be an [...] "intense experience." [...] He felt that, had he stayed in the series, Meyer could not have remained enigmatic much longer, and believed: [...] "you have to stop when a character's time is through." [...] Following Irving's departure from Holby City, Benji Wilson of the Radio Times questioned whether he would ever consider returning. Irving responded: [...] "I don't know–my feeling is that Meyer was of his time. He's the kind of character that belongs at the launch of series like Holby and I think that's where he should remain. The memory of Meyer is important to me and I want it to stay as it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Angels Cry" [...] {{is about}} {{maintaining}} {{hope that a}} fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once. Carey sings [...] "I’m willing to live and die for our love/Baby {{we can get back}} that shine." [...] However, the lyrics [...] "Super natural love conquers all" [...] could also be interpreted as feeling God's love. Adam Holz of Plugged In thought that the lyrics were [...] "depressing," [...] while Lauren Murphy of Entertainment IE felt that the lyrics [...] "When you and I say goodbye, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> angels cry" [...] were too sentimental. Although Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that the song had a [...] "sad" [...] tone, she praised its production. Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Angels Cry" [...] in his list of the album's best tracks. Michael Cragg of musicOMH was critical of the song, writing that it is a [...] "limp ballad" [...] which he thought was trying too hard at recreating some of Carey's previous material, and concluded by writing that it [...] "ultimately ends up making you want to hear the original version more than anything". A reviewer for DJ Booth commented that the song sounded as thought it could have been released in 1994.|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 2009, Barton was {{questioned}} by the Indian media on why she chose to sign on the project to which she responded [...] "I'm interested {{in all kinds of}} things, I did this film for moral reasons. Also, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> story needed to be told, I feel {{that this is going to}} be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E
