40|$|Yong Li, John J Voorhees, Gary J FisherDepartment of Dermatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USAType I {{collagen}} (COL 1) is {{the predominant}} structural protein in the skin. COL 1 forms densely packed fibrils which {{are essential for}} maintaining skin mechanical properties and youthful appearance. 1 The enzyme matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP 1) cleaves COL 1 fibrils at a single site. 2 Once cleaved by MMP 1, COL 1 fibrils can be degraded by other proteases. MMP 1 expression is elevated during natural aging and chronic sun exposure, ie, photoaging, leading to excessive degradation of COL 1. 3 This excessive degradation contributes to COL 1 deficiency in {{the skin of the}} elderly. COL 1 deficiency <b>impairs</b> <b>skin</b> structural <b>integrity</b> and appearance. Given the detrimental role of MMP 1 in mediating age-associated fragmentation of COL 1 fibrils, it would be beneficial to include MMP 1 inhibitors in topical antiaging skin care products.

METHOD: cross-sectional study using data collected for four months. RNs and students daily registered patients, took history (at admission), performed physical assessments, and established nursing diagnoses, nursing plans/prescriptions, and assessed care delivered to 17 patients using software. Indicators concerning the incidence and prevalence of nursing diagnoses, rate of effectiveness, risk diagnoses, and rate of effective prevention of complications were computed. RESULTS: the Risk for imbalanced body temperature was the most frequent diagnosis (23. 53 %), while the least frequent was Risk for constipation (0 %).

30|$|Further, single frozen skin {{samples were}} shown to exhibit {{negative}} impedances. Since existence of negative skin impedances is unlikely, such individual cases might be rather attributed to inaccurate fixing of the electrode in the donor chamber before or after clamping the skin into the diffusion cells or other unknown influencing parameters. Even slight differences in {{the distance from the}} tip of the donor electrode to the skin surface may lead to considerably different impedance results, indicating the susceptibility of impedance measurement for slight methodical inaccuracies or external influences. Furthermore, measured impedance ranges of freshly excised and frozen skin of X. laevis overlapped clearly and impedances of freshly excised skin of X. laevis were rather low. Intact human skin samples are usually characterized by an impedance of higher than 1  kΩ at 1  kHz and may be rejected below this range based on historical datasets and depending on laboratory-specific conditions [47]. Due to these low impedances of amphibian skin, only little room would be left for the detection of <b>impaired</b> <b>skin</b> samples and transition between intact and <b>impaired</b> <b>skin</b> might be smooth and overlapping. This was also shown by the additional perforation test of two dorsal skin samples, which decreased only about 15 and 50  % in their impedances relative to their original impedances before perforation. Accordingly, when impedance is already low, a structural damage such as a hole in the skin sample is difficult to detect. However, since the check of <b>skin</b> <b>integrity</b> is essential for the permeability test, impedance measurement {{does not appear to be}} suitable for this purpose and the derivation of an impedance cut-off value to distinguish <b>impaired</b> from intact <b>skin</b> samples might be difficult. Additional investigation into other <b>skin</b> <b>integrity</b> tests should be evaluated for suitability, such as the measurement of transevaporative water loss or the absorption of internal standards (e.g., methylene blue). However, as integrity tests are based on species-specific historical datasets, a broad collection of data is necessary for the derivation of cut-off values.|$|R

Methods: The Diagnostic Content Validity Model designed by Fehring was used for validation of the nursing diagnosis; we used it to establish the significance of the risk factors of the nursing diagnosis of at Risk of <b>Impaired</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>Integrity</b> in relation to pressure ulcer development. Correlation analysis was used for evaluation of the relationships between the risk factors. The sample consisted of 126 nurse-experts in accordance with modified Fehring criteria. Results: Out of 23 items, the nurses rated nine as significant (the most frequently present) risk factors (the weighted scores are shown in brackets) : physical immobilisation (0. 92), skeletal prominence (0. 9), imbalanced nutritional state (0. 86), moisture (0. 86), mechanical factors (e. g., shearing forces, pressure, restraint) (0. 84), a Norton Scale score of 14 ≥ points (0. 81), hyperthermia (0. 81), excretions (0. 77), and extremes of age (0. 76). Statistically significant correlations, which are positive and range between 0. 2 and 0. 4, were found between some risk factors.

Method: content validation of nursing diagnosis. 146 defining characteristics and risk factors were identified in the literature in Brazilian and international databases. This was followed by content validation of the definitions of these diagnoses (presented by NANDA-I) and of the operational definitions (developed by the researchers) of the defining characteristics and risk factors, carried out by six expert nurses, regarding relevance, clarity and comprehensiveness. Result: of the 146 defining characteristics and risk factors, 22 were considered redundant and were excluded. The experts proposed changing the definitions of the diagnoses of Impaired Tissue Integrity and Risk for <b>Impaired</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>Integrity.</b> It was possible to identify various defining characteristics and risk factors which are not present in the NANDA-I taxonomy but which are indicated in the literature.

40|$|Purpose: Effective postinsertion {{management}} of central venous access devices (CVADs) {{is important to}} prevent CVAD-associated complications, including catheter-associated bloodstream infections. Although there is a wealth of evidence-based guidelines available to guide the care of CVADs, applying their recommendations to the clinical setting across variable patient groups, CVAD types and international healthcare settings is challenging. This may result in patients receiving suboptimal care. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study using an online survey was performed with an aim to determine current CVAD site care practices internationally. The CVAD site care domains included skin antisepsis, dressing selection, frequency of dressing change and device securement practices across impaired and unimpaired CVAD sites. Results: Clinicians (n = 1044) residing in 34 countries reported diversity in their practice, {{with the majority of}} respondents practicing as nurses (89 %) from North America (81 %) as vascular access specialists (52 %). The respondents’ reported practice was variant, with differing inconsistency to guidelines throughout each of the domains. There was wide variance in the {{management of}} CVAD sites with <b>impaired</b> <b>skin</b> <b>integrity,</b> such as rash, skin stripping/adhesive-related injuries and drainage. Vascular access clinicians reported high levels of confidence in managing CVAD sites, including those with impaired skin. Conclusions: These inconsistencies are reflective of the complex and heterogeneous populations requiring CVADs, the evidence available to support practice in this area, the skills and knowledge of the clinicians caring for them and the resources of the healthcare setting. Further research and education is necessary to ensure that CVAD site care is undertaken effectively to minimise preventable complications. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Uncontrolled faecal {{incontinence}} (FI) secondary to diarrhoea represents a major risk to perianal <b>skin</b> <b>integrity</b> and {{the healing of}} perineal wounds or burns. In an era of heightened awareness of the morbidity and {{the costs associated with}} hospital-acquired infection, there are obvious concerns about the risks of cross-infection associated with diarrhoea or FI. This article evaluates the Zassi Bowel Management System (ZBMS, Hollister®), a product that has been designed to manage diarrhoea, {{faecal incontinence}} and defaecation in situations where a patient is either completely dependent, has overwhelming uncontrolled diarrhoea that poses a threat to <b>skin</b> <b>integrity</b> and is a cross-infection risk, or where normal defaecation poses a risk to wound integrity and sterility...|$|R
