As his theses become repetitious of his propositions, they become abbreviated, and he returns to the accusations made in Short Story. He ends his work claiming that he was right all along, and that he was not an Antinomian.|$|E

500|$|The {{terminology}} {{used to describe}} the buildings of the Gas Boom era is slightly different from that used today. The term [...] "block" [...] was often {{used to describe the}} group of offices or stores located in a building instead of referring to the building. As {{can be seen in the}} boundaries diagram and descriptions <b>herein,</b> these [...] "block" [...] buildings did not occupy an entire city block, but they often had multiple storefronts or offices with multiple occupants. For example, the New York Times article from 1899 (see below) refers to the [...] "Briscoe Block" [...] instead of the Briscoe Building. The article also lists multiple businesses that occupied the building. Another example can be found in a business directory from the Gas Boom Era. Some of the attorneys (and other businesses too) listed their address as part of a [...] "block" [...] such as [...] "Campbell Block" [...] or [...] "Tyner Block". [...] Most of the building names used <b>herein</b> rely on the building names found in either National Register forms or publications from the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana.|$|E
500|$|Romanesque Revival {{architecture}} {{was very}} popular in Hartford City, and at least 7 of the District's contributing buildings were built using this style.

A variation of the Romanesque Revival architectural style known as Richardsonian Romanesque was popular in America {{near the end of the}} 19th century, when much of the construction around Hartford City's courthouse took place. [...] The courthouse and Presbyterian Church are outstanding examples of Henry Hobson Richardson's variation in Romanesque Revival style. [...] (See photos <b>herein.)</b> [...] A corner tower, arched windows, recessed entrances, steeply pitched roofs, and multiple exterior textures (rustication) are typical of this style of architecture. [...] The Richardsonian Romanesque buildings differ from the original Romanesque Revival buildings by having rough-textured exterior surfaces instead of all-smooth surfaces. [...] The Hotel Ingram, Kirshbaum, and Weiler buildings were built in Romanesque Revival style with arched windows and multiple exterior textures, but they were not identified in the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form as Richardsonian (see photos of all three buildings <b>herein.)</b> ...|$|E
