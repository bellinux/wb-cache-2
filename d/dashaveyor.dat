25|$|The <b>Dashaveyor</b> was an {{automated}} guideway transit (AGT) system developed during the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} to build an {{offshore}} terminal with docks equipped with <b>Dashaveyor</b> tracks instead of a conventional container shipping port on land. An operator would load containers onto <b>Dashaveyor</b> cars, which would then enter a tunnel to move them at high speed to the shore. There they would exit the tunnel and automatically drive the container to its storage location, and optionally lift it to stack them. In a <b>Dashaveyor</b> equipped port, a single vehicle would pick up, move and stack the containers. Normally each of these steps required a separate, manned, vehicle. Additionally, the ships never had to enter port, which had major advantages in terms of siting and construction.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} {{companies}} was the Bendix Corporation, who found the <b>Dashaveyor</b> concept and decided {{it would make the}} basis for a competitive AGT system. Its main advantages in this role were its high speed and its ability to switch among a network of tracks. Most competing AGT systems operated at a fixed speed that was much lower than the <b>Dashaveyor,</b> and normally followed fixed routes. They purchased the company {{and turned it into a}} subsidiary, developing the AGT versions in Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

The small {{horizontal}} wheels {{at the front}} steer the larger running wheels just visible behind them. The electrical supply uses a small 3rd rail shaped like a V with a pickup that pushes up {{on the bottom of}} it. The operator can also be seen in the front left of the cabin.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Dashaveyor</b> concept {{started with}} Stanley Dashew, a {{prolific}} inventor who {{is best known}} for building the embossing machines used to produce the BankAmericard, the first plastic bank credit card system, which later evolved into Visa.|$|E
25|$|The four chosen {{systems were}} the Bendix <b>Dashaveyor,</b> the Ford ACT, TTI Hovair (a {{spin-off}} of General Motors) and the Rohr ROMAG, represented by its former rubber-wheeled prototype, the Monocab. Boeing and Vought also showed cars from their larger systems, Boeing's {{version of the}} Alden staRRcar being installed in Morgantown, and the Vought Airtrans being installed at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Ford would later install a small ACT deployment at a shopping mall in Dearborn, and <b>Dashaveyor</b> would win a contest for the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride, but further sales were not forthcoming. Several European companies also presented models of their designs. The plans to use Transpo {{as a way to}} excite mayors into buying the AGT systems failed, a disappointment to both the UMTA and Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{the company}} {{displayed}} the <b>Dashaveyor</b> {{as one of}} four major deployments shown at the Transpo '72 show in Washington, D.C. Like the other vendors, Bendix found little third-party interest in the AGT market, {{and was one of}} the first vendors to withdraw from the market, inactive by 1975.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 the Copper Range company {{decided to}} dig a new shaft at their White Pine mine in Michigan. Copper Range was {{involved}} {{in a number of different}} technology projects, and for the new shaft they decided to experiment with automated ore hauling to the nearby mill. They reached an agreement with <b>Dashaveyor</b> in 1966 to install a pilot system, and when this proved successful, the two companies signed a contract for a complete system.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} major sales efforts for the <b>Dashaveyor</b> AGT was a system for the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Bendix and Varo both received parts of a $1 million grant from the new Urban Mass Transit Administration to study the system. Both bids came in well over the airport's budget, {{and in the end}} it was won by the Vought Airtrans. A similar system for Newark International Airport ended when the entire project was put on hold.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{developed}} by the <b>Dashaveyor</b> Company for moving cargo, the system used motorized pallets that could be routed on the fly to any destination in an extended network. The pallets could run at high speeds between stations, climb steep grades at slower speeds, and even climb vertically. They were designed to replace several manned vehicles with a single automated one, controlled from a central operating station. One such system was installed and operated at the White Pine mine from 1968 to 1972, but was considered a failure.|$|E
25|$|Bendix Corporation {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the basic <b>Dashaveyor</b> system in order to use it as the basis for an AGT system during the heyday of urban transport research in the late 1960s. Often referred to as the Bendix-Dashaveyor in this form, the system used the basic design of the cargo system, but with a larger passenger body running on rubber wheels. Only one such system was installed, the 5km long Toronto Zoo Domain Ride which operated from 1976 until a lack of proper maintenance led to an accident that forced its closure in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Varo declined, {{and sold}} their {{interest}} in Monocab to Rohr, Inc., which later re-emerged as the Rohr ROMAG. LTV decided to submit their original design for the May 1971 deadline, developing their guideway to match existing highway specifications and construction techniques {{as a way to}} lower costs. Since they had no time to develop prototype hardware, they instead backed up their proposal with an extensive computer simulation of full operations. Westinghouse and <b>Dashaveyor</b> (Bendix) also entered designs, but LTV's simulation proved decisive and they were announced as the winner on [...] 2 August 1971. The contract stipulated that the system had to be operational on 13 July 1973.|$|E

50|$|Gathering {{support from}} WVU, the City of Morgantown, and West Virginia's congressional delegation, Elias {{arranged}} a $50,000 development {{grant from the}} Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) for a comparative study of three PRT systems: the Monocab, <b>Dashaveyor,</b> and the Alden staRRcar.

50|$|Professor Samy Elias of the Industrial Engineering Department at West Virginia University in Morgantown {{had been}} {{pressing}} {{for the development}} of a PRT system for their campus since the late 1960s. Elias was able to obtain $50,000 from UMTA for a comparative study of three different types of PRT systems: Monocab, <b>Dashaveyor</b> and the Alden staRRcar. The staRRcar won the selection contest and the newly formed Department of Transportation (DOT) chose the Morgantown proposal as a testbed system.|$|E
50|$|Dashew {{then took}} the helm of a fledgling Swedish {{enterprise}} and facilitated the worldwide introduction of single-point mooring systems for offshore oil production developed through the IMODCO Company. The <b>Dashaveyor</b> Company, a people-mover system builder, gained many worldwide patents under Dashew’s direction, as did Omnithruster Company, maker of a bow-thruster system to help maneuver ships and military vessels. Other start-up companies followed, including most recently the Dashaway Company, a personal mobility and exercise device for elderly, spinal surgery, Parkinson's disease sufferers (like himself), and other patients.|$|E

50|$|In {{its early}} {{days it was}} known for its use of {{advanced}} mining and transport systems (not all of which worked very well) including the <b>Dashaveyor,</b> a high speed transportation system, and what {{was at the time}} the world's largest hard rock tunneling machine to be sold to a mining company. It {{was also one of the}} earlier mines to use rubber tired mining equipment on a large scale. An interesting sidelight was that about 70% of the workforce was of Finnish descent, which in some ways was not surprising given the similarity between the countryside around the mine and rural Finland.|$|E
50|$|Dashew {{has been}} issued {{fourteen}} U.S. patents directly, {{and more than}} fifty assigned to his many companies. He has created mechanical systems in the business data, banking, shipping, mining, transportation, marine recreation, water purification, and medical-health industries. These included the Databosser and Datawriter under Dashew Business Machines, the single point mooring buoy in Imodco (SBM Offshore), the <b>Dashaveyor</b> mining cars and people transport, a ship bow thruster under the Omnithruster Company, liquid aeration and oxygenation treatments through Omniphaser, wastewater purification system for Biomixer, Inc., and personal spinal decompression mobility devices under the title —the latter developed and marketed under his oversight, while in his nineties, from 2005 to 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{publication}} of the HUD reports in the US in 1968 led to a wave of developments in the mass transit world. Dozens of companies around the world started development of AGT systems from large to small, hoping {{to cash in on}} what was predicted to be an enormous buildout of AGT systems. The majority of these systems were essentially smaller versions of rubber-wheeled metros, sometimes operating as a single car, but often in small trains. On the simpler end were systems like the Vought Airtrans and Bendix <b>Dashaveyor,</b> while more complex systems include the Alden staRRcar and Cabinentaxi which were true personal rapid transit systems (PRTs).|$|E
