5|$|<b>Houses</b> <b>at</b> Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, Charles Moreign {{purchased}} {{several small}} <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} Vine Street {{so they could be}} redeveloped into St James's Hall, Piccadilly. A rear entrance to the hall backed onto the street. The hall was demolished in 1905 and replaced by the Piccadilly Hotel, which also backs onto Vine Street.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1878, Sullivan {{used some}} of the Pinafore music, {{arranged}} by his assistant Hamilton Clarke, during several successful promenade concerts at Covent Garden that generated interest and stimulated ticket sales. By September, Pinafore was playing to full <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> the Opera Comique. The piano score sold 10,000copies, and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.|$|E

50|$|The {{east side}} of the oldest section of the street is still {{completely}} dominated by the historic townhouses, although many have been altered, extended or replaced over the years. Dating from the 1620s, the <b>house</b> row <b>at</b> No. 28-32 has some of the oldest houses in Christianshavn. The Mikkel Vibe <b>House</b> <b>at</b> No. 32 was built by Mikkel Vibe who was mayor of Copenhagen. Other notable houses along this stretch of the street are the Lehn <b>House</b> <b>at</b> No. 6, Rhode <b>House</b> <b>at</b> No. 14, Behagen <b>House</b> <b>at</b> No. 26, Sigvert Grubbe <b>House</b> <b>at</b> No. 28-30 and Andreas Bjørn <b>House</b> <b>at</b> No. 46.|$|R

5|$|A {{memorial}} to Ball, {{along with his}} parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the exterior wall of {{the southwest corner of}} Holy Trinity Church in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall and bearing the RFC and RAF motto Per Ardua ad Astra, along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College.

5|$|August 9, 1878: At {{least three}} tornadoes {{affected}} {{the state from}} a single storm system. The first touched down in South Kent, causing major damage but no injuries. The second, the Wallingford Tornado of 1878, touched down just outside Wallingford. A severe tornado, likely an F4, it smashed through {{the north side of}} town, completely destroying dozens of <b>houses.</b> <b>At</b> least 29 people were killed in that town (likely 34), the most by any tornado event in Connecticut history. A third tornado moved through Durham and Killingsworth, unroofing houses but again causing no injuries.|$|E
5|$|Despite some {{immediate}} confiscations {{after the}} siege, {{by the time}} of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family had managed to recover most of their possessions, including Raglan Castle. Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess, decided to prioritise the rebuilding of his other <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> Troy and Badminton, rather than Raglan, reusing some of the property sent away for safety before the war, or salvaged after the slighting.|$|E
5|$|From 1793, seven small <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> {{the east}} side of the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E

5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of settlements within the Rhondda during the Norman period. Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age {{the remains of}} the Medieval buildings discovered in the area follow the pattern similar to modern farmsteads; with separate holdings spaced out around the hillsides. The evidence of Medieval Welsh farmers comes from {{the remains of the}}ir buildings, with the foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys. When the site of several platform <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s potsherds dating from the 13th-14th century were discovered.|$|E
5|$|More than 200 {{other houses}} were damaged, and {{numerous}} buildings of historical significance were lost, including the Mount Franklin Chalet, {{which was built}} in 1937–38 for the Canberra Alpine Club {{and was the first}} club-built ski lodge in mainland Australia, and many others in the Namadgi National Park. Nil Desperandum and Rock Valley Homestead, the two historic <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> Tidbinbilla, were destroyed. Most buildings of the Mount Stromlo Observatory, operated by the Australian National University, were destroyed, including the observatory's Oddie telescope and its dome, which had been built in 1911 and was the first federal building in the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Neither Monmouth nor its castle were {{attacked}} in the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr between 1400 and 1415, although nearby Abergavenny and Grosmont were burned {{down in the}} uprising. The unrest of the period had {{a negative impact on}} the development of the town. But the bridge continued its important function as a toll-gate. Philip Jones, Member of Parliament for Monmouth Boroughs in 1589, bequeathed an annual sum of about £120, the rent from his lands and <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> 'Bayliepitte', to the mayor and bailiffs of Monmouth on condition that the borough exempt those people passing through the gate or coming into Monmouth with cattle from paying tolls on fair days.|$|E

5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would {{have a positive effect on}} property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E
5|$|The banded sugar ant is {{considered}} a household pest and is occasionally seen in <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> night, capable of damaging furniture and fittings by chewing the wood; carbon disulphide is used to treat and remove a banded sugar ant nest. These ants do not pose any threat to humans, as they are incapable of stinging and can only spray formic acid, however, the larger soldiers are capable of inflicting a painful bite with their powerful jaws, and the formic acid they spray is corrosive to human skin. The eggs of this species were consumed by the Australian Aborigines.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} Robinson family established {{itself on}} a residential plot containing two small <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs {{to support the}} family. Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities. As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.|$|E

5|$|The rise of {{successful}} freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is {{a characteristic of}} early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by , and by their ownership {{of some of the}} most lavish <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> Pompeii, such as the House of the Vettii. The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized in the character of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius, who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{consists of}} the Permo-Triassic New Red Sandstone in the south, and the Middle Coal Measures of the Manchester Coalfield to the north. The upper soils are a mixture of clay and sand, with a subsoil of clay. The Astley area encompasses smaller, suburban and semi-outlying areas, including Blackmoor, Astley Green, Gin Pit and Cross Hillock. The isolated hamlet of terraced <b>houses</b> <b>at</b> Gin Pit was built by the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company. Peace Street, Lord Street and Maden Street were named after directors of the company.|$|E

When Prince Louis was serving with the Mediterranean Fleet, she spent some winters in Malta. In 1887, she contracted typhoid but, after being nursed through her illness by her husband, was sufficiently recovered by June to attend Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee celebrations in London. She was interested in science and drew a detailed geological map of Malta and also participated in archaeological digs both {{on the island and}} in Germany. In leather-bound volumes she kept meticulous records of books she had read, which reveal a wide range of interests, including socialist philosophy.|$|E
