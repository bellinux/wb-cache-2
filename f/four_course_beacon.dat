50|$|On {{his last}} {{appearance}} of the season, Sir Harry returned to Newmarket for a Sweepstakes over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b> He was made 13/8 favourite and finished second of the six runners beaten by Mr Adams' horse Humbug.|$|R
50|$|Turquoise {{began her}} four-year-old season with two {{unsuccessful}} runs at the First Spring meeting. She was beaten by Lord Sefton's mare Souvenir in a King's Plate over {{three and a}} half miles on 5 May and by Amphion in a race over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course</b> a day later.|$|R
50|$|Tontine {{was kept}} in {{training}} as a four-year-old in 1826, but her campaign consisted of a single unsuccessful start.

She did not run again.|$|R
50|$|Sir Peter then won the Newmarket Craven, beating Meteor again. He then {{forfeited}} two races—a six-mile, 1,000 guineas {{match against}} Dash, and 500 guineas match against Meteor—probably due to physical problems. Sir Peter then lost to Mulberry (by Florizel), who was carrying 28 lbs less, over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>course</b> at Newmarket. He then {{broke down in}} a later race, and was retired to stud.|$|R
50|$|Herod began racing at five, {{the usual}} age to begin {{training}} for this period, in October 1763 winning a race on the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>course</b> at Newmarket. At age six, he won another race at Newmarket, {{followed by a}} four-miler at Ascot and a match against Antinous over the <b>Beacon</b> <b>course.</b> When he was seven, his owner died and he was sold in a dispersal sale to Sir John Moore, and it wasn't until 1766 that {{he returned to the}} track, where won again against Antinous in a match over the same course.|$|R
50|$|He {{had some}} success {{in the next two}} seasons before being sold to the Prince of Wales and being moved to {{campaign}} in the south of England. In his last three seasons he won fifteen races at long distances, becoming particularly effective over Newmarket's <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course,</b> and winning several match races against the leading stayers of the day. After his racing career ended he became a highly successful breeding stallion.|$|R
50|$|Orville {{began his}} five-year-old season by winning a two-mile Sweepstakes at York on 29 May. He {{returned}} to York in August {{when he finished}} last of the five runners behind Haphazard in a four-mile subscription race and second to R Garfoth's horse by Traveller in a similar event two days later. In September at Doncaster Orville won the two mile Free Handicap Sweepstakes and a four-mile match race against Mr Mellish's horse Stockton. In October, Orville was sent south to run at Newmarket where he finished second to Eleanor in a race over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After a five-month break, Aimwell {{returned}} for three races at Newmarket in the autumn. At the First October meeting {{he won a}} match race over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course,</b> winning a 300 guinea prize by beating Mr Vernon's horse Mousetrap. Aimwell was beaten in a 200 guinea Sweepstakes at the Second October meeting, in which he finished second of the four runners to Guyler. At the Houghton meeting two weeks later he conceded 35 pounds to Sir Charles Bunbury's Blacklock and won a match over ten furlongs [...] "Across the Flat" [...] to claim a prize of 100 guineas.|$|R
5000|$|Ditto {{returned}} for the Craven Stakes, an all-aged race run over ten furlongs [...] "Across the Flat" [...] at Newmarket on 15 April 1805. He started 3/1 second favourite {{in a field}} of eleven runners and won the race from the four-year-old colts Castrel and Agincourt. Three days later he ran a match race against Lord Foley's Sir Harry Dimsdale, a grey horse who had finished unplaced in the Craven Stakes. Running over Newmarket's <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course,</b> Ditto started favourite but suffered his first defeat as he failed to concede seven pounds to his opponent.|$|R
5000|$|Hambletonian did {{not start}} during 1798. In a famous match with Mr. Cookson's Diamond over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course</b> at Newmarket on 25 March 1799, Hambletonian, ridden by Francis Buckle, won by a neck {{in a time of}} 7 minutes 15 seconds. He is said to have covered 21 feet in a single stride at the finish. [...] Sir Henry had wagered 3,000 guineas on the outcome. The horse was {{afterwards}} the subject of the painting, Hambletonian Rubbing Down by the great equine artist, George Stubbs, who was then 75 years old. In 1800 Hambletonian won his only start in the Great Subscription Purse for six-year-olds and over at York.|$|R
5000|$|Tiresias {{began his}} four-year-old {{campaign}} with a match race against Merlin at Newmarket on 6 April. He took the 300 guinea prize without effort as his opponent broke down injured {{a quarter of}} a mile from the finish. At the next Newmarket meeting two weeks later he claimed another 300 guinea prize, recording a [...] "very easy" [...] win over Pacha in a one mile match. Three days later he was beaten into second place when attempting to concede eight pounds to Banker in a Sweepstakes. On 4 May at Newmarket, Tiresias won the Jockey Club Purse over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course,</b> easily beating Aldford at level weights.|$|R
50|$|In early 1815, Villiers {{was able}} to claim two prizes without having to race his new acquisition. Mr Prince had to pay 100 guineas forfeit when his horse Young Eagle failed to appear for a match against Cwrw at the Craven meeting and Mr Scott Stonehewer paid 100 guineas when Slender Billy did not oppose Cwrw in a match over the Ditch Mile on 27 April. Cwrw failed to win in his eight {{competitive}} races in 1815. At the Second Spring meeting he finished fourth behind Slender Billy in a handicap race over the <b>four</b> <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course</b> and was beaten in a match by Mr Bouverie's mare Scheherazade. At the July meeting Cwrw finished unplaced behind Alexander the Great in a two-mile sweepstakes.|$|R
5000|$|At the First Spring meeting {{two weeks}} later he was pitted against the 1805 Epsom Derby winner Cardinal Beaufort in a match race over the Abington mile. Despite conceding five pounds to his rival and being opposed in the betting, Staveley won the match easily to claim a prize of 500 guineas. At the Second Spring meeting in early May, Staveley was beaten by Mr Arthur's five-year-old in a match over the Abington Mile, before contesting the Jockey Club Plate over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b> Ridden by a stable lad ("a boy") Staveley started at odds of 4/1 and won [...] "a good race" [...] from Mr Radcliffe's colt Barbarossa and the Duke of Grafton's six-year-old mare Parasol.|$|R

5000|$|At the Newmarket Craven {{meeting in}} April 1806 Meteora's owner {{received}} 200 guineas {{without having to}} race his filly when Lord Barrymore withdrew his four-year-old Gratitude from a match over the Abington Mile. Three days later Meteora ran a match against the St Leger winner Staveley over ten furlongs and defeated the colt to win a prize of 200 guineas. In May Meteora again [...] "received forfeit" [...] when Lord Osborne withdrew his horse Superstition from a match against the Oaks winner over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b> Meteora's unbeaten run {{came to an end}} on 15 July at Preston.

On 28 May, Quiz appeared at Brocket-Hall in Hertfordshire where he won the local Gold Cup over three and a half miles, beating five opponents at odds of 4/5.|$|R
50|$|After a {{break of}} almost five months, Galantine {{returned}} to {{action for the}} autumn meetings at Newmarket, where she was entered in six races. On 3 October she was made favourite for a £100 Sweepstakes, but was beaten by her only rival, a colt named Lochinvar. Two weeks later she earned £100 for her owner without having to compete when her opponent, a colt owned by Lord Jersey, was withdrawn from a scheduled match race. Four days later she won a £100 match against Lord Chesterfield's Titania over the Ditch Mile and then finished unplaced in a five furlong handicap race later the same afternoon. On 2 November Galantine won another match, this time beating Lord Orford's colt The Grand Duke over the Rowley Mile for a prize of £100. On {{the final day of}} the Newmarket season, Galantine collected a further £100 when Thomas Thornhill's colt Earwig was withdrawn from a match race over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 3 September {{the mare}} {{appeared}} at Bedford where {{she won a}} £50 race in two four-mile heats. A week later at Northampton Rhoda ran three times in one day, beating four opponents in the Wellington Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles and then winning both heats of the Town Plate. Six days after her wins at Northampton Rhoda was sent to race at Leicester where she won both heats of a £70 race on the opening day of the meeting. On the following day she added the Burgess's Plate at the same course, winning two out of three heats. Rhoda returned to Newmarket in October and collected her sixth consecutive prize as she defeated Lord Jersey's horse Cannon-ball in a weight-for-age contest over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b> The mare's winning run came to an end at Newmarket on 30 October when she finished unplaced behind Lord Foley's colt Boniface in a ten furlong handicap, carrying top weight of 133 pounds.|$|R
50|$|The mare {{changed hands}} {{more than once}} in 1807. She began the year in the {{ownership}} of Richard Watt, then appeared in the colours of Mr Fermor, and then Mr Forth before returning to Mr Fermor. Pelisse began her fourth season by finishing second to the leading stayer Orville over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course</b> on 30 April. At Lewes in August the mare raced away from Newmarket {{for the first time in}} three years when she was beaten in a four mile match against Orville. Later that month she finished third to Canopus and Master Jackey in the Gold Cup at Egham. On the following day she recorded her only competitive success of the season when she won both heats of the Egham Town Plate. Pelisse returned to Newmarket in October where she finished fourth to Canopus in the October Oatlands Stakes and then collected a 50 guinea forfeit when Lord Sackville's horse Enchanter failed to appear for a scheduled match.|$|R
5000|$|Vespa {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old and began her third season at Newmarket's Craven meeting on 15 April. Contesting the Oatlands Stakes a handicap race over the two-mile [...] "Ditch In" [...] course, she started at odds of 8/1 and won from the Duke of Portland's horse Trustee, with the unplaced horses including the Oaks and Ascot Gold Cup winner Galata. At the next Newmarket meeting, Vespa was moved up in distance to run in a King's Plate for female horses over the {{three and a half}} mile Round Course. Ridden by Jem Chapple she defeated her two opponents, Chantilly and Revelry very easily ("almost in a canter"). On 15 May Vespa was eneered for the Jockey Club Plate, a race over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course</b> which was retricted to horses owned by members of the Jockey Club. When no other horses appeared to oppose her, Vespa was allowed to walk over the course to claim the prize.|$|R
5000|$|Oxygen ran {{three times}} at Newmarket {{in the spring}} of 1832. At the Craven meeting in April she began her season in a {{division}} of the Oatlands Stakes, a handicap over the two mile [...] "Ditch In" [...] course. Carrying a weight of 107 pounds and ridden by Patrick Conolly, she started the 2/1 favourite and demonstrated a [...] "game heart" [...] to win by a length from the colts Mazeppa and Sarpedon. Until 1834, racehorses' ages advanced by a year on 1 May rather than 1 January, meaning that Oxygen was officially a three-year-old at this time. At the next meeting Oxygen contested a 100 guinea King's Plate over the three and a half mile Round Course against the 1830 Ascot Gold Cup winner Lucetta, from whom she was receiving twenty pounds. Day sent Oxygen into the lead from the start and she held off repeated challenges from the older mare to win by a length. Two weeks later, Oxygen and Lucetta met again in the Jockey Club Plate over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course</b> and Lucetta reversed the form with her younger rival to win a prize of £50.|$|R
5000|$|Fidget's {{brother was}} named Eager for the 1792 season and began his season with five engagements at the Newmarket spring meetings. The {{modifier}} [...] "brother to Fidget" [...] was still printed in racing literature {{in conjunction with}} his new name {{for a few years}} after he was officially named. Eager made his first appearance on 11 April in the Oatlands Stakes, a two-mile handicap which carried a first prize of more than £5,000, making it far more valuable than any of the Classics. He finished fifth of the twenty runners behind Toby, with the 1790 Derby winner Rhadamanthus and Vermin among the horses further back in the field. At the next meeting the Duke of Bedford claimed over £1,000 in prize money when Eager was allowed to walk over for a valuable Sweepstakes over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course.</b> <b>Four</b> days later he ran in the two mile Fortescue Stakes in which he started 2/5 favourite and won from Vermin (beating Lord Foley's colt for the fourth time in five races) and a filly named Peggy. Eager won another prize for his owner without having to race when Mr Fox paid a forfeit when he withdrew his horse Mercutio from a scheduled match race on 7 May. On the following day Eager defeated the odds-on favourite Halbert to win the Jockey Club Plate over the Round Course, with Vermin third.|$|R
2500|$|Camarine was rested until autumn {{when she}} {{returned}} to Newmarket and was able to [...] "win" [...] three successive prizes without having to race. On 2 October the 1830 Derby winner Priam failed to appear for a race against the filly over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course,</b> enabling Wood to claim £130 [...] "and the Cup". Two weeks later Wood issued a challenge for [...] "The Whip", a silver trophy which was said to incorporate hairs from the tail and mane of Eclipse. When no horse appeared to oppose Camarine, Wood was able to claim the trophy without a race. At the Houghton meeting on 1 November Camarine was scheduled to run a match race in which she was set to concede nineteen pounds to John Gully's St Leger winner Margrave over ten furlongs. The colt did not appear and Gully paid a forfeit to Wood. On the following day Camarine returned to active competition and ran twice. She began by winning a five furlong match for £200 against Mr M Stanley's horse Crutch. Later in the afternoon she carried top weight of 130 pounds in the Audley End Stakes over one and three quarter miles. Ridden again by Robinson she started 4/6 favourite and won from Mr Day's horse Mazeppa and three others.|$|R
5000|$|Bronze won {{one of her}} eight races as {{a four-year-old}} and was placed on six occasions. At the Craven meeting she {{finished}} third in a Sweepstakes over the two mile [...] "Ditch-In" [...] course. Two weeks later she finished fourth of the eight runners in a King's Plate for fillies and mares over the <b>four</b> mile <b>Beacon</b> <b>Course,</b> finishing ahead of Houghton Lass and Jerboa. At Brighton in August she was beaten by Sir John Shelley's colt Sir Launcelot in a four mile Sweepstakes and finished second to the Prince of Wales's six-year-old horse Sir David in the Brighton Gold Cup. At Lewes, two days later, she was withdrawn after finishing second in the first heat of a King's Plate won by Sir Launcelot. On 12 October at Newmarket, Bronze ran a match race at level weights against the Duke of Grafton's three-year-old colt Musician. Bronze defeated her younger rival over the ten furlong distance to win the 200 guinea prize. Four days later she was beaten in a match over the same course and distance when attempting to concede twenty pounds to a colt named Ferdinand. On 29 October at the Newmarket Houghton meeting, Bronze ended her season by finishing second to Meteora in the Audley End Stakes.|$|R
