50|$|GDDR3s strobe signal unlike DDR2 SDRAM is {{unidirectional}} & single-ended (RDQS, WDQS). This {{means there}} is a separate read and write <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> allowing for a quicker read to write ratio than DDR2.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{equivalent}} way {{to specify the}} relationship between Data and Strobe.For even-numbered <b>Data</b> bits, <b>Strobe</b> {{is the opposite of}} Data.For odd-numbered <b>Data</b> bits, <b>Strobe</b> is the same as Data.From this definition it is more obvious that the XOR of <b>Data</b> and <b>Strobe</b> will yield a clock signal. Also, it specifies the simplest means of generating the Strobe signal for a given Data stream.|$|R
50|$|The GDDR3 Interface {{transfers}} two 32 bit wide data {{words per}} clock cycle from the I/O pins. Corresponding to the 4n-pre fetch a single write or read access {{consists of a}} 128 bit wide, one-clock-cycle data transfer at the internal memory core and four corresponding 32 bit wide, one-half-clock-cycle data transfers at the I/O Pins. Single-ended unidirectional Read and Write <b>Data</b> <b>strobes</b> are transmitted simultaneously with Read and Write data respectively in order to capture data properly at the receivers of both the Graphics SDRAM and the controller. <b>Data</b> <b>strobes</b> are organized per byte of the 32 bit wide interface.|$|R
50|$|DIMMs {{based on}} Single Data Rate (SDR) DRAM {{have the same}} bus {{frequency}} for data, address and control lines. DIMMs based on Double Data Rate (DDR) DRAM have data but not the strobe at double {{the rate of the}} clock; this is achieved by clocking on both the rising and falling edge of the <b>data</b> <b>strobes.</b> Power consumption and voltage gradually became lower with each generation of DDR-based DIMMs.|$|R
50|$|FireWire uses <b>Data</b> <b>strobe</b> {{encoding}} (D/S encoding). In D/S encoding, two non-return-to-zero (NRZ) {{signals are}} used to transmit the data with high reliability. The NRZ signal sent is fed with the clock signal through an XOR gate, creating a strobe signal. This strobe is then put through another XOR gate along with the data signal to reconstruct the clock. This in turn acts as the bus's Phase-locked loop for synchronization purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>strobe</b> {{encoding}} (or D/S encoding) is an {{encoding scheme}} for transmitting data in digital circuits.It uses two signal lines (e.g. wires in a cable or traces on {{a printed circuit}} board), Data and Strobe. These have the property that either Data or Strobe changes its logical value in one clock cycle, but never both.This allows for easy clock recovery with a good jitter tolerance by XORing the two signal line values.|$|E
50|$|At this point, {{the master}} has {{gained access to}} the bus. To write data, the card drives an address, an address {{modifier}} and data onto the bus. It then drives the address strobe line and the two <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> lines low, to indicate the data is ready, and drives the write pin to indicate the transfer direction. There are two data strobes and an *LWORD line, so the cards can indicate if the data width is 8, 16, or 32 bits (or 64 in VME64). The card at the bus address reads the data and pulls the data transfer acknowledge low line when the transfer can complete. If the transfer cannot complete, it can pull the bus error line low. Reading data {{is essentially the same}} but the controlling card drives the address bus, leaves the data bus tri-stated and drives the read pin. The slave card drives read data onto the data bus and drives the <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> pins low when the data is ready. The signalling scheme is asynchronous, meaning that the transfer is not tied to the timing of a bus clock pin (unlike synchronous buses such as PCI).|$|E

40|$|Embedded {{systems that}} use double data rate memory (DDR) can realize {{increased}} performance over traditional single data rate (SDR) memories. As the name implies, DDR enables two data transactions to occur {{within a single}} clock cycle without doubling the applied clock or without to doubling {{the size of the}} data bus. This increased data bus performance is due to source-synchronous <b>data</b> <b>strobes</b> that permit <b>data</b> to be captured on both the falling and rising edges of the strobe. Although DDR can bring improved performance to an embedded design, care must be observed in the schematic and layout phases to ensure that desired performance is realized.

[...] The Transputer was a microprocessor developed to inexpensively implement parallel computation. IEEE 1355 resulted from an attempt to preserve the Transputer's unusually simple data network. This <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> encoding scheme makes the links self-clocking, able to adapt automatically to different speeds. It was patented by Inmos under U.K. patent number 9011700.3, claim 16 (DS-Link bit-level encoding),and in 1991 under US patent 5341371,claim 16.|$|E
50|$|SpaceWire's {{modulation}} {{and data}} formats generally follow the <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> encoding - differential ended signaling (DS-DE) {{part of the}} IEEE Std 1355-1995. SpaceWire utilizes asynchronous communication and allows speeds between 2 Mbit/s and 400 Mbit/s. DS-DE is well-favored because it describes modulation, bit formats, routing, flow control and error detection in hardware, with little need for software. SpaceWire also has very low error rates, deterministic system behavior, and relatively simple digital electronics. SpaceWire replaced old PECL differential drivers in the physical layer of IEEE 1355 DS-DE by low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS). SpaceWire also proposes the use of space-qualified 9-pin connectors.|$|E
40|$|An {{interface}} logic circuit permitting {{the transfer of}} information between two computers having asynchronous clocks is disclosed. The information transfer involves utilization of control signals (including request, return-response, ready) to generate properly timed <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> signals. Noise problems are avoided because each control signal, upon receipt, is verified by at least two clock pulses at the receiving computer. If control signals are verified, a <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> pulse is generated to accomplish a data transfer. Once initiated, the <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> signal is properly completed independently of signal disturbances in the control signal initiating the <b>data</b> <b>strobe</b> signal.

40|$|Abstract- An {{effective}} method for joint timing and channel estimation for receive diversity systems in a frequency-flat Rayleigh fading environment is presented. We implement non-synchronous timing recovery using Gardner’s timing error detector, whose insensitivity to phase errors allows for timing recovery prior to pilot symbol based channel estimation. By employing a polyphase filter {{bank in the}} timing loop, {{we are able to}} simultaneously carry out matched filtering and data interpolation, thus eliminating the need for a separate interpolation filter. In addition, selection diversity combining is used to select the input to the timing loop, thus improving the reliability of the signal used for timing recov-ery. Pilot assisted channel estimation is performed on the recovered <b>data</b> <b>strobes.</b> For normalized Doppler frequency of 0. 01 the system’s bit error rate (BER) performance is within 1 dB from the ideal timing and channel estimation error bound, with an additional drop of 1. 5 dB for a non-optimum channel interpolator. In deep fades, the receiver timing is held fixed. We show that the receiver maintains timing lock over such fades up to a normalized timing bandwidth of 1 × 10 − 4 for normalized Doppler frequency up to 0. 05...|$|R

This GUI connects to a multi-thread server via TCP/IP sockets.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{optional}} coding scheme for SpaceWire {{in lieu of}} the current <b>Data</b> <b>Strobe</b> scheme for three reasons. First reason is to provide a straightforward method for electrical isolation of the interface; secondly to provide ability to reduce the mass and bend radius of the SpaceWire cable; and thirdly to provide a means for a common physical layer over which multiple spacecraft onboard data link protocols could operate {{for a wide range of}} data rates. The intent is to accomplish these goals without significant change to existing SpaceWire design investments. The ability to optionally use Manchester coding in place of the current <b>Data</b> <b>Strobe</b> coding provides the ability to DC balanced the signal transitions unlike the SpaceWire <b>Data</b> <b>Strobe</b> coding; and therefore the ability to isolate the electrical interface without concern. Additionally, because the Manchester code has the clock and data encoded on the same signal, the number of wires of the existing SpaceWire cable could be optionally reduced by 50. This reduction could be an important consideration for many users of SpaceWire as indicated by the already existing effort underway by the SpaceWire working group to reduce the cable mass and bend radius by elimination of shields. However, reducing the signal count by half would provide even greater gains. It is proposed to restrict the data rate for the optional Manchester coding to a fixed data rate of 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) in order to make the necessary changes simple and still able to run in current radiation tolerant Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Even with this constraint, 10 Mbps will meet many applications where SpaceWire is used. These include command and control applications and many instruments applications with have moderate data rate. For most NASA flight implementations, SpaceWire designs are in rad-tolerant FPGAs, and the desire to preserve the heritage design investment is important for cost and risk considerations. The Manchester coding option can be accommodated in existing designs with only changes to the FPGA...|$|E

50|$|VME also decodes {{all seven}} of the 68000's {{interrupt}} levels onto a 7-pin interrupt bus. The interrupt scheme is one of prioritized vectored interrupts. The interrupt request lines (IRQ1 - IRQ7) prioritize interrupts. An interrupting module asserts one of the interrupt request lines. Any module on the bus may potentially handleany interrupt. When an interrupt handling module recognizes an interrupt request at a priority it handles, it arbitrates for the bus in the usual fashion described above. It then performs a read of the interrupt vector by driving the binary version of the IRQ line it handles (e.g. if IRQ5 is being handled, then binary 101) onto the address bus. It also asserts the IACK line, along with the appropriate <b>data</b> transfer <b>strobes</b> for {{the width of the}} status/ID being read. Again, LWORD*, DS0* and DS1* allow status/ID read cycles to be 8, 16, or 32 bit wide transfers but most existing hardware interrupters use 8 bit status/IDs. The interrupter responds by transferring a status/ID on the data bus to describe the interrupt. The interrupt handling module (usually a CPU) will usually use this status/ID number to identify and run the appropriate software interrupt service routine.|$|R

These networks will consist of hundreds to thousands of dust motes and a few interrogating transceivers. The motes will be built from integrated circuit and micromachining processes (figure 1) for low cost, low energy consumption, and small size, while communication between the motes and the receiver will be accomplished via a wireless optical communication link. We designed an integrated circuit that generates pseudorandom <b>data</b> when <b>strobed</b> by a laser then directly drives a micromachined corner cube retroreflector (CCR) to passively transmit via the strobing laser beam. The base station that controls the laser pulses will use an optical imaging array to receive the flashing reflections. The circuit runs off a single Zn-Air type 5 hearing aid battery that provides a nominal 1. 4 V, so we can fit the entire two-way optical communications system in a 5. 8 mm x 2. 4 mm package (figure 2) with an enclosed volume of 63 mm 3.

40|$|As {{data centers}} are {{expected}} to manage the increasing demands in bandwidth, processing power and storage requirements, connectivity issues between blades/racks present {{a whole new set}} of challenges in maintaining a stable infrastructure. While data centers may grow to occupy thousands of square feet, current passive copper interconnects pose a real limitation with a run length of 10 meters at 10 Gbps per wire pair. Optical fiber can extend the interconnection length from 10 meters to 100 meters, but the large power requirements and expensive opto-electric modules prove to be too uneconomical for practical application. As a compromise, through the use of the Infiniband standard, a 12 Gbps cable link can be achieved that would extend the range of copper interconnects beyond the 100 meter threshold. The proposed link leverages synchronous clock forwarding on one available data channel that improves jitter tracking, while greatly simplifying the design of the receiver and timing recovery circuits. Only a phase de-skewing is required at the receive side to retrieve the clock-data relationship. In the cable link architecture, the 12 Gbps data is repeated in 8 meter sections with clocking forwarding on a dedicated channel. Then the forwarded clock is dropped off every data repeating stage in order to be multiplied to half the data rate and be used to <b>strobe</b> the incoming <b>data.</b> The longer the quality of clock forwarding is maintained, the cleaner the <b>data</b> <b>strobed</b> at each repeater and the longer the cable can be extended. At each repeater, the clock resets the jitter accumulated from the previous repeater, allowing for data transmission with as much jitter as in the strobing clock. Determining a fine balance in forward clock frequency is crucial in defining jitter performance of the cable link. Frequency beyond the cable bandwidth results in large attenuation of clock amplitude creating more noise and jitter accumulation along clock repeater. On the other hand, frequency well below the cable bandwidth will increase jitter accumulation time and will degrade jitter performance inside the clock multiplier. The trade-off between low frequency clock jitter accumulation in the Clock Multiplication Unit (CMU) and the high frequency jitter accumulation along the clock repeaters is one of the defining aspects of optimizing the active copper link. To further reduce the clock jitter accumulation across repeaters, phase interpolation between the input clock and the divided output of the CMU is used to generate the forward clock for the next repeater stage. The addition of the phase interpolator has negligible power/area cost, dramatically reduces jitter accumulation, and adds another degree of flexibility in choosing the forwarded clock to reduce the total accumulated jitter. With the proper choice of forward clock frequency, application of the FIR filtering technique and a high performance CMU, a total run length of 115 meters is achieved at 12 Gbps data rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{experimental}} evaluation of Simultaneous TRansmissions with Orthogonally Blinded Eavesdroppers (STROBE). STROBE is a cross-layer approach that exploits the multi-stream capabilities of existing technologies such as 802. 11 n and the upcoming 802. 11 ac standard where multi-antenna APs construct simultaneous data streams using Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF). Instead of using this technique for simultaneous <b>data</b> stream generation, <b>STROBE</b> utilizes ZFBF by allowing an AP to use one stream to communicate with an intended user and the remaining streams to orthogonally "blind" (actively interfere) with any potential eavesdropper thereby preventing eavesdroppers from decoding nearby transmissions. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show that STROBE reliably outperforms Omnidirectional, Single-User Beamforming (SUBF), and directional antenna based transmission methods by keeping the transmitted signal at the intended receiver and shielded from eavesdroppers. In an indoor Wireless LAN environment, STROBE consistently serves an intended user with a signal 15 dB stronger than an eavesdropper...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Structural {{variation}} including deletions, duplications and rearrangements of DNA sequence are {{an important}} contributor to genome variation in many organisms. In human, many structural variants are found in complex and highly repetitive regions of the genome making their identication difcult. A new sequencing technology called strobe sequencing generates strobe reads containing multiple subreads from a single contiguous fragment of DNA. Strobe reads thus generalize the concept of paired reads, or mate pairs, that have been routinely used for structural variant detection. Strobe sequencing holds promise for unraveling complex variants that have been difcult to characterize with current sequencing technologies. Results: We introduce an algorithm for identication of structural variants using <b>strobe</b> sequencing <b>data.</b> We consider <b>strobe</b> reads from a test genome that have multiple possible alignments to a reference genome due to sequencing errors and/or repetitive sequences in the reference.
