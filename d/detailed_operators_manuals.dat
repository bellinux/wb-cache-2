40|$|To obtain Commission {{approval}} {{to publish the}} proposed rule, including {{the issue of the}} need for an interim enforcement discretion policy and make available the draft regulatory guide and other supporting documents for public comment. BACKGROUND: In SECY- 03 - 0100, ‚ÄúRulemaking Plan on Post-Fire <b>Operator</b> <b>Manual</b> Actions, ‚Äù dated June 17, 2003, the staff recommended revising the existing fire protection regulation in paragraph III. G. 2 of Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50 to include <b>operator</b> <b>manual</b> actions. These actions are needed to ensure that a redundant train of systems necessary to achieve and maintain hot shutdown conditions located within the same area outside the primary containment is free of fire damage. In an SRM dated September 12, 2003, the Commission approved the staff‚Äôs recommendation to revise the fire protection program requirements in Appendix R and the associated guidance. The Commission also approved the staff‚Äôs plan to develop an interim enforcement policy to deal with compliance issues until the guidance and final rule are implemented. CONTACT...|$|R

Till detta gassystem fanns bristande {{information}} om hur dessa komponenter fungerar och h√§nger ihop. Detta examensjobb har till syfte att skapa en funktionsbeskrivning i form av en l√§ttl√§st operat√∂rsmanual, f√∂r nya och erfarna operat√∂rer. Informationen till funktionsbeskrivningen har kompilerats fr√•n tillverkarmanualer, konstruktionsritningar, informationsp√§rmar, intervjuer samt ABB styrsystem. Bilder har tagits och redigerats, f√∂r att ge en illustrativ √∂verblick av fluider och gasers v√§g genom gassystemet och dess kringutrustning. Information och bilder har sedan sammanst√§llts i en funktionsbeskrivning (Se bilaga 1). The {{study which}} {{is presented in}} this report {{has been carried out}} at R 1 K, which is a section of the R√∂nnsk√§r smelter plant. The plant is owned by New Boliden. In the year of 2007 a new gas system containing several new components were built. The operators that were in charge of monitoring the new system were not given sufficient education about the new components and their part in the system as whole. The {{purpose of this study is}} to create a function functional description about the system and all its components. The functional description is to be presented in the form of an easy-to-use manual for both experienced and new <b>operators.</b> The <b>manual</b> has been compiled from manufacturer manuals, construction blueprints, scattered <b>operator</b> <b>manuals,</b> knowledge of the ABB operator-system and interviews with various employees. To give the operators and the readers a good visual overview of all the different gas and fluid flows in the system pictures have been taken. All this have been compiled into the <b>operator</b> <b>manual</b> that is the functional description. (See attachment 1) ...|$|R
