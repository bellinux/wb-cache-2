40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} transformerless multilevel con-verters as {{an application}} for high-power and/or high-voltage <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drives.</b> Multilevel converters: 1) can generate near-sinusoidal voltages with only fundamental frequency switching; 2) have almost no electromagnetic interference or common-mode voltage; and 3) are suitable for large voltampere-rated <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> and high voltages. The cascade inverter is a natural fit for large automotive all-electric drives because it uses several levels of dc voltage sources, which would be available from batteries or fuel cells. The back-to-back diode-clamped converter is ideal where a source of ac voltage is available, such as in a hybrid electric vehicle. Simulation and experimental results show the superiority of these two converters over two-level pulsewidth-modulation-based drives.
