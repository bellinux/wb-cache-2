Drying experiments were performed at an air temperature of 45 Â Â°C with an air velocity of 1 Â m/s. In this work, {{the performance of the}} drier along with its main components is evaluated using exergy analysis method. The most important component for improving the system efficiency is found to be the gas engine, followed by the exhaust air heat exchanger for the drying system. An exergy loss and flow diagram (the so-called Grassmann diagram) of the whole drying system is also presented to give quantitative information regarding the proportion of the exergy input dissipated in the various system components, while the sustainability index values for the system components are calculated to indicate how sustainability is affected by changing the exergy efficiency of a process. Gas engine, expansion valve and drying ducts account for more than 60 % amount of exergy in the system. The exergetic efficiency values are in the range of 77. 68 - 79. 21 % for the heat pump unit, 39. 26 - 43. 24 % for the gas <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> heat <b>pump</b> unit, 81. 29 - 81. 56 % for the drying chamber and 48. 24 - 51. 28 % for the overall drying system.

40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, but poor electricity generating efficiency limits the potential energy savings of electrically powered units. Thus the work reported in this thesis concerns {{the development of a}} range of gas <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> heat <b>pumps</b> for industrial and commercial heating applications, which recover heat from the prime mover, normally rejected to waste. Despite the convenience of using proprietary engine heat recovery packages, investigations have highlighted the necessity to ensure the engine and the heat recovery equipment are compatible. A problem common •to all air source heat pumps is the formation of frost on the evaporator, which must be removed periodically, with the expenditure of energy, to ensure the continued operation of the plant. An original fluidised bed defrosting mechanism is proposed, which prevents the build-up of this frost, and also improves system performance. Criticisms have been levelled against the rotary sliding vane compressor, in particular the effects of lubrication, which is essential. This thesis compares the rotary sliding vane compressor with other machines, and concludes that many of these criticisms are unfounded. A confidential market survey indicates an increasing demand for heat pumps up to and including 1990, and the technical support needed to penetrate this market is presented. Such support includes the development of a range of modular gas <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> heat <b>pumps,</b> and a computer aided design for the selection of the optimum units.

The performance of the drying system components is discussed, while the important system components are determined to improve the system efficiency. The performance of the drying process is also analyzed for three different medicinal and aromatic plants from the exergoeconomic point of view. A comprehensive parametric study is conducted to investigate the effect of varying dead (reference) state temperatures on exergoeconomic performance parameters for both drying system components and drying process. The correlations between the performance parameters and dead state temperatures are developed. The results have indicated that the dead state temperature affects the performance parameters, particularly the drying process parameters. Rising the dead state temperature leads {{to an increase in}} the exergy efficiencies of the drying process and a decrease in the ratio of the thermodynamic loss rate to the capital cost values in a polynomial form. values of the drying process are obtained to be very higher compared to those of the drying system components.

40|$|International audienceVehicle Thermal Management {{covers the}} {{engineering}} field of solutions that maintain the complete vehicle in acceptable operating conditions regarding components and fluid temperatures in an engine. The maximum efficiency rating of a Diesel engine reaches up to 45 %; {{a vast amount}} of the energy produced is transformed into heat. This heat is partly rejected in the exhaust gases and partly transmitted to the engine cooling circuit. The latter can be seen in two different ways, on the one hand, cooling is necessary to regulate the fluids and component temperature to an optimum operating point for fuel efficiency and maintain engine performance. On the other hand it constitutes a loss since the coolant system actuators are <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> (<b>pump,</b> fan, etc.). In order to improve the fuel efficiency of the vehicle one can reduce the losses generated by the cooling system. Ideally, the full motive force of the engine should be used for propulsion, and new and more efficient energy sources have to be explored to power the secondary systems (cooling, compressed air…). The electrification of some components in the cooling system can limit losses and improve component energy efficiency {{but it is not the}} only answer and in many cases this approach might be a limited. Recent studies have shown that by improving the control strategy of the cooling system the fuel consumption can be improved, however no real data is available since its implementation has been limited. In keeping with latter approach, this paper introduces a novel control which aims at a more efficient regulation of the cooling system operation of a Heavy Duty Truck cooling system. The main complexity in such a system remains the interactions between actuators. In this paper we propose a way to solve this using a control based on model inversion and decoupling strategy. It needs to be noted that any new approach requires the current control specifications to be modified. This enables also a better understanding of the system. However, other goals can be exploited through the use of an advanced control and the new control specifications such as a reduction of thermal shock, reduction of thermal fatigue, minimization of system overcooling (directly impacts fuel consumption but also the noise levels). Finally, the controller has been tested on a Simulation Platform using a Matlab/Simulink (Controller) and compared to the existing system control using a reference driving cycle...|$|E

Advantages of PV pumping systems include low operating cost, unattended operation, low maintenance, easy installation, and long life. These are all important in remote locations where electricity is unavailable. Namibia renewable energy programme (NAMREP) conducted a study on feasibility of solar pump in Namibia [5]. The report furnished that for small- to medium-sized wells, solar photovoltaic pump was much cheaper on a life cycle cost basis than diesel-powered pumps. When looking beyond the original purchase price, solar pumping systems costed from 22 – 56  % of diesel pumps’ cost and can achieve a payback over diesel engine-operated pump little as 2  years.

40|$|Consumption {{of natural}} gas as primary energy source in Italy is {{increasing}} during the last years, mainly due to the diffusion of the most modern natural gas-fired combined cycle power plants. As well known, it is quite opportune to increase use {{of natural gas}}, mainly in summer, because of the “take-or-pay” contracts that often regulate the energy supply. Electrical energy use instead should be decreased, because of the “peak demand” problem that in Italy has become very urgent.

40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of natural gas}} as a primary energy source in Italy has increased during recent years, mainly due to more widespread use of modern natural gas-fired combined cycle power plants. It is generally accepted that such an increased use of natural gas is beneficial, particularly in summer, due to the “take-or-pay” contracts that often regulate the energy supply. Conversely, the use of electrical energy should be decreased, in order to limit the “peak demand” problem that has become prevalent in Italy. Therefore, besides electrically <b>driven</b> heat <b>pumps</b> that achieve good efficiencies, {{it is interesting to}} also consider the option of combustion <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> heat <b>pumps</b> for space heating purposes.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} concern about energy savings {{in recent years the}} Japan Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) revised the {{performance}} rating of industrial air conditioning systems in October, 2006. The coefficient of performance (COP), the conventional factor, does not consider the actual operation of air conditioning systems corresponding to seasonal temperature changes. Instead it is evaluated under constant temperature conditions. In actual operation, the capacity and power consumption of cooling and heating varies according to outside air temperatures. As a result, the annual performance factor (APF) was adopted as the new criteria to evaluate energy savings performance. Under this method, model cases were designed in order to conduct proper evaluations that are approximately equal to real operation. Factors were estimated by calculations of annual total energy consumption and thermal building load. As the efficiency characteristics of the APF and COP are respectively indicated, calculation of conversion factors became necessary in order to compare their energy saving capabilities. In this study, the energy consumption and its characteristics of the APF and COP machines were calculated using the annual operating data of electric <b>driven</b> heat <b>pumps</b> (EHP) under equivalent load conditions.

40|$|The gas {{engine-driven}} {{heat pump}} (GEHP), {{which has been}} considered as a preferable choice in the heating and air-conditioning scheme can make full use of the waste heat from the engine and achieve a higher primary energy ratio (PER) than other forms of heating/cooling systems. In this paper, {{the relationship between the}} capacity characteristic of the GEHP and the heating and cooling loads of buildings has been analyzed. Meanwhile the reasons of the imbalance of the urban electricity and natural gas consumptions between summer and winter have been studied. The running characteristic of a water-to-water GEHP has been investigated experimentally and the PER was measured. Based on the analysis and experimental results, it could be concluded that if both the gas-fired boilers and electric air conditioners are replaced by GEHPs in some percentage, we can narrow the gaps between the requirement and provision of electricity and natural gas and balance the seasonal consumption differences of electricity and natural gas between summer and winter simultaneously. In order to improve energy efficiency, environmental quality and energy consumption structure effectively, the governmental incentive policies for promoting use of GEHPs should be formulated in China and some other developing countries.
