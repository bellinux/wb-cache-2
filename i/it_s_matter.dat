A substance necessarily possesses {{at least one}} substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a [...] "substance" [...] (ousia) is an individual thing—for example, an individual man or an individual horse. The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties, the properties that <b>S's</b> <b>matter</b> needs {{in order to be}} the kind of substance that S is. In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties, properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance.|$|R

Sex education was offered in Science courses provided by the Center of Adolescent Educators. The focus on reproduction matters contradictorily entice students to the subject of pregnancy which public policies wished to avoid. The course aimed at instigate a sense of responsibility about sexual relations. However information on contraceptive methods was usually related to adult <b>s</b> <b>matters</b> and remained distant from youth's anxieties thus not acknowledging adolescent sexuality...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a very simple}} extension of the standard model in which one or more gauge singlet scalars S-i couples to the standard model via an interaction of the form lambda(S) S(i) (dagger) S(i) H(dagger) H, where H is the standard model Higgs doublet. The thermal relic density of S scalars is calculated {{as a function of}} the coupling lambda(S) and the S scalar mass ms. The regions of the (m(S),lambda(S)) parameter space which can be probed by present and future experiments designed to detect scattering of <b>S</b> dark <b>matter</b> particles from Ge nuclei, and to observe upward-moving muons and contained events in neutrino detectors due to high-energy neutrinos from annihilations of <b>S</b> dark <b>matter</b> particles in the Sun and the Earth, are discussed. Present experimental bounds place only very weak constraints on the possibility of thermal relic <b>S</b> scalar dark <b>matter.</b> The next generation of cryogenic Ge detectors and of large area (10 (4) m(2)) neutrino detectors will be able to investigate most of the parameter space corresponding to thermal relic <b>S</b> scalar dark <b>matter</b> up to m(S) approximate to 50 GeV, while a 1 km(2) detector would in general be able to detect thermal relic <b>S</b> scalar dark <b>matter</b> up to m(S) approximate to 100 GeV and would be able to detect up to m(S) approximate to 500 GeV or more if the Higgs boson is lighter than 100 GeV...|$|R

Para isto, fez-se um recorte na zona oeste de Campinas, onde estuda-se 5 conjuntos habitacionais de média e baixa renda e seus respectivos sistemas de espaços livres. Assim, relaciona-se o caráter desses espaços com suas intensidades de uso e com a contribuição ecológica que oferecem ao município.
