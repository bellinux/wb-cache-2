5|$|This road <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>name</b> {{because it}} {{formerly}} {{served as a}} demarcation line which separated the civic area from the ethnic settlements of Singapore {{as part of the}} British colonial government's town planning, known as the Jackson Plan.

This perpendicular road is the present-day Middle Road. Due to increasing Chinese immigrants settling near the European Town, the Europeans subsequently vacated the area to dwell more inland, away from the urbanising city quarters.|$|E
5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim {{was working}} at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>name.</b> Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E

5|$|In England, {{cultivation}} persisted {{only in the}} light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of {{the north}} Essex countryside. The Essex town of Saffron Walden <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>name</b> as a saffron growing and trading centre; its name was originally Cheppinge Walden, and the culinary name change was effected to punctuate {{the importance of the}} crop to the townsfolk; the town's arms still feature blooms from the eponymous crocus. Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation. Puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere, unadorned, and unspiced foods. Saffron was also a labor-intensive crop, which became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time opportunity costs rose. And finally, an influx of more exotic spices from the far East due to the resurgent spice trade meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had many moreand cheaperseasonings to dally over.|$|E
