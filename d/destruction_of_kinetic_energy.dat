It is found that the kinetic energy is generated in the lower latitudes south of the maximum westerlies, transported northward and then, destroyed in the midlatitudes north of the maximum westerlies. Therefore, the atmospheric kinetic energy is maintained by the counterbalance between the divergence (convergence) of kinetic energy flux and generation (<b>destruction)</b> <b>of</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> in lower (middle) latitudes...|$|E
40|$|The global {{features}} and meridional spectral energy transformation {{variations of the}} first and second special observation periods of the First Global GARP Experiment (FGGE) are investigated, together with the latitudinal distribution of the kinetic energy balance. Specific seasonal characteristics are shown by the spectral distributions of the global transformations between (1) zonal mean and eddy components of the available potential energy, (2) the zonal mean and eddy components of the kinetic energy, and (3) the available potential energy and the kinetic energy. Maximum kinetic energy production is found to occur at subtropical latitudes, with a secondary maximum at higher middle latitudes.

My paper (Kung 1970), referred to by Gordon, presented a latitude-height cross-section of the-V-V 4. The distribution of-V-Vt $ is markedly different from that of [...] wa as we generally envision it. While we have large positive-V-V 4 values to the south and north of middle latitudes in the upper troposphere, and also generally in the lower troposphere, we find a significant, negative-V*V+ in the middle and upper troposphere of the middle latitudes. This negative area of-V-V 4 is approximately the region where we expect the maximum-wa. In a subsequent paper (Kung 1971), the adiabatic generation and <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> were examined separately for the zonal and meridional motions of the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} generation <b>of</b> turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> and buoyancy {{forces on the}} statistics of air temperature and velocity increments are experimentally investigated at the cross over from production to inertial range scales. The ratio of an approximated mechanical to buoyant production (or <b>destruction)</b> <b>of</b> turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> {{can be used to}} form a dimensionless stability parameter ζ that classifies the state of the atmosphere as common in many atmospheric surface layer studies. Here, we assess how ζ affects the scale-wise evolution of the probability of extreme air temperature excursions, their asymmetry and time reversibility. The analysis makes use of high frequency velocity and air temperature time series measurements collected at z= 5 m above a grass surface at very large Reynolds numbers Re=u_* z/ν > 1 × 10 ^ 5 (u_* is the friction velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity of air). Using conventional higher-order structure functions, temperature exhibits larger intermittency and wider multifractality when compared to the longitudinal velocity component, consistent with laboratory studies and simulations conducted at lower Re. Moreover, deviations from the classical Kolmogorov scaling for the longitudinal velocity are shown to be reasonably described by the She-Leveque vortex filament model that has no 'tunable' parameters and is independent of ζ. The work demonstrates that external boundary conditions, and in particular the magnitude and sign of the sensible heat flux, {{have a significant impact on}} temperature advection-diffusion dynamics within the inertial range. In particular, atmospheric stability affects both the buildup of intermittency and the persistent asymmetry and time irreversibility observed in the first two decades of inertial sub-range scales...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{turbulence}} models calibrated for fully turbulent boundary layers often over-predict {{drag and}} heat transfer on aerodynamic surfaces with partially laminar boundary layers. A robust correlation-based model is developed {{for use in}} Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations to predict laminar-to-turbulent transition onset of boundary layers on external aerodynamic surfaces. The new model is derived from an existing transition model for the two-equation k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model, and is coupled with the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model. The transition model solves two transport equations for intermittency and transition momentum thickness Reynolds number. Experimental correlations and local mean flow quantities {{are used in the}} model to account for effects of freestream turbulence level and pressure gradients on transition onset location. Transition onset is triggered by activating intermittency production using a vorticity Reynolds number criterion. In the new model, production and <b>destruction</b> terms <b>of</b> the intermittency equation are modified to improve consistency in the fully turbulent boundary layer post-transition onset, as well as ensure insensitivity to freestream eddy viscosity value specified in the SA model. In the original model, intermittency was used to control production and <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b> Whereas, in the new model, only the production of eddy viscosity in SA model is controlled, and the destruction term is not altered. Unlike the original model, the new model does not use an additional correction to intermittency for separation-induced transition. Accuracy of drag predictions are improved significantly {{with the use of the}} transition model for several two-dimensional single- and multi-element airfoil cases over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The new model is able to predict the formation of stable and long laminar separation bubbles on low-Reynolds number airfoils that is not captured with conventional turbulence models. The validated transition model is successfully applied to rotating blade configurations in axial flow conditions to study the effects of transitional boundary layers on rotor thrust and torque. In helicopter rotors, inclusion of transition effects increased thrust prediction by 2 % and decreased torque by as much as 8 % at lower collective angles, due to reduced airfoil profile drag. In wind turbine rotors, transition model predicted a 7 % [...] 70 % increase in generated shaft torque at lower wind speeds, due to lower viscous drag. This has important implications for CFD analysis of small wind turbines operating at low values of rated power. Transition onset locations along upper and lower surfaces of rotor blades are analyzed in detail. A new crossflow transition onset criterion is developed to account for crossflow instability effects in three-dimensional boundary layers. Preliminary results for swept wing and rotating blade flows demonstrate the need to account for crossflow transition in three-dimensional simulations of wings, rotating blades, and airframes. Inclusion of crossflow effects resulted in accelerated transition in the presence of favorable pressure gradients and yawed flow. Finally, a new correction to the wall damping function in the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is proposed to improve sensitivity of the model to strong adverse pressure gradients (APG). The correction reduces turbulence production in the boundary layer when the ratio of magnitudes of local turbulent stress to the wall shear stress exceeds a threshold value, therefore enabling earlier separation of boundary layer. Improved prediction of static and dynamic stall on two-dimensional airfoils is demonstrated with the APG correction...|$|R
