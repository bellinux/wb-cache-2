5|$|Abd al-Rahman {{helped the}} British to retain Sudanese support during the First World War, {{when they were}} opposed to the Turkish Empire, despite <b>his</b> <b>being</b> a Muslim leader.

5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown.
