5|$|Ochs went on tour {{wearing the}} gold suit, {{backed by a}} rock band, singing his own {{material}} along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard. His fans <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to respond. This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience. Ochs's March 27, 1970, concerts at Carnegie Hall were the most successful, {{and by the end}} of that night's second show Ochs had won over many in the crowd. The show was recorded and released as Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{opposed the}} use of {{mandatory}} limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming. He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much of it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> embryonic development was controlled {{at the molecular}} level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development {{in a wide range}} of eukaryotes.|$|E

5|$|When previewed, {{the focus}} group liked the concept but hated the way the pilot was produced. Among the {{problems}} with the original pilot was the believability of the Eppes family in terms of both physical appearance and chemistry, with the chemistry of the actors being the larger issue. Although Heuton and Falacci liked Cariou, Macht, and Krumholtz, Heuton and Falacci <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the three actors playing the Eppes family would interact with each other until filming began.|$|E
5|$|While La Salle was gone, six {{of those}} who had {{remained}} on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha took his first ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day. Rishabhanatha, Jains believe, was the first monk of the present half cycle of time (avasarpini). Therefore, people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to offer food (ahara) to monks. King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered sugarcane juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as {{it was only after}} one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself {{in other parts of}} his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage {{and the need for}} closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

Executive producer James L. Brooks {{came up with the}} idea of the Moe's Tavern wraparounds at the beginning and the end of the episode. It was added because the writers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to end the episode. Levine had worked as a minor league baseball announcer before the episode was produced so he was able to give directions to the animators on the characters' looks and ambiance of the episode.|$|E

5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to facilitate this.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invention}} of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll came the first images of viruses. In 1935 American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E

5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E
5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, the United States Department of War {{announced}} {{they would take}} over both classroom space and athletic facilities at 271 colleges and universities to be utilized for the training of United States Army soldiers. As part of the Department's order, only students under 18 {{years of age or}} those with 4-F draft classifications were permitted to compete in intercollegiate athletics. At the time of the announcement, coach Thomas was quoted as saying:"Army–Navy programs not figured at all in our plans for athletics next fall."As such, preparations continued towards fielding a team for the 1943 season. On March 8, spring practice commenced at Denny Stadium and 55 student-athletes reported the first day. At that time coach Thomas acknowledged he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many of his players would be eligible to play in the fall due to rules the prohibited active-duty servicemen playing intercollegiate football. As they entered practice, only 15 lettermen returned to the squad from the 1942 team. These players included: Jack Aland, Johnny August, Bill Baughman, Andy Bires, Charley Compton, Ted Cook, Leon Fichman, Ted McKosky, Jim McWhorter, Norman Mosley, Mitchell Olenski, Kenny Reese, Lou Scales, John Staples and Don Whitmire. Two weeks into the practices, coach Thomas held the first scrimmage of the spring on March 22.|$|E
