40|$|Photosynthesis {{is one of}} {{the most}} thermo-sensitive {{processes}} in plants. Although the severity of heat stress could be attenuated <b>by</b> <b>grafting</b> <b>approach,</b> the primary damaged site of photosynthesis system under heat stress and the regulatory mechanism of rootstock-mediated heat tolerance are poorly understood. In the current study, cucumber plants grafted onto their own roots and heat-tolerant luffa roots were exposed to root-zone heat (25 / 40 °C) and aerial heat (40 / 25 °C) individually and in combination (40 / 40 °C) to understand the response of photosynthetic process by investigating energy absorption and distribution, electron transport in photosystem (PS) II and I, and CO 2 assimilation. According to the results, root-zone heat stress inhibited photosynthesis mainly through decreasing Rubisco activity, while aerial heat stress mainly through inhibiting PSII acceptor side. The imbalance in light absorption and utilization resulted in accumulation of reactive oxygen species that caused damage to photosynthetic apparatus, forming a vicious cycle. On the contrary, grafting cucumber onto heat-tolerant luffa rootstock alleviated heat-induced photosynthetic inhibition and oxidative stress by maintaining higher root vitality, HSP 70 accumulation, and antioxidant potential...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to review our {{experience}} with the surgical treatment of 110 patients with an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA). Furthermore, we focus especially on 37 ureteral obstructions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1978 and 1996 we treated 110 patients for an IAAA. It concerned 101 men and nine women with mean age of 66. 8 years. Emergency surgery was performed in 32 patients (13 ruptures) and elective surgery in 78 patients (only 23 asymptomatic). The IAAA diagnosis was made by CT scan preoperatively in 40 % of the patients. Compression of 37 ureters in 23 patients (14 bilateral, 9 unilateral) was noticed and ureteral stenting was performed preoperatively in nine patients (12 ureters). The surgical approach was median laparotomy (88 patients) or retroperitoneal approach (21 patients). One patient was treated with an endovascular Min-Tec Stentor aortic <b>graft</b> <b>by</b> femoral <b>approach.</b> Suprarenal clamping was necessary in 44 patients. Ureterolysis of 23 ureters was performed. Three peroperative iatrogenic lesions were successfully treated intraoperatively. RESULTS: Fatal complications occurred in nine patients (8 %), five patients after urgent surgery and four patients after elective surgery, all of them related to technical problems. Non fatal complications occurred in 22 patients, renal insufficiency was most important in ten patients (two permanent dialysis). The mean follow-up was 4. 5 years (range, 0. 5 to 15 years). Late survival was 68 % at 5 years and 42 % after 10 years. Seven patients presented late graft related complications, one fatal. In 14 surviving patients with 21 ureterolysed ureters, one needed a nefrectomy and one a bilateral Boari-plasty. In eight surviving patients with 11 stented ureters, one patient needed a small bowel interposition for ureteral stricture. After CT evaluation, all ureteral stents were removed 3 to 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Surgery for IAAA is quite complex. Mortality and morbidity are often associated with emergency or combined vascular and non vascular procedures. 2. When carefull operative repair is performed with minimal dissection of structures from the aneurysmal wall, excellent results can be expected. 3. Ureteral compression should be treated by ureteral stenting, preoperatively, to facilitate ureterolysis or even to avoid it. Regular follow-up CT control is recommended. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Femoral neck {{fractures}} {{are notorious}} for complications like avascular necrosis and nonunion. In developing countries, {{various factors such as}} illiteracy, low socioeconomic status, ignorance are responsible for the delay in surgery. Neglected fracture neck femur always poses a formidable challenge. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the results of triple muscle pedicle bone grafting using sartorius, tensor fasciae latae and part of gluteus medius in neglected femoral neck fracture. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study with medical record of 50 patients, who were operated by open reduction, internal fixation along with muscle pedicle bone <b>grafting</b> <b>by</b> the anterior <b>approach.</b> After open reduction, two to three cancellous screws (6. 5 mm) were used for internal fixation in all cases. A bony chunk of the whole anterior superior iliac spine of 1 cm thickness, 1 cm width and 4. 5 cm length, taken from the iliac crest comprised of muscle pedicle of sartorius, tensor fascia latae and part of gluteus medius. Then the graft with all three muscles mobilized and put in the trough made over the anterior or anterosuperior aspect of the femoral head. The graft was fixed with one or two 4. 5 mm self-tapping cortical screw in anterior to posterior direction. Results: 14 patients were lost to followup. The results were based on 36 patients. We observed that in our series, there was union in 34, out of 36 (94. 4 %) patients. All patients were within the age group of 15 - 51 years (average 38 years) with displaced neglected femoral neck fracture of ≥ 30 days. Mean time taken for full clinicoradiological union was 14 weeks (range- 10 - 24 weeks). Conclusion: Triple muscle pedicle bone grafting gives satisfactory results for neglected femoral neck fracture in physiologically active patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{compared}} {{the results of}} percutaneous angioscopy and angiography for detecting critical elements of surface lesion morphology in 21 patients undergoing balloon angioplasty of saphenous vein coronary bypass grafts. Background. Angiography remains the standard for diagnosing and treating intravascular pathology associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. It has been demonstrated that coronary angioscopy is more sensitive for identifying more complex atherosclerotic plaques and intracoronary thrombi in native coronary arteries. Methods. Angioscopy and angiography were performed before and after angioplasty of “culprit lesions” in bypass grafts. All {{but one of the}} patients had unstable angina. The mean age of the saphenous vein coronary bypass grafts was 10. 1 ± 2. 4 years (range 5 to 15). Results. Restesosis at a prior angioptasty site was present in seven patients. Intravascalar thrombi were seen by angioscopy in 15 (71 %) of 21 versus 4 (19 %) of 21 <b>grafts</b> <b>by</b> angiography (p < 0. 001). Dissection was identified by angioscony in 14 (66 %) of 21 versus 2 (9. 5 %) of 21 <b>grafts</b> <b>by</b> angiograpay (p < 0. 01). The presence of friable plaque liung the Iumen surface of the vein <b>graft</b> was detected <b>by</b> angioscopy in 11 (52 %) of 21 versus 4 (19 %) of 21 <b>grafts</b> <b>by</b> angiography (p < 0. 05). There was no correlation between age of the bypass graft and the finding of friable plaque. Conclusions. We conclude that angioscopy is superior to angiography for detecting complex lesion merphology ta bypass grafts and that the presence of friable plaque does not preclude an uncomplicated angioplasty procedure...|$|R

40|$|Human skin grafted {{upon the}} chorio-allantoic {{membrane}} of chick embryos adheres and becomes nourished {{for as long}} as 10 days.

In successful experiments the epithelium of the chorio-allantois fuses with that of the graft, the collagen fibers of the corium interlace with those of the membrane after the separation or disappearance of the ectodermal layer, and the blood vessels of the chick anastomose, and unite by intervening pools of extravasated blood, with those of the graft. This vascular communication between the two tissues is largely responsible for the nourishment of the <b>graft</b> <b>by</b> affording a plasmatic circulation.
