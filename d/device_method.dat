The emphasis is given on the compilation of rule conditions into a discrimination network for incremental matching at run-time. The network consists of primitive, logical and complex events, that save information about partial condition element matching, as in RETE algorithm and triggers one ECA rule {{that corresponds to}} the production rule. The <b>DEVICE</b> <b>method</b> re-uses the primitives of active OODB systems, without introducing low-level data structures and provides an infrastructure for the integration of all database rule paradigms into a single knowledge base system...|$|E

40|$|Calibration {{plays an}} {{important}} role in industrial robots. Traditional ways are time consuming and also involve a lot of human efforts. We have proposed a dual-PSD (Position Sensitive <b>Device)</b> <b>method</b> to automatically accomplish the calibration in several minutes. The alignment control problem is the major issue in the calibration process, which requires to move a laser pointer mounted on the robot's end-effector to shoot the laser beam at one PSD center and reflect to another PSD center. This paper proposes an adaptive control method to solve the alignment problem. It can online estimate the unknown parameters between the robot base frame and the PSD frame, which are usually required before the alignment control. The advantage of the approach is that we do not need to calculate or estimate these parameters before the alignment control so it can further facilitate the automated calibration process. The effectiveness and advantages of the method is demonstrated through simulation results. © 2015 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{limit is}} an {{important}} property of fine-grained soils. The standard thread-rolling method for determining the plastic limit has long been criticized for requiring considerable judgments from the operator. This {{study was conducted to}} seek for a new method on the determination of the plastic limit in a way to overcome the inconsistence result produce by using the standard thread-rolling method. Four different methods were tested. The first method was the modified fall cone method, a method commonly used to obtain a liquid limit. The second method was the rolling <b>device</b> <b>method</b> which is previously proposed by Bobrowski and Griekspoor (1992). The third method was proposed by Wood and Wroth (1978) using a heavier cone. The fourth method was the one proposed by Tao-Wei Feng (2004) which made use of a small soil container. Eight soil samples representing plasticity index (PI) ranging from 15 to 42 % were tested.
