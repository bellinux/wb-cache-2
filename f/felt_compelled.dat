5|$|Men who <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> {{to protest}} the {{restrictions}} of the conscription law attempted to disrupt the program {{through the use of}} various techniques, including the initiation of work slowdowns and labor strikes. Routine rule breaking frustrated camp directors. The most difficult cases were given to the federal court system and the men imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{area that}} is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams {{and was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies of the United States. Williams and his company <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to withdraw from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Providence quickly became a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as Williams himself had been exiled from Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas.|$|E
60|$|Sir Gregory {{spoke to}} Mrs. Brownlow {{on the same}} subject, and as he told her what had taken place between him and Edith, she <b>felt</b> herself <b>compelled</b> {{to speak to her}} daughter.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{uncle was}} sitting in the room at the time, and Ayala <b>felt</b> herself <b>compelled</b> to go to him and kiss him, and thank him for all his kindness. [...] "I am so sorry to cost you so much money, Uncle Reginald," [...] she said.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2010 Kowalski {{announced}} that he is gay. Kowalski says he was inspired to come out by Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas, who announced the previous December that he was gay. He said [...] "I <b>felt</b> really <b>compelled</b> {{to do it because}} it's very tough to live a closeted existence".|$|R
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between {{the two sides of the}} Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to {{meet the}} Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's {{commitment}} to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E
5000|$|This {{imagery of}} love and loss {{captured}} Katie's imagination immediately and she says, [...] "As a woman and mother I <b>felt</b> deeply <b>compelled</b> to explore these stories. I soon discovered that {{the lives of the}} first female convicts is a part of our history that has been explored by few".|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you, sir," [...] {{answered}} Peveril, who now <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> to turn about, and reply with civility, [...] "that it {{was with}} difficulty I could prevail on my landlady to add my cover to yours, though she seems now such a zealot for the consumption of eggs and bacon." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had taken}} {{so much the}} more {{prominent}} part in all this that he <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> by his manliness to say something in contradiction to it--something that {{should have the same}} flavour about it as had her self-abnegation and declared passion. He also must be unselfish and enthusiastic. 'I do not deny that there is truth in what you say.' ...|$|R
5|$|The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC {{was fought}} between Rome and Jugurtha of the North African kingdom of Numidia. It {{constituted}} the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion {{on the continent}} after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{documented}} {{description of}} hare coursing {{is the work}} known in English as On Coursing. It was written by Arrian a Greek historian of the Roman period, circa 180AD and is known in Anicent Greek as Kynegetikos and in Latin as Cynegeticus. Arrian <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the Ancient Greeks only knew the scent hunt; On Coursing complements Xenophon's classic work on that subject, Cynegeticus (On Hunting). William Dansey, an English clergyman, translated On Coursing in 1831.|$|E
60|$|Third (and wherein he soars {{far above}} Daniel) the sinewy {{strength}} and originality of single lines and paragraphs: the frequent curiosa felicitas of his diction, of which I need not here give specimens, having anticipated {{them in a}} preceding page. This beauty, and as eminently characteristic of Wordsworth's poetry, his rudest assailants have <b>felt</b> themselves <b>compelled</b> to acknowledge and admire.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} the death of Landra (the {{original}} Starshine), Rom left Clairton to continue seeking out Wraiths elsewhere. Brandy <b>felt</b> strangely <b>compelled</b> to dig up Starshine's body. A Wraith sorcerer called Doctor Dredd then magically transplanted Brandy's body into the Starshine armor as part of an evil plan. This was something she had secretly yearned for; and afterwards, she left Clairton and accompanied Rom as he traveled the Earth.|$|R
50|$|He {{inherited}} a marquistate impoverished {{by the recent}} civil war, and in bad relationships with the neighbouring Duchy of Savoy. Therefore, he <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> to seek help to France, swearing loyalty to Charles, Dauphin of France in April 1375. In the following forty years the margraves repeatedly asked the French help against Savoy: in 1376, for example, Thomas went to Paris, asking to King Charles V that the quarrel with Savoy could be debated at the Paris Parliament.|$|R
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> {{to issue the}} written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
5|$|Harrelson was the season's next {{significant}} casting choice, {{brought on}} to play Hart at McConaughey's request. Harrelson stated that he joined True Detective partly {{because he wanted to}} work with certain people involved in the project, with whom he had previously collaborated in the 2012 HBO film Game Change. Michelle Monaghan agreed to play the season's female lead, Maggie, because she <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> by the direction of the plot and her character's story arc. Michael Potts and Tory Kittles completed the principal cast, playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania, respectively. Major supporting roles in True Detective first season include Kevin Dunn as Major Ken Quesada, Alexandra Daddario as Lisa Tragnetti, and Brad Carter as Charlie Lange.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Admiral Karimullah again {{secretly}} {{pushed for}} the second strike capability in the government but publicly reiterated {{on the issue of}} nuclear weapons and announced that while no such immediate plans really existed, but he did stressed on the fact Pakistan would not hesitate to take such steps if it <b>felt</b> so <b>compelled.</b> He remained concerns of expansion of Indian Navy in the region and continued his secret push for acquiring of the modern weapon systems for the Navy.|$|R
60|$|Iris secluded {{herself in}} her own room. Her husband passed the hours of every day away from the cottage; {{sometimes}} {{in the company of}} the doctor, sometimes among his friends in Paris. His wife suffered acutely under the self-imposed state of separation, to which wounded pride and keenly <b>felt</b> resentment <b>compelled</b> her to submit. No friend was near her, in whose compassionate advice she might have token refuge. Not even the sympathy of her maid was offered to the lonely wife.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} also chosen {{because of its}} {{derelict}} condition. It was risky to put passengers on {{it and it was}} <b>felt</b> this would <b>compel</b> the British to let it pass blockade because of this danger or put the British in a bad light internationally.|$|R
5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|Klein had {{the power}} to make or break {{academic}} careers, so Born <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E
5|$|When {{the book}} edition of The Vicar of Bullhampton {{appeared}} in April 1870, it bore a preface; Trollope, who ordinarily scorned prefaces and dedications, <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> {{to justify the}} presentation of a character like Carry Brattle. He reiterated the points he had made regarding Formosa: that while depicting a fallen woman as glamourous or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice, a true depiction of such a woman's misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation; and might soften the hearts of parents whose daughters have fallen, and thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency.|$|E
2500|$|Hillquit <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> {{to get a}} job to help {{alleviate}} the family's difficult financial situation. Since his English was poor and his body frail, employment options were limited. He joined other young intellectual émigrés from Tsarist Russia a shirt-maker, repetitiously stitching cuffs of garments. In his posthumously-published memoirs, Hillquit recalled that cuff-making was [...] "the simplest part and required least skill and training," [...] involving the simple stitching of square pieces of cut cloth. The young Hillquit never progressed past that entry-level task as a shirtmaker.|$|R
60|$|David said he {{was tired}} of secrets, and would not guess. Annie guessed a great deal; but Miss Fosbrook thought more about the word she would not try to read. She began to have a strong {{suspicion}} from whom the post-office order had come, and was the more uneasy about the spending of David's half sovereign; but she durst say nothing, for she knew it could do no good if he <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> against his own will; and she saw that he was full of thought.|$|R
50|$|During {{his seventh}} {{year at the}} gymnasium, Preobrazhensky <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> to choose which revolutionary {{organisation}} to support, being torn between the competing strategies of the peasant-oriented Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) and the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Influenced by the Communist Manifesto and another work by Frederick Engels, Preobrazhensky cast his lot with the latter organisation, believing its approach to be scientifically based. Together with two friends, Preobrazhensky declared his formal allegiance to the RSDLP late in 1903 and was accepted into the illegal organisation {{two or three months}} later.|$|R
5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to {{the doors of the}} classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E
5000|$|Although Merrill could lobby his own Board - {{not always}} with success - {{on behalf of}} writers and artists whose work and {{circumstances}} he <b>felt</b> particularly <b>compelling,</b> his interference in the grant-giving process was officially discouraged. This was by Merrill's own design: a measure of formal disengagement from his namesake foundation helped immunize him from [...] "the friends of the friends" [...] who might feel tempted to [...] "put in a good word with Jimmy" [...] on a pending application. In the event, Merrill could truthfully reply that decisions were out of his hands.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} here to unfathomable impulse. If he {{had been}} driven to hunt up Jeff Aiken, now he was called to find this unknown ranger captain. In Duane's state of mind clear reasoning, common sense, or keenness {{were out of the}} question. He went because he <b>felt</b> he was <b>compelled.</b>|$|R

After receiving an electronic reprint of Zhang’s recent paper [1] some time ago, I have had an email exchange with the author pointing {{out a number of}} errors in the paper, which unfortunately invalidate all its main results.
