5|$|A {{reduction}} in <b>fracture</b> toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in <b>fracture</b> toughness is accompanied by a change in the <b>fracture</b> appearance. When above the transition, the <b>fracture</b> is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the <b>fracture</b> appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the <b>fracture</b> will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle <b>fracture</b> in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the <b>fracture.</b>|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related <b>fracture.</b> A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral <b>fracture</b> and rib <b>fracture</b> was increased; other <b>fracture</b> types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic <b>fracture</b> found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards <b>fracture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{specimen}} has {{a poorly}} healed <b>fracture</b> {{of the right}} fibula, which left a large callus on the bone. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 54 foot bones referred to Gorgosaurus were examined for signs of stress <b>fracture,</b> but none were found.|$|E
30|$|Six of 30 femur <b>fractures</b> and six of 21 tibia <b>fractures</b> were corner <b>fractures.</b> The {{average age}} of {{patients}} with corner <b>fractures</b> was 2.2  months, ranging from 1  month to 4  months.

5|$|Boron {{fibers and}} sub-millimeter sized {{crystalline}} boron springs {{are produced by}} laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450GPa, <b>fracture</b> strain 3.7%, <b>fracture</b> stress 17GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.|$|E
5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without <b>fracture.</b> In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in <b>fracture</b> toughness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fracture</b> {{toughness}} {{is measured}} using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular specimen, {{of which the}} dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23. There are other means of estimating or measuring <b>fracture</b> toughness by the following: The Charpy impact test per ASTM A370; The crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) test per BS 7448-1; The J integral test per ASTM E1820; The Pellini drop-weight test per ASTM E208.|$|E

25|$|A simple <b>fracture</b> {{describes}} a complete transection {{of the bone}} with minimal fragmentation at the <b>fracture</b> site.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} {{of a simple}} <b>fracture</b> is a comminuted <b>fracture,</b> where the bone has been shattered into fragments, or there are secondary fractures along the main <b>fracture</b> lines. High velocity injuries (e.g. those caused by bullets, improvised explosive devices, etc...) will frequently cause comminuted fractures.|$|E
30|$|For data analysis, 4 -part <b>fractures,</b> head-split <b>fractures,</b> {{dislocation}} <b>fractures</b> {{and highly}} comminuted <b>fractures</b> were summarized into {{the group of}} complex <b>fractures.</b> All radiographic material was analyzed to identify a possible involvement of the subcapital medial meta-diaphyseal cortex (medial calcar region).|$|R
50|$|In normal bone, <b>fractures</b> {{occur when}} there is {{significant}} force applied, or repetitive trauma over a long time. <b>Fractures</b> can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or {{when there is}} a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as Paget's disease) or is the site of the growth of cancer. Common <b>fractures</b> include wrist <b>fractures</b> and hip <b>fractures,</b> associated with osteoporosis, vertebral <b>fractures</b> associated with high-energy trauma and cancer, and <b>fractures</b> of long-bones. Not all <b>fractures</b> are painful. When serious, depending on the <b>fractures</b> type and location, complications may include flail chest, compartment syndromes or fat embolism.Compound <b>fractures</b> involve the bone's penetration through the skin. Some complex <b>fractures</b> can be treated by the use of bone grafting procedures that replace missing bone portions.|$|R

40|$|Background: Both pelvic <b>fractures</b> and femoral shaft <b>fractures</b> {{are caused}} by high-energy injuries. When {{unstable}} pelvic <b>fractures</b> and femoral shaft <b>fractures</b> occur concomitantly, the optimal treatment method is controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a reasonable principle for treating such complicated injuries. Methods: Forty patients sustaining unstable pelvic <b>fractures</b> and concomitant femoral shaft <b>fractures</b> were treated in a 7 -year period. The initial management of the <b>fractures</b> was started at the emergency service according to the Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol. Unstable pelvic <b>fractures</b> were wrapped by cloth sheets and femoral shaft <b>fractures</b> were immobilized with a splint. Angiography was performed on patients with unstable hemodynamic status. The definitive treatment for combined <b>fractures</b> was performed after stabilizing the hemodynamics.

25|$|Between 35 and 50% of {{all women}} over 50 {{had at least one}} {{vertebral}} <b>fracture.</b> In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized.

25|$|Treatment of bone {{fractures}} are broadly {{classified as}} surgical or conservative, the latter basically referring to any non-surgical procedure, such as pain management, immobilization or other non-surgical stabilization.

25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken in a {{direction}} that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured.

This type of <b>fracture</b> occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of <b>fracture</b> are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in native copper.|$|E
