5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe,</b> which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|The first non-visual {{study of}} galaxies, {{particularly}} active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5MHz and 30GHz. (The ionosphere blocks signals below this range.) Large radio interferometers {{have been used}} to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei. Radio telescopes {{can also be used to}} observe neutral hydrogen (via 21cm radiation), including, potentially, the non-ionized matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> that later collapsed to form galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe)</b> appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations {{of the formation of}} structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E

25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{also explains}} why quasars were more common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes {{all of the}} gas and dust near it. This means {{that it is possible}} that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy that depended on the black hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now quiescent because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.|$|E
25|$|Wormholes are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists {{postulate}} could connect two arbitrary {{points in}} the universe, across an Einstein–Rosen Bridge. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for wormholes, all of the currently known solutions involve some assumption, for example the existence of negative mass, which may be unphysical. However, Cramer et al. argue that such wormholes might have been created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> stabilized by cosmic string.

25|$|The {{structure}} of {{the cosmic microwave background}} anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the photon–baryon plasma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b> The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.|$|E
25|$|Tritium, or hydrogen-3, {{with one}} proton and two neutrons, was {{produced}} by proton and neutron collisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> as well, but it has since radioactively decayed to helium-3. Modern tritium cannot be explained by big bang nucleosynthesis because of tritium's short half-life of 12.3 years.

The radioactive beta decay of tritium to helium releases an electron and an antineutrino, with an average energy release of 18.6 MeV.
