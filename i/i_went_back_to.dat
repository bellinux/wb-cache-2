500|$|In 1989, Hawke {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} appearance in Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, playing {{one of the}} students taught by Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher. The Variety reviewer noted [...] "Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance." [...] The film received considerable acclaim, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Film and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With revenue of US$235million worldwide, it remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date. Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered {{as a result of the}} film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: [...] "I didn't want to be an actor and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> college. But then the [...] success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else." ...|$|E

According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet".

During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that place." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{third of}} five {{children}} of actor James Fox and his wife Mary Elizabeth Piper, His father James {{was the son of}} Major Robin Fox, theatrical agent, who married Angela Muriel Darita Worthington, a natural daughter of Frederick Lonsdale. Laurence Fox was born in 1978 in Yorkshire. At the age of thirteen he entered Harrow School where, according to him, he was [...] "shy around women, sensitive and a bit naïve". Although he made friends and liked the drama teacher, he hated the school's strict regimen and felt despised and out of place among pupils with titles and wealth. Constantly in trouble for smoking, fighting, going into town and seeing girls, he was eventually expelled a few weeks before his A-levels. According to him, [...] "It was something to do with a girl at a dance. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> take the exams, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone." [...] With hindsight, Fox has said that his experience at Harrow enabled him to portray [...] "" [...] – the upper-class boys looking down on him and whom he disliked – with much insight and cynicism.|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E
