5|$|Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. Andrew left Rome and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Poland. He {{inherited}} {{the domains of}} Gyalu, Nagyenyed and Örményes in Transylvania (now Gilău, Aiud and Armeniș in Romania) from his uncle. Stephen Báthory stipulated that Gyalu should serve the reestablishment of the Roman Catholic bishopric in Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} campaign, an {{attempted}} reconquest of the Emirate of Crete led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring {{a victory over}} the Arabs in Crete, Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas. Theoktistos <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Constantinople, where he discovered that the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E

5|$|Wishing to {{capitalize}} on Soult's failure to defend Bordeaux, Wellington sent Beresford and the 4th and 7th Divisions to seize the seaport. Beresford departed the Allied camp on 7 March and occupied Bordeaux on 12 March. Leaving the 7th Division as an occupation force, Beresford <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> with the 4th Division to join Wellington on 19 March. During this period, Allied infantry strength fell to 29,000 which was why Wellington did not trouble Soult. To {{make up for the}} deficit, the British army commander called for his heavy cavalry brigades to join him. He also asked for 8,000 Spanish reinforcements to be forwarded to the army, the soldiers to be paid by the British treasury. The Battle of Toulouse would be fought on 10 April.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

5|$|Constantine of Baberon, the regent for Isabella of Cilicia, {{offered her}} hand to Bohemond's son, Philip, because he needed Bohemond's {{assistance}} against Kayqubad I, Sultan of Rum. Bohemond accepted the offer and his son married Isabella in June 1222. Bohemond and Philip repelled a Seldjuq attack against Cilicia. Philip's blatant favoritism towards his Frankish retainers enabled Constantine of Baberon to hatch a plot against him. Philip and his supporters were captured and imprisoned {{at the end of}} 1224. Bohemond tried to ensure his son's liberation through negotiations. He appealed to Pope Honorius III, but the pope confirmed his excommunication and forbade the Templars to assist him. Bohemond persuaded Kayqubad I to invade Cilicia. Although Bohemond's son had already been poisoned, Constantine of Baberon promised that Philip would be released if Bohemond come to Cilicia. Shortly after Bohemond's departure, Shihab ad-Din Toghril, atabeg of Aleppo, broke into the Principality of Antioch. After learning of his son's death and Toghril's invasion, Bohemond <b>hurried</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to bring more men forward.|$|E

25|$|In Sicily, {{the fleet}} was redivided into two parts. The army landed and {{joined with the}} cavalry of Segesta. They did not {{immediately}} attack Syracuse and, as the Athenians wintered their camp at Catana, the Syracusans prepared to attack. When the Syracusans marched out to Catana, they learned the Athenians had reboarded their ships and sailed into the harbour at Syracuse. The Syracusans quickly <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> and prepared for battle.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, {{some of the}} men {{expressed}} {{doubts about}} Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt making party he had apparently lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnee village of Paint Lick Town {{on the other side of}} the Ohio River. This accomplished little, and the raiding party <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Boonesborough when they discovered that Blackfish had marched south.|$|E
25|$|The colony was {{now without}} a governor. Pérez Dasmariñas {{had brought with}} him to the Philippines a royal order {{directing}} him to choose a temporary successor in the event of his own death. He had shown this order to various prominent Spaniards in the colony, implying to each that he was the designated successor. In particular, both the governor's son and conquistador Captain Estevan Rodríguez de Figueroa expected the appointment. Both were on the expedition to the Moluccas, and both <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Manila to take command of the colony.|$|E

25|$|As {{smallpox}} {{broke out}} among his troops Governor Lyttleton feared the desertion {{of most of}} his force and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Charleston in great disorder. The Cherokee were still angry, and continued to attack frontier settlements into 1760. In February 1760, they attacked Fort Prince George {{in an attempt to}} rescue their hostages. The fort's commander was killed. The garrison, in panicked retaliation, massacred all of the hostages. And two days later the fort fired artillery into the town of Keowee. The Cherokee now attacked Fort Ninety Six, but it withstood the siege. However, settlements and lesser posts in the South Carolina backcountry quickly fell to Cherokee raids.|$|E
25|$|On {{learning}} of Conrad's assassination, Henry of Champagne, who had meanwhile returned to Acre, <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Tyre. Henry, {{who was the}} nephew of both Richard of England and Philip of France, was acclaimed king by the barons and the citizens of Tyre. According to Ernoul, Henry was hesitant, because Isabella was pregnant, possibly with a son. The barons and the citizens, continued Ernoul, promised him that his children would inherit the Kingdom of Jerusalem to convince him to accept the crown. The betrothal of Henry and Isabella was announced two days after Conrad's death. The marriage was celebrated in Acre on 10 May 1192.|$|E
25|$|Sennacherib {{was assassinated}} in obscure {{circumstances}} in 681BCE. An inscription by Sennacherib's successor, Esarhaddon, describes how Esarhaddon heard that his brothers were fighting {{in the streets of}} Nineveh, <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> from the Western provinces with an army, defeated them all, and took the throne. The inscription does not mention that the brothers were fighting because one of them had just murdered Sennacherib, but this is indicated in the Babylonian chronicles, the Bible (Isaiah 37:36-38, Tobit 1:21), and in later Assyrian records. Esarhaddon's silence {{on the subject of the}} name of his father's murderer may have been to avoid perpetuating any perceptions of instability. To one Babylonian historian, it was divine punishment for what the king had done to Babylon.|$|E

25|$|Lucius Volumnius <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Samnium {{because the}} proconsulships of Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius {{were about to}} expire. Meanwhile, the Samnites raised new troops and raided Roman territories and allies in Campania around Capua and Falernium. Lucius Volumnius headed for Campania and was {{informed}} that the Samnites {{had gone back to}} Samnium to take their loot. He caught up with their camp and defeated a force which was made unfit to fight by the burden of their loot. The Samnite commander, Staius Minatius, was attacked by the prisoners of the Samnites and delivered to the consul. The senate decided to establish the colonies of Minturnae on the mouth of the River Liris and Sinuessa further inland, in the former territory of the Ausoni.|$|E
25|$|The Elector John Sigismund, Maria Eleonora's father, died on 23 December 1619, and the {{prospect}} of a Swedish marriage seemed gone with him. In the spring of 1620, however, stubborn Gustavus Adolphus arrived in Berlin. The Electress Dowager maintained an attitude of reserve and even refused to grant the Swedish king a personal meeting with Maria Eleonora. All those who were present, however, noticed the princess's interest in the young king. Afterwards, Gustavus Adolphus made a round of other Protestant German courts with the professed intention of inspecting a few matrimonial alternatives. On his return to Berlin, the Electress Dowager seems to have become completely captivated by the charming Swedish king. After plighting his troth to Maria Eleonora, Gustavus Adolphus <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Sweden to make arrangements for the reception of his bride.|$|E

The teenager Stephen Bocskai may have already moved to Maximilian's courtit is known that a son of Krisztina Sulyok was reportedly living in Vienna in 1571but {{it is certain that}} he was living in the royal court when his elder brother, Jeromos, died in 1572, because he <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> to Kismarja from Vienna to console his mother. Initially, he served as a page in the royal court. He received a salary from 1574. He again came back to Kismarja in the summer of 1575 to see his ailing mother and to administer his estates. About a year later, he returned to Vienna where he was made a steward.|$|E
