25|$|A {{cellular}} automaton is reversible if, for every current {{configuration of the}} {{cellular automaton}}, there is exactly one past configuration (preimage).

If a cellular automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also {{be described as a}} cellular automaton; this fact is a consequence of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata. For cellular automata in which not every configuration has a preimage, the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns.|$|E
