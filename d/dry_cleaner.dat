Brown attempted {{several times to}} apply to the school's aviation program, but was denied because of his race. Brown joined the track and field team as well as the wrestling team, but soon dropped both for financial reasons. He {{took a job as a}} janitor at a local Lazarus department store and then was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15:30 to midnight each day. In spite of this, he maintained top grades in his classes. Facing difficulties with his academics and the institutional segregation in the city, Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him. Brown rarely returned to Mississippi during the school year, but in the summers he worked at a <b>dry</b> <b>cleaner</b> in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes.|$|E

Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her.

She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed.

40|$|Perchloroethylene {{exposure}} in 28 dry-cleaning establishments and in 25 homes occupied by <b>dry</b> <b>cleaners</b> in Modena, Italy, was investigated. Environmental air samples and alveolar air samples from <b>dry</b> <b>cleaners</b> (n = 60) {{and from their}} family members (n = 23) were collected. The degree of perchloroethylene on the dry-cleaning premises varied widely from establishment to establishment. Spot sampling ranged from 0. 6 to 75 mg/m 3, whereas sampling by personal passive dosimeters ranged from 2. 6 to 221. 5 mg/m 3 (8 -h time weighted average values). Perchloroethylene in alveolar air samples collected {{at the end of}} the work day correlated closely with the 8 -h time weighted average values (r =. 750, p =. 001), and correlated also with alveolar air samples collected at home in the evening (r =. 665, p =. 001) and the following morning (r =. 549, p <. 001). Perchloroethylene levels inside the homes of <b>dry</b> <b>cleaners</b> appeared significantly higher than in 29 houses selected as controls (Mann Whitney U test, p <. 001). Perchloroethylene in alveolar air samples collected at home suggests that nonoccupational exposure to perchloroethylene for family members of <b>dry</b> <b>cleaners</b> exists...|$|R
