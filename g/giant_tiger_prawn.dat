30|$|Research into {{improving}} the growth and/or feed efficiency of various aquaculture species using filamentous green seaweeds as raw or dried feed {{has been increasing}} since around 2010 (Tsutsui et al. 2007; Limsuwan et al. 2008; Ergün et al. 2009; Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Tsutsui et al. 2010; Gamboa-Delgado et al. 2011; Siddik and Anh 2015; Siddik et al. 2014). For species related to the seaweed investigated in the present study, Ulva clathrata improved growth of whiteleg shrimp by 107 – 164  % (Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Gamboa-Delgado et al. 2011), U. intestinalis improved growth of whiteleg shrimp and <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (without specific data) (Limsuwan et al. 2008), and Chaetomorpha ligustica increased SGR of <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> by up to 157  % at the early juvenile stage (Tsutsui et al. 2010). Although direct comparisons with the studies cited above cannot be made because of differences in co-cultured species, our {{results suggest that the}} Chaetomorpha sp. is able to improve shrimp growth by almost the same amount as that of the other filamentous green seaweeds under co-culture conditions.|$|R

30|$|An {{unidentified}} {{species of}} Chaetomorpha grows abundantly {{in the central}} Thailand. This alga has extremely wide euryhalinity and eurythermy (Tsutsui et al. 2015), making it of potentially higher benefit to intensive shrimp aquaculture ponds than Ulva species; however, the use of Chaetomorpha sp. in aquaculture {{has not yet been}} tested. This study aims to investigate the effect of Chaetomorpha sp. as raw feed on the growth of <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> and assess Chaetomorpha sp. as a potential alternative for reducing feeding cost in intensive shrimp culture. This study will also detail the proximate analysis of Chaetomorpha, which has not yet been reported.|$|R
30|$|Three {{replications}} each {{were made}} of Chaetomorpha sp. in monoculture (control) and in co-culture of <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> and Chaetomorpha sp. (experimental treatment). The 70 -L plastic control and treatment tanks (40  cm long ×  57  cm wide ×  30  cm high) were randomly arranged, and connected to each other by polyvinyl chloride pipes. The water was circulated through all tanks with a flow rate of about 30  L h− 1 to maintain the same water conditions, and was passed through an external filter to improve water quality. Water was adjusted to an approximate salinity of 20 – 25 PSU. Water temperature was recorded but not adjusted, and varied from 26.7 to 31.5  °C during the experiment.|$|R
30|$|The Chaetomorpha sp. {{that grows}} abundantly {{in the central}} Thailand {{enhanced}} the growth of <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> and reduced the FCR when used as a raw supplemental feed under co-culture conditions. The protein content of this species is almost the same or {{a little less than}} other filamentous green seaweeds, such as Ulva species; however, it has the advantage of higher fiber and gross energy levels. Thus, Chaetomorpha sp. has the potential to reduce commercial feed costs in the shrimp aquaculture industry through co-culturing. This species of Chaetomorpha may be more suitable and better for shrimp co-culture systems worldwide than Ulva species, which are currently used as raw or dried supplemental feeds.|$|R

50|$|Early Mortality Syndrome {{disease has}} been linked to a strain of a {{bacterium}} called Vibrio parahaemolyticus which affects the <b>Giant</b> <b>Tiger</b> <b>Prawn</b> and the Whiteleg Shrimp, both shrimp that are commonly farmed around the world. The strains are not harmful to humans, but are economically devastating for shrimp farmers. The spread of the bacteria is more prevalent in warmer and saltier ocean waters.|$|E
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that the {{filamentous}} green seaweed Ulva spp. can reduce FCR for shrimp and herbivorous fish (Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Siddik and Anh 2015). For example, U. clathrata reduced the FCR for whiteleg shrimp by approximately 47.5 – 62.1  % (Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010), and U. intestinalis reduced the FCR for spotted scat, red tilapia, and giant gourami by 26 – 58  % (Siddik and Anh 2015). Our study found that Chaetomorpha sp. as a raw feed reduced the FCR for <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> by approximately 40  % under co-culture conditions, indicating that Chaetomorpha sp. can reduce artificial feed expenses as efficiently as Ulva species. This is the first report of FCR reduction for a farmed species by the genus Chaetomorpha under co-culture conditions, as previous reports have only described improvement in shrimp growth (Tsutsui et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|TLA rapid {{expansion}} of shrimp farming, induced by new technologies such as formulated feed and hatchery production of shrimp seed, has led to dramatic changes in coastal resource utilisation. These can be categorised by changes such as the conversion of rice fields, salt farms and other coastal land uses to shrimp farms, decline in mangrove forest, coastal water pollution and a rise in new businesses associated with shrimp farming (e. g. feed, chemicals, cold storage, shrimp export industry networks etc). There {{has been an increase}} in contract farming involving large private enterprises in association with a large number of small-scale shrimp farmers. Shrimp farming is now viewed by many developing countries as a tool for export earning (Goss et al. 1996). For example, in Thailand, marine farmed shrimp has become a very important export commodity and to a smaller extent, a contributor to domestic food supply. The Thai shrimp sector earned the country over US$ 2 billion in foreign exchange in 1995. Thailand has become the world’s leading exporter of <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (Penaeus monodon) since 1993, and currently supplies 20 % of the world trade. On the environmental side, new developments in shrimp farming have stirred up controversies among different groups of people over what the true consequences of the farmed shrimp industry {{to the health of the}} environment are.

40|$|DNA barcoding is the {{technique}} of sequencing a short fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA – a ‘DNA barcode ’- from a taxonomically unknown organism. This DNA barcode is then matched against a reference library of barcodes of known species origin to make a species identification. Since 2004 an international consortium has been promoting DNA barcoding as a global standard for taxonomic identifications (Savolainen et al. 2005). While we applaud Kumar et al. (2012) for bringing DNA barcoding {{to the attention of}} researchers in Malaysia, we have concerns about their understanding of the theory and methods of DNA barcoding which we discuss below. One major advantage of DNA barcoding over traditional species identification methods is the ability to correctly identify organisms from any life cycle stage to species. DNA barcoding has this capacity because intraspecific variation in DNA barcodes is generally much lower than interspecific variation between DNA barcodes (Savolainen et al. 2005), and crucially, because an organism’s DNA barcode does not change as the organism progresses from one life stage to the next. The integrity of DNA sequences through replication and organism growth is fundamental to their role as the “blueprint of life ” (Hill 2006). Kumar et al. (2012) sequenced DNA barcodes from <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> and report the pattern typically seen in DNA barcoding studies: “The average pair-wise distance within the sequences of different stages of P. monodon was two times lesser than the pair-wise distance of the out-group used [sic]”.

40|$|Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (PACT) {{has emerged}} as a {{promising}} method for pathogen eradication and control. PACT uses light excitation of non-toxic photosensitisers to produce singlet oxygen (1 O 2), which in turn damages and eradicates microbial cells. In the present study, a naturally luminescent Vibrio campbellii strain ISO 7 (V. campbellii ISO 7) was used as a model aquaculture pathogen to test the suitability of two porphyrin compounds, the tetra-cationic TMPyP and the tetra-anionic TPPS 4, for the treatment of aquaculture water. Initial work accurately identified the bacterial strain and confirmed its virulence towards <b>giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> Penaeus monodon when injected. The strain killed 100 % of injected prawns within 1 to 16 h, while control prawns injected with sterile buffer remained healthy. Koch's postulates were satisfied by identification of re-isolated strains by multiplex PCR and sequencing of housekeeping genes. In separate time-course experiments, the two photosensitisers were diluted in aquaculture water seeded with the indicator bacterium and samples were irradiated for 24 h using 150 W white LED light. Luminescence assays, growth and regrowth experiments demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of generated 1 O 2 was both time- and dose-dependent, and confirmed that light or porphyrins alone were not toxic. Continuous irradiation in the presence of 20 μM cationic porphyrin for 5 h or 1 μM for 24 h achieved complete lethality of the indicator bacterium. Consistent with previous reports, the tested anionic porphyrin did not impact on the survival of the bacterium, causing only a slight decline in the luminescence signal. Photo-bleaching tests demonstrated natural degradation of both porphyrins after continuous irradiation, making them suitable as ‘self-destructive’ photosensitizers for in situ treatment of aquaculture waters, as they do not accumulate in the water...|$|R
50|$|By 1636, Rembrandt had a {{successful}} venture in the Amsterdam's portraiture market and he had received commissions from the court in The Hague, set up an active studio, married burgomaster's daughter and moved into a prestigious home. By that time, Rembrandt had arisen up the social hierarchy and had various success in life. In 1636, he successfully sued Saskia's relatives for denying her part of her father's estate. In this Self-portrait with Saskia, both the artist and his wife appear to flaunt a proto-bohemian lifestyle, displaying their conspicuous and lavish consumption. His swaggering attitude and fanciful costume were seen as Rembrandt showing off his wealth and youthful bride. The blackboard on the wall, used to chalk up drinks, and the peacock pie alluding to costly pride were traditional elements in pictures of the Prodigal Son squandering his inheritance. Similar degree of extravagance is found in Ma's Self Portrait (in Celebration), 1966. <b>Giant</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> in those days, are up-market expensive seafood more commonly found in banquets and were not even served in middle-class family meals. The wearing {{of a pair of}} leader glove also shows off Ma’s wealth where in the 60s leader products are luxuries. As compared with his other portraits, where clothes were worn plain, Ma’s wearing of a proper white collar shirt, a green silk tie inside a red cardigan with a posh brass zips, together with a matching green overcoat and a freshly knitted stylish cashmere scarf would probably be the most expensive apparels that the artist could have mustered in those days. The orange wine was an imported one which was sold at exorbitant prices. The hand holding the wine glass {{is similar to that of}} Rembrandt but in reserve. The smile on Ma’s face, together with a pair of healthy red lips, a shining forehead, indicative of a robust and strong state of health. His pair of eyes was full of hope and contemplation for a prosperous future. Rembrandt’s drunken eyes and with a whore sitting on his lap, subtly, the picture has been interpreted as Rembrandt’s admission that he shares the original sin of all human beings - greed and lust. Ma did not see living comfortably and to enjoy good food was a sin. At that time, Ma had met a well off admirer who was then the general manager of the Bangkok Bank in Hong Kong who supported him and later required some of his paintings.

(2012) ’s conclusion points to the source of this incongruence: “However, it (COI) failed to segregate the different developmental stages to its corresponding life history stages [sic]”. If Kumar et al. (2012) intended to use a molecular technique to segregate individuals of P. monodon into different life stages, as implied in their objectives and conclusion, they took a fundamentally wrong approach; DNA characters are independent of life stage. We suggest instead, they focus on RNA and differential gene expression (e. g. Pérez-Porro et al. 2013). We can state confidently that increasing the sample size will not “reveal the efficiency of COI gene in pinpointing various life history stages of any organism” as Kumar et al. (2012) postulated.

A vessel buy-back scheme and other effort reductions were introduced to reverse this trend but, by the mid- 1990 s, the desired recovery of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> had not occurred. To understand the reasons for this, and with the support of FRDC, CSIRO began a 3 -year research project in 1995 to improve our understanding {{of the relationship between the}} spawning stock and recruitment in the <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> fishery. This project has examined data from the logbook system, collected new information from skippers on where they fish and their patterns of fishing, and developed models to assess the numbers of recruits and spawners, and hence the status of the <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> stocks...|$|R
