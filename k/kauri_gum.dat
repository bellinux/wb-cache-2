5|$|<b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>kauri</b> <b>gum</b> {{was found}} to mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used <b>kauri</b> <b>gum.</b> It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} gum, which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, <b>kauri</b> <b>gum</b> sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s, <b>kauri</b> {{timber and}} <b>gum</b> from Kaitaia {{moved to the}} coast through Awanui.|$|R
25|$|Kaiwaka {{became a}} trading and {{commercial}} point {{from the late}} 1850s. As the <b>kauri</b> timber and <b>gum</b> industries declined {{towards the end of}} the century, dairy farming became established. The Hakaru Dairy Company was formed to serve Kaiwaka farmers in 1902.|$|R
5000|$|Como {{had also}} been {{developing}} a reputation (reported in the newspapers of the time) for skilled boat building, with suitable facilities located on the south bank of the Georges River, also near where the future rail bridge was to be built. On Saturday 17 January 1885, {{it was reported that}} the [...] "Active" [...] - a large steamer constructed of <b>kauri,</b> spotted <b>gum</b> & ironbark, being 115ft in length, weighing 150tons, with 40hp paddle steam engines, was successfully launched at Como. She was built by Mr Harry Stephens for Messrs C. & E. Miller (one of the Illawarra Railway Line contractors) & was intended to carry railway materials from South Australian ports.|$|R
5|$|<b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or {{cracks in the}} bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly {{fell to the ground}} and became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually fossilising. Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of gum were exported. The peak in the gum market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, European {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in the Kaipara to fell and mill kauri trees and build boats for local requirements. Despite the perilous bar at the harbour entrance, the Kaipara became a busy timber port from the 1860s, shipping thousands of tonnes of <b>kauri</b> timber and <b>gum.</b> The first sailing ship wrecked {{at the entrance to}} the harbour was the Aurora in April 1840. The brigantine Sophia Pate was wrecked at South Head in August 1841 with the loss of all 21 on board.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{destination}} for settlers was the Northland gum fields where the young boys {{were sent to}} dig <b>Kauri</b> tree <b>gum</b> from swamps which until the 1950s was used to varnish wooden furniture and the likes. Here on these fields, as outcasts by the British Empire and called 'Austrians' because of the passport they carried they were looked at with suspicion. Mainly because they worked hard and fast in a gang rather who would share profits and send money back to their villages in Dalmatia. Many British settlers who worked the same fields resented the Dalmatian gum-diggers, whom they nicknamed [...] "Dallies", a term which is still occasionally used. On these fields as outcasts, they Croatian immigrants were thrown together with the other outcasts, the native Māori people who having {{many of the same}} view points and coming from villages themselves got on extremely well.|$|R
5|$|New Zealand's early {{economy was}} based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, <b>kauri</b> <b>gum,</b> and native timber. During the 1880s {{agricultural}} products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand. Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census, although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector. The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people. Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, <b>kauri</b> <b>gum,</b> and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>kauri</b> <b>gum</b> {{industry}} became established around Matakohe in 1867-70, {{possibly the}} {{first place in the}} Kaipara District that the industry developed amongst settlers. A flax mill was built in 1870, but it was not profitable and was soon converted to a timber mill. This was replaced by a larger timber mill in the 1880s. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1906. Matakohe held a race-day each February, in which were entries from as far as Kaiwaka and Waipu.|$|E
25|$|Ngai Tai {{along with}} members of other Hauraki tribes, lived in the Omana park area for many generations. The park was part of William Fairburn's Maraetai Mission Station which {{included}} a small school for Maori from 1837 - 42. Omana {{was part of the}} mission farm, developed from 1837. The forest covering the park and surrounding area was felled for timber by European settlers who cleared the land for farming during the mid-1840s. Kauri felled in the Maraetai hills behind Omana was hauled by bullock teams down to the sea and then floated to mills in Auckland. The Omana park area was also dug for <b>kauri</b> <b>gum</b> and even prospected for gold and silver. In 1852 following the discovery of gold in Coromandel many searched the hills digging shafts wherever quartz veins could be located.|$|E

500|$|The gum {{varied in}} color {{depending}} {{on the condition of}} the original tree. It also depended on where the gum had formed and how long it had been buried. Colors ranged from chalky-white, through red-brown to black; the most prized was a pale gold, as it was hard and translucent. The size of each lump also varied greatly. Swamps tended to yield the small nuggets known as [...] "chips", whereas the hillsides tended to produce larger lumps. The majority were the size of acorns, although some were found which weighed a few pounds; the largest (and rarest) were reported to weigh half a hundredweight. <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> shares a few characteristics with amber, another fossilised resin found in the Northern Hemisphere, but where amber can be dated as millions of years old, carbon-dating suggests the age of most <b>kauri</b> <b>gum</b> is a few thousand years.|$|E
500|$|Gum-diggers {{were men}} and women who dug for <b>kauri</b> <b>gum,</b> a fossilised resin, in the old kauri fields of New Zealand {{at the end of the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The gum was used mainly for varnish. The term may be a source for the {{nickname}} [...] "Digger" [...] given to New Zealand soldiers in World War I. In 1898, a gum-digger described [...] "the life of a gum-digger" [...] as [...] "wretched, and one of the last [...] a man would take to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{pieces are}} {{carefully}} heated with {{exclusion of air}} and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used {{for the production of}} cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and <b>kauri</b> <b>gum,</b> as well as by celluloid and even glass. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called [...] "true amber".|$|E
60|$|On this day, {{when the}} Duke's £500 {{was turned into}} the business, Sexty yielded in a large matter which his partner had been {{pressing}} upon him for the last week. They bought a cargo of <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum,</b> coming from New Zealand. Lopez had reasons for thinking that <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> must have a great rise. There was an immense demand for amber, and <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> might {{be used as a}} substitute, and in six months' time would be double its present value. This unfortunately was a real cargo. He could not find an individual so enterprising as to venture to deal in a cargo of <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> after his fashion. But the next best thing was done. The real cargo was bought, and his name and Sexty's name were on the bills given for the goods. On that day he returned home in high spirits, for he did believe in his own intelligence and good fortune.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the mean}} time {{the two men}} outside the porch were {{discussing}} their affairs in somewhat the same spirit. At last Lopez showed his friend Wharton's letter, and told him of the expected schedule. [...] "Schedule be d----d, you know," [...] said Lopez. [...] "How am I to put down a rise of 12s. 6d. a ton on <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> in a schedule? But {{when you come to}} 2000 tons it's £1250." ...|$|E
60|$|It is from Auckland {{that the}} <b>Kauri</b> <b>gum</b> is shipped. For {{a long time}} now about 8,000 tons of it have been brought into the town per year. It is worth about $300 per ton, unassorted; assorted, the finest grades are worth about $1,000. It goes to America, chiefly. It is in lumps, and is hard and smooth, and looks like amber--the light-colored like new amber, and the dark brown like rich old amber. And it has the {{pleasant}} feel of amber, too. Some of the light-colored samples were a tolerably fair counterfeit of uncut South African diamonds, they were so perfectly smooth and polished and transparent. It is manufactured into varnish; a varnish which answers for copal varnish and is cheaper.|$|E
