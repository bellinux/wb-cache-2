25|$|The {{industry}} {{reported a}} {{growth rate of}} around 10% from 1996–97 to 2000–01. After opening the sector, growth rates averaged 15.85% from 2001–02 to 2010–11. Specialised insurers Export Credit Guarantee Corporation and Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) offer credit guarantee and crop insurance, respectively. AIC, which initially offered coverage under the National Agriculture Insurance Company (NAIS), has now started providing crop insurance on commercial line as well. It has introduced several <b>innovative</b> <b>products</b> such as weather insurance and insurance related to specific crops. The premium underwritten by the non-life insurers during 2010–11 was 42,576crore (425billion) against 34,620crore (346billion) in 2009–10. The growth was satisfactory, particularly given across-the-broad cuts in the tariff rates. The private insurers underwrote premiums of 17,424crore (174billion) against 13,977crore (140billion) in 2009–10.

40|$|Extant {{empirical}} studies examine {{the effect of}} different types of partners on <b>innovative</b> <b>product</b> sales. Although these studies present ambiguous results, little research pays attention to the factors leading to this ambiguity. Therefore, this study investigates how technological capacity affects the relationships between different types of partners and <b>innovative</b> <b>product</b> sales. Based on a sample of manufacturing firms from the technological innovation survey, this study reveals several interesting results. First, for the sales from significantly improved products, technological capacity positively impacts on the links between the sales and collaborations with suppliers and also with customers, but negatively moderates with competitors and with research organization. Second, however, on the sales of marginally changed products, technological capacity negatively affects the collaboration with suppliers, but positively impacts on alliance with research organizations. These results increase understanding of the relationships between different types of partners and <b>innovative</b> <b>product</b> sales. <b>Innovative</b> <b>product</b> sales Technological collaboration Technological capacity...|$|R

25|$|RCA {{inherited}} American Marconi's {{status as}} a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded Radiotron in the United States. Especially after the rise of broadcasting, they were a major profit source for the company. RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which {{were significantly higher than}} in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of <b>innovative</b> <b>products,</b> ranging from octal base metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to miniaturized Nuvistor tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the cathode ray tube (CRT) picture tube.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{experts are}} advocating that the U.S. federal {{government}} launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics, strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation economic development initiatives, especially to strengthen regional clusters. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of <b>innovative</b> <b>products</b> and processes, a cluster development grant program {{would also be}} targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating {{in such areas as}} precision manufacturing, information technology, and clean energy, other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt, carbon footprint, and oil dependence. The U.S. Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative. In addition, federal grants in R, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to Japan, Finland, South Korea, and Switzerland in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to metropolitan areas, the essential engines of the American economy.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2014 {{survey by}} the UNESCO Institute for Statistics of {{innovative}} manufacturing firms in 65 countries, 85% of Brazilian firms are still at the stage of acquiring machinery, equipment and software {{to enable them to}} innovate. Among the other BRICS countries (Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa), the percentage varies between 64% and 71%. Some 17% of Brazilian firms conduct research and development in house, according to the survey, compared to 19% of Russian firms, 35% of Indian firms, 54% of South African firms and 63% of Chinese firms. Brazil is also the BRICS country which outsources research the least (7% of innovative firms), compared to one in ten in India and one in five in the other BRICS. Brazil also trails other Latin American countries. A much higher percentage of firms report in-house research and development in Costa Rica (76%), Argentina (72%), Mexico (43%), El Salvador (42%), Ecuador (35%) and Colombia (22%). Only 6% of Brazilian manufacturing firms collaborate with universities to develop <b>innovative</b> <b>products</b> and processes, a lower ratio than in Mexico (7%), Colombia (11%), Argentina and Cuba (15%) and, above all, Costa Rica (35%).|$|E

500|$|Facilitated by its flourishing textile industry, Oldham {{developed}} extensive {{structural and}} mechanical engineering sectors during the 18th and 19th centuries. The manufacture of spinning and weaving machinery in Oldham {{belongs to the}} last decade of the 19th century, when it became a leading centre in the field of engineering. The Platt Brothers, originated in nearby Dobcross village, but moved to Oldham. They were pioneers of cotton-spinning machinery, developing <b>innovative</b> <b>products</b> that enabled the mass-production of cotton yarn. Platt Brothers became the largest textile machine makers in the world, employing over [...] people in the 1890s, twice the number of their nearest rivals Dobson & Barlow in Bolton and Asa Lees on Greenacres Moor. They were keen investors in the local area and at one time, were supporting 42% of the population. The centre of the company lay at the New Hartford Works in Werneth, a massive complex of buildings and internal railways on a site overlooking Manchester. The railway station which served this site later formed the basis of Oldham Werneth railway station. [...] The main building exists to this day. Platts gained prestigious awards from around the world, and were heavily involved with local politics and civic pride in Oldham. John and James Platt were the largest subscribers for promoting Oldham from a township to a Borough, pledging £100 (more than double the next largest sum) in advance towards any expenses which may have been incurred by the Royal Charter. In 1854 John Platt was made the (fourth) Mayor of Oldham, an office he was to hold twice more in 1855–56 and 1861–62. John Platt was elected in 1865 to become Member of Parliament for Oldham, and was re-elected in 1868; he remained in office until his death in 1872. A bronze statue of Platt existed in the town centre for years, though was moved to Alexandra Park. There have been recommendations for it to be returned to the town centre.|$|E
