5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Palmer was {{appointed}} {{professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University. The same year saw the publication of her Animal <b>Ethics</b> <b>in</b> Context with Columbia University Press. Among reviews of this book were pieces by Bernard Rollin in Anthrozoös, Jason Zinser in The Quarterly Review of Biology, J. M. Dieterle in Environmental Ethics, Scott D. Wilson in Ethics and Daniel A. Dombrowski in the Journal of Animal Ethics. She has subsequently published papers {{on the theme of}} assisting animals in the wild—ideas discussed in her Animal <b>Ethics</b> <b>in</b> Context—in animal-focussed journals, prompting commentary from Joel MacClellan, Gordon Burghart, and Catia Faria.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen {{promoted}} the hacker <b>ethic</b> <b>in</b> {{opposition to the}} Protestant work <b>ethic.</b> <b>In</b> Himanen's opinion, the hacker ethic is {{more closely related to}} the virtue <b>ethics</b> found <b>in</b> the writings of Plato and of Aristotle. Himanen explained these ideas in a book, The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age, with a prologue contributed by Linus Torvalds and an epilogue by Manuel Castells.|$|R

5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal <b>Ethics</b> <b>in</b> Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal <b>ethics.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal <b>Ethics</b> <b>in</b> Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E
5|$|She has {{published}} three sole-authored books—Environmental Ethics (ABC-CLIO, 1997), Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking (Oxford University Press, 1998) and Animal <b>Ethics</b> <b>in</b> Context (Columbia University Press, 2010)—as {{well as the}} co-authored Companion Animal Ethics (Wiley-Blackwell, 2015) and seven sole- or co-edited collections.

5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> {{his works}} The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Televised {{hearings}} in early 1957 exposed misconduct {{by both the}} Beck and the Hoffa factions of the Teamsters Union. Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won the battle {{for control of the}} Teamsters. In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of <b>ethics,</b> <b>in</b> the wake of the scandal.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 Marcinkus {{graduated}} from the Kaunas Military School and received a commission as an infantry second lieutenant. From 1930 until 1932 he attended the Vytautas the Great Military Institute's aviation department and became a military pilot. While pursuing his military career, Marcinkus did not abandon his passion for football. He became a Lithuanian football champion three times. His team won the cup for the Baltic states' championship twice, and he played over forty games for the national team. Eventually, Marcinkus became a coach for the national team. He also wrote several articles about football and <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> sports. His many successes made him a celebrity in his home county. He {{is considered one of}} the best Lithuanian players of that time.|$|E

5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal <b>Ethics</b> <b>in</b> Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} <b>ethics.</b> <b>In</b> considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} cultures in developing a positive work ethic.

It further focuses on the factors that may advance positive work <b>ethic</b> <b>in</b> the public service. These factors are parental education, educational institutions, religious influences and societal values. The role of religions in developing a positive work ethic is divided into five sub-categories. These subcategories are African traditional religions, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. It needs the concerted efforts of all interested members of the society to develop a positive work ethic...|$|R
