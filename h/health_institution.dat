The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E

Information Technologies is {{a factor}} that {{take place at the}} center of the lives of {{companies}} and human lives and that have the greatest positive share in easing the lives.  While reaching information is considered to be the most important skill both for companies and people, the tool used in reaching and storage of information is technology. The development of the technologic developments in the world without slowing down, affects the service industry as well as all the other industries. <b>Health</b> <b>institutions</b> that have a great share in service industries have to follow the innovations and technological developments closely in order to survive in competitive market conditions and therefore they should make their plans in in accordance with these developments. In accordance with these statements, the aim of the study is; to search whether the information technology investments of <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> in order to ensure customer satisfaction and sustainability correspond to the future plans or not. For that purpose, <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> located in cities Gümüşhane and Trabzon in Eastern Black Sea Region, constitute the universe of the research. The data of the universe is obtained by survey data acquisition technique. Reliability and validation analyses were applied with definitional statistical analyses to the data obtained and the optimal scale structure for the structural model is attained. Goal oriented structural model is analyzed with structural equation model and AMOS 20 and SPSS 20 package programs. In accordance with the factors obtained as a result of the research it is stated that; factors such as information structures of the <b>health</b> <b>institutions,</b> information technology usage levels of the <b>health</b> <b>institutions,</b> information technology perceptions of the <b>health</b> <b>institutions,</b> the usage level of <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> during decision making processes and technology compliance of <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> are effective on the future plans of the <b>health</b> <b>institutions.</b> Keywords.

He was granted a second exceptional provisional release over the Christmas court recess. The trial chamber rendered its decision on 3 April 2008; not guilty. Defenders of Haradinaj, Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj have not taken a single witness of the defence to the stand considering that unnecessary. The prosecution was unable {{to bring to the}} courtroom three planned witnesses. One of them was committed to a mental <b>health</b> <b>institution</b> {{at the time he was}} called to testify. Another, Shefqet Kabashi, refused to testify citing the OTP's failure to live up to the conditions set for his testimony.

When Silas demands to see Texas in relation to possible information on Lynsey's murder, Texas visits him in the mental <b>health</b> <b>institution</b> where he is serving his sentences. Silas taunts Texas by explaining how he killed her sister India. He tells Texas that another young woman will die the following day.

40|$|Background: Information {{on health}} service {{utilization}} {{is crucial for}} planning, organizing and evaluation of health services. Objective: Assess perceived morbidity and examine the factors associated with utilization of health services by {{a sample of the}} population of the Amhara Region. Methods: Questionnaire was administered in 7 urban and 14 rural kebeles in four administrative zones. A total of 17780 people were included in the study. Results: Of the 200 reported deaths 118 (59 %) visited <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> for the killer disease. Over the two weeks period preceding the survey, 995 (5. 6 %) people claimed that they were sick and 38. 7 % of them visited <b>health</b> <b>institutions.</b> The most important reasons for not visiting <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> were believed that the disease did not need treatment in <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> (31. 9 %), bought drugs from drug vendors (27. 2) and visited traditional healers (20. 2 %). In multivariate analysis urban residence (OR = 2. 8, 95 %CI 1. 8, 4. 5) and educational status of head of household (OR = 3. 4 95 %CI 2. 1, 5. 5) were significantly related to utilization of modern <b>health</b> <b>institutions.</b> Teenagers and persons above the age of 60 were less likely to visit modern health services. Conclusion: There is a wide gap between perceived morbidity, mortality, and modern health service utilization. In addition to the problems of accessibility and illiteracy of household heads, assumptions that modern <b>health</b> <b>institutions</b> are not helpful for certain disease conditions appear to be the main reason for low utilization of health services.
