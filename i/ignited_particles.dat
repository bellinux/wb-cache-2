Over time, these oils can oxidize and turn rancid, causing the pipe to give a sour or bitter smoke. A purported countermeasure involves filling the bowl with kosher salt and carefully wetting it with strong spirits. It is important to not use iodized salt, as the iodine and other additives may impart an unpleasant flavor. Regularly wiping out the bowl with spirits such as vodka or rum is helpful in preventing souring. Commercial pipe-sweetening products are also available.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} a novel propagation mechanism of vapour cloud explosions. The hypothesis is based on the potential of forward thermal radiation from hot combustion products to initiate combustion ahead of the main flame front by <b>igniting</b> <b>particles</b> suspended in the unburnt gas mixture. The formation of such local ignition events may cause an augmented explosion. An experimental investigation is described in which a laser source is used to heat various types of particles in flammable butane-air mixtures. It is found that fine powders can ignite an adjacent charge upon irradiation. Ignition times are established for a range of particles with widely different characteristics (size, type, morphology, etc.). In particular, ignition times scales 100 ms could be obtained at an irradiance of 600 kW/m^ 2 using glass substrates coated with a carbon black. The relationship between absorption-emission properties of different powders is investigated further by determining particle temperatures under relevant radiation levels using time-resolved emission spectroscopy. Two different ignition regimes were observed, ignition temperatures appeared to be constant for non-reactive silicon carbide, while for reactive powders, temperature appeared to be not the sole ignition criterion. In response to the lack of radiation measurements for large scale premixed systems, a tool is developed for estimating the radiation flux emitted from such systems along with the corresponding level of irradiance posed on particles raised in the unburnt gas mixture. This information permits an assessment of the potential role of forward thermal radiation on the flame propagation. The comparison of such theoretical estimates with the experimentally measured ignition time data is vital for evaluation purposes. The analysis shows that the estimated and required fluxes are comparatively close and, hence, the proposed flame propagation mechanism is credible. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} results from {{experimental}} and theoretical studies aimed at elucidating the effects of particle pore structure and process conditions on the ignition of coal and char particles. A novel reactor combining thermogravimetric analysis and video microscopy imaging (TGA/VMI) was used for our combustion studies. By allowing simultaneous observation of light emissions from <b>igniting</b> <b>particles</b> and measurement of sample reactivity from weight-loss data, the TGA/VMI reactor was very effective in detecting and characterizing particle ignitions. Investigations of ignition mechanism showed that the ignition of char particles typically occurs heterogeneously, while coal <b>particles</b> may <b>ignite</b> heterogeneously, homogeneously, or {{by a combination of}} both mechanisms. Homogeneous ignitions were favored by high oxygen concentrations and close particle interactions. Other transient phenomena such as multiple ignitions of a single particle were also observed. A second hot stage reactor was also used for our studies to achieve heating rates as high as 1000 ∘C/sec. We found that chars prepared at higher pyrolysis heating rates ignited more frequently and exhibited higher reactivity when combusted at temperatures leading to diffusional limitations. Due to inherent differences in the two reactors, chars prepared in the hot stage at the same conditions as those prepared in the TGA/VMI exhibited lower ignition and reactivity behavior. Despite these differences, chars prepared at the highest heating rates in the hot stage reactor clearly exhibited higher reactivity and ignited more frequently. Mathematical modeling efforts focused on the coupled transient mass and energy balances governing the diffusion-reaction problem in char combustion. Changes in particle size and pore structure with conversion were described using experimental data obtained in our laboratory. Combustion kinetics were also measured experimentally. Theoretical predictions agreed very well with experimentally observed trends. Important char structural properties which favored ignitions were larger particle radii, more open macropore structures, and larger macropore surface areas. Process conditions which increased particle ignitions were high pyrolysis heating rates, high combustion temperatures and increased oxygen concentrations during combustion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a model based on fundamental experimental data to predict lean flammability limit, L, and flame propagation velocity, Sb, for oxy-fuel combustion conditions. The basic model system {{consisted of two}} particles. One side of the two particles burns first, then, the other <b>particle</b> is <b>ignited</b> by the heat of combustion of the one burning particle. This phenomenon was defined as flame propagation. We analyzed at what distance the first burning <b>particle</b> could <b>ignite</b> the next <b>particle</b> (flame propagation distance d, and related to L), and how fast the first burning <b>particle</b> could <b>ignite</b> the next <b>particle</b> (flame propagation time s, and related to Sb) under various conditions. The proposed model was verified with data of both fundamental and pilot-and actual-scale experiments. We also applied the model to develop burner systems for lignite-fired oxy-fuel combustion. Local Sb and L near the ignition points of the burner systems could be analyzed from the concentration and temperature profiles of the general CFD results (k−ε method). Flame stability was judged by the calculated Sb and L profiles, and past results of blow-off limits obtained with actual- and pilot-scale experiments. We call this proposed technique flammability analysis. By using combination with the technique and Large Eddy Simulation, we could quickly clarify points for improvement of the burner systems. The calculated results were applied to a DS®T-burner designed by Hitachi Power Europe, installed at Schwarze Pumpe pilot plant...|$|R

It is hypothesized that the first cloud was due to the evolution and reaction of tar, and the second resulted from low molecular weight, combustible gases.

40|$|This is {{the first}} round of studies to verify the {{technical}} feasibility of applying the Fuel-Slurry Integrated Gasifier/Gas Turbine (FSIG/GT) concept for thermoelectric power generation consuming high-ash coal (HAC). Such resource is, in most instances, considered unprofitable and usually discarded as a residue. This is part of a series dedicated to the application of FSIG/GT, which has already shown the possibility of increasing the efficiencies of conventional power generation based on sugar-cane bagasse and municipal solid waste (MSW). As before, a water-slurry of fuel particles is injected into pressurized vessels using commercially available pumps. Therefore, it avoids the cumbersome sequential or cascade feeding systems. In addition, the process does not need the application of pure oxygen or hydrocarbons to <b>ignite</b> the <b>particles</b> in the injected slurry. The slurry is prepared to contain fractions of dry-solid fuel near the limit allowed for the operation of slurry pumps. The slurry is injected into a dryer, from which the dry solid particles enter the gasifier. As the dryer and gasifier operate under similar pressures, simple rotary valves and Archimedes' screws can accomplish the transference from one vessel to the other. The produced fuel gas is cleaned to decrease its particle content and size as well alkaline concentration and reach acceptable limits for injections into standard gas turbines. Power steam turbine cycles are used to recover energy. Having in mind the low quality of HAC as fuel, the overall power generation efficiencies attained in the present study seem reasonable. Nonetheless, unlike conventional processes consuming HAC, the present one does not require de-ashing. Future studies will explore possibilities of improving the values achieved at the present instance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A rate constant of surface oxidation reaction of the bituminous coal at a temperature range between 800 K and 1400 K was calculated by an analysis of the ignition temperatures of the particles. The reaction order for oxygen partial pressure was 1. 0 and the activation energy was 50 KJ/mol, which coincide with published values determined by heterogeneous reaction theory.

Inorganic salts present {{on the surface of}} the soot particles may make them hydrophilic.

Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target <b>ignite,</b> producing <b>particles</b> of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.) Magnetic remanence, recorded in the iron oxide particles, indicates the strength of Earth's magnetic field when they were cooled beyond their Curie temperature; this can be used to distinguish magnetic particles of terrestrial and meteoric origin. Fly ash is composed mainly of silica and calcium oxide. Cenospheres are present in smoke from liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Minute metal particles produced by abrasion can be present in engine smokes. Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen. The silica particles have about 10 nm size, clumped to 70-100 nm aggregates and further agglomerated to chains. Radioactive particles may be present due to traces of uranium, thorium, or other radionuclides in the fuel; hot particles can be present in case of fires during nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl disaster) or nuclear war.|$|R

Combustion was characterized experimentally for micron-sized powders of both aluminum and magnesium. Particle size distributions were measured using low-angle laser light scattering. Optical emission of the burning particles was recorded using filtered photomultiplier tubes. Measured durations of individual particle emission pulses were assumed to represent their burn times; these data were classified into logarithmically spaced time bins. The distribution of the particle burn times was correlated with their size distributions assuming that larger size particles burned longer. It was observed that correlation between the burn times, t, and particle diameters, D, can be approximately described as t~D^ 0. 64 and t~D^ 0. 68 for aluminum and magnesium powders, respectively.

The ignition characteristics of char particles {{are an important part}} of the overall coal combustion process, and the aim of research in this area is to improve efficiency and minimize waste products and pollution in current combustors. The experiments were conducted using 158 - 210 µm diameter Spherocarb particles, and 200 - 300 µm diameter char particles from a bituminous coal. Individual charged char particles were suspended in the electrodynamic balance and heated by a 420 ms pulse of radiation from a CO_ 2 laser at a heating rate of approximately 4. 5 x 10 ^ 3 K/s. The temperature of the particle was measured with an optical pyrometer. The atmosphere in the electrodynamic balance was initially pure nitrogen.

40|$|A hybrid {{two-phase}} numerical methodology is used {{to study}} the propagation of explosive blast wave from spherical charges of TNT and their interaction with ambient distribution of aluminum particles. The presence of these particles is found to cause Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the contact surface between the detonation products and the shock-compressed air, which results in enhanced mixing and afterburn. The afterburn energy release is not observed to aect the primary blast wave, but aects the pressure decay rate behind the blast wave, and the speed {{and the strength of}} the secondary shock. The dispersion and reaction of aluminum particles in the hot region behind the blast wave is investigated for a range of particle sizes and mass loading, and the role played by these particles in the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities is studied. It is shown that for the range of sizes investigated, particle size does not play a signicant role in the mixing, but the distribution and initial extent do have appreciable impact. It is found that large <b>particles</b> do not <b>ignite,</b> while small <b>particles</b> rapidly <b>ignite</b> and burn completely.

40|$|New {{system for}} {{start-up}} and flame support based on coal gasification by low temperature air thermal plasma is planned to supplement current heavy oil system in Serbian thermal {{power plants in}} order to decrease air pollutions emission and operational costs. Locally introduced plasma thermal energy heats up and <b>ignites</b> entrained coal <b>particles,</b> thus starting chain process which releases heat energy from gasified coal particles inside burner channel. Important stages during particle combustion, such as particle devolatilisation and char combustion, are described with satisfying accuracy in existing commercial CFD codes that are extensively used as powerful tool for pulverized coal combustion and gasification modeling. However, during plasma coal gasification, high plasma temperature induces strong thermal stresses inside interacting coal particles. These stresses lead to “thermal shock” and extensive particle fragmentation during which coal particles with initial size of 50 - 100 m disintegrate into fragments of at most 5 - 10 m. This intensifies volatile release by a factor 3 - 4 and substantially accelerates the oxidation of combustible matter. Particle fragmentation, due to its small size and thus limited influence on combustion process is commonly neglected in modelling. The main focus of this work is to suggest novel approach to pulverized coal gasification under high temperature conditions and to implement it into commercial comprehensive code ANSYS FLUENT 14. 0. Proposed model was validated against experimental data obtained in newly built pilot scale D. C plasma burner test facility.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{combustible}} particle clouds is of fundamental scientific interest {{as well as}} a practical concern. The principal scientific interests are the characteristic combustion properties, especially flame structure, propagation rates, stability limits, and the effects of stoichiometry, particle type, transport phenomena, and nonadiabatic processes on these properties. The feasibility tests for the particle cloud combustion experiment (PCCE) were performed in reduced gravity in the following stages: (1) fuel particles were mixed into cloud form inside a flammability tube; (2) when the concentration of particles in the cloud was sufficiently uniform, the particle motion was allowed to decay toward quiescence; (3) an igniter was energized which both opened one end of the tube and <b>ignited</b> the suspended <b>particle</b> cloud; and (4) the flame proceeded down the tube length, with its position and characteristic features being photographed by high-speed cameras. Gravitational settling and buoyancy effects were minimized because of the reduced gravity enviroment in the NASA Lewis drop towers and aircraft. Feasibility was shown as quasi-steady flame propagation which was observed for fuel-rich mixtures. Of greatest scientific interest is the finding that for near-stoichiometric mixtures, a new mode of flame propagation was observed, now called a chattering flame. These flames did not propagate steadily through the tube. Chattering modes of flame propagation are not expected to display extinction limits that are the same as those for acoustically undisturbed, uniform, quiescent clouds. A low concentration of fuel particles, uniformly distributed in a volume, may not be flammable but may be made flammable, as was observed, through induced segregation processes. A theory was developed which showed that chattering flame propagation was controlled by radiation from combustion products which heated the successive discrete laminae sufficiently to cause autoignition...|$|R
40|$|Although {{diffusion}} {{is known}} {{to play an important}} role for gasification and combustion of large char particles, their effects on conversion rates, kinetic parameters and other relevant factors have not been thoroughly analyzed. Similarly, tar reduction is not yet well understood. Central to these challenges is the shortage of experimental data for reduction of tar and large char particles. Likewise, analytical models for reduction processes have not been systematically examined. In this study, large char particles between 1. 5 to 7 mm are gasified and combusted non-isothermally with initial temperatures up to 1000 degree celcius using various oxidants. Tar is also reduced with steam and vitiated air continuously and non-isothermally. In the absence of mathematical tools for large particle reduction analysis, models are proposed and derived in this study. Carbon and large near-spherically or irregularly shaped particles are modeled as large disk-shaped and spherically-shaped particles, respectively. One-film ash segregated core and random pore models are explored to analyze char reduction data and these are found to provide consistent and inconsistent results, respectively. Thiele analysis is also used and it indicates that less porous particles are consumed more externally at the surface than internally. For C + O 2 ⇒ CO 2 reductions, disk-shaped <b>particles</b> <b>ignite</b> when reactor temperature reaches 584 degree and these processes are purely kinetic controlled for 1. 5 mm thick samples. Reduction of spherically-shaped particles shows that O 2 enrichment as compared to a 50 degree celcius rise in reactor temperature substantially improves conversion. Oxygen enrichment with steam also significantly increases conversion of 5. 5 mm thick disk-shaped particle up to 600 % under identical reactor conditions. For C + CO 2 ⇒ 2 CO reductions, conversion rates increased five-fold when reactor temperature is increased from 850 to 1000 degree Celsius. Increasing initial reactor temperatures and O 2 enrichment provide an increase in char reactivity, diffusional rate, conversion, reduction rate and surface temperature. Most of the large particle reductions investigated here operate near kinetic-diffusion controlled regime. Calculated total energy released during combustion is within the range of Dulong’s empirical formula. At higher tar concentrations, CO and H 2 production moderately increase between 814 to 875 degree celsius...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of hydrazinium nitroformate (HNF) was studied {{in a hot}} quartz cell and by dropping small amounts of HNF on a hot plate. The species formed during the decomposition were identified by ultraviolet-visible absorption experiments. These experiments reveal that first HONO is formed. The HONO formation is followed by formation of NO 2. NO is not a "first" gaseous product. It is only detected if a HNF <b>particle</b> <b>ignites.</b> N 2 O is observed in the absorption spectrum of HNF decomposition gases. An intermolecular hydrogen atom transform mechanism is proposed to describe the HNF decomposition. This mechanism has similarities with observations in aromatic nitrocompounds. Absorption experiments {{have been carried out}} to resolve neat HNF flame structure at sub-atmospheric and elevated pressures (0. 03 - 1 MPa). These experiments were carried out in a window bomb with sapphire windows. The obtained absorption spectra were used to determine NO concentration and NO-temperature above the surface. The HNF flame was found to reach temperatures close to adiabatic near the burning surface. These high temperatures were reached with still considerable amounts of NO present (mole fraction > 0. 1). During the combustion of HNF at low pressures, yellow condensate was found in the window bomb. The absorption spectrum of a solution of this material was found to be similar to that of HNF. This indicates that transition to the gas phase occurs by evaporation or by ejection of small particulates (or a combination of both). A model for the combustion of HNF is presented. This model accounts for the three phases observed during the combustion of HNF (solid, liquid and gas phase). Yetter’s mechanism for nitramine combustion is used for kinetic calculations in the gas phase. The mechanism is extended by the proposed decomposition mechanism. The results of the model calculations are in agreement with experimental observations: NO-decomposition to N 2 and O 2 was calculated to be very slow. Species profiles obtained from Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF), absorption (CN and NH at 1 atm, and NO and OH at various pressures) and emission spectroscopies (NH 2 * and CH* at 1 atm) are compared with the model calculations...|$|R

Francisco Javier González Madariaga The {{expanded polystyrene}} (EPS) recycling technique exposed here consists {{in the formation}} of EPS wastes and gypsum-water mixtures with different proportions and under different conditions. One of the objectives for this thesis is to determine the components proportions for the gypsum-EPS wastes mixtures to be used as plasterboards and panels in construction also the work done here includes the determination of some of the new plasterboards and panels main properties. The experimental work at the new materials is the main part in this thesis. In the latest experimental section 14 physical and mechanical resistance tests have been done to 290 specimens. Among 68 different mixtures tested only 8 were selected and applied in 2 construction materials: one with similar uses to gypsum plasterboards and the other one with similar uses to a thermal insulating panel. The plasterboard mixtures have been produced with a main gypsum proportion and a reduced percentage of EPS wastes. From the plasterboard tests we know that plasterboards made of gypsum-EPS wastes are more prone to total water absorption (14 % more) and the new material is 23, 1 % lighter than the standard laminated gypsum plasterboards (10 kg/m 2) available in the market, both materials 12, 5 mm thick. The flexure resistance for the new plasterboards with EPS wastes complies the UNE 102035 - 1 M: 2001 Spanish Norm by more than 24 N. The fire reaction test developed here allows the research team to propose a Euroclasses level of B, s 2, d 0 for the new plasterboard materials because they show under a punctual fire attack a very limited combustion and a slow and limited smoke production with no <b>ignited</b> dropping <b>particles.</b> The impact resistance test of the new plasterboards shows that they exceed the limits by more than 2, 29 mm of the Spanish Norm mentioned before where the maximum impact mark diameter accepted is 20 mm. The mixture selected to by used in a thermal insulation panel has a high EPS waste percentage and a little of gypsum-water. From the insulation panel tests: they show a 20. 7 % mean of water absorption which is higher than the percentage accepted by the Spanish Norm UNE-EN 12087. The new panel has a density of 193 kg/m 3 which is superior to a brand new EPS panel's density (Type III 15 kg/m 3) this result is similar or superior to others researcher's publications who work on construction materials made of alike components. The EPS wastes-gypsum panel could be classified to flexure resistance as a BS 350 material (349, 9 kPa) according the European Norm UNE-EN 13163 : 2002 which is a higher level to a new EPS panel type III (15 kg/m 3) with a flexure resistance of 124 kPa, level BS 115. The thermal conductivity index for the selected EPS wastes- gypsum mixture was 0, 065 W/mK which is 12, 3 % higher than a new EPS Type I (0, 057 W/mK) and 66 % higher than a type III EPS panel (0, 039 W/mK). This is an original work which has produced several optimized mixtures of EPS wastes and gypsum-water.

40|$|The ceramic {{welding process}} is a unique hot repair {{technique}} for refractory linings in industrial equipments. This process consists of projecting a weld mix in powder {{by means of a}} current of oxygen or oxygen/air onto the refractory surface to be restored. The weld mix content refractory particles chemically compatible with the refractory to be repaired and a solid combustible (oxidizable fine particles, metallic and/or non metallic) as exotermic agent. When the combustible <b>particles</b> <b>ignites</b> at contact with the hot face (1000 - 1500 °C), an exotermic reaction with oxygen occurs developing temperatures of the order of 2000 - 2500 °C. The heat generated from this reaction is enough to melt the surface to be repaired and allowing a very close bond to be formed between the repaired area and the deposited material. There are limited data in literature about ceramic welding and the larger part of the information is protected by patents. Several differences between the available patents were detected. In this work, the principal aspects of researches about ceramic welding that had been relieved are present, including results and conclusions from a study accomplished about ceramic welding (design and set up of a test in laboratory, and evaluation of the reparations) for the reparation of silica bricks employed to build coke ovens. El proceso de soldadura cerámica es un atractivo método para la reparación en caliente de revestimientos refractarios de equipamientos industriales. Consiste en la proyección a alta temperatura de una mezcla de soldadura en polvo mediante una corriente rica en oxígeno sobre el material refractario dañado. La mezcla contiene agregados refractarios gruesos compatibles con el sustrato a reparar y un combustible sólido (finas partículas oxidables, metálicas y/o no metálicas) que actúa como agente exotérmico en el proceso. Cuando las partículas combustibles impactan en la superficie caliente del sustrato (1000 - 1500 °C), reaccionan con el oxígeno liberando calor y alcanzando localmente temperaturas de 2000 - 2500 ºC. Estas temperaturas producen la fusión parcial tanto del sustrato como de la carga de soldadura formándose una unión cerámica entre ambos. Existe muy escasa bibliografía sobre el tema y la mayor parte de la información está protegida por patentes, existiendo ciertas discrepancias entre las disponibles. En este trabajo se presentan los principales aspectos de las investigaciones sobre el tema que han sido relevadas, incluyendo resultados y conclusiones de un estudio desarrollado sobre soldadura cerámica a escala laboratorio para la reparación de ladrillos de sílice de uso siderúrgico...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} and ignition behaviour of {{the four}} major sulfide minerals present in the nickel concentrates smelted at the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter (KNS) has been established. These minerals are pyrite (FeS 2), pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -nS, where n = 0 to 0. 125), pentlandite ((FeNi) 9 S 8) and violarite (Ni 2 FeS 4). The characteristic behaviour of these sulfides has been examined using Thermogravimetry-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA) under normal oxidation conditions (l 0 ºC/min, air atmosphere). By increasing the heating rate to 40 ºC/min and using an oxygen atmosphere, the tendency of the sulfides to ignite was established. Ignition was characterised by a highly exothermic reaction which occurred in association with a rapid mass loss over a short time span. Significant overheating of the samples beyond the temperature of the surroundings was observed. Pyrite, pyrrhotite and violarite all exhibited ignition behaviour while pentlandite did not. Using Isothermal Thermogravimetry (TG) the sulfides were subjected to shock heating conditions (heating rate = 3000 - 5000 ºC/min, oxygen atmosphere) analogous to those which exist in an industrial flash smelter. The order of reactivity of the sulfides agreed with that observed during TG-DTA ignition trials. Even under these more intensely oxidising conditions pentlandite did not ignite. The effect of particle size on the ignition temperature was determined, larger <b>particles</b> <b>igniting</b> at a higher temperature. The magnitude of this effect varied according to the characteristics of the minerals. Products collected during Isothermal TG were examined by optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA). Using these techniques it was possible to establish the morphology of the products and hence, to propose mechanisms for the reaction {{of the four}} sulfide minerals under ignition conditions. In order to ++simulate the thermal environment which exists in the KNS, a pilot scale model of the reaction shaft was used. Nickel sulfide concentrates of varying mineralogy and particle size distribution were smelted under various conditions. The effect of larger particle size and increasing oxygen partial pressure on the reactivity of these concentrates was established. The products were quenched {{at the base of the}} shaft and collected for examination by optical microscopy, SEM and EPMA. Products ranged from unreacted to completely oxidised particles. The morphology and composition of these species were identified. Approximately 30 particles in each of 26 samples were examined with a view to establishing the frequency of occurrence of the particular product types in concentrates of differing mineralogy and particle size. This allowed proposals to be made regarding the fate of the individual sulfide minerals during ignition in the pilot scale flash reactor...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{energetic}} materials {{which are based}} on monomolecular compounds such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) have relatively low volumetric energy density. The energy density can be significantly enhanced by the addition of metal particulates. Among all metals, aluminum is popular because of its high oxidation enthalpy, low cost, and relative safety. Micron-sized aluminum particles, which have relatively high ignition temperatures and burning times, have been most commonly employed. Ignition of micron-sized aluminum particles is typically achieved only upon melting of the oxide shell at 2350 K, thereby resulting in fairly high ignition delay. Novel approaches to reduce the ignition temperatures and burning times and enhance the energy content of the particle are necessary. Recently, there has been an enormous interest in nano-materials due to their unique physicochemical properties such as lower melting and ignition temperatures and shorter burning times. Favorably, tremendous developments in the synthesis technology of nano-materials have also been made in the recent past. Several metal-based {{energetic materials}} with nano-sized particles such as nano-thermites, nano-fluids, and metalized solid propellants are being actively studied. The “green” reactive mixture of nano-aluminum particles and water/ice mixture (ALICE) is being explored for various applications such as space and underwater propulsion, hydrogen generation, and fuel-cell technology. Strand burning experiments indicate that the burning rates of nano-aluminum and water mixtures surpass those of common energetic materials such as ammonium dinitramide (ADN), hydrazinium nitroformate (HNF), and cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX). Sufficient understanding of key physicochemical phenomena is, however, not present. Furthermore, the most critical parameters that dictate the burning rate have not been identified. A multi-zone theoretical framework is established to predict the burning properties and flame structure by solving conservation equations in each zone and enforcing the mass and energy continuities at the interfacial boundaries. An analytical expression for the burning rate is derived and physicochemical parameters that dictate the flame behavior are identified. An attempt is made to elucidate the rate-controlling combustion mechanism. The effect of bi-modal particle size distribution on the burning rate and flame structure are investigated. The results are compared with the experimental data and favorable agreement is achieved. The ignition and combustion characteristics of micron-sized aluminum particles can also be enhanced by replacing the inert alumina layer with favorable metallic coatings such as nickel. Experiments indicate that nickel-coated aluminum <b>particles</b> <b>ignite</b> at temperatures significantly lower than the melting point of the oxide film, 2350 K due to the presence of inter-metallic reactions. Nickel coating is also attractive for nano-sized aluminum particles due to its ability to maximize the active aluminum content. Understanding the thermo-chemical behavior of nickel-aluminum core-shell structured particles is of key importance to both propulsion and material synthesis applications. The current understanding is, however, far from complete. In the present study, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the melting behavior, diffusion characteristics, and inter-metallic reactions in nickel-coated nano-aluminum particles. Particular emphasis is on the effects of core size and shell thickness on all important phenomena. The properties of nickel-coated aluminum particles and aluminum-coated nickel particles are also compared. Considerable uncertainties pertaining to the ignition characteristics of nano-aluminum particles exist. Aluminum particles can spontaneously burn at room temperature, a phenomenon known as pyrophoricity. This is a major safety issue during particle synthesis, handling, and storage. The critical particle size below which nascent particles are pyrophoric is not well known. Energy balance analysis with accurate evaluation of material properties (including size dependent properties) is performed to estimate the critical particle size for nascent particles. The effect of oxide layer thickness on pyrophoricity of aluminum particles is studied. The ignition delay and ignition temperature of passivated aluminum particles are also calculated. Specific focus is placed on the effect of particle size. An attempt is made to explain the weak dependence of the ignition delay on particle size at nano-scales. Ph. D...|$|R
