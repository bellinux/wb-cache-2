40|$|Using {{competitions}} {{to motivate}} students {{is a well-known}} practice that {{has proved to be}} successful. Nevertheless, grading students only through their results in the competition could unfairly limit the range of grades that each student can get: regardless {{of the quality of the}} different teams participating, one student must necessarily win the tournament, another must be second, and so on until the last place. In fact, player rankings are relative assessments that are conditioned by the performance of every student. In this paper, we propose solving this issue by making students do a code review before betting on the competition. By betting, the grade of students depends both on the performance of their own solution and the one they bet on. This way, grades represent not only coding skills, but also code analysis skills, widening the attainable range of grades and allowing for a fairer grade distribution. As a result, students that are not so proficient in coding are rewarded <b>if</b> <b>they</b> demonstrate <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> a good analysis of the source code written by others, which is a very valuable skill in the professional world. We provide a case study in an undergraduate course, showing positive results...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two innovations to geophysical inversion. The first {{provides a}} framework and an algorithm for combining linear deconvolution methods with geo-statistical interpolation techniques. This allows for sparsely sampled data to aid in image deblurring problems, or, conversely, noisy and blurred data to aid in sample interpolation. In order to overcome difficulties arising from high dimensionality, the solution must be derived in the correct framework {{and the structure of}} the problem must be exploited by an iterative solution algorithm. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated first on a synthetic problem involving satellite remotely sensed data, and then on a real 3 -D seismic data set combined with well logs. The second innovation addresses how to use wavelets in a linear geophysical inverse problem. Wavelets have lead to great successes in image compression and denoising, so it is interesting to see what, <b>if</b> anything, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for a general linear inverse problem. It is shown that a simple nonlinear operation of weighting and thresholding wavelet coefficients can consistently outperform classical linear inverse methods i...|$|R

Population decline will be facilitated by emigration, as Hong Kong people who <b>can</b> afford to <b>do</b> so move to countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens emigrated to these countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s, seeking political and economic security prior to China’s recovery of sovereignty over the territory in 1997. Many of them returned to work in Hong Kong after 1997, while holding overseas citizenships, when it became apparent that Hong Kong was still economically vibrant.
