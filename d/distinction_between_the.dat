5|$|Whereas some {{acronyms}} are logical, such as N3 (N for natural, i.e. {{observed in}} natural diamond) or H3 (H for heated, i.e. observed after irradiation and heating), many are not.

5|$|A key <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{bills of}} {{rights of the}} Commonwealth jurisdictions {{referred}} to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, any <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> M.D. and the D.O. professions {{has eroded}} steadily; {{diminishing}} numbers of D.O. graduates enter primary care fields, fewer use OMT, and {{increasing numbers of}} osteopathic graduates choose to train in non-osteopathic residency programs. An osteopathic physician (DO) is a fully licensed, patient-centered medical doctor. DO has full medical practice rights throughout the United States and in 44 countries abroad.|$|E

5|$|Jain texts make a clear <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic {{theology}} differentiates between {{soul and}} matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies {{contributes to the}} karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising {{the body and the}} passions.|$|E
5|$|Lacking Havok, Euphoria, and DMM, Krome's Wii version {{relies on}} the company's {{in-house}} physics engine. Some character animations may be ragdoll while others are preset; in developing the game, Krome tried to blur the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two. The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E

He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other.

5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. The <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> heavy {{infantry}} types {{began to}} blur, {{perhaps because the}} state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> heavy {{infantry}} {{types of}} hastati, principes and triarii began to blur, {{perhaps because the}} state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment. By the time of Polybius, the triarii or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the hastati and principes had become indistinguishable.|$|E

5|$|The {{idealization}} of Tamar {{was further}} accentuated {{by the events}} that took place under her immediate successors; within two decades of Tamar's death, the Khwarezmian and Mongol invasions brought Georgian ascendancy to an abrupt end. Later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match the achievements of Tamar's reign. All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E
5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created a <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as {{there is little to}} suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos {{described}} {{a new species}} of giant mouse lemur, the northern giant mouse lemur (M.zaza). Their studies compared the morphology, behavioral ecology, and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of specimens from both Kirindy Forest in central-western Madagascar and around Ambato in northwestern Madagascar, part of the Sambirano valley. Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, sociality, and breeding, as well as sufficient genetic distance to merit specific <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description {{was based on a}} southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
