5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a <b>division</b> <b>ring.</b> A field is defined as a commutative <b>division</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} form a commutative ring whose {{elements are}} the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers {{can be added}} or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a+b = b+a. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a <b>division</b> <b>ring,</b> because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3×a=1.|$|E
25|$|A <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> is a ring {{such that}} every non-zero element is a unit. A {{commutative}} <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> is a field.

25|$|The {{structure}} of a noncommutative ring {{is more complicated than}} that of a commutative ring. For example, there exist simple rings, containing no non-trivial proper (two-sided) ideals, which contain non-trivial proper left or right ideals. Various invariants exist for commutative rings, whereas invariants of noncommutative rings are difficult to find. As an example, the nilradical of a ring, the set of all nilpotent elements, need not be an ideal unless the ring is commutative. Specifically, the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring of all n x n matrices over a <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> never forms an ideal, irrespective of the <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> chosen. There are, however, analogues of the nilradical defined for noncommutative rings, that coincide with the nilradical when commutativity is assumed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> is a {{generalization}} of field. Division rings are not {{assumed to be}} commutative. There are no non-commutative finite division rings: Wedderburn's little theorem states that all finite division rings are commutative, hence finite fields. The result holds even if we relax associativity and consider alternative rings, by the Artin–Zorn theorem.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} conjugacy classes figures {{prominently}} in the classical theory of division rings. Cartan famously asked the following question: given a <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> D and a proper sub-division-ring S that is not contained in the center, does each inner automorphism of D restrict to an automorphism of S? The answer is negative: this is the Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem.|$|E
25|$|One {{may also}} define collineation groups for axiomatically defined {{projective}} spaces, {{where there is}} no natural notion of a projective linear transform. However, {{with the exception of the}} non-Desarguesian planes, all projective spaces are the projectivization of a linear space over a <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> though, as noted above, there are multiple choices of linear structure, namely a torsor over Gal(K/k) (for n ≥ 3).|$|E
500|$|Dropping one {{or several}} axioms in the {{definition}} of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a <b>division</b> <b>ring</b> or skew field. The only division rings which are finite-dimensional -vector spaces are [...] itself, [...] (which is a field), the quaternions [...] (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the octonions [...] (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of algebraic topology in 1958 by Kervaire and Bott / Milnor. The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the Hairy ball theorem illustrated at the right.|$|E

500|$|Modules are to rings what vector {{spaces are}} to fields: the same axioms, {{applied to a}} ring R instead of a field F, yield modules. The theory of modules, {{compared}} to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have multiplicative inverses. For example, modules need not have bases, as the Z-module (i.e., abelian group) Z/2Z shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as free modules. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a module over a ring which is a field with the elements being called vectors.
