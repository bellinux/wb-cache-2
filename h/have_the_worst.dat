During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E

Consequently, slums in all do not have consistently high crime rates; slums <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> crime rates in sectors maintaining influence of illicit economy – such as drug trafficking, brewing, prostitution and gambling –. Often in such circumstance, multiple gangs fight for control over revenue.|$|E

25|$|The 76ers, {{predicted}} {{by many to}} finish with the worst record in the league, had a 3–0 start that included wins over the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and a Chicago Bulls team with high expectations. However, the Sixers struggled mightily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season. The Sixers finished {{the season with a}} 19–63 record, the third-worst in franchise history.

25|$|Yolk sac tumors, {{formerly}} called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10–20% {{of ovarian}} germ cell malignancies, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> prognosis of all ovarian germ cell tumors. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half {{of people with}} yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64–91%.|$|E
25|$|Any {{motor vehicle}} built before the Euro {{emission}} standards were in force (called pre-E) {{is not allowed}} to enter the restricted zone (ZTL) from October 15 to April 15, as these vehicles <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> polluting engines and the weather during this period worsens air quality. This is a restriction in force in the entire Lombardy region since 2007. Cleaner vehicles are exempted from the pollution charge and there is free access for all vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays, except as noted above. The amount of the charge payable depends on the type of vehicle according with their compliance with the European emission standards, and there is a discounted annual pass for residents within the restricted zone (ZTL). The following table details the daily and annual charges and the type of vehicles that are exempted.|$|E

Just hours after {{being told by}} a psychic that {{she was about to}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> year of her life, her boyfriend Rick ran off with her best friend Melissa while Sophie was still {{pregnant}} with what she and Rick thought was Rick's baby. Soon afterward, she gave birth and discovered that the baby (named Robert) couldn't be Rick's child after all: he's half black. It turns out Robbie was conceived in a one-night stand Sophie had with André (played by Lyriq Bent in flashbacks), whom she met in a cab in New York City. At first, she did not have any contact with him and went as far as shredding his business card. But in the first season finale, he would later show up to see her, and upon learning that he was a father, he walked out on Sophie and left her devastated, only to return hours later to see Sophie with her ex-boyfriend Rick at her apartment.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September 2013, {{transfer}} deadline day, Barry was loaned to Everton in a season-long deal. He {{made his}} debut on 15 September in a 1–0 home league win against Chelsea {{during which he}} made a block on Samuel Eto'o which prevented a certain goal, later being named man of the match. Later in the month Barry became the 10th player in Premier League history to make 500 career appearances in a 3–2 win over Newcastle United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 victory over Hull City on 19 October; the goal was originally awarded to Kevin Mirallas; however, the goals panel ruled that {{en route to the}} goal, Barry was deemed to have got the last touch on the ball before it beat Hull keeper Allan McGregor. He scored a long range effort in a 2–0 victory against Norwich City on 11 January 2014. He became a mainstay in Everton's midfield during the season and forged a partnership with James McCarthy. Barry completed the most passes of any Everton player during his spell as he helped the club amass a club record of 72 Premier League points to finish fifth. Barry was booked 10 times during the season to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> disciplinary record at the club.|$|E
500|$|Having {{been drawn}} to face Gillingham {{in the first round}} of the League Cup, the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, planned to make a couple of changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season, with youngster Joe Mason {{included}} in the squad. Two first-half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round. Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half-time break. Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second-half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick, but they couldn't find an equaliser. The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance when he pulled his shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. The defeat extended Sturrock's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager, having won just once in nine attempts. [...] "I must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record of all managers in cup competitions, it's unbelievable," [...] he said. [...] "One or two of my defenders didn't defend properly tonight. It's not proper to name people but there were some glaring attempts to clear the ball and that's where we had problems." ...|$|E
