5|$|Field {{survey for}} the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an {{official}} groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place. The {{first section of}} the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run Gap to Thornton Gap. The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, Congress approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct Skyline Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run Gap. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{in the construction of}} Skyline Drive. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along Skyline Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes {{on both sides of the}} roadway, built guardrails and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for bituminous surfacing of the road. The section of Skyline Drive between Thornton Gap and Swift Run Gap opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge Bureau of Public Roads and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build Skyline Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton Gap at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of Skyline Drive from Swift Run Gap to Jarman Gap was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman Gap and Rockfish Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of Skyline Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of Skyline Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.|$|E

25|$|During {{his term}} as premier, Groza also {{clashed with the}} nation's {{remaining}} monarchist forces under King Michael. Although his powers were minimal within Groza's regime, King Michael symbolized {{the remnants of the}} traditional Romanian monarchy and, in late 1945, the King urged Groza to resign. The King maintained that Romania must abide by the Yalta accords, allowing the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union to each <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in post-war government reconstruction and the incorporation of a broader coalition force he had already organized. Groza flatly rejected the request, and relations between the two figures remained tense over the next few years, with Groza and the King differing on the persecution of war criminals and in the awarding of honorary citizenship of Romania to Stalin, in August 1947.|$|E
25|$|The Bahraini protests were {{a series}} of anti-government protests from 2011 until 2013. The protests were {{inspired}} by the unrest of the 2011 Arab Spring and 2011–12 Iranian protests and escalated to daily clashes after the King Hamad government violently repressed a revolt {{with the help of}} foreign mercenary forces (mostly Pakistanis) and a coalition of neighbouring Sheikhdom armies under the name of Peninsula Shield Force, however Oman and Kuwait refrained from sending troops or supporting Saudi Arabia and UAE armies in Bahrain. Iran is alleged by United States and others to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in the arming of Bahraini militants. The Bahraini protests were {{a series of}} demonstrations, amounting to a sustained campaign of civil and violent resistance in the Persian Gulf country of Bahrain. As part of the revolutionary wave of protests in the Middle East and North Africa following the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, the Bahraini protests were initially aimed at achieving greater political freedom and equality for the majority Shia population, and expanded to a call to end the monarchy of Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa following a deadly night raid on 17 February 2011 against protesters at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama, known locally as Bloody Thursday.|$|E

The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division, based {{in the town of}} Biên Hòa on Saigon's northern outskirts, into the capital.

[...] In the aftermath of the raids, Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned in protest, shaved his head like a monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India; Nhu ordered Đính to jail him.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr {{was known for his}} fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr's rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins' Phil Esposito, [...] "No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him if he needed {{to do it in the}} framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that's when you saw his truly great speed. Very seldom did he not get back to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in breaking up the play." [...] Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was [...] shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get from one end of the ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.|$|E
500|$|A New York Times {{article by}} Peter De Jonge {{explained}} that [...] "The West Wing is never plotted {{out for more}} than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because [...] "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: [...] "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time."

Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that [...] "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit".

500|$|On 30 May Ibrahim Pasha re-entered Jerusalem and {{the next}} day Egyptian troops {{attacked}} Beit Jala, a nearby Christian village. A reported 33 men and women were killed there because of their alleged involvement in the looting of Egyptian property. The purported revenge killings were halted by Ibrahim Pasha, but the residents' livestock was seized. The next day, over 1,000 rebels from the Ta'amirah tribe entered the adjacent town of Bethlehem to protect their families and the Christian inhabitants from potentially experiencing the same fate as Beit Jala. They refrained from directly confronting Ibrahim Pasha, however. Bethlehem's Muslim Quarter was destroyed by the Egyptian army and its inhabitants disarmed. This move was apparently a punishment for the killing of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha. Reverend William McClure Thomson wrote [...] "this terrible vengeance failed to quell the turbulent spirit of the people. They are ever distinguished in the great feasts at Jerusalem by their fierce and lawless manners, and if any row occurs they are sure to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in it." [...] The peasant rebels had frequently requested from the Christians of Bethlehem that they fight alongside them against Ibrahim Pasha's troops. The Christians refused, citing their religious beliefs and political status, and sheltered in the town's monasteries for safety. On 3 June, the rebels decided to attack the monasteries and looted the city. On 4 June rebels launched an attack on Ibrahim Pasha and about 4,000 of his men at Solomon's Pools near al-Khader.|$|E
