5000|$|Avery started {{building}} agricultural trucks in 1910. Early truck manufacturers were uncertain how to market their product {{and whether they}} should just be used to haul goods or should also be useful in the field. Avery described its truck as a 'gasoline farm wagon' and 'general farm power machine' for city, town, and country hauling. Their advertising suggested the farmer could use it to haul livestock, grain, hay, and other loads, as to pull plows, road graders, harrows, discs, binders, and other farm machinery, as well as loaded wagons. The truck weighed 1 ST and featured a four-cylinder engine, open cab and chain drive. Its wheels had wooden spokes and rims, while the steel tires were 1.5 inx5 in wide. [...] Avery figured farmers could get the most use out of the machines during the harvest season. Their tractor trucks included a large belt pulley that could {{be attached to the}} front crank shaft, useful for powering <b>grain</b> <b>separators</b> and other belt-driven machines. Early models had cast steel wheels with holes. Wooden plugs were driven into the holes to provide added traction. When the wooden plugs wore down, the owner simply replaced them with new wooden plugs.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Effect of weed, mineral and metallomagnetic {{impurities}} in {{the grain}} feedstock to micronization process was investigated. In laboratory and production conditions {{conducted a study}} on the influence of the impurity content in the treated grain, different size, density and metallomagnetic properties on the process of micronization. Trash content in feed grains of barley, wheat and corn according to current standards for grain must match the basic approach, and do not exceed 5 %, including mineral impurities - 1. 0 %. No restrictions on metallomagnetic and organic impurities. Dependence of the clearing of mineral impurities in various capacities device for separating stones was installed. Most effectively, 95 - 98 % grain (especially barley where these studies were carried out) allocated pebbles, i. e. mineral impurity density which is almost twice the density of barley. Lumps of earth, the density of which is virtually identical to the density of barley allocated a maximum of 70 %. Setting in the shop micronization <b>grain</b> <b>separator</b> and magnetic separator device for separating stones led to increase the reliability of the process equipment and process stability micronization.

40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} an infl uence of air stream fl ow rates in a modifi ed separator with vertical air stream on purifi cation and separation of selected grain mixture. An {{analysis of the}} obtained data on vertical air stream fl ow intensity revealed great variability of grain separation and purifi cation effi ciency. It was found that both air stream intensity and the way and rate of mixture supply into the working area of the separator had the largest infl uence on the course and effi ciency of particular mixture components separation (particularly of light substances). It was observed that precise regulation of air stream fl ow and its wide variability range allowed for an achievement of very good results of purifi cation and separation of the studied grain mixture. The obtained effects resulted in a positive evaluation of the proposed construction of laboratory separator with vertical air stream for effi cient separation of particular components of grain mixture.

The engine, like others in use thereabout, shed steam and hot water round it from every leaky joint, and kept Harry busy feeding it with birch billets and liquid from the well. There were sheaves to pitch to the <b>separator,</b> <b>grain</b> bags to be filled and hauled to the straw-pile granary, while between times we drove wagon-loads of chaff and straw {{bouncing}} behind the bronco teams to complete that altogether western structure. Its erection is simple. You drive stout birch poles into the sod, wattle them with willow branches, and lash on whatever comes handiest for rafters; then pile the straw all over it several fathoms thick, and leave the wind and snow to do the rest. When it has settled into shape and solidity it is both frost and rain proof, and often requires a hay-knife to get into it.|$|R
40|$|Sieving and air {{classification}} are not efficient {{enough for the}} extraction of the high-nutritional-value constituents of wheat. The aim {{of this article is}} to validate a simple electrostatic separation method of peeling and gluten, which are two such nutriments contained in finely ground wheat <b>grains.</b> The electrostatic <b>separator</b> is composed of metallic grounded belt conveyer and a rotating roll electrode connected to a high voltage supply. The electrostatic behavior of peeling and gluten powders was characterized using surface potential decay and direct charge measurements. These first set of experiments pointed out the conductive behavior of these powders: in contact with a grounded electrode, they lose their charge in less than 10 s. In a second set of experiments, mixtures of 50 % peeling and 50 % gluten powders were processed by electrostatic separation. Experimental design methodology was used to model the outcome of the separation process as function of two control variables: the high-voltage applied to the roll electrode and the speed of the belt conveyor electrode. In this way, it was possible to determine the optimal operational conditions for the recovery of high-purity peeling and gluten fractions...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{negative}} effects of climate change the time interval for grain harvesting under optimal conditions is becoming increasingly narrower. The dynamic growth of the Earth’s population as well as the use of species of increasingly greater yield necessitate the development of machinery capable of harvesting greater quantities over a shorter period of time. As a result of these developments, combine harvesters operating by new principles, first those with the axial and later those using the hybrid system appeared, characterised by a significantly increased throughput compared to their conventional counterparts. While operating hybrid combine harvesters, i. e. those equipped with an axial flow residual grain separation rotor unit mounted along the longitudinal axle of the machine, users experienced inability to fully utilise the full potential of the machines under dry harvesting conditions. The reason of reduced capacity {{turned out to be the}} excessive chaff separation, overloading the machine’s cleaning unit, thereby limiting its throughput capacity. The precise description of the grain and chaff separation processes in rotary residual <b>grain</b> <b>separator</b> systems as well as the clarification of the correlations between their influencing factors therefore emerged as important challenges in order to evaluate the operation of the equipment to assess its efficiency and to forecast the effects of possible design amendments on the work process.
