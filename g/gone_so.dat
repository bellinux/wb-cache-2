5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are <b>gone,</b> <b>so</b> {{he has to}} fight as a normal human, using {{a wide variety of}} weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País.

5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds {{in a game}} have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot {{late in the game}} in order to recover the rebound; a few have even <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as shooting off their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined not to be a legitimate scoring attempt.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses {{that had been set}} up by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had <b>gone,</b> <b>so</b> the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E

Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> early in the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was seriously}} {{weakened}} by five days hiding from NVA forces {{with little to}} eat. Following the instructions of the FAC controller overhead, he floated down the cold river and at about 2-3:00a.m., just as Norris {{was about to leave}} cover to pull Clark to shore, a six-man NVA patrol walked between them. Norris refrained from opening fire, recognizing this would compromise the covert mission and that they were outgunned. When the patrol was <b>gone,</b> <b>so</b> was Clark. Norris radioed Clark and instructed him {{to get out of the}} river on the south bank. On his own initiative, Norris left his team and on his own searched the river for Clark for several hours before finally finding Clark hiding behind a sampan on the riverbank. Norris was able to re-link up with the rest of his team and safely deliver Clark to Anderson at the forward operating base. Clark was transported to the last outpost on the Cua Viet River at Dong Ha by an ARVN M113 armored personnel carrier and then flown to Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 {{during an}} {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, King declared that, while Hanneman still had not {{been involved with the}} album, the band was waiting for label issues to be resolved before recording. King stated that he and Lombardo had eight songs that they were working on, as well. When asked about whether or not Exodus guitarist Gary Holt, who had been filling in for Hanneman during live shows, would play on the record, King denied it, saying that he would handle all guitars except for Hanneman's lead parts. King also said that Hanneman had yet to offer up any material for the album. Araya later contradicted King's statement about Hanneman and stated that Hanneman had been working on material for the album. Shortly after Hanneman's death, Araya revealed that Hanneman had <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to send Araya music that he had been working on, and Araya later said that some of this material—including an outtake from World Painted Blood—may make it onto the album.|$|E

5|$|The clade Oviraptorosauria is {{generally}} regarded {{as a group of}} non-avian (or non-bird) theropod dinosaurs, and their similarity to birds (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family Caenagnathidae have historically been confused with those of birds, and some researchers have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed Nemegtomaia to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to birds than to bird-like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult to delineate. Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to birds, together forming the group Paraves; oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs, and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called Pennaraptora, and this group is defined by the presence of pennaceous feathers (feathers with a stalk).|$|E

25|$|Over {{one million}} cases of acute {{salpingitis}} are reported {{every year in}} the US, but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness has <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far that it has developed chronic complications.
