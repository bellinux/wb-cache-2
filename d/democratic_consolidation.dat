30|$|Can {{economic}} structures predict political transitions? Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) {{in their}} book, Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, {{have proposed a}} theory of <b>democratic</b> transition and <b>consolidation</b> {{that is based on}} a country’s economic structure. The latter is defined as either land or capital intensive and though this view is different from ours, the difference can be easily reconciled. Among the economic activities located at the periphery of the product space are natural resources like oil, gold and land. Also, it is not incorrect to say that the goods/services located at the centre of the product space are capital intensive.|$|R
30|$|This paper first {{argues that}} the {{literature}} on external voting should {{pay more attention to}} the political context in which external voting provisions are adopted. Rather than focusing primarily on why States adopt external voting, more research studies should explore if and how external voting provisions are part of broader domestic processes of political change (authoritarian succession, regime <b>consolidation,</b> <b>democratic</b> transition). In addition, this paper calls for more research on the condition of implementation of external voting. More specifically, it suggests that the impact of voting procedures on the voter turnout is amplified in external elections due to the specific conditions under which the vote takes place.|$|R
