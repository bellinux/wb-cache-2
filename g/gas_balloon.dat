5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled <b>gas</b> <b>balloon</b> (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E

On 4 November 1909, as a joke to prove that pigs could fly, he put a small pig in a waste-paper basket tied to a wing-strut of his aeroplane. This {{may have been the}} first live cargo flight by aeroplane. With Charles Rolls, he would later make the first ascent in a spherical <b>gas</b> <b>balloon,</b> which had been made in England by the Short brothers.|$|E

He also competed successfully in an Antoinette motor yacht in the power boat racing events at the Monaco Regatta, April 1905, in association with his cousin Jules Gastambide and Léon Levavasseur, {{the inventor of the}} Antoinette engine. He then led an exploratory expedition with friends to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1906/07 during which he collected specimens for the Natural History Museum in Paris and performed survey work for the French Colonial Office. In 1908, his travels continued on to the Far East, before returning to France later that year.|$|E

25|$|Oswald Short {{was born}} at Stanton by Dale, Derbyshire, the son of mining {{engineer}} Samuel Short and his second wife Emma Robinson. In 1897, he took an intense interest in ballooning, after his brother Eustace Short had purchased, repaired and flown a second-hand <b>gas</b> <b>balloon.</b> The two brothers formed a partnership to design and manufacture balloons for fairground businesses, and made a joint visit to the 1900 Paris Exposition ('World's Fair'). There, they were inspired by the perfectly spherical balloons made by Édouard Surcouf of Société Astra, and they then modified their own design accordingly. In 1901, the two brothers constructed their first balloon, capacity 33,000 cu.ft, in premises above the laboratory of their brother Horace Short, in Hove, Sussex. In 1902, the balloon made successful flights, {{and in the same}} year Oswald and Eustace moved their enterprise to London. The pair made and sold gas-filled observation balloons, for customers including the government of India. In 1906, they moved their business again, to railway arches at Battersea, and flew balloons from Battersea gas works, including some passenger-carrying flights over London. Via contacts in the War Office and in the Aero Club of Great Britain (later Royal Aero Club), they went on to produce balloons of various designs for many notable people and events, up to and including the First World War.|$|E
