40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a com-puterized <b>exercise</b> <b>expert</b> system (CEES) that creates {{tailored}} exercise plans for older adults. A panel of experts was selected in the areas of medicine, exercise physiology, health promo-tion, exercise psychology, and gerontology. The experts com-municated with the principal investigator and the project members by mail, email, telephone, and expert meetings. A two-day workshop was held during the second year for the pro-ject members as well as local and national experts to review the CEES. The CEES demonstrated adequate inter-rater reliability (0. 80) and criterion validity (0. 70). Content validity was achieved by literature review and expert opinion. The CEES gathers information on the elder’s health status, clinical fac-tors, and exercise determinants that characterize specific barri-ers or incentives to exercise. The software program then develops individualized exercise prescriptions that are cus-tomized to older adults...|$|E

Each of the study treatments was administered 30 min before and immediately {{after a period of}} daily exercise, which was delivered by an <b>exercise</b> <b>expert,</b> for a period of 12 weeks. When compared with the placebo group, several indicators, such as waist and hip circumferences, were found to have significantly decreased in the test supplement groups compared with the placebo.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a common}} {{condition}} managed in general practice, but often not in line with published guidance. The ideal consultation for a patient presenting with possible OA is not known. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop the content of a model OA consultation for the assessment and treatment of older adults presenting in general practice with peripheral joint problems. Methods A postal Delphi consensus exercise was undertaken with two expert groups: i) general practitioners (GPs) with expertise in OA management and ii) patients with experience of living with OA. An advisory group generated 61 possible consultation tasks for consideration in the consensus <b>exercise.</b> <b>Expert</b> groups were asked to consider which tasks should be included in the model OA consultation. The exercise was completed by 15 GPs and 14 patients. The level of agreement for inclusion in the model was set at 90 %. Results The model OA consultation included 25 tasks to be undertaken during the initial consultation between a GP and a patient presenting with peripheral joint pain. The 25 tasks provide detailed advice on how the following elements of the consultation should be addressed: i) assessment of chronic joint pain, ii) patient’s ideas and concerns, iii) exclusion of red flags, iv) examination, v) provision of the diagnosis and written information, vi) promotion of exercise and weight loss, vii) initial pain management and viii) arranging a follow-up appointment. Both groups prioritised a bio-medical approach to the consultation, rather than a bio-psycho-social one, suggesting a discordance between current thinking and research evidence. Conclusions This study has enabled the priorities of GPs and patients to be identified for a model OA consultation. The results of this consensus study will inform the development of best practice for the management of OA in primary care and the implementation of evidence-based guidelines for OA in primary care. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Exercise {{interventions}} are often incompletely described in reports of clinical trials, hampering {{evaluation of results}} and replication and implementation into practice. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a standardized method for reporting exercise programs in clinical trials: the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT). Design and Methods: Using the EQUATOR Network's methodological framework, 137 <b>exercise</b> <b>experts</b> were invited to participate in a Delphi consensus study. A list of 41 items was identified from a meta-epidemiologic study of 73 systematic reviews of exercise. For each item, participants indicated agreement on an 11 -point rating scale. Consensus for item inclusion was defined a priori as greater than 70 % agreement of respondents rating an item 7 or above. Three sequential rounds of anonymous online questionnaires and a Delphi workshop were used. Results: There were 57 (response rate= 42 %), 54 (response rate= 95 %), and 49 (response rate= 91 %) respondents to rounds 1 through 3, respectively, from 11 countries and a range of disciplines. In round 1, 2 items were excluded; 24 items reached consensus for inclusion (8 items accepted in original format), and 16 items were revised in response to participant suggestions. Of 14 items in round 2, 3 were excluded, 11 reached consensus for inclusion (4 items accepted in original format), and 7 were reworded. Sixteen items were included in round 3, and all items reached greater than 70 % consensus for inclusion. Limitations: The views of included Delphi panelists may differ from those of experts who declined participation and may not fully represent the views of all <b>exercise</b> <b>experts.</b> Conclusions: The CERT, a 16 -item checklist developed by an international panel of <b>exercise</b> <b>experts,</b> is designed to improve the reporting of exercise programs in all evaluative study designs and contains 7 categories: materials, provider, delivery, location, dosage, tailoring, and compliance.

40|$|With the {{increase}} in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery there is a concomitant rising demand for training methods. The objective was to establish face and construct validity of a novel virtual reality simulator (dV-Trainer, Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA) for the use in training of robot-assisted surgery. A comparative cohort study was performed. Participants (n = 42) were divided into three groups according to their robotic experience. To determine construct validity, participants performed three different exercises twice. Performance parameters were measured. To determine face validity, participants filled in a questionnaire after completion of the <b>exercises.</b> <b>Experts</b> outperformed novices {{in most of the}} measured parameters. The most discriminative parameters were "time to complete" and "economy of motion" (P < 0. 001). The training capacity of the simulator was rated 4. 6 ± 0. 5 SD on a 5 -point Likert scale. The realism of the simulator in general, visual graphics, movements of instruments, interaction with objects, and the depth perception were all rated as being realistic.

40|$|PURPOSE The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} face validity and construct validity of a new virtual-reality-based simulator for diagnostic and therapeutic knee arthroscopy. METHODS The study tests a novel arthroscopic simulator based on passive haptics. Sixty-eight participants were grouped into novices, intermediates, and experts. All participants completed two exercises. In order to establish face validity, all participants filled out a questionnaire concerning different aspects of simulator realism, training capacity, and different statements using a seven-point Likert scale (range 1 - 7). Construct validity was tested by comparing various simulator metric values between novices and experts. RESULTS Face validity could be established: overall realism was rated with a mean value of 5. 5 points. Global training capacity scored a mean value of 5. 9. Participants considered the simulator as useful for procedural training of diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy. In the foreign body removal <b>exercise,</b> <b>experts</b> were overall significantly faster in the whole procedure (6 min 24 s vs. 8 min 24 s, p < 0. 001), took less time to complete the diagnostic tour (2 min 49 s vs. 3 min 32 s, p = 0. 027), and had a shorter camera path length (186 vs. 246 cm, p = 0. 006). CONCLUSION The simulator achieved high scores in terms of realism. It {{was regarded as a}} useful training tool, which is also capable of differentiating between varying levels of arthroscopic experience. Nevertheless, further improvements of the simulator especially in the field of therapeutic arthroscopy are desirable. In general, the findings support that virtual-reality-based simulation using passive haptics has the potential to complement conventional training of knee arthroscopy skills.

30|$|On a {{collective}} or group level, the knowledge creation process {{seems to be}} less certain.

Such collective consciousness may take on a form of cultural or world view, i.e., some taken-for-granted, implicit and consensus-based understanding of how one should behave in the domain group foresight context. The notion of expertise can refer both to the domain capability of a person, a group or an expert system.
