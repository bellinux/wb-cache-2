5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the traps erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to create an {{evaluation}} tool that would be the new standard for evaluating clinical competencies of interns in the field of orientation and mobility (O&M). Using results from previous research in this area, specific competency skills were identified and the O&M Clinical Competency Evaluation Matrix (CCEM) was developed. O&M university faculty were surveyed to gather content evidence. After revisions were made to the O&M CCEM, the evaluation tool was piloted with O&M clinical internship supervisors and validity and reliability evidence was examined. The combination of all the validity evidence supported the intended inferences. The content <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> experts in the field agreed that the O&M CCEM as a whole was representative of the content area. The internal structure <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> scores on the O&M CCEM could be interpreted as measuring clinical competency in relation to standard teaching skills, O&M specific skills, and advanced O&M instruction skills. The external structure <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> scores on the O&M CCEM are related to scores on the ACVREP evaluation form. The practicality <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the tool is useful for measuring clinical competence. In addition, the internal consistency reliability <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> there was consistency in ratings within dimensions and the inter-rater reliability <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> there was moderate consistency in ratings between supervisors...|$|R

5|$|Paleoenvironmental <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> {{between the}} 9th and 11th centuries {{the area around}} Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may have {{factored}} into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear. Photographic <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were {{constructed}} almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected. At one {{time it was}} believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.|$|E

5|$|The koala's {{geographic}} range covers roughly , and 30 ecoregions. It extends throughout eastern and southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and southeastern Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southeastern South Australia. The koala was introduced near Adelaide and on several islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range. Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia {{during the late}} Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by indigenous Australians.|$|E
5|$|There was mass {{unemployment}} among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably. In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.|$|E
5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E
5|$|Root form implants; {{the most}} common type of implant {{indicated}} for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited <b>evidence</b> <b>showing</b> <b>that</b> implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no <b>evidence</b> <b>showing</b> <b>that</b> any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success.|$|R

5|$|During the Eocene, rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} Eocene before spreading to Eurasia. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Thomas of Marlborough, {{who was a}} monk of Evesham Abbey, pleaded a {{case for}} Evesham before Archbishop Walter, and later, in his chronicle, he noted that Simon, John of Tynemouth, and Honorius, all canon lawyers from the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also {{described}} the three men as magistri mei in scholis. Surviving <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law. Thomas appears to have studied under Simon, John and Honorius at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, local clandestine {{treasure}} hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved {{onto the}} temple's walls. This discovery stirred {{the interest of}} Theodore Macridy, curator of the Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.|$|E

5|$|The crocodylomorphs are {{the only}} pseudosuchians to have survived the Triassic–Jurassic {{extinction}} event, 201.3 million years ago. During the early Jurassic period, the dinosaurs became dominant on land, and the crocodylomorphs underwent major adaptive diversications to fill ecological niches vacated by recently extinguished groups. Unfolding fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Mesozoic crocodylomorphs had a much greater diversity of forms than modern crocodilians. Some became small fast-moving insectivores, others specialist fish-eaters, still others marine and terrestrial carnivores, and a few became herbivores. The earliest stage of crocodilian evolution was the protosuchians, which evolved in the late Triassic and early Jurassic. They were followed by the mesosuchians, which diversified widely during the Jurassic and the Tertiary. Another group, the eusuchians, appeared in the late Cretaceous 80 million years ago and includes all the crocodilians living today.|$|E
5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Zhou dynasty divination was {{grounded}} in cleromancy, {{the production of}} seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E
