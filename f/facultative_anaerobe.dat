5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobe.</b> It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
25|$|The Oenococcus genus has {{one main}} member {{involved}} in winemaking, O. oeni, {{once known as}} Leuconostoc oeni. Despite having the name Oenococcus, under the microscope, the bacterium has a bacillus (shape) rod shape. The bacteria is a Gram-positive, <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobe</b> that can utilize some oxygen for aerobic respiration but usually produces cellular energy through fermentation. O. oeni is a heterofermenter that create multiple end products {{from the use of}} glucose with D-lactic acid and carbon dioxide being produced in roughly equal amounts to either ethanol or acetate. In reductive conditions (such as near the end of alcoholic fermentation), the third end product is usually ethanol while in slightly oxidative (such as early in alcohol fermentation or in an untopped barrel), the bacteria are more likely to produce acetate.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcus aureus (also {{known as}} golden staph) is a gram-positive, round-shaped {{bacterium}} {{that is a}} member of the Firmicutes, and it {{is a member of}} the normal flora of the body, frequently found in the nose, respiratory tract, and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobe</b> that can grow without the need for oxygen. Although S. aureus is not always pathogenic (and can commonly be found existing as a commensal), it is a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development there is no approved vaccine for S. aureus.|$|E
5000|$|Both <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> and aerotolerant organisms {{will undergo}} {{fermentation}} {{in the absence}} of oxygen, but the <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> will switch to aerobic metabolism when oxygen is present (a phenomenon known as the Pasteur effect). The Pasteur effect is sometimes used to distinguish between <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> and aerotolerant organisms, in the lab.|$|R
50|$|There are {{organisms that}} can adjust their {{metabolism}} to their environment, such as <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes.</b> <b>Facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> can be active at positive Eh values, and at negative Eh {{values in the}} presence of oxygen bearing inorganic compounds, such as nitrates and sulfates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{energy yield}} of {{anaerobic}} respiration and fermentation (i.e. {{the number of}} ATP molecules generated) is less than in aerobic respiration. [...] This is why <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes,</b> which can metabolise energy both aerobically and anaerobically, preferentially metabolise energy aerobically. This is observable when <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> are cultured in thioglycollate broth.|$|R
500|$|E. coli {{belongs to}} a group of {{bacteria}} informally known as coliforms that are found in the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. E. coli normally colonizes an infant's gastrointestinal tract within 40 hours of birth, arriving with food or water or from the individuals handling the child. [...] In the bowel, E. coli adheres to the mucus of the large intestine. It is the primary <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobe</b> of the human gastrointestinal tract. (Facultative anaerobes are organisms that can grow in either {{the presence or absence of}} oxygen.) As long as these bacteria do not acquire genetic elements encoding for virulence factors, they remain benign commensals.|$|E

2500|$|P. aeruginosa is a <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobe,</b> {{as it is}} well {{adapted to}} proliferate in {{conditions}} of partial or total oxygen depletion. This organism can achieve [...] growth with nitrate or nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] When oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite are absent, {{it is able to}} ferment arginine and pyruvate by substrate-level phosphorylation. Adaptation to microaerobic or anaerobic environments is essential for certain lifestyles of P. aeruginosa, for example, during lung infection in cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, where thick layers of lung mucus and alginate surrounding mucoid bacterial cells can limit the diffusion of oxygen. P. aeruginosa growth within the human body can be asymptomatic until the bacteria form a biofilm, which overwhelms the immune system. These biofilms are found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, and can prove fatal.|$|E

The presence of anaerobes affected these processes.

50|$|An {{anaerobic}} organism may be unicellular (e.g. protozoans, bacteria) or multicellular. For practical purposes, {{there are three}} categories of anaerobe: obligate anaerobes, which are harmed {{by the presence of}} oxygen; aerotolerant organisms, which cannot use oxygen for growth but tolerate its presence; and <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes,</b> which can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if it is present. Human muscle cells function as <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> during vigorous exercise and this creates a build-up of the byproduct lactic acid in the muscles, resulting in the characteristic burning and aching sensations.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the human cecal microbiota is poorly known because of sampling difficulties. Samples of cecal fluid from eight subjects were collected via an intestinal tube.

Total <b>anaerobes,</b> <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobes,</b> bifidobacteria, and Bacteroides were enumerated by culture methods, and the predominant phylogenetic groups were quantified by molecular hybridization using a set of six rRNA-targeted probes. The numbers of strict anaerobes, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, {{and members of the}} Clostridium coccoides group and Clostridium leptum subgroup were lower in the cecum. <b>Facultative</b> <b>anaerobes</b> represented 25 % of total bacteria in the cecum versus 1 % in the feces...|$|R
