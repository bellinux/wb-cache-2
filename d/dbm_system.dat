The Chireix power combining scheme {{can be used in}} Chireix outphasing architecture, which is currently together with EER and the Doherty amplifier {{one of the most prominent}} research topics in power amplifier linearization / efficiency enhancement area. In an outphasing system, also known as LINC (Linear Amplification of Nonlinear Components), an amplitude and phase modulated signal is separated into two constant envelope signals containing only phase modulation. The original signal waveform can subsequently be reconstructed by varying the phases of the two constant envelope signal branches, thus enabling, ideally, linear amplification of the original signal with system efficiency comparable to the efficiency of the used PAs.

Therefore, a direct modulation based frequency dithering (DMFD) method is proposed for nonlinear propagation compensation, namely the self phase modulation (SPM) and stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS). We found that DMFD method operates substantially different in RoF systems. The major difference is that DMFD signal frequency fd has to be much smaller than the RoF carrier frequency fRF; thus the condition of {fd <;<; fRF} has to be stringently obeyed. Analysis of the optical launch power (OLP) with DMFD method reveals that the SBS threshold is above ~ 6 <b>dBm</b> for LTE-RoF <b>system.</b> In addition, we also unfold that DMFD method does not induce an additional distortion for the linear and optimum OLP regions, which are frequency chirp dependent.

A new approach to suppressing the four-wave mixing (FWM) crosstalk by using the pairing combinations of differently linear-polarized optical signals was investigated. The simulation was conducted using a four-channel system, and the total data rate was 40 Gb/s. A comparative study on the suppression of FWM for existing and suggested techniques was conducted by varying the input power from 2 dBm to 14 dBm. The robustness of the proposed technique was examined with two types of optical fiber, namely, single-mode fiber (SMF) and dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF). The FWM power drastically reduced to less than − 68 and − 25 dBm at an input power of 14 dBm, when the polarization technique was conducted for SMF and DSF, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—An {{original}} {{approach to}} {{the solution of the}} nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is pursued in this paper, following the regular perturbation (RP) method. Such an iterative method provides a closed-form approximation of the received field and is thus appealing for devising nonlinear equalization/compensation techniques for optical transmission systems operating in the non-linear regime. It is shown that, when the nonlinearity is due to the Kerr effect alone, the order RP solution coincides with the order 2 + 1 Volterra series solution proposed by Brandt-Pearce and co-workers. The RP method thus provides a computationally ef-ficient way of evaluating the Volterra kernels, with a complexity comparable to that of the split-step Fourier method (SSFM). Nu-merical results on 10 Gb/s single-channel terrestrial transmission systems employing common dispersion maps show that the sim-plest third-order Volterra series solution is applicable only in the weakly nonlinear propagation regime, for peak transmitted power well below 5 dBm. However, the insight in the nonlinear propa-gation phenomenon provided by the RP method suggests an en-hanced regular perturbation (ERP) method, which allows the first-order ERP solution to be fairly accurate for terrestrial dispersion-mapped systems up to launched peak powers of 10 <b>dBm.</b> Index Terms—Nonlinear <b>systems,</b> optical fiber communication, optical Kerr effect, optical propagation in nonlinear media.

On the other hand, the radar front-end with the off-chip antennas and compensated differential bondwire interconnects achieves 9 GHz bandwidth and maximum EIRP power of 13 dBm. Experimental measurement results suggest that a compensated bondwire interconnect with total length of 0. 8 mm can achieve the above bandwidth and minimum insertion loss of 0. 2 dB. The latter demonstrates that the well-established wire-bonding techniques are still an attractive solution for millimeter-wave interconnects even beyond 100 GHz...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the performance of the}} portable Cortex Metamax 3 B (MM 3 B) automated gas analysis system during both simulated and human exercise using adolescents. Repeated measures using a Gas Exchange System Validator (GESV) across a range of simulated metabolic rates, showed the MM 3 B to be adequately reliable (both percentage errors, and percentage technical error of measurements < 2 %) for measuring expired ventilation (V E), oxygen consumption (VO 2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO 2). Over a 3 h period, the MM 3 B was shown to be acceptably stable in measuring gas fractions, as well as V E, VO 2, and VCO 2 generated by the GESV, especially at moderate and high metabolic rates (drifts < 2 % and of minor physiological significance). Using eight healthy adolescents during rest, moderate, and vigorous cycle ergometry, the validity of the MM 3 B was tested against the primary criterion Douglas bag method (DBM) and a secondary criterion machine known to be accurate, the Jaeger Oxycon Pro system. No significant errors in V E were noted, yet the MM 3 B significantly overestimated both VO 2 and VCO 2 by approximately 10 - 17 % at moderate and vigorous exercise as compared to the DBM and at all exercise levels compared to the Oxycon Pro. No significant differences were seen in any metabolic variable between the two criterion <b>systems</b> (<b>DBM</b> and Oxycon Pro). It is concluded the MM 3 B produces acceptably stable and reliable results, but is not adequately valid during moderate and vigorous exercise without some further correction of VO 2 and VCO 2. © The Author(s) 2011.

40|$|Radio over Fiber (RoF) is a {{promising}} technology capable of serving huge demands in the ever expanding wireless communication system. A {{number of studies}} have employed four RoF system architectures namely optical heterodyning, external modulation, optical transceiver, and up- and down-conversion for signal generation {{to solve the problem of}} system congestion. In this study, the millimeter-wave (mmwave) frequency band has been identified in resolving the congestion problem. In particular an up-conversion RoF system architecture which uses a Remote Optical Local Oscillator (ROLO) is proposed. The optical signal, generated using a 10 GHz radio frequency (RF) signal utilises the Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) technique at the Central Station (CS). At the Base Station (BS), this signal is used to up-convert a modulated intermediate frequency (IF) signal by using a microwave mixer. The mixer is developed using a Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) as its main active component due to its high internal gain. In addition, the mixer also functions as the frequency conversion stage. This study discovered that the proposed RoF-ROLO system is effective in reducing the dispersion effect which normally restricts the performance of mm-wave RoF system, in which the frequency conversion is done at the BS. The system was designed and simulated using the OptiSystem software for up to 40 GHz mm-wave carrier. Besides, the HBT mixer configuration has been successfully modelled and simulated using Microwave Office (MWO) software. Verification was carried through real-time measurement. The simulated conversion gain of the mixer achieved ranges between 2. 11 dB to 7. 97 dB for modulated IF input power ranging from - 30 dBm to - 10 dBm, respectively. These values were obtained by fixing the Local Oscillator (LO) power to 0 <b>dBm.</b> Moreover, the <b>system</b> has practically up-converted RF signal at 12. 92 GHz. The new configuration between the SBS mm-wave signal generation with the up-conversion technique has been found to be practical by omitting the necessity of mm-wave LO at the BS; yet the frequency conversion still can be done at the BS...|$|R
