40|$|Relationship between track {{alignment}} <b>irregularity</b> <b>and</b> car body horizontal vibration acceleration is analyzed by using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Actual measured alignment <b>irregularity</b> <b>and</b> car body horizontal vibration acceleration are decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain intrinsic mode function (IMF). By comparing IMF waveform and energy {{spectrum of the}} <b>irregularity</b> <b>and</b> vibration acceleration, there is the definitive correspondence of IMFs, and the adverse section of irregularity can be identified from car body horizontal vibration acceleration. Finally, regression analysis is taken for measured sample of track inspection car on Beijing-Guangzhou line; the quantitative relationship between {{track alignment}} <b>irregularity</b> <b>and</b> car body horizontal vibration acceleration is established with a wavelength between 1. 5 m and 50 m...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the efficacy of treatment acceptance and commitment therapy based on cognitive emotion regulation strategies on the sensitivity of anxiety, excitement <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> efficacy in patients with chronic headache disorder. For this purpose, in a single subject multiple baselines pre-test and posttest and follow-upin two groups, 3 patients with chronic pain who were referred to health centers in Kerman using the sampling method Selected and randomly divided and were assigned into two experimental groups. The group initially sensitivity of anxiety, excitement <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy were tested. The training is based on acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were presented and then after completing the training program and follow-upperiod, both in terms of sensitivity, anxiety, excitement <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy were tested. Results: Analysis of data by the method of Cohen's effect size indicators was showed that acceptance and commitment therapy based on reducing anxiety sensitivity, excitement <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> increase self-efficacy in disarray and the treatment based on cognitive emotion regulation strategies has not affecting on reducing anxiety sensitivity <b>and</b> excitement <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> the self-efficacy. The cognitive and behavioral intervention (acceptance and commitment cognitive emotion regulation) was significant in reducing anxiety sensitivity <b>and</b> excitement <b>irregularities</b> of migraine headaches and tension...|$|R

30|$|Here, we have {{separated}} the plots {{in the figure}} into two parts in four rows. Plots {{in the first and}} the third row are the monthly occurrences of <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> OLRs. The bar chart shows the number of days in a month for the OLR occurrence, and the red dotted line shows the irregularity occurrence rate. For the plots in the second and the fourth rows, linear regression of the monthly occurrences between the <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> OLRs in a longitude sector is shown. The linear regression analyses indicate that the African, South American, and Atlantic sectors have positive correlations between the <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> OLRs, while the Indian, West Pacific, Central Pacific, and East Pacific sectors have a negative correlation.|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of spectral broadening on anisotropic electron-density <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> velocity {{fluctuations in the}} solar wind is investigated {{on the basis of}} results for a second moment mutual coherence function obtained by a parabolic-equation method. It is found that although anisotropic <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> wind-velocity fluctuations decrease the bandwidth of the spectrum relative to that for isotropic <b>irregularities</b> <b>and</b> no velocity fluctuations, the shape of the spectrum remains unchanged. Examination of the frequency dependence and shape of a computed angular spectrum indicates that the electron-density spectrum is consistent with a power law having a spectral index close to the value appropriate for the Kolmogorov spectrum. It is proposed that multiple-station observations of some total field be employed to measure the solar wind...|$|R
