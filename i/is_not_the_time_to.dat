500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do it.... Give me a few days. Give me {{to the end of the}} week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

[...] Or the teacher invites the students into their mind to witness their thought process, how it is done and how decisions are made during the task.

2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to play the Reds, dropping the opener 6-4 when Dee Gordon committed a costly error {{in the seventh inning}} with the game tied, leading to four runs scoring. The Dodgers wasted a fine start by Kershaw on June 15 as the Scott Elbert allowed a go-ahead eighth-inning single to Joey Votto and the Reds won 3-2. Scott Rolen got three hits and drove in three runs as the Reds finished off their sweep of the Dodgers 7-2. The slumping Dodgers were subsequently handled by Houston starter Brett Myers, who retired 17 consecutive batters at one point and made only 98 pitches in a 7-3 Astros win. The Dodgers home losing streak hit five when they were shut out by the Astros 7-0 on June 18. The game was doubly frustrating because starting catcher Rod Barajas suffered an ankle strain in the second inning and joined the multitude of Dodgers already on the disabled list. Manager Don Mattingly said after the game, [...] "We're frustrated, that's for sure, but you know what? We don't have time to be frustrated... This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> feel sorry for ourselves." [...] The Dodgers avoided being swept by the last place Astros with a 1-0 victory on June 19, that ended the five-game losing streak. A solo homer by Dioner Navarro {{in the bottom of the}} 8th inning was all the Dodgers offense could muster, but it was enough as Hiroki Kuroda and two relievers pitched a shutout. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw was dominant, striking out 11 in a two-hit shutout of the Detroit Tigers. He also hit a two-run eighth-inning single to extended the Dodgers lead in the 4-0 win. Chad Billingsley's turn was next and he also pitched effectively, allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won their third straight, 6-1, over the Tigers. Matt Kemp reached base all five times he came up to bat in the series finale, with three hits (including a triple) and two walks but the Dodgers were done in by four home runs hit by the Tigers off of Ted Lilly in the 7-5 loss. The Los Angeles Angels came to town next for the next installment of the Freeway Series. In the opener, the Angels won a sloppy game with baserunning and fielding errors 8-3. [...] "I don't like the way it's going, thats for sure." [...] Manager Don Mattingly said after the Dodgers lost 6-1 in game 2. The Dodgers bounced back to take the series finale 3-2. Clayton Kershaw struck out eleven in the game and pitched his second straight complete game, the first Dodger to do so in 11 years. Tony Gwynn, Jr.'s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth won it for the Dodgers.|$|E
