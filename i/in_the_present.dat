30|$|Other {{sensitivity}} tests {{also were}} implemented {{according to the}} importance of criteria. Based on all these tests and the way it is observed in Figs.  3, 4, 5 and 6, the sensitivity of the alternatives {{to the importance of}} criteria is more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> method rather than in Chen’s method. In fact, influence of the importance of criteria on ranking of the options is more intense <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> method. According to Figs.  4, 5, 6 and 7 and other implemented tests, in Chen’s method, changing the importance of criteria does not have influence on the rank of alternatives A and B and alternative A is always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1 st rank, as alternative B is always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last rank (4 th rank). But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> method, alternatives ranking always change with changing the importance level of criteria, and <b>in</b> each test, <b>the</b> alternative occupying 1 st rank is different. After local survey and group discussion on options’ ranks in each test, it was shown that <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> method has a better function <b>in</b> introducing <b>the</b> alternative with 1 st rank (the selected alternative) as well as ranking other alternatives.|$|R
