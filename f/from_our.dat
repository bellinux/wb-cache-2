5|$|It is {{important}} for us, my brothers, that we exterminate <b>from</b> <b>our</b> lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us.

Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.|$|E

5|$|The {{estimated}} {{distance of}} the Andromeda Galaxy <b>from</b> <b>our</b> own was doubled in 1953 when {{it was discovered that}} there is another, dimmer type of Cepheid. In the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.|$|E
5|$|I {{hope that}} {{all the people who}} see us will be happy in knowing that we, despite being prisoners, {{we were able to do}} this. Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away <b>from</b> <b>our</b> problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E

5|$|Lambda Tucanae is {{an optical}} double—that is, {{the name is}} given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear close {{together}} <b>from</b> <b>our</b> viewpoint, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda1 is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of spectral type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Malhotra {{started playing}} {{organized}} hockey {{at the age}} of seven. He attended John Fraser Secondary School in Mississauga before graduating <b>from</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Lourdes in Guelph, Ontario. Malhotra moved to Guelph to begin his OHL career with the Guelph Storm, during which time he was awarded the Bobby Smith Trophy as the OHL's scholastic player of the year in 1998. He has referred to it as the award he is most proud of in his hockey career. In 2009, he received the National Leadership Award in a ceremony at his former high school in Guelph.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and {{wanted to see how}} that film was received before committing to Our Friends in the North. When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew <b>from</b> <b>Our</b> Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E

5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road <b>from</b> <b>our</b> studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
