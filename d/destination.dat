When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time.

In contrast to the previous film, which was a direct sequel to the original, Final <b>Destination</b> 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel, with the idea of featuring a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster coming from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan placed control as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005, with Winstead and Merriman landing the lead roles, and concluded in April. Final <b>Destination</b> 3 was filmed in Vancouver, as with the previous two installments, over a three-month period; the first two weeks were spent entirely on filming the roller-coaster's derailment.|$|E

5|$|Final <b>Destination</b> 3 is a 2006 American supernatural horror film {{directed}} by James Wong {{and the third}} installment in the Final <b>Destination</b> film series. The screenplay was written by Wong and Glen Morgan, both of whom had worked on the franchise's first film in 2000. Final <b>Destination</b> 3 stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, and is set {{five years after the}} first film. Winstead plays Wendy Christensen, a teenager who has a premonition that a roller coaster on which she and her classmates are riding derails. Although she saves some of them, Death begins hunting for the survivors. Wendy realizes the photos she took in the amusement park contain clues about how her classmates will die, and tries to use them to save the rest of the survivors and foil Death's design.|$|E
5|$|Final <b>Destination</b> 3 {{received}} a mixed response; some critics {{felt that the}} film was formulaic and did not bring anything new to the franchise while others praised it for being enjoyable and offering its audience what it wishes to see. Attention was given especially to death scenes involving a tanning bed and a nail gun respectively; these were favorably received, as was Winstead's performance. The film was a financial success and, {{at the time of}} its release, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise. The film was followed by two sequels‚ÄîThe Final <b>Destination</b> and Final <b>Destination</b> 5‚Äîreleased in 2009 and 2011, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Final <b>Destination</b> 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final <b>Destination</b> 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final <b>Destination</b> 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final <b>Destination,</b> or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

30|$|The Current Population Surveys, {{the data}} we use, {{do not allow}} us to {{determine}} whether migration is for family reunion or driven by economic opportunities. Because newer <b>destinations</b> have fewer Mexicans it is less likely that migration to these <b>destinations</b> if for family reunion. We estimated the difference in years since migration between the earliest arriving household member and the newly arrived Mexican immigrants (in the US for less than 5 ¬†years) at the three destinations: the average difference was eight years for new immigrants at the traditional <b>destinations,</b> six years for new Mexican immigrants at the new high-growth <b>destinations,</b> and four years for Mexican migrants at the new low-growth <b>destinations.</b> Further, we find that 44 % of Mexicans at new low-growth <b>destinations</b> live in households where there are no earlier arrivals; the corresponding proportions are 33 % for Mexicans at the traditional <b>destinations</b> and 36 % for Mexicans at the new high-growth <b>destinations.</b> These data provide some credence to our hypothesis that family reunion is less important in Mexican migration to new <b>destinations,</b> in particular new low-growth <b>destinations.</b>|$|R
