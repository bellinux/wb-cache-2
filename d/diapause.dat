5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult <b>diapause,</b> a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult <b>diapause</b> {{is the most common}} form of <b>diapause</b> in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This <b>diapause</b> is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter <b>diapause</b> (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Different amylase enzymes were {{identified}} by analysis of digestive fluid and haemolymph in <b>diapausing</b> and nondiapausing strains of silkworm, Bombyx mori. The <b>diapausing</b> strain showed negligible digestive amylase activity at a pH range of 3 - 11, while the nondiapausing strain registered strikingly higher amylase activity at pH 9. 2. Higher levels of undigested starch {{was found in the}} faecal matter of the <b>diapausing</b> strain, which is consistent with the negligible digestive amylase activity. Developmental specific expression of haemolymph amylase activity was seen in nondiapausing and <b>diapausing</b> strains. In the nondiapausing strain the digestive amylase activity was at its peak during intermoult and depressed during moult.

Thermal treatments are gaining acceptance to replace chemical fumigation. Determining the most thermal-tolerant life stage {{is essential in}} the development of effective postharvest insect control protocols based on thermal energy. A heating block system was used to evaluate relative heat resistance of five different life stages of codling moth: white-ring eggs, black-head eggs, third-instar, fifth-instar, and <b>diapausing</b> larvae, at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The fifth-instar was the most heat-resistant life stage in the tested temperature range of 50 – 52 C except for <b>diapausing</b> larvae. Thermal death kinetic data of <b>diapausing</b> fifth-instar larvae were determined and also compared with the published TDT curve of non-diapausing larvae using the same heating block system. Both <b>diapausing</b> and non-diapausing larvae were dead after treatments at 50 C for 5 min and 52 C for 2 min.

40|$|<b>Diapausing</b> Culex pipiens L. females fed 10 % sucrose for 7 d {{following}} eclosion contained {{significantly more}} lipids (P < 0. 05) than nondiapausing females reared and maintained {{at the same}} temperature (22 °C) but at a longer photophase (14 : 10 [L:D] instead of 9 : 15). <b>Diapausing</b> females with limited lipid reserves failed to increase their reserves after blood feeding. The average lipid content of 56 females tested decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) by day 6 after feeding {{and there was no}} correlation (r = − 0. 06) between lipid content at this time and original bloodmeal volumes of individual females. These results refute the contention that blood meals taken by <b>diapausing</b> Cx. pipiens result in fat body development when females are incubated at 18 °C during bloodmeal digestion. <b>Diapausing</b> Cx. pipiens with limited lipid reserves were unable to obtain sufficient energy from a single blood meal to survive extended hibernation.

40|$|Reproduction, {{hatching}} {{success and}} population {{dynamics of the}} dominant copepod Acartia steueri were studied in Sagami Bay, Japan from February 2002 to December 2003.

Population egg production rate (EPR) increased with the abundance of adult males and females from February and reached maximum in June. However, planktonic population of A. steueri did not increase during summer to winter because <b>diapausing</b> eggs occupied a great part of their reproduction (～ 98 %). Recruitment rates in October to December 2002 and September 2003 were higher than population EPR, implying that <b>diapausing</b> eggs of A. steueri had a key role to support the recruitment into water column when the reproductive ability of the population diminished rather than to contribute to an increase of the planktonic population rapidly in their favorable seasons...|$|R

5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, go through a <b>diapause</b> (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring.

5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} <b>diapause</b> and finds a {{suitable}} place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (<b>diapause),</b> generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E
40|$|<b>Diapausing</b> egg {{banks are}} {{reservoirs}} of ecological and genetic diversity in continental zooplankton. However, although habitat size {{has often been}} used as a proxy for population size, the relationship between <b>diapausing</b> egg bank size and genetic diversity has not been explicitly tested in zooplankton. We estimated the density and size of <b>diapausing</b> egg banks, habitat size and genetic diversity (for mitochondrial and nuclear markers) of 14 populations of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis in an endorheic basin in the SE Iberian Peninsula. The size of B. plicatilis <b>diapausing</b> egg banks ranged across eight orders of magnitude (from 257 to 4. 9 × 1010 eggs). Despite the small geographical scale, populations were strongly structured genetically, but with no evidence of isolation by distance. Habitat size (lake area) was a better predictor of genetic diversity than total <b>diapausing</b> egg bank size, but only for mtDNA haplotype diversity. However, as these results were driven by the strong effect of the largest lake in the database, they should be taken with caution. Our results suggest that large lakes could have a disproportionate effect on genetic diversity and that more work is needed to support the use of habitat size as a proxy of population size in rotifers...|$|R

40|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} (PPN) need to {{be adapted}} {{to survive in the}} absence of a suitable host or in hostile environmental conditions. Various forms of developmental arrest including hatching inhibition and dauer stages are used by PPN in order to survive these conditions and spread to other areas. Potato cyst nematodes (PCN) (Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis) are frequently in an anhydrobiotic state, with unhatched nematode persisting for extended periods of time inside the cyst in the absence of the host. This paper shows fundamental changes in the response of quiescent and <b>diapaused</b> eggs of G. pallida to hydration and following exposure to tomato root diffusate (RD) using microarray gene expression analysis encompassing a broad set of genes. For the quiescent eggs, 547 genes showed differential expression following hydration vs. hydratation and RD (H-RD) treatment whereas 708 genes showed differential regulation for the <b>diapaused</b> eggs following these treatments. The comparison between hydrated quiescent and <b>diapaused</b> eggs showed marked differences, with 2, 380 genes that were differentially regulated compared with 987 genes following H-RD. Hydrated quiescent and <b>diapaused</b> eggs were markedly different indicating differences in adaptation for long-term survival. Transport activity is highly up-regulated following H-RD and few genes were coincident between both kinds of eggs. With the quiescent eggs, the majority of genes were related to ion transport (mainly sodium), while the <b>diapaused</b> eggs showed a major diversity of transporters (amino acid transport, ion transport, acetylcholine or other molecules) ...|$|R

40|$|The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae {{was exposed}} to UV-C (250 nm), UV-B (300 nm), and UV-A (350 nm). In non-diapausing females, the median {{effective}} doses for 50 % mortality plus escape incidence (ED 50) were 21 (UV-C) and 104 kJ m- 2 (UV-B); those for 50 % oviposition rate in continuous darkness-treated mites were 6. 2 (UV-C) and 41 kJ m- 2 (UV-B). No significant effects of UV-A on mortality and oviposition rate were observed. The ED 50 values for UV-B were similar to the natural UV-B observed for 2 - 5 days in summer when T. urticae inhabits the undersides of leaves. Therefore, T. urticae possibly uses leaves as a filter to avoid the deleterious effects of UV-B. In <b>diapausing</b> females, low mortality was observed even at high doses of UV radiation, but more than half escaped even at low doses. The orange body color of <b>diapausing</b> females results from accumulation of carotenoids, a scavenger for UV-induced reactive oxygen species; this may explain the low mortality of <b>diapausing</b> females. <b>Diapausing</b> females may overcome the deleterious effects of UV-B during winter {{in the absence of}} leaves by emigrating to UV-free environments and by accumulating carotenoids...|$|R
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or <b>diapause.</b> The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no <b>diapause</b> stage.|$|E
