I {{was asked by}} some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should {{keep your mouth shut}} after the war.|$|E
25|$|As {{they joined}} Emma at Merlin's tree, Arthur and his Knights {{are ready to}} stop Regina and Emma from {{releasing}} Merlin, calling them liars. As Regina unleashed her hand of fire to keep Arthur at bay, she tells Emma to use the spell, which unleashes light and dark magic, freeing Merlin. The now-human sorcerer then calls out Emma, and lashed out at Arthur, telling the King that he - and not Merlin's false prophecies - {{are to blame for}} this mess, and added as long as the dagger and Excalibur are separated Merlin is untouchable. Arthur, however says this is far from over. Merlin later lifted Arthur’s spell off of David and Mary Margaret. Hook asks Merlin if he can he free Emma to remove darkness out of her. Merlin revealed he could lift the darkness from Emma, but there was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he needs from Emma, and that is if Emma's heart was ready to release the darkness from hers.|$|E

[...] In response, Timberlake said, [...] "It is similar. You go back to Aaliyah's biggest record, 'Are You That Somebody' – it's similar to that too because it's that percussive ballad." [...] When asked about the lyrics, [...] "There's <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I need from you: say I do", being autobiographical, he said no, adding that the line before that, [...] "this ring here {{represents}} my heart", is about marriage and love. Timberlake stated, [...] "It's not specifically about marriage, but about a humble approach to love. None of it is autobiographical, though obviously I have experience to draw from." ...|$|E

In one chapter titled: [...] "The Power of Clothes: Don't Pull a Dukakis", Brown explains that men should acquire a navy blazer for each season: one with [...] "a hint of green" [...] for springtime, another with more autumnal threading for the fall. He further remarks, [...] "You really shouldn't try {{to get through a}} public day wearing <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> ... Sometimes, I change clothes four times a day." ...|$|E

But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his person in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him.

2500|$|In 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek {{presented}} his thoughts {{in his speech}} [...] "What I Really Believe About UFOs".

[...] We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{news of the}} {{disaster}} reached Paris on 2 September, and was confirmed the next day. Two hundred twenty Deputies of the Assembly gathered on the 4th and, following Thiers' formula, declared that, [...] "due to circumstances", there was a vacancy of power. At the same time, a group of republican deputies, including Leon Gambetta and headed by General Trochu, met at the Hôtel de Ville and formed a provisional government, called the Government of National Defense, which was determined to continue the war. Thiers told the monarchist deputies, [...] "In {{the presence of the}} enemy, who will soon be outside Paris, we have <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to do; to retire from here with dignity." [...] He closed the session of the Assembly and offered his services to the new republican government.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1971, Clive Calder and Ralph Simon {{began their}} two-decade {{partnership}} in forming businesses in record production and promotion, music publishing, artist management and concert promotion in South Africa. [...] Because {{of the market}} in South Africa, there was a need to branch out into various aspects of the business, instead of just focusing on one aspect of the industry. [...] "You couldn't do <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] It was too small," [...] explained David Gresham, CEO of David Gresham Record Company. [...] "This is not a country where you have a million-seller. [...] A No. 1 record is a 10,000 unit seller. That only pays the rent for a month or two." [...] While almost mandatory in South Africa, this early style of music company would be adapted to other markets throughout the companies history, and would become a staple of Calder's managing legacy.|$|E

[...] A Daily Post reporter quipped [...] "No wedding goes without a hitch in soapland, and Toadie and Sonya's is no exception." [...] On the day the episode was broadcast in the UK, All About Soaps Claire Crick wrote [...] "There's <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> you need to have {{at the top of your}} to-do list today… and that's watch Neighbours!

2500|$|The group's first single, [...] "Maybe Tomorrow", {{produced}} by Visconti, was released worldwide on 15 November 1968. It reached the Top Ten in several European countries and Japan, but only number 67 on the US Billboard Hot 100, {{and failed to}} chart in the UK. The US manager of Apple Records, Ken Mansfield, ordered 400,000 copies of the single—considered to be a bold move {{at the time in}} the music business—and pushed for automatic airplay and reviews from newspapers, which he secured. Nevertheless, Mansfield remembered the problems: [...] "We had a great group. We had a great record. We were missing <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> ... the ability to go out and pick up people, and convince them to put their money on the counter". A second Tom Evans composition, [...] "Storm in a Teacup", was included on an Apple EP promoting Wall's Ice Cream, along with songs by Apple artists such as [...] James Taylor, Mary Hopkin and Jackie Lomax. The chart success of [...] "Maybe Tomorrow" [...] in Europe and Japan led to a follow-up single release in those markets in July 1969: Griffiths' [...] "Dear Angie", also {{produced by}} Visconti. An LP containing both singles and titled Maybe Tomorrow was released only in Italy, Germany and Japan. This limited release strategy was thought to be the work of Apple Corps' president, Allen Klein; an Apple Corps' press officer, Tony Bramwell, remembered: [...] " [...] was saying, 'We're not going to issue any more records until I sort out this [...] mess.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The concert special {{received}} a 0.5 rating of adults aged 18–49, and aired to 888,000 viewers. Adam Carlson of Time magazine described the special as unique, {{and felt that}} HBO's contributions were mostly simple and cheap [...] "embellishment" [...] which showcase hypnotizing imagery. He [...] summarised the tour special stating, [...] "Beyoncé and Jay-Z style themselves as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde... But why settle for bank robbers? The pair, African Americans who write, produce, and perform their own music, are never <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to anyone. It has been a horrible... summer — for them, {{for all of us}} — but On The Run, a symphony of spectacles, absorbs all of that into something small that feels huge: the most important marriage in pop culture." [...] Erin Strecker of Billboard also gave the special a positive review, explaining that there were many high points from a musical perspective, before adding that the whole show was set up to look as one major high point with the pair changing turns to perform their songs as a medley showcasing their talents. He felt that it had something to offer to every viewer and added that the slow-motion footage focusing on Beyoncé and the audience was among the best executed of the special. Strecker chose the performance of [...] "Young Forever" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as the concert's highlight and finished his review concluding that [...] "the HBO special allowed fans to see them up close and at their best". Similarly, a writer of Rap-Up called the special a three-hour [...] "spectacular" [...] with the duo being at their finest.|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
