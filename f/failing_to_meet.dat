As of December 2009, the film ranks 14th for the year internationally and 23rd domestically (U.S. and Canada), which puts it below initial expectations in terms of domestic gross and first weekend, as well as overall global take.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections {{that require the}} player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor grates to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel gun to pull enemies over ledges.|$|E

5|$|The Morumbi Stadium {{failed to}} provide proof of funding for a R$630million {{renovation}} plan requested by FIFA to secure {{its status as a}} World Cup venue; the stadium was then excluded from the tournament on 16 June 2010. The Local World Cup Committee suggested to use Arena Corinthians instead. FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Journalist Wagner Vilaron from O Estado de S. Paulo deemed the exclusion of the Morumbi Stadium from the World Cup and the subsequent choice of Arena Corinthians as a venue for the event to be politically charged. After receiving several negative responses from FIFA about the renovation project for Morumbi, then-CBF-president Ricardo Teixeira lost patience with São Paulo Futebol Clube officers; he considered that they were delaying the decision by purposely <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the requirements to force the government to spend money on the construction.

5|$|Vertical {{wind shear}} {{decreased}} {{as the storm}} passed over the Gulf Stream, allowing a strong convective burst to develop near the center. As it approached the coast of North Carolina, the center re-developed within the deep convection underneath the mid-level circulation, although increased northerly wind shear displaced the center of Gabrielle {{to the north of}} the thunderstorm activity. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Gabrielle moved ashore at Cape Lookout National Seashore at 1530UTC on September 9 with winds of 60mph (95km/h), though due to the shear the strongest winds remained offshore. Tracking around the ridge over the western Atlantic, the storm turned to the north and north-northeast, emerging into the ocean near Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina early on September 10 as a poorly organized system with convection far to the south of the center. Gabrielle weakened to a tropical depression shortly thereafter, and maintained scattered convection despite unfavorable wind shear as it tracked along the northern portion of the Gulf Stream. By midday on September 11, the circulation had become ill-defined and elongated; <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the criteria of a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center declared Gabrielle dissipating well to the south of Nova Scotia. By early the next day, the remnants of Gabrielle were absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the cartel. But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Cancún. But after <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced.|$|E

In Zakynthos doctors, lawyers, former so called nobles, Popolari and clerics from the Orthodox and Catholic churches were included in the 40 member governing council. However, the initial enthusiasm was transformed with discontent primarily because of the greater levels of taxation, the method of tax collection and the habit of French authorities borrowing from local merchants and <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> later <b>meet</b> their obligations. But what really bothered the locals was the contempt French had for their institutions, like the Orthodox religion and other traditions.|$|R

Increasing numbers of individuals fleeing conflict regimes and seeking asylum {{are faced with}} restrictive immigration regimes whilst at the same time, highly skilled migrants are welcomed and encouraged to contribute to developed economies. This paper explores the asylum-migration nexus that {{has emerged as a}} result of restrictive immigration policy by drawing upon a survey of 300 health professionals in the UK. First, the empirical lens of health professionals fleeing conflict regions is employed to map the contours of the asylum-migration nexus. Second, the implications of highly selective asylum flows to Europe, in terms of economic and social characteristics, are considered.

Immediate social context—rather than demographic characteristics or global work–family variables—was associated with content of possible selves. Controlling for demographic and work–family variables, job-focused possible selves (and strategies to attain them) were more salient; and caregiving and mental-health-related possible selves were less salient to mothers in job-training programs vs. welfare offices...|$|R
50|$|A major {{complaint}} of NYNEX was its reputation of poor {{customer service and}} low reliability. During its era, long-term issues regarding corrupt and faulty business practices, phones frequently breaking down, and missed repair appointments were reported. The company also had a very poor habit of <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>meet</b> the goals it promised for its customers. This eventually led NYNEX to a $4.1 million fine for lack of service in 1996. A bigger complication, however, was the difficulty of contacting customer support whenever help was needed. Many NYNEX customers have witnessed filing countless complaints to the company, {{only to find out}} that none of them were being responded to. To numerous NYNEX customers, this was not an issue that happened only a few times, but rather, on a regular basis. In 1995, the state of New York first proposed a turnaround plan that was meant to help NYNEX improve its customer service, but it was suddenly believed that it would not help NYNEX improve its poor service record, and that the rate reductions proposed by the plan would be too inconsistent.|$|R

40|$|Bilingualism {{has taken}} a swing on the {{pendulum}} in a negative direction {{when it comes to}} education. Programs are being dissolved and are disappearing at startling rates, meanwhile the population of bilingual students continues to grow on a daily basis. In Teacher Preparation for Bilingual Student Populations: Educar para Transformar, Belinda Bustos Flores, Rosa Hernandez Sheets, and Ellen Riojas Clark (2011) create an argument aligned to the need for reform in teacher preparation programs with a focus on bilingual education and bilin-gual learners in particular. The purpose of this book is thus to raise awareness about the need to incorporate culturally responsive pedagogy, including bilingual and bicultural pedagogy, multiculturalism, and multilingualism, into the curriculum, beginning at the University with teacher candidates and feeding down into K- 12 schooling. The authors problematize current teacher preparation programs by focusing on how such programs might be reformed in order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the needs of an increasingly diverse student body. The authors present a new edu-cational model, Educar para Transformar, which is designed to be implemented by teacher preparation programs in an effort to address the ever-changing landscape of schools in the United States. Specifically, they propose that Educar para Transformar offers teacher preparation programs, especially those in areas with highly diverse populations, new possibilities for meeting the needs of students. In demonstrating how many educational programs are <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>meet</b> the needs of a diverse studen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Frameworks for {{applying}} the cellular models, {{proposed by the}} authors years ago, are investigated aiming to reduce the complexity of courseware design. Development of topdown courseware involves the task of arranging the contents which are logically hypertextualized so that learners can walk through the courses with utmost ease. In many cases, the produced courseware must face with varieties of learners who have different backgrounds, <b>failing</b> often <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> {{the demands of the}} majority of both teachers and learners. An ideal solution to this problem is to produce customized versions of the courseware, each of which is so arranged that each learner can maintain and increase one’s primary interest and motivation. However, the time complexity involved in such a process is combinatorial, which can be reduced to an amenable task only when, at present, experienced teachers or courseware designers are involved. In general, developing courseware takes much human resources. Using the cellular models, we can save courseware projects from this difficulty. We propose here a courseware design method based on the cellular database technology that greatly reduces the complexity of designing processes in orders of magnitude, aiming to promote the development of courseware for topdown education.
