25|$|Aerosolized {{medications}} that help loosen secretions include dornase alfa and hypertonic saline. Dornase is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down DNA in the sputum, thus decreasing its viscosity. Denufosol, an <b>investigational</b> <b>drug,</b> opens an alternative chloride channel, helping to liquefy mucus. Whether inhaled corticosteroids are useful is unclear, but stopping inhaled corticosteroid therapy is safe. There is weak evidence that corticosteroid treatment may cause harm by interfering with growth.|$|E
25|$|Double-blinding is {{relatively}} easy to achieve in drug studies, by formulating the <b>investigational</b> <b>drug</b> and the control (either a placebo or an established drug) to have identical appearance (color, taste, etc.). Patients are randomly assigned to the control or experimental group and given random numbers by a study coordinator, who also encodes the drugs with matching random numbers. Neither the patients nor the researchers monitoring the outcome know which patient is receiving which treatment, until the study is over and the random code is revealed.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{are another}} <b>investigational</b> <b>drug</b> class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>investigational</b> <b>drug</b> Debio-025 is a known {{inhibitor}} of {{the protein}} cyclophilin D, which regulates the swelling of mitochondria {{in response to}} cellular injury.

2500|$|In November 2013 the FDA {{released}} the observational notes from an inspection of Burzynski {{as a principal}} investigator that took place between January and March 2013. Among the findings were “ to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome, therapeutic response , for 67% of study subjects reviewed during the inspection,” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria, failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons, and failure to report all adverse events. Further, the FDA told Burzynski, [...] "You failed to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under your care. Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102 investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22, 2013 [...] There is no documentation {{to show that you}} have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects.” The FDA also observed that Burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the <b>investigational</b> <b>drug.</b> Lastly, the FDA observed: [...] "Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review", meaning {{that there was no way}} for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} types of EAPs allowed in the United States. Treatment {{protocols}} and treatment INDs provide {{large numbers of people}} access to investigational drugs. A single-patient IND is a request from a physician to the FDA that an individual be allowed access to an <b>investigational</b> <b>drug</b> on an emergency or compassionate use basis. When the FDA receives a significant number of requests (~10 to 100) for individual expanded access to an <b>investigational</b> <b>drug</b> for the same use, they may ask the trial sponsor to consolidate these requests, creating an intermediate-size group. “Compassionate use” is a more colloquial term that is not generally used by the FDA.
