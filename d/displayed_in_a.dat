5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and {{on grounds that}} it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} capture {{the city for the}} Christians was made by Enrique de Guzmán, Second Count of Niebla. The Seventh Siege of Gibraltar ended in {{disaster}} on 31 August 1436 when a landing led by Enrique resulted in his drowning at the Red Sands along with 40 knights and men-at-arms. His body was retrieved by the Moors, beheaded and <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wicker basket above Gibraltar's Sea Gate for the next 26 years.|$|E

5|$|On 29 October Banksy's art was <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shop window, {{unbeknownst to}} the owners. Banksy had {{purchased}} {{a very basic}} painting of a landscape, added his own special touch {{in the form of}} a Nazi in full uniform resting on a bench and enjoying the view, and donated it back to the store, drastically increasing their patronage for the day.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat has {{two large}} and {{remarkable}} churches from the Middle Ages. St. Faith's Church {{is the oldest}} and {{a prime example of}} Romanesque architecture. Its design is related to similar buildings both in the Rhine region and in Lorraine. It was built {{during the second half of}} the 12th century to replace an earlier building. The church was renovated in the 19th century and a medieval death mask was found during this work. It is often attributed to Hildegard of Eguisheim, founder of the church, and is now <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} elements are often <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> periodic table that {{is laid out}} to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with {{the same number of}} valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|Early in October 1835, Yagan's {{head and}} the {{panoramic}} view were returned to Dale, then living in Liverpool. On 12 October he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution, where the head may have been <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the Liverpool Museum; it is thought {{not to have been}} put on display there. By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head. They were buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 stillborn babies and two infants who died soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser {{turned to}} Pflueger {{again for a}} new {{neighborhood}} theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps standing outside of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Beebe and Barton's Bathysphere dives were {{interrupted}} {{for a year}} due to technical problems and uncooperative weather. An additional difficulty in 1931 was the death of Beebe's father, and Beebe left Nonsuch Island for a week in order to attend his father's funeral. A second year-long interruption occurred in 1933, and was caused {{in part by a}} lack of funds due to the Great Depression. Although Beebe and Barton performed no dives in 1933, their work gathered a large amount of publicity when the Bathysphere was <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History, and later at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago, where they shared the fair's Hall of Science with Auguste Piccard. Beebe and Barton also obtained publicity for their dives from several articles Beebe wrote describing them for National Geographic, and from an NBC radio broadcast in which Beebe's voice transmitted up the phone line from inside the Bathysphere was broadcast nationally over the radio.|$|E

5|$|In December 2011, YouTube {{launched}} {{a new version of}} the site interface, with the video channels <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> central column on the home page, similar to the news feeds of social networking sites. At the same time, {{a new version of the}} YouTube logo was introduced with a darker shade of red, the first change in design since October 2006. In May 2013, YouTube {{launched a}} pilot program to begin offering some content providers the ability to charge $0.99 per month or more for certain channels, but the vast majority of its videos would remain free to view. In February 2014, Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} offered Jovanović {{the opportunity}} {{to make a name for}} himself as a serious history painter, given that the subject of the work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foreign capital. To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes and other objects, later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora, where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.|$|E
