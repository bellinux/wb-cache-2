60|$|We {{have seen}} from the {{investigations}} of the last twenty years, when the phenomena of sweating have been under close and scientific review, {{that there is no}} power of self-cure within the area of the evil. We have seen that while the general advance in the standards of work and wages has on the whole been constant, these morbid and diseased patches, which we call the Sweated Trades, have not shared in that improvement, but have remained in a state of chronic depression and degeneration. The same shocking facts, in some cases the same pitiful witnesses, were brought before the Select Committee last year as before Lord Dunraven's Committee in 1888. Indeed I am advised that in some respects wages and conditions are worse than they were twenty years ago. Nor are these melancholy facts confined to any one country. Sweating <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of Great Britain. Practically the same trades experience the same evils in all other industrial countries. France, Germany, Austria, and America reproduce with great exactness under similar economic conditions the same social evils, and in those countries, as in ours, Sweated Industries--by which I mean trades where there is no organisation, where wages are exceptionally low, and conditions subversive of physical health and moral welfare--cast dark shadows in what is, upon the whole, the growing and broadening light of civilisation.|$|E
60|$|As Horne Tooke, one of {{the founders}} of the noble science of philology, observes, {{language}} is an art, like brewing or baking; but writing would have been a much more appropriate simile. It certainly is not a true instinct, as every language has to be learnt. It differs, however, widely from all ordinary arts, for man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; whilst no child has an instinctive tendency to brew, bake, or write. Moreover, no philologist now supposes that any language has been deliberately invented; each has been slowly and unconsciously developed by many steps. The sounds uttered by birds offer in several respects the nearest analogy to language, for all the members of the same species utter the same instinctive cries expressive of their emotions; and all the kinds that have the power of singing exert this power instinctively; but the actual song, and even the call-notes, are learnt from their parents or foster-parents. These sounds, as Daines Barrington[77] has proved, “are no more innate than language is in man.” The first attempts to sing “may be compared to the imperfect endeavour in a child to babble.” The young males continue practising, or, as the bird-catchers say, recording, for ten or eleven months. Their first essays show hardly a rudiment of the future song; but as they grow older we can perceive what they are aiming at; and at last they are said “to sing their song round.” Nestlings which have learnt the song of a distinct species, as with the canary-birds educated in the Tyrol, teach and transmit their new song to their offspring. The slight natural differences of song in the same species inhabiting different districts may be appositely compared, as Barrington remarks, “to provincial dialects;” and the songs of allied, though distinct species may be compared with the languages of distinct races of man. I have given the foregoing details to shew that an instinctive tendency to acquire an art <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> confined to man.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{appointment}} of judges to supranational and international courts {{has long been}} an unstudied area of sovereign activity. However, the growing role and significance of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), by now {{one of the most significant}} players within the European political and constitutional space, demands reforms which also affect its architecture. The creation of the advisory panel under article 255 TFUE, is a way to improve judicial independence and proficiency but also a mean to achieve an adequate level of judicial accountability. Indeed, the existing national nomination processes, missing both transparency and public involvement, risk to shape courts which are far away to reach an adequate degree of legitimacy, especially in a supranational order. In this paper, we are going to put together all the stages that have led to the ECJ judicial selection reforms, introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. Then, we are going to analyse the composition and the functioning of the new panel under article 255, especially pointing out its limits and strength. In conclusion, together with a far-seeing consideration of all future perspectives, the paper will focus on an interesting comparative datum: judicial appointment panels <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of the ECJ but a “trend” which characterizes several judicial selection reforms both for national and supranational courts...|$|R

Large companies with high profitability that were created relatively late during Germany’s growth success period conducted more FDI. Market size and similarity of the respective host country triggered horizontal FDI.

In this paper, I extend the investigation to the domain of events. More specifically, I present a case study of verbs of ingestion in Maniq illustrating a highly specific categorization of ingestion events at the basic level. A detailed analysis of these verbs reveals they tap into culturally salient notions. Yet, cultural salience alone cannot explain specificity of basic-level verbs, since ingestion is a domain of universal human experience. Further analysis reveals, however, that another key factor is the language itself.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermodynamical {{behavior and the}} scaling symmetries of the scalar dressed black brane (BB) solutions of a recently proposed, exactly integrable Einstein-scalar gravity model [1], which also arises as compactification of (p- 1) -branes with a smeared charge. The extremal, zero temperature, solution is a scalar soliton interpolating between a conformal invariant AdS vacuum in the near-horizon region and a scale covariant metric (generating hyperscaling violation on the boundary field theory) asymptotically. We show explicitly that for the boundary field theory this implies {{the emergence of an}} UV length scale (related {{to the size of the}} brane), which decouples in the IR, where conformal invariance is restored. We also show that at high temperatures the system undergoes a phase transition. Whereas at small temperature the Schwarzschild-AdS BB is stable, above a critical temperature the scale covariant, scalar-dressed BB solution, becomes energetically preferred. We calculate the critical exponent z and the hyperscaling violation parameter of the scalar-dressed phase. In particular we show that the hyperscaling violation parameter is always negative. We also show that the above features <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of the exact integrable model of Ref. [1], but are a quite generic feature of Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity models for which the squared-mass of the scalar field is positive and the potential vanishes exponentially as the scalar field goes to minus infinity.

In these cases, by performing a complete stringy calculation of the interaction among D 3 -branes, {{it has been shown that}} the fact that this correspondence works is a consequence of the open/closed duality and of the absence of threshold corrections.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of the {{plastoquinone}} redox state on the regulation of the light-harvesting antenna size at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This was approached by studying transcription and accumulation of light-harvesting complexes in wild type versus the barley mutant viridis zb 63, which is depleted in photosystem I and where plastoquinone is constitutively reduced. We show that the mRNA level of genes encoding antenna proteins is almost unaffected in the mutant; this stability of messenger level <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of antenna-encoding genes, but it extends to all photosynthesis-related genes. In contrast, analysis of protein accumulation by two-dimensional PAGE shows that the mutant undergoes strong reduction of its antenna size, with individual gene products having different levels of accumulation.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of diquark condensation at sufficiently large baryon chemical potential and zero temperature is analyzed in QCD at strong coupling. In agreement with other strong coupling analysis, {{it is found}} that a first order phase transition separates a low density phase with chiral symmetry spontaneously broken from a high density phase where chiral symmetry is restored. In none of the phases diquark condensation takes place as an equilibrium state, but, for any value of the chemical potential, there is a metastable state characterized by a non-vanishing diquark condensate. The energy difference between this metastable state and the equilibrium state decreases with the chemical potential and is minimum in the high density phase.

Transpositions of science into art <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of contemporary age, as {{the history of western}} culture has been shaped by hypotheses, theories, and discoveries travelling from the sciences to the arts. It is thus the specificity of artistic responses to specific scientific stimuli that calls for attention.

Systematic study of the genes has generated artistic responses involving both the construction and commodification of a symbolic imagery. The impact of genetics on artistic creativity can be comprehended by examining new forms of representation, cultural icons, and symbols, but also by assessing the commercialization of genetics research material. Extending its scope of intervention well beyond health research, medical practice, or pharmaceutical industry, the work of bioscientists resonates outside the scientific community. Popularization of genomic research has aroused strongly polarized responses, ranging from deep anxiety to unwavering optimism for the scientists’ capacity to gain deeper and deeper knowledge of the structure and function of genes and exert greater control over the course of human life. Bioscientific experiments and results obtained in the laboratories, hypotheses and theories are constantly transfused into artworks and displayed in exhibitions. Art which incorporates material from genetic research has assumed different shapes and gained public recognition as Ars Genetica, Ars Chimaera, Tissue Culture and Art, Wet Biology Art Practice: the variety of definitions shows that a new critical vocabulary is required to investigate contemporary intersections between the arts and the biosciences. Interrogated and interpreted by artists, bioscientific knowledge is used to create items which are claimed to possess aesthetic quality and generate aesthetic experience. Owing to the union of organic matter, artistic creativity, and technological processes, bioart has an enormous resonance in the social sphere.

The recovery of sensitivity to H 2 O 2 by ascorbate is completely inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, indicating that ascorbate is mediating the reduction of Fe(III). The decrease in the sensitivity to the DNA-damaging action of H 2 O 2 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of hypotonic PBS, since it appears to be caused by hypo-osmolarity in general: it is also observed in culture medium of 25 % the isotonic concentration, and in 0. 07 M sucrose.

Under these conditions Fe(II) tends to be oxidized to Fe(III) and the Fenton chemistry is mitigated.

Superior structural order on the local scale of atomic clusters was confirmed by 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The measurements were performed in the 10 -fold periodic direction of the structure and in three specific crystallographic directions within the quasiperiodic plane, corresponding to the 2 and 2 ′ twofold symmetry directions and their bisector. The specific heat, being a scalar quantity, was determined as well. The measurements of the second-rank bulk tensorial properties confirm the theoretical prediction that a solid of decagonal point group symmetry should exhibit isotropic physical properties within the quasiperiodic plane and anisotropy between the in-plane and the 10 -fold directions. d-Al-Co-Ni is an anisotropic diamagnet with stronger diamagnetism for the magnetic field in the 10 -fold direction. Electrical and thermal transport is strongly metallic in the 10 -fold direction but largely suppressed within the quasiperiodic plane, the main reason being the lack of translational periodicity that hinders the propagation of electrons and phonons in a nonperiodic lattice. The third-rank Hall-coefficient tensor shows sign-reversal anisotropy related to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field when applied in the 10 -fold direction or within the quasiperiodic plane.

There was entertainment indeed in simply getting into the place and observing the queer incidents of a Venetian installation. A great many persons contribute indirectly to this undertaking, and it is surprising how they spring out at you during your novitiate to remind you that they are bound up in some mysterious manner with the constitution of your little establishment. It was an interesting problem for instance to trace the subtle connection existing between the niece of the landlady and the occupancy of the fourth floor. Superficially it was none too visible, as the young lady in question was a dancer at the Fenice theatre--or when that was closed at the Rossini-- and might have been supposed absorbed by her professional duties. It proved necessary, however, that she should hover about the premises in a velvet jacket and a pair of black kid gloves with one little white button; as also, that she should apply a thick coating of powder to her face, which had a charming oval and a sweet weak expression, like that of most of the Venetian maidens, who, as <b>a</b> general thing--it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of the land- lady's niece--are fond of besmearing themselves with flour.

It is a faint, shimmering, airy, watery pink; the bright sea-light seems to flush with it and the pale whiteish-green of lagoon and canal to drink it in. There is indeed a great deal of very evident brickwork, which is never fresh or loud in colour, but always burnt out, as it were, always exquisitely mild.|$|R

Only a minor fraction of the large-T present was associated with 53 K protein, and large-T and the 53 K host protein cosedimented during centrifugation through sucrose gradients. We used monospecific sera and monoclonal antibodies to study the rate of synthesis and phosphorylation of the 53 K protein during lytic infections. Infection of CV- 1 cells with SV 40 increased the rate of synthesis of the 53 K protein fivefold over that in mock-infected cells. At the same time, the rate of phosphorylation of the 53 K protein increased more than 30 -fold compared with control cultures. Monkey cells {{transformed by}} UV-irradiated SV 40 (Gluzman et al., J. Virol. 22 : 256 - 266, 1977) also contained the large-T- 53 K protein complex. The formation of the complex <b>is</b> therefore <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of SV 40 -transformed rodent cells but is a common feature of SV 40 infections...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interaction}} between glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and fibronectin in the basement membrane of the epiblast in the chicken blastoderm using testicular-hyaluronidase digestion of GAGs either on fixed tissue sections or in vivo after microinjection of the enzyme preparation prior to immunostaining for fibronectin. In the choice of fixatives, special {{attention was paid to}} their preservation of GAGs. The controls included alcian-blue staining of serial sections to test the efficiency of the digestion, and incubations in the presence of protease inhibitors to abolish contaminating proteolytic activity in the commercial hyaluronidase preparations. The results indicate that fixation in solutions which preserve GAGs, i. e. ethanolic solutions or aqueous solutions containing cetylpyridinium chloride, allows the immunocytochemical demonstration of fibronectin in the basement membrane of the epiblast {{at the level of the}} endophyllic crescent, but masks this glycoprotein at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface. As shown by both approaches, this masking of immunoreactivity is reversible. Moreover, the in vivo clearance of GAGs before fixation shows that the masking at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> experimental <b>peculiarity</b> due to the use of a particular technique, but is the consequence of an interaction between GAGs and fibronectin in that particular area of the basement membrane that is used by mesoblast cells as a substrate for migration. The observation that fibronectin may be masked by GAGs in ethanol-fixed tissue [...] a commonly used fixation method [...] may require the re-evaluation of some negative results mentioned in the literature.

40|$|The role {{of experts}} grows {{in the present and}} that is, in part, justifiable: as {{complexity}} rises, the ones who deliberate feel the need of the help of those who have know-how in specific fields. The question that must be asked revolves around the type of expectations developed in modern societies regarding what experts can do. Though specialization <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of our time (the process can be observed since human beings became sedentary); it has presently gained specific characteristics. Two aspects of modern life are particularly significant on that matter: (i.) the fact that the economic system is based on excitation of new needs (and no longer on the demand for satisfaction of needs); (ii.) the growing pursuit for total administration of conflicts. These factors are constitutive of what Gadamer sees as a great threat to our civilization: the excessive emphasis given in our time to the human ability to adapt. A specific ability is demanded from individuals: the capability of making an apparatus functions properly. Less resistance and more adaptability is requested, and because of that, autonomous thought - that is, not determined by the function it has in a system – is devalued. The threat we currently face is that the abilities of a good technocrat become the only qualities demanded from those who are responsible for practical decisions (especially in politics and law). Teleological reason, that guides the activity of specialists (and requires know-how in a specific area and consists in choosing means to reach a previously established goal), should not substitute practical reason, as the former requires adaptability to experience (not to a plan that was previously established) and is grounded on solidarity. In order to discuss the limits of the activity of specialists, the paper looks back to phrónesis and the way ancient Greeks set boundaries - this exercise should help raising new questions revolving the matter...|$|E
40|$|Downloadable Document is in German Summary 1. The private lawyer’s role is {{inseparably}} {{connected with}} the paradigms and doctrines of private law. This is so because {{the role played by}} private lawyers constitutes a large part of their understanding of the discipline. At the same time, the shared understanding of the discipline has necessary consequences for the roles played by lawyers in it. 2. Roles and role perceptions in private law are contingent upon space and time. The most important factor affecting private lawyers today is the growing detachment of private law from the state, through globalization, Europeanization, and privatization of law. 3. International commercial arbitration creates a transnational epistemic community. Within this community, the same individuals perform different functional roles: party representatives, arbitrators, scholars, advertisers. 4. The international arbitrator is a cosmopolitan; his or her national origin is considered largely irrelevant and is marginalized. This cosmopolitan role is both a consequence and a prerequisite of the autonomy of international commercial arbitration. 5. The state’s courts, by contrast, are only slowly becoming transnationalized. They favor convergence but shy away from unilateral regulation where such convergence does not exist or cannot be brought about. 6. The arbitrator’s role has evolved in the 20 th century, from that of a legal notable whose authority rests in experience and wisdom, to that of a professional and entrepreneur. However, both types, as well as intermediate types, still exist. 7. In arbitration, the scholar’s role is regularly inseparable from that of a stakeholder. Most scholarship is produced by practitioners; university professors who write on arbitration frequently also practice. Arbitration scholarship is used as advertisement for ist author practitioner’s name and for international arbitration in general. The resulting scholarship is therefore of mixed quality; it tends to present arbitration in a favorable light. 8. Whereas domestic law rests in and finds ist legitimacy in the state, such a foundation is lacking for international arbitration. Instead of an alternative theory, scholars and practitioners frequently resort to faith and visions instead of rationality. 9. Two theories of international arbitration compete: a private theory of the arbitrator as a service provider whose only obligations are to the parties, and a public understand of the arbitrator as a quasi-judge with obligations towards the world at large. Attempts to combine both theories usually fail in their attempt to transcend the public/private tension inherent in both theories. A new theory will be necessary. 10. Other than legal practice, which is already transnationalized, private law scholarship is still in a process towards such transnationalization. The process largely leads to a role perception detached from both the state and politics. 11. Effectively, legal practice takes part in the creation of law beyond the state, in particular in so-called formulating agencies. Officially, however, such a lawmaking role is regularly rejected. 12. Private codifications like the Lando and UNIDROIT Principles are justified with a view to the needs of practice. Their authors, however, view themselves as disinteresed scholars, neither as practitioners nor as lawmakers. This is true even for the authors of the European Common Frame of Reference. The ensuing unclear relation between restatement and prestatement of law <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of transnational private law, it is commensurate with the experience from state codifications. 13. Private codifciations, other than state laws, need to be recognized by their users in order to claim any validity. As a consequence, private codifiers frequently act as advertisors for their products. 14. In transnational private law, ultimate foundations are often sought with reference to faith and vision, not rationality. Letztbegründungsproblem mit Hinweis auf Glauben, Vision, und Traum, letztlich also irrational, überwunden. 15. The private codifier legitimizes herself as a service provider vis-à-vis lawmakers and parties; he rejects a governance role. His code is supposed to gain ist validity from reason rather than state power, a doubtful juxtaposition. The reference to private autonomy is meant to substitute for other legitimacy, based on substantive quality or democratic process. 16. Private codifiers regulary refer to the state for questions of public interests. The consequence is a division of responsibilities...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} have revealed a surprising lack of close binaries among extreme horizontal branch (EHB) {{stars in the}} globular cluster NGC 6752, at variance with the analogous sdB field stars. Another puzzling result concerns the derived spectroscopic masses for some EHB stars. The present paper extends our study of NGC 6752 to M 80 and NGC 5986. Twenty-one horizontal branch stars (out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC 5986 and 31 in M 80 (11 EHBs) were observed during four consecutive nights. We measured radial velocity variations, temperatures, gravities, and helium abundances. By means of a statistical analysis, we detected one EHB close binary candidate per cluster. In M 80, the best estimate of the close binary EHB fraction is f= 12 %, and even the lowest estimate of the binary fraction among field sdB stars can be ruled out within a 90 % confidence level. Because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawn on the close EHB binary fraction for NGC 5986, although our best estimate is rather low (f= 25 %). For the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses with theoretical models observed in NGC 6752, our analysis of M 80 EHB stars shows a similar trend. For the first time, we report a clear trend in surface helium abundance with temperature. Our {{results show that the}} deficiency of close binaries among EHB stars is now confirmed in two, and possibly three, globular clusters. This feature <b>is</b> therefore <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>peculiarity</b> of NGC 6752. Our analysis also proves that the strangely high spectroscopic masses among EHB stars are now confirmed in at least a second cluster. Our results confirm that f could be a function of the age of the sdB star population, but we find that recent models have some problem reproducing all observations.

40|$|Already {{in some of}} Bartók's {{juvenile}} compositions, {{a definite}} attraction is manifested for the irregular rhythmics. This is an early appearance of additive metrics, opposed to the conventional divisive one. An extremely rich selection for irregular meters was offered to Bartók by Rumanian folk song material, particularly in the “colindas”. Speaking about, although Bartók used the term “Bulgarian rhythm”, although knew well this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> exclusively Bulgarian <b>peculiarity.</b> The phenomenon shows clearly the existing form of the additive-substractive metrics, because the quantitatively various bar structures alternate by augmenting or diminishing by one quaver (as common nominator), a kind of “mistuning in the time”. This thinking {{has been well documented}} in a series of various examples, but the Sonata for two pianos and percussion (1937) provides an extremely rich selection of rhythm combination, in which the inner overstructurating of the bar, resp. the mistuning of the meter plays the principal role (3 + 3 + 3 / 8 à 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 / 8 à 4 + 2 + 3 / 8) ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} on Shmelev, the second thesis in Pushkin speech is usually commented on — the one about Pushkin's mystery. The famous Dostoevsky’s speech is concluded with words about a mystery and revealing this mystery. Shmelev's reply is that "we seem to have revealed this mystery". However, the first thesis of this speech — containing a complete agreement between Shmelev and Dostoyevsky — is usually ignored. In this paper, the author polemizes with his predecessors who studied Shmelev's publicistic writings and interprets this agreement between Shmelev and Dostoevsky. The Truth of God is brought up, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only <b>an</b> individual <b>peculiarity</b> of Pushkin but the high road of Russian literature in general. Applicable as well to Russian culture in general. The Truth of Russian people, {{also known as the}} Truth of God, is the truth accepted by us from the font of Orthodoxy — and this is the central idea of Pushkin, which became clear to Russian exiles. In particular, it became clear because an almost thousand-year-long Russian history was forcedly interrupted in the homeland they left; this is something that, naturally, Dostoyevsky could not even think of...|$|R
40|$|Context: Recent {{investigations}} have revealed a surprising lack of close binaries among extreme horizontal branch (EHB) {{stars in the}} globular cluster NGC 6752, at variance with the analogous sdB field stars. Another puzzling result concerns the derived spectroscopic masses for some EHB stars. Aims: The present paper extends our study of NGC 6752 to M 80 and NGC 5986, to establish whether the unexpected properties of EHB stars in NGC 6752 are also present in other clusters. Methods: Twenty-one horizontal branch stars (out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC 5986 and 31 in M 80 (11 EHBs) were observed during four consecutive nights. We measured radial velocity variations and evaluated statistical and systematic errors. Temperatures, gravities, and helium abundances were also measured. Results: By means of a statistical analysis of the observed radial velocity variations, we detected one EHB close binary candidate per cluster. In M 80, the best estimate of the close binary EHB fraction is f= 12 %, and even the lowest estimate of the binary fraction among field sdB stars can be ruled out within a 90 % confidence level.
