500|$|Richard B. Freeman, {{writing in}} 2011 about the {{contemporaneous}} economic {{situation in the}} United States, called Horton Hatches the Egg a tale of investment. Freeman argued that [...] "economic growth requires long-term investments", as embodied by Horton's sitting on the egg, and that [...] "trust is important in a well-functioning economy", as embodied by Horton's repeated maxim, [...] "I meant what I said,/ and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I meant." ...|$|E
500|$|Naturally, {{the absurd}} sight of an {{elephant}} sitting atop a tree makes quite a scene - Horton {{is exposed to}} the elements, laughed at by his jungle friends, captured by hunters, forced to endure a terrible sea voyage, and finally placed in a traveling circus. However, despite his hardships and Mayzie's clear intent not to return, Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word, often repeating, [...] "I meant what I said, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred per cent!" ...|$|E
500|$|Horton Hatches the Egg is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House. The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, [...] "I meant what I said, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!" [...] Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{had been}} {{considering}} {{a man that}} turned invisible {{in the political and}} metaphorical sense for a while, but he still needed a way for physical invisibility. The eventual concept came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother, who told about blind spots regarding malfunctioning retinal spots or optic nerves, which do not impair humans due to a brain compensation. Gordon noted, [...] "these stories come from scientific research... So <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists?" [...] Gordon decided to use a Vietnam War veteran given [...] "they are getting old, and like the Holocaust survivor of 'Kaddish', starting to die", and the opportunity would allow a larger role for Skinner. General MacDougal was named after the show's editor, Heather MacDougall.|$|E
500|$|On 20 August 2009, Villa {{scored in}} his first {{official}} match of the season, a 3–0 Europa League qualifier against Stabæk. He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E

If I'm skeptical, it's not about now, but about the distant future. We are {{separated}} for too long at a {{time for us to}} be bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked me about a child, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 11, 2006, Robert Novak {{posted a}} column titled [...] "My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story": [...] "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has {{informed}} my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his {{investigation of the}} CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me {{in the middle of a}} long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.) Harlow is the person whom Novak refers to as his [...] "CIA source" [...] for his column [...] "Mission to Niger".|$|E
