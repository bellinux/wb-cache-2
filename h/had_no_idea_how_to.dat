5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders {{wondered if the}} company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company planned {{to use them to}} develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> develop a video game at that time.|$|E

In the fourth round, a {{snapping}} right landed on Louis' chin, and Louis {{was sent to the}} canvas {{for the first time in}} his twenty eight professional fights. As the fight progressed, stunned fans and critics alike watched Schmeling continue to use this style effectively, and Louis apparently <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> solve the puzzle.|$|E

25|$|The Carroll Brothers {{were also}} {{consultants}} {{to the many}} record companies who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> market hip hop music. Vincent Carroll, the magazine's creator-publisher, {{went on to become}} a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting Blow-Up Media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in NYC's Tribeca district. At the age of 21, Vincent employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the culture's biggest and brightest stars (the Fugees, Nelly, the Outzidaz, feat. Eminem and many more). Later other publications spawned up including: Hip Hop Connection, XXL, Scratch, The Source and Vibe. Many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. The 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|Asimov unsuccessfully {{tried to}} end the series with Second Foundation. However, because of the {{predicted}} thousand years until {{the rise of the}} next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, Asimov gave in after a 30-year hiatus, and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. However, this concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been a Good Life), he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels.|$|E
500|$|According to Ronson, Mars wanted [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] to be {{the lead}} single, which he {{considered}} a [...] "brave" [...] choice. Aaron Bay-Schuck, Mars' A representative at the time, found the track's production to be cutting edge, although admitting {{that it was not}} an instant favorite. However, he perceived that [...] "it was something special" [...] but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> classify it. Bay-Schuck felt the song needed time to grow as [...] "the more you hear it, the more of an earworm it becomes", leading the promotional department to make sure that program directors weren't afraid of playing a track that [...] "sounded different from what was on the radio".|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{has stated}} that he became serious about {{creating}} and engineering his own electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he {{has stated that}} he felt comfortable with how R and Hip hop music integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, Letur-Lefr. PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone was recorded while Frusciante looked {{to find new ways}} to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, [...] "My Recent History," [...] he notes that [...] "Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> execute." ...|$|E
500|$|Moon's {{first serious}} {{relationship}} was with Kim Kerrigan, whom he started dating in January 1965 after {{she saw the}} Who play at Le Disque a Go! Go! in Bournemouth. By {{the end of the}} year, she discovered she was pregnant; her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. They were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Registry Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage (and child) were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: [...] "if we went out after I had Mandy," [...] she later said, [...] "if someone talked to me, he'd lose it. We'd go home and he'd start a fight with me." [...] He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. [...] "He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be a father," [...] Kim said. [...] "He {{was too much of a}} child himself." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{was completed}} Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus {{had left on}} a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various independent labels, distributors, and zines. He recalled [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like SST and Twin Tone and ask, 'How do I do this?'" [...] A representative from SST recommended that Kannberg use Erica Records, a Los Angeles 7" [...] manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of Slay Tracks; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the master recording produced by the company: [...] "It sounds like it sounds now—it's just a mess—but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, if it sounds like that–whatever.'" [...] 1000 copies of Slay Tracks were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label. The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting Austria.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{elements}} of the show's mythology were established from the start. The parallel universe was always {{part of the original}} concept, though aspects of when and how to introduce it were tackled as the show proceeded. The idea of Peter being from the parallel universe came early into the show's production, but this came to lead the team to jokingly refer to Peter as their [...] "hatch", one of the early mysteries in Lost, as with the hatch in Lost, they initially <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> introduce this within the show. FOX's Reilly was also initially concerned about the parallel universe aspect, but as the show progressed into the first season and found its groove, the concept was readily accepted. The most poignant introduction of the parallel universe was in the conclusion of the first-season finale, [...] "There's More Than One of Everything", where they showed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were still standing in the parallel universe, a concept introduced by writer Andrew Kreisberg as an iconic image to leave viewers with; Jackson stated, [...] "I don't know that we've ever had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{producing}} the third series, {{the goal was}} to [...] "raise the bar" [...] higher to satisfy and surprise the audience. The second series finale [...] "Smoke and Mirrors" [...] ended on a cliffhanger which left Tom's fate open. The producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return at the time they began storylining. Brenton had already written the first two episodes as if he was not coming back. When Macfadyen announced his return for those episodes, they had to be rewritten. Brenton went through a [...] "nightmare" [...] rewriting the first episode as he [...] "dug this enormous hole, and [...] <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get out of it." [...] It became a long process of growing the story where Tom turns the tables against Joyce. To make a suitable send off to the character, Brenton did not want Tom to be disillusioned; instead he wanted him to [...] "sort of [...] a human being," [...] as there have been real life instances where spies are attracted to the idea that [...] "the world's a stage to them all the time," [...] but later on they start to unravel.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} a [...] "ménage à trois" [...] between Mrs Arbuthnot, her husband Charles, and Wellington, widely speculated upon, has been {{rejected}} by some biographers. However, {{it has been said}} that the unhappily married Duke enjoyed his relationship with Mrs Arbuthnot because he found in her company [...] "the comfort and happiness his wife could not give him." [...] Arbuthnot was certainly the Duke's confidante in all matters, especially that of his marriage. He confided to her that he only married his wife because [...] "they asked me to do it" [...] and that he was [...] "not the least in love with her." [...] In fact, Wellington had not seen his wife for ten years before their wedding day. Following the marriage, the bride and groom found they had little if anything in common. Despite producing two sons, they led mostly separate lives until the death of the Duchess of Wellington in 1831. Harriet had a rather poor opinion of the Duchess ("she is such a fool"), although she disagreed with Wellington when he said that his wife cared nothing for his comfort: in Harriet's view the Duchess longed to make her husband happy, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> go about the task.|$|E

500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{sales pitch}} {{was typical of}} Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style. [...] In the spirit of his {{character}} name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to [...] "get naked" [...] or [...] "lay {{your hands on the}} radio and squeeze my knobs". [...] Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> recognize the face behind the voice that said things like [...] "Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!" ...|$|E

Nevertheless, Snow was the first American editor to publish Cartier-Bresson's photographs in a magazine.

The Beowulf manuscript itself is identified by {{name for the}} first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley [...] "I can find nothing yet of Beowulph."
