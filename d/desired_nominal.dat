By utilizing the differential flatness property, we reduce the path-based model predictive control problem from a nonlinear to a convex optimization problem. Robustness to disturbances is achieved by a dynamic path reference, which adjusts its speed based on the robot's progress. We also account for key system constraints.

40|$|This paper studies {{a rental}} firm that offers {{reusable}} products to price- and quality-of-service-sensitive customers [...] Netflix or Blockbuster {{can be thought}} of as the canonical example. Customers' perception of quality is determined by their likelihood of obtaining the product or service immediately upon request. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per-unit time, or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. Customers are assumed to <b>desire</b> a <b>nominal</b> usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate in the subscription option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under the subscription option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under the pay-per-use option. In a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using the subscription option is more profitable for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that the subscription option does not necessarily dominate the pay-per-use option in quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better in the subscription option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from the subscription option. subscription services, pay-per-use services, operational benefits, pricing, capacity sizing, finite customer population, loss system, on-off model, diffusion approximation...|$|R

30|$|Piezoresistor {{geometry}} {{is chosen}} {{based on the}} <b>desired</b> <b>nominal</b> resistance value and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Lower limit of nominal resistance is determined by joule heating-induced self-heating effects and electro-migration, whereas its upper limit is determined by specifications of driving current and interface circuitry. Thus, typically the value of nominal resistance of piezoresistors is kept in kΩ range. In general, the piezoresistors {{are designed to be}} U-shaped to improve reliability by avoiding interconnects on the cantilever platform. Since the electrical resistivity of metals is low (in the range of µ Ω-cm), when metal piezoresistors are designed in U shape, their nominal resistance is only a few ohms, which results in large joule heating. Thus, strategically the metal piezoresistors are designed lengthier to obtain large nominal resistance. Therefore, in few cases, rather than the conventional U-shaped design, the piezoresistors are meander-shaped. However, the coverage of the piezoresistor is limited by the cantilever lateral dimensions, since lengthier cantilever platforms result in reduced mechanical stability and electrical sensitivity. On the other hand, by tailoring the electrical resistivity of the piezoresistor material and careful design, it is possible to realize U-shaped metal piezoresistors. Similarly, the width and thickness of the piezoresistor are designed to obtain a desirable nominal resistance. Thickness of metal piezoresistors has an additional constraint on noise figure, since thinner metal piezoresistors show higher electrical noise level. The need for high nominal resistance value to reduce the current density and therefore the joule heating effects is achieved by using lower supply voltages. In the case of doped polysilicon or doped SU- 8 piezoresistors, the electrical resistivity is controlled by varying the dopant concentration. Thus, by optimizing the dopant concentration and geometry of the piezoresistor, <b>desired</b> <b>nominal</b> resistance is achieved. Typical magnitude of surface stress sensitivity and deflection sensitivity of SU- 8 piezoresistive cantilever sensors are in the range of a few ×  10 − 3 (N/m)− 1 and a few ×  10 − 6 to ×  10 − 9 (nm)− 1 which can detect miniscule forces of pN magnitude and lower.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a method {{for the design of}} a nominal {{trajectory}} for a flexible one-link manipulator. This trajectory is near time-optimal. The torque control law consists of two parts: the commanded feedforward torque and the linear an-gular position and velocity feedback. Feedforward signal is proportional to nominal angular acceleration of the hub. On the first time interval, the feedforward torque approaches con-tinuously to a value that is a little smaller than the maximal possible torque, then it remains constant, and then it goes to zero. On the second interval, the feedforward torque ap-proaches continuously to a value that is a little greater than the minimal possible torque, then it remains constant, and then it goes to zero. On the third time interval, feedforward signal is zero. We compute the corresponding <b>nominal</b> (<b>desired)</b> angu-lar acceleration, velociy, and position of the hub as functions of time. The last two functions are fed to the linear feedback system. The angular acceleration is such that, on the first time interval, the hub moves with "large " acceleration in one di-rection, and the link bends on the opposite side. On the second time interval, the hub moves with deceleration, and the link bends {{in the direction of the}} motion. On the third time interval we stabilize the arm near its desired position.

40|$|High-speed {{unmanned}} ground vehicles {{have important}} applications in rough-terrain. In these applications unexpected and dangerous situations can occur that require rapid hazard avoidance maneuvers. At high speeds, {{there is limited}} time to perform navigation and hazard avoidance calculations based on detailed vehicle and terrain models. Furthermore, detailed models often do not accurately predict the robot's performance due to model parameter and sensor uncertainty. This thesis presents the development and analysis of a novel method for high speed navigation and hazard avoidance. The method {{is based on the}} two dimensional "trajectory space," which is a compact model-based representation of a robot's dynamic performance limits on natural terrain. This method allows a vehicle to perform dynamically feasible hazard avoidance maneuvers in a computationally efficient manner. This thesis also presents a novel method for trajectory replanning, based on a "curvature matching" technique. This method quickly generates a path connects the end of the path generated by a hazard avoidance maneuver to the <b>nominal</b> <b>desired</b> path. Simulation and experimental results with a small gasoline-powered high-speed unmanned ground vehicle verify the effectiveness of these algorithms.

40|$|Background: Knowledge and {{innovation}} transfer (KIT) is recognised internationally as a complex, dynamic {{process that is}} difficult to embed in organisations. There is growing use of health service–academic–industry collaborations in the UK, with knowledge brokers linking producers with the users of knowledge {{and innovation}}. Aim: Focusing on KIT ‘agent’ roles within Academic Health Science Networks in England and Partnerships in Wales, we show how individual dispositions, processes and content contribute to desired outcomes. Methods: We studied the KIT intentions of all Academic Health Science Networks in England, and the South East Wales Academic Health Science Partnership. Using a qualitative case study design, we studied the work of 13 KIT agents purposively sampled from five networks, by collecting data from observation of meetings, documentation, KIT agent audio-diaries, and semistructured interviews with KIT agents, their line managers and those they supported (‘Links’). We also used a consensus method in a meeting of experts (nominal group technique) to discuss the measurement of outcomes of KIT agent activity. Findings: The case study KIT agents were predominantly from a clinical background with differing levels of experience and expertise, with the shared aim of improving services and patient care. Although outside of recognised career structures, the flexibility afforded to KIT agents to define their role was an enabler of success. Other helpful factors included (1) time and resources to devote to KIT activity; (2) line manager support and a team to assist in the work; and (3) access and the means to use data for improvement projects. The organisational and political context could be challenging. KIT agents not only tackled local barriers such as siloed working, but also navigated shifting regional and national policies. Board-level support for knowledge mobilisation together with a culture of reflection (listening to front-line staff), openness to challenges and receptivity to research all enabled KIT agents to achieve <b>desired</b> outcomes. <b>Nominal</b> group findings underscored the importance of relating measures to specific intended outcomes. However, the case studies highlighted that few measures were employed by KIT agents and their managers. Using social marketing theory helped to show linkages between processes, outcomes and impact, and drew attention to how KIT agents developed insight into their clients’ needs and tailored work accordingly. Limitations: Level of KIT agent participation varied; line managers and Links were interviewed only once; and outcomes were self-reported. Conclusions: Social marketing theory provided a framework for analysing KIT agent activity. The preparatory work KIT agents do in listening, understanding local context and building relationships enabled them to develop ‘insight’ and adapt their ‘offer’ to clients to achieve desired outcomes. Future work: The complexity of the role and the environment in which it is played out justifies more research on KIT agents. Suggestions include (1) longitudinal study of career pathways; (2) how roles are negotiated within teams and how competing priorities are managed; (3) how success is measured; (4) the place of improvement methodologies within KIT work; (5) the application of social marketing theory to comparative study of similar roles; and (6) patients as KIT agents.

40|$|The role {{of vision}} as an {{additional}} sensing mechanism has {{received a lot of}} attention in recent years in the context of autonomous flight applications. Modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are equipped with vision sensors because of their light-weight, low-cost characteristics and also their ability to provide a rich variety of information of the environment in which the UAVs are navigating in. The problem of vision based autonomous flight is very difficult and challenging since it requires bringing together concepts from image processing and computer vision, target tracking and state estimation, and flight guidance and control. This thesis focuses on the adaptive state estimation, guidance and control problems involved in vision-based formation flight. Specifically, the thesis presents a composite adaptation approach to the partial state estimation of a class of nonlinear systems with unmodeled dynamics. In this approach, a linear time-varying Kalman filter is the nominal state estimator which is augmented by the output of an adaptive neural network (NN) that is trained with two error signals. The benefit of the proposed approach is in its faster and more accurate adaptation to the modeling errors over a conventional approach. The thesis also presents two approaches to the design of adaptive guidance and control (G&C) laws for line-of-sight formation flight. In the first approach, the guidance and autopilot systems are designed separately and then combined together by assuming time-scale separation. The second approach is based on integrating the guidance and autopilot design process. The developed G&C laws using both approaches are adaptive to unmodeled leader aircraft acceleration and to own aircraft aerodynamic uncertainties. The thesis also presents theoretical justification based on Lyapunov-like stability analysis for integrating the adaptive state estimation and adaptive G&C designs. All the developed designs are validated in nonlinear, 6 DOF fixed-wing aircraft simulations. Finally, the thesis presents a decentralized coordination strategy for vision-based multiple-aircraft formation control. In this approach, each aircraft in formation regulates range from up to two nearest neighboring aircraft while simultaneously tracking <b>nominal</b> <b>desired</b> trajectories common to all aircraft and avoiding static obstacles.

40|$|ABSTRACT – An {{important}} issue in control structure selection is the plant ”stabilization”. By the term ”stabilize ” we here include both modes which are mathematically unstable (modes with RHP poles) {{as well as}} ”drifting ” modes which need to be kept within limits to avoid operational problems. By this definition, we can include the states x as variables that should be ”stabilized”, i. e., we want to avoid them to drift {{too far away from}} their <b>desired</b> (<b>nominal)</b> values. An advantage of this approach is that we are able to avoid problems resulted from nonlinear effects. Therefore, as the objective function can, usually, be considered as a combination of the states, the control system obtained by this approach is not tied too closely to a particular primary control objective (which may change with time) because it allows the designer to change the control objective. This paper presents a way to reduce the effects of disturbances and measurement errors in the states and the results show the effectiveness of this approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to propose a design method for controllers to secure specified robust oscillation amplitude and frequency for separable nonlinear systems exhibiting unavoidable or desirable limit cycles. The design approach of robust limit cycle controllers introduced here {{can be used for}} autonomous systems with separable single-input-single-output nonlinearities. The proposed design approach consists of quasi-linearization of the nonlinearity via the Describing Function (DF) method and then shaping the loop to reach desired limit cycle characteristics. As the DF method is used, loop shaping takes place in the Nyquist plot, because the intersection between the loop shaped loci and the DF negative reciprocal loci is related to the limit cycle characteristics of the system. In the problem addressed in this thesis, the original linear subsystem (i. e. without controller) is considered as an uncertain system with unstructured uncertainty. A condition to be satisfied by the shaped loop is given such that the controlled system has limit cycle characteristics {{as close as possible to}} the nominal characteristics even though the uncertainty considered. Three requirements are satisfied in the loop shaping step. The first requirement assures the <b>nominal</b> <b>desired</b> limit cycle characteristics in the designed system. The second is related to limit cycle stability, i. e., if a (small) perturbation disturbs the limit cycle of the controlled system, it will return to the earlier limit cycle. The third requirement addresses the robustness question, and the condition mentioned before is used. After the loop is shaped to satisfy the requirements, a controller is computed so that the controlled linear subsystem transfer function is equal the transfer function obtained in the loop shaping. This approach is applicable to systems with linear subsystems that are minimum phase. In some cases it may be necessary to add a high frequency pole in order to obtain a proper controller. Examples are given in order to illustrate the robustness of the controlled system with respect to uncertainty in the linear subsystem model. In the first example the intersection between the loop shaped loci and the DF negative reciprocal loci is on the real axis. In the second example the crossing point is not on the real axis and so, restrictions more generals than the ones used in the first example are used. In the third example the crossing point is on the real axis and output disturbance is considered...|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} {{aspect of}} distributed systems is resource management, concerning how resources {{can be accessed}} and allocated. This aspect should also {{be taken into account}} when modeling and verifying such systems. A class of formalisms with the <b>desired</b> features are <b>nominal</b> calculi: they represent resources as atomic objects called names and have linguistic constructs to express creation of new resources. The paradigmatic nominal calculus is the π-calculus, which is well-studied and comes with models and logics. The first objective of this thesis is devising a natural and seamless extension of the π-calculus where resources are network nodes and links. The motivation is provided by a recent, successful networking paradigm called Software Defined Networks, which allows the network structure to be manipulated at runtime via software. We devise a new calculus called Network Conscious π-calculus (NCPi), where resources, namely nodes and links, are represented as names, following the π-calculus guidelines. This allows NCPi to reuse the π-calculus name-handling machinery. The semantics allows observing end-to-end routing behavior, in the form of routing paths through the network. As in the π-calculus, bisimilarity is not closed under input prefix. Interestingly, closure under parallel composition does not hold either. Taking the greatest bisimulation closed under all renamings solves the issue only for the input prefix. We conjecture that such closure yields a full congruence for the subcalculus with only guarded sums. We introduce an extension of NCPi (κNCPi) with some features that makes it closer to real-life routing. Most importantly, we add concurrency, i. e. multiple paths can be observed at the same time. Unlike the sequential version, bisimilarity is a congruence from the very beginning, due to the richer observations, so κNCPi can be considered the “right” version of NCPi when compositionality is needed. This extended calculus is used to model the peer- to-peer architecture Pastry. The second objective is constructing a convenient operational model for NCPi. We consider coalgebras, that are categorical representation of system. Coalgebras have been studied in full generality, regardless of the specific structure of systems, and algorithms and logics have been developed for them. This allows for the application of general results and techniques to a variety of systems. The main difficulty in the coalgebraic treatment of nominal calculi is the presence of name binding: it introduces α-conversion and makes SOS rules and bisimulations non-standard. The consequence is that coalgebras on sets are not able to capture these notions. The idea of the seminal paper by Fiore and Turi is resorting to coalgebras on presheaves, i. e. functors C → Set. Intuitively, presheaves allow associating to collections of names, seen as objects of C, the set of processes using those names. Fresh names generation strategies can be formalized as endofunctors on C, which are lifted to presheaves in a standard way and used to model name binding. Within this framework, a coalgebra for the π-calculus transition system is constructed: the benefit is that ordinary coalgebraic bisimulations for such coalgebra are π-calculus bisimulations. Moreover, Fiore and Turi show a technique to obtain a new coalgebra whose bisimilarity is closed under all renamings. This relation is a congruence for the π-calculus. Presheaves come with a rich theory that can help deriving new results, but coalgebras on presheaves are impractical to implement: the state space can be infinite, for instance when a process recursively creates names. However, if we restrict to a class of presheaves (according to Ciancia et al.), coalgebras admit a concrete implementation in terms of HD-automata, that are finite-state automata suitable for verification. In this thesis we adapt and extend Fiore-Turi’s approach to cope with network resources. First we provide a coalgebraic semantics for NCPi whose bisimulations are bisimulations in the NCPi sense. Then we compute coalgebras and equivalences that are closed under all renamings. The greatest such equivalence is a congruence w. r. t. the input prefix and we conjecture that, for the NCPi with only guarded sums, it is a congruence also w. r. t. parallel composition. We show that this construction applies a form of saturation. Then we prove the existence of a HD-automaton for NCPi. The treatment of network resources is non-trivial and paves the way to modeling other calculi with complex resources...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, {{there exist}} several assistance {{technologies such as}} imaging and navigation systems, positioning robots and additive-manufacturing patient-specific instrumentation (PSI). These generic technologies {{can be used for}} different applications, i. e. knee arthroplasty, spine instrumentation and bone tumor resection. Practically, these technologies enable surgeons to identify patient anatomy, define preoperative surgical planning and intraoperatively replicate this planning on the patient. Since 2010, there exists a standard protocol from ASTM society to assess technical specifications of navigation systems and positioning robots in CAOS [1]. The standard presents both parameters to be used and tracking tests to be performed to define accuracy and precision (bias and variability) of navigation and robotic systems. The logical continuation of this first ASTM standard is to develop new standard protocols to evaluate quality of bone-preparation tasks, i. e. bone cutting, milling, drilling and assembly of bone fragments, performed with the aid of such CAOS systems. This paper introduces a practical guide for orthopaedic surgeons to plan and evaluate bone-preparation tasks in CAOS. The pratical guide consists in a systematic six-steps approach to plan and evaluate a bone-preparation task, independent from the CAOS systems being used to execute the task. The practical guide also provides guidelines to implement the systematic approach for specific task and surgical application, i. e. femoral and tibial cutting in knee arthroplasty, vertebral drilling in spine instrumentation, and bone cutting and assembly in tumor surgery. Materials and methods Systematic approach to plan and evaluate bone-preparation tasks in CAOS The systematic approach is composed of six steps (Figure) : (1) Planning frame is defined as a coordinate system presenting three orthogonal axes (x, y, z) according to patient anatomy; (2) Target specification of the task (cutting, milling, drilling or assembly) is defined in the planning frame as <b>nominal</b> (<b>desired)</b> geometry of the bone being prepared; (3) Accepted tolerances on nominal geometry are defined with relevant quality indicators accounting for desired functional outcomes and the level of accuracy provided by available CAOS systems; (4) Evaluation frame is defined as a new coordinate system with three orthogonal axes being registered to planning frame; (5) Errors on nominal geometry are computed and expressed in the registered planning frame; (6) Computed errors are investigated to determine whether the geometrical tolerances are respected. Validation process The implementation of the systematic approach for a specific task during a CAOS surgery may be validated in two phases. First, in-vitro experimentation on synthetic bone models with realistic simulations of the CAOS surgery will enable to validate the relevancy of the quality indicators used to define the geometric tolerances on bone cutting and drilling. This step will also enable to statistically investigate input factors with potential significant effect on outputs of the planning and evaluation process (i. e. geometric distortion during 3 D reconstruction of medical images, manual identification of anatomical landmarks to define planning frame, semi-automatic registration between planning and evaluation frames, automatic identification of cut planes in postoperative images, [...] .). Second, in-vivo studies with data provided by actual CAOS surgeries will enable to validate the reliability of the planning and evaluation process. This step will also enable to detect potential irrelevancies and inconsistencies in the planning and evaluation of the task (i. e. the postoperative CT images are unsuitable for the evaluation process {{because of the presence of}} a metallic implant). Results The systematic approach is currently undergoing the validation process for three specific tasks and surgical applications: bone cutting in knee arthroplasty, bone drilling in spine instrumentation (pedicle screw insertion), and bone cutting and assembly in pelvic tumor surgery. Simulations currently performed on experimental models of the knee, spine and pelvis, are validating the relevancy of the planning and evaluation process of computer-assisted planar cutting and axial drilling of bones. We demonstrated that target specifications and geometrical tolerances can be defined by relevant quality indicators in accordance with ISO 1101 standard [2], such as location (L) and flatness (F) parameters for planar cutting of bones, and angularity (A) and position (P) for axial drilling. As an example, detailed information on the use of location L to evaluate bone-cutting can be found in [3]. Clinical studies are currently validating the reliability of the planning and evaluation process of planar cutting and axial drilling of bones with data taken from actual CAOS surgeries. For bone tumor surgery, we showed that a millimetric accuracy can be evaluated by registering pre- and postoperative CT images and computing location L between planned and achieved cuts. For spine surgery, we also showed that a millimetric accuracy of inserted pedicle screws (in terms of angularity A) can be measured using intra-operative fluoroscopic images and compared with the preoperative CT-based insertion planning. Discussion The work presented here in the form of a practical guide is a first step toward developing new standard protocols to evaluate quality of bone-preparation tasks that could be assisted with CAOS technologies. The philosophy of these new standard protocols is not only to perform a quantitative evaluation of the quality in CAOS, but also to improve the objectivity of the planning and evaluation process in CAOS. Practically, for surgeons, such a practical guide can serve as a standard application-specific protocol to evaluate how accurately a preoperative planning can be intraoperately replicated on the patient. For researchers, this can be a standard protocol to investigate performances of new CAOS technologies that are still in prototyping in laboratories. For industrials, this can be useful for the certification of new CAOS technologies that are ready for marketplace. In 2014, joint application to ISO and CAOS societies will aim the setting-up of a new international technical committee composed of voluntary academicians and industrials, surgeons and engineers, to develop new application-specific ISO standards dedicated to the planning and quality evaluation in CAOS.
