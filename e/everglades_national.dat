5|$|Establishment of the C made <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|<b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park {{reported}} in 2005 {{a budget of}} over $28million. Of that, $14.8million is granted from the National Park Service, and $13.5million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for vehicles in 2006 ranged from $10 to $200 for bus tours. Of the nearly one million visitors to <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a night for backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48million in local economies.

50|$|This apocalyptic {{scenario}} {{was laid}} out before Florida’s politicians, and {{in no time at}} all even the most slatternly among them was extolling the <b>Everglades</b> as a <b>national</b> treasure, that must be preserved at all costs.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{protecting}} {{a portion of the}} Everglades arose in 1905, a crystallized effort was formed in 1928 when Miami landscape designer Ernest F.

Recreational vehicle camping {{is available at}} these sites, but not with all necessary services. Backcountry permits are required for campsites along the Wilderness Waterway, Gulf Coast sites, and sites in the various keys. Several backcountry sites are chickees; others are beach and ground sites.|$|E
5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of Burmese pythons became established in <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park. Substantial American alligator populations in the Everglades may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on young alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect has been seen on overall American alligator populations.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic {{plant species}} {{actively}} reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida. The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in the Everglades than {{in their native}} Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million has been spent on keeping them out of <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park.|$|E

500|$|Douglas became {{involved}} in the Everglades in the 1920s, when she joined the board of the <b>Everglades</b> Tropical <b>National</b> Park Committee, a group led by Ernest F.

By the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, in 1969—at the age of 79—Douglas founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a jetport in the Big Cypress portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, [...] "It is a woman's business to be interested in the environment. It's an extended form of housekeeping." ...|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of sites that were {{previously}} listed as being in danger, but they were later removed from the list after improvements in management and conservation.

5|$|<b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park is a U.S. National Park in Florida {{that protects}} the {{southern}} 20percent of the original Everglades. In the United States, {{it is the largest}} tropical wilderness, the largest wilderness of any kind east of the Mississippi River, and is visited on average by one million people each year. It is the third-largest national park in the lower 48states after Death Valley and Yellowstone. It has been declared an International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, and a Wetland of International Importance, one of only three locations in the world to appear on all three lists.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Everglades</b> Tropical <b>National</b> Park Association was {{established}} by Coe in 1928 with Fairchild, University of Miami president Bowman Ashe, and journalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas on the committee. It followed two very destructive hurricanes that caused widespread flooding in Miami and from Lake Okeechobee. One of the association's primary selling points was to portray the proposed area that would receive protection as worthless for human habitation and commercial enterprise; so far controlling the natural floods in the region had met with no success and a tourist attraction such as the park would be favorable. Coe insisted that [...] "tropical" [...] {{be used in the}} park name, to allude to the salubrious nature of tropical weather. It invoked a foreign place to most Americans and reminded them that it was, at the time, the only tropical location within U.S. borders.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Creeks, escaped African slaves, and other Indians from {{northern}} Florida {{displaced by the}} Creek War formed the area's Seminole nation. After {{the end of the}} Seminole Wars in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to Indian territory near Oklahoma. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today Big Cypress National Preserve, to escape the forced emigration to the west. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and Miccosukee, a similar but linguistically unique tribe, lived in relative isolation, making their living by trading. In 1928, surveying and construction began on the Tamiami Trail, along the northern border of <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park. The road not only bisected the Everglades but also introduced a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.|$|E

5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E
5|$|Severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic {{damage and}} {{flooding}} from Lake Okeechobee {{that prompted the}} Army Corps of Engineers to build a dike around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.|$|E

The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to <b>Everglades</b> <b>National</b> Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Everglades</b> Headwaters <b>National</b> Wildlife Refuge (EHNWR) and Conservation Area, when completed, {{will serve}} {{to protect the}} upland {{habitats}} and wetlands of the Everglades watersheds. Completing the "reserve design” for this protected area involves many ecological, social, and political factors to successfully identify parcels of land for protection. Land acquisition choices are difficult because it typically takes many years to gather the funds to purchase all necessary parcels of land, and initial land acquisition planning could be complicated by future conditions such as projected climate and urbanization changes across the landscape. To meet the reserve design needs of the EHNWR, we used the conservation planning software Marxan to allocate the targets among two “zones” representing different methods of protection: fee-simple purchase and conservation easement agreements. Projections from urban growth models revealed how climate change could affect the study area by examining how urbanization associated with people moving inland from the coast might affect the availability of parcels {{for inclusion in the}} reserve...|$|R
