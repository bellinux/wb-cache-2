In the 1980 s, Chile, Mexico, and Bolivia were among the continent`s first nations to slash tariff rates and virtually eliminate quantitative restrictions on imports.

Therefore, {{it is very}} important to find good animal models to characterise the events of this severe disease. In 1984, Mizunuma et al. developed a new type of experimental necrotizing pancreatitis by intraperitoneal administration of a high dose of L-arginine in rats. This non-invasive model is highly reproducible and produces selective, dose-dependent acinar cell necrosis. Not only <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> model to study the pathomechanisms of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, but it is also excellent to observe and influence the time course changes of the disease.

This "Reflections" article examines the potential for further investment opportunities, the case for government intervention, and the evidence on the effectiveness of the various forms of intervention. The evidence suggests that the challenge of breaking down the barriers is more difficult than conventional wisdom would have us believe. Internalizing externalities and assuring an adequate flow of information is helpful, but not likely to be sufficient. The significant challenges posed by these barriers suggest that policy makers must recognize an expanded set of barriers and respond with some ingenuity in applying an expanded set of available instruments.

40|$|Many {{economic}} reforms are undertaken {{at a time}} of economic crisis. But <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time for a country to undertake trade reform? In this paper we investigate whether an economic crisis at the time of trade liberalisation affects a country’s subsequent growth performance. We employ threshold regression techniques on five crisis indicators commonly used in the literature, to identify the relevant “crisis values” and to estimate the differential postliberalisation growth effects in the crisis and non-crisis regimes. We find that the magnitude of the acceleration in postliberalisation growth depends on the characteristics of the crisis. Although trade liberalisation in both crisis and non-crisis periods raises subsequent growth, an internal crisis implies a lower acceleration and an external crisis a higher acceleration relative to the non-crisis regime...|$|E
