40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the sentence-final aspectual <b>particles</b> in <b>Mandarin</b> <b>Chinese</b> are in fact head-initial; it is the {{movement}} of the complements of these particles to the specifier positions that renders these particles sentence-final. Evidence for this claim comes from the CED effect of the moved complement: the predicate of a sentence with a sentence-final aspectual particle is an island to movement. This discovery supports Kayne’s (1994) proposal, according to which surface head-final constructions derive from underlying head-initial structures via movement of the complement to a higher specifier position...|$|R

Classification of the different uses of the particle de has been of interest to linguists and computational linguists alike, not least because of its importance for machine translation from Chinese to English. The primary aim of this thesis is to describe and, where necessary, systemize existing classifications of the noun phrase internal occurrences of de. To this end, we have built a small-annotated corpus of de constructions using the TypeCraft Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) Repository. In addition, we have made use of the TypeCraft Mandarin corpus as the data source for our linguistic classification of de constructions. This thesis distinguishes the uses of de in modification and relativisation structures, and explores sequences of de-attributes...|$|R
5000|$|A major use of sentence-final <b>particles</b> in <b>Mandarin</b> <b>Chinese</b> {{specifically}} {{is thought}} to be as a signal of the speaker's attitude, the intended force of the statement to which the particle is attached, and [...] "how the utterance is to be taken by the hearer." [...] For example, the addition of a particle may soften the tone of a question that might sound presumptuous or inappropriate without the particle. As such, sentence-final particles in this sense often perform an interpersonal function, rather than a grammatical one. Nevertheless, there are cases in which sentence-final particles do perform grammatical functions, such as Mandarin ma 嗎/吗, the [...] "question particle," [...] which changes the grammatical mood of a sentence to interrogative. Likewise, even though sentence-final particles can usually be omitted from a sentence without making the sentence ungrammatical or changing its meaning, some particles do contain information critical to the interpretation of an utterance's meaning, such as Mandarin le 了.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a {{proposal}} for a relevance-theoretic description of the use of the <b>particle</b> ba in <b>Mandarin</b> <b>Chinese.</b> The result of the analyses of the data shows that ba is a pragmatic marker with a similar function in declaratives, interrogatives and imperatives, i. e. to indicate hearer-oriented weak commitment towards either the proposition expressed (declaratives, interrogatives) or the speech act expressed (imperatives). The results also indicate that ba can be compared to tags such as English yeah, right? and innit? and that it is often used more generally to engage the hearer in the conversation and expressing politeness with no real intention of allowing for a response or confirmation from him/her...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates pragmatic factors {{affecting}} {{the development of}} the focus <b>particle</b> lian in <b>Mandarin</b> <b>Chinese.</b> An analysis of lian’s evolution in historical texts demonstrates that lian’s semantic transformation from con-crete activity to abstract grammatical meaning involved two major processes: metaphorization and inferencing. More importantly, this study provides evidence to show that due to the isolating characteristic, 1) Chinese does not restrict metaphorization to any particular category of lexical items, as Indo-European languages do (cf. Heine 1993); 2) different kinds of inferencing have affected lian in its process of semantic change and grammaticalization as opposed to the claim that different kinds of inferencing occur with differ-ent types of lexical items (cf. Traugott and König 1991); and 3) both diver- 42 gence and desemantization are the results of lian’s grammaticalization. Unlike similar cases in Indo-European languages, lian has not become in-creasingly morphologized as it becomes more grammaticalized. 1...|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{is noted}} for its rich {{inventory}} of particles that help to form sentences. However, a precise definition of particle is hard to achieve due to its wide range of forms and functions. Most words {{that are hard to}} categorize are dumped into this class. Naturally, there are two consequences that come out of this: 1) the difference is huge among groups and subgroups; 2) {{there seems to be no}} interconnectedness between groups. In these circumstances, this study mainly aims to address two issues: a) to establish particle as a theoretical construct that is distinguishable from other well-established constructs, and b) to present a unified analysis of the syntax of particles in Chinese. Through a close examination on particles in the cross-linguistic literature, it is found that <b>particles</b> in <b>Mandarin</b> <b>Chinese</b> are characterized by syntactic deficiency, i. e. inability to project. This study thus defines a Chinese particle as a ‘non-projecting word which is adjoined to X^(0,). A systematic account of particles in Chinese has remained as a conundrum due to their diversity. This study concerns two groups of <b>particles</b> in <b>Mandarin</b> <b>Chinese,</b> namely the structural particles and the verbal particles. The former has long been discussed in Chinese literature, while the latter is evolved out of this study. It is adequately shown that the so-called ‘verb-complement compounds’ in traditional Chinese literature are indeed ‘verb-particle combinations’. Accordingly, three types of verbal particles are specified in this study: aspectual, resultative, and directional. The syntactic behaviours of the structural particles and the verbal particles are intensively explored in this study. A unified analysis of these particles is achieved under the framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar. It turns out that all of them share the same representation at c-structure. As a non-projecting category, the particle is head-adjoined to X and thus the formation of a syntactic construct. In other words, the particle is syntactically combined rather than lexically combined, represented by two nodes in a tree diagram. Their grammatical functions can be captured at f-structure with two possibilities: a co-head or an XCOMP. The same analysis is generalized to the syntax of the particle ge and the verbal particles in Cantonese. It is proved that particles in Cantonese also feature syntactic deficiency (i. e. inability to project). This dissertation is among the first of its kind to provide a unified analysis of the syntax of particles in Chinese. It is observed that certain particles are quite distinguishable from other word classes by their phrase structural realization. Different from previous studies that have tried to classify particles mainly according to their meanings and functions, this study explores another possibility: particles in Chinese can be captured structurally as a coherent group. published_or_final_versionLinguisticsDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
