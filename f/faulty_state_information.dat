40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{effective}} way for the diagnosis of discrete-event systems by using a timed automaton. It {{is based on the}} model-checking technique, thanks to the time analysis of the timed model. This paper gives a method to construct all timed models and details the different steps used to obtain the diagnosis path. A dynamic model with temporal transitions is proposed in order to model the system. By "dynamical model", we mean an extension of timed automata for which the <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> are identified. The model of the studied system contains the faultless functioning states and all the <b>faulty</b> <b>states.</b> Our method is based on the backward exploitation of the dynamic model, where all possible reverse paths are searched. The reverse path is the connection of the <b>faulty</b> <b>state</b> to the initial state. The diagnosis method is based on the coherence between the occurrence time of the fault and the reverse path length. A simple real-world batch process is used to demonstrate the modeling steps and the proposed backward time analysis method to reach the diagnosis results...|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). System health {{diagnostics}} provides diversified benefits such as improved safety, improved reliability and reduced costs for the operation and maintenance of engineered systems. Successful health diagnostics requires the knowledge of system failures. However, with an increasing system complexity, it is extraordinarily difficult to have a well-tested system so that all potential <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> can be realized and studied at product testing stage. Thus, real time health diagnostics requires automatic detection of unexampled system <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> based upon sensory data to avoid sudden catastrophic system failures. This paper presents a trifold hybrid classification (THC) approach for structural health diagnosis with unexampled health states (UHS), which comprises of preliminary VHS identification using a new thresholded Mahalanobis distance (TMD) classifier, VHS diagnostics using a two-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and exampled health states diagnostics using a multi-class SVM classifier. The proposed THC approach, which takes the advantages of both TMD and SVM-based classification techniques, is able to identify and isolate the unexampled <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> through interactively detecting the deviation of sensory data from the exampled health states and forming new ones autonomously. The proposed THC approach is further extended to a generic framework for health diagnostics problems with unexampled <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> and demonstrated with health diagnostics case studies for power transformers and rolling bearings.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} diagnosability of discrete-time {{nonlinear}} systems with unknown inputs and quantized outputs. We propose a novel notion of diagnosability that we term approximate diagnosability, {{corresponding to the}} possibility of detecting within a finite delay and within a given accuracy if a set of <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> is reached or not. Addressing diagnosability in an approximate sense is primarily motivated by the fact that system outputs in concrete applications are measured by sensors that introduce measurement errors. Consequently, {{it is not possible to}} detect exactly if the state of the system has reached or not the set of <b>faulty</b> <b>states.</b> In order to check approximate diagnosability on the class of nonlinear systems we use tools from formal methods. We first derive a symbolic model approximating the original system within any desired accuracy. This step allows us to check approximate diagnosability of the symbolic model. We then establish the relation between approximate diagnosability of the symbolic model and of the original nonlinear system. Comment: 7 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four published or accepted journal articles that {{address some of the}} key problems in prognostics and health management area (PHM). Effective health diagnostics and prognostics provide multifarious benefits such as improved safety, improved reliability and reduced costs for operation and maintenance (O&M) of complex engineered systems. Extensive literature reviews on PHM for diagnostics of system health conditions and O&M decision-making for complex engineered systems have identified important challenge problems for this dissertation as follows: - Effective diagnostics of current health states based on heterogeneous sensory data from multiple sensors is an intricate problem for condition monitoring techniques to be applied on complex engineered systems, mainly due to high system complexity and sensory data heterogeneity; - With an increasing system complexity, it is extraordinarily difficult to have a well-tested system so that all potential <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> can be realized and studied at product testing stage. Thus, real time health diagnostics requires automatic detection of unexampled system <b>faulty</b> <b>states</b> based upon sensory data to avoid sudden catastrophic system failures; - Despite successful applications of different diagnostic algorithms in various engineering fields, a challenge for health diagnostics is that an implicit relationship between different system health states and features of sensory signals makes it difficult to develop a generally applicable health diagnostics technique. - Although diagnostics and prognostics can provide valuable information for proactive actions in preventing system failures, their benefits have not been fully utilized for the O&M decision-making process. To carefully address these important research problems, this dissertation proposes four research solutions: a multi-sensor health diagnostics technique using deep belief network, a tri-fold hybrid classification approach for diagnostics with unexampled <b>faulty</b> <b>states,</b> a multi-attribute classification fusion technique to develop a generally applicable health diagnostics framework and a generic prognostics-informed O&M decision-making framework by utilizing failure prediction information in the O&M decision-making process.
