5|$|The sand {{devil is}} found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to the Florida Keys, where it is fairly common. It also occurs in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and there are additional unconfirmed records from Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The southern extent of its range is uncertain due to confusion with the disparate angelshark (S. <b>heteroptera)</b> and Mexican angelshark (S. mexicana). This bottom-dwelling shark is found over sandy or muddy bottoms on the continental shelf and slope.|$|E
25|$|Tessaratomidae is {{classified}} under order Hemiptera (true bugs), suborder <b>Heteroptera,</b> infraorder Pentatomomorpha, and superfamily Pentatomoidea (shield bugs and stink bugs). It is currently {{divided into three}} subfamilies: Natalicolinae (with 8 genera), Oncomerinae (with 15 genera), and Tessaratominae (with 33 genera and one of uncertain placement).|$|E
25|$|There is {{insufficient}} {{information about the}} invertebrate and lower forms of India, with significant work having been done only in a few groups of insects, notably the butterflies, odonates, hymenoptera, the larger coleoptera and <b>heteroptera.</b> Few concerted attempts to document the biodiversity have been made {{since the publication of}} The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma series.|$|E
25|$|Scutellerids {{were first}} {{described}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in 1815. It belongs to the order Hemiptera (true bugs), under the suborder <b>Heteroptera</b> and infraorder Pentatomomorpha. They are classified under the superfamily Pentatomoidea. They were formerly classified as a subfamily of Pentatomidae by George Willis Kirkaldy in 1909. The earliest attempt to restore them to family status was in 1917 by Edward Payson Van Duzee. Most authorities today regard it as a valid family group.|$|E
25|$|Scutelleridae is {{a family}} of true bugs. They are {{commonly}} known as jewel bugs or metallic shield bugs due to their often brilliant coloration. They are also known as shield-backed bugs due to the enlargement of the last section of their thorax into a continuous shield over the abdomen and wings. This latter characteristic distinguishes them from most other families within <b>Heteroptera,</b> and may lead to misidentification as a beetle rather than a bug. These insects feed on plant juices from a variety of different species, including some commercial crops. Closely related to stink bugs, they may also produce an offensive odour when disturbed. There are around 450 species worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, {{during the}} Late Triassic, mycetophagous, or fungus feeding species of beetle (i.e., Cupedidae) {{appear in the}} fossil record. In the stages of the Upper Triassic representatives of the algophagous, or algae feeding species (i.e., Triaplidae and Hydrophilidae) begin to appear, as well as predatory water beetles. The first {{primitive}} weevils appear (i.e., Obrienidae), {{as well as the}} first representatives of the rove beetles (i.e., Staphylinidae), which show no marked difference in physique compared to recent species. This was also around the first time evidence of diverse freshwater insect fauna appeared. Some of the oldest living families also appear around during the Triassic, including from Hemiptera: Cercopidae, Cicadellidae, Cixiidae, and Membracidae; from Coleoptera: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, and Trachypachidae; from Hymenoptera: Xyelidae; From Diptera: Anisopodidae, Chironomidae, and Tipulidae. The first flies (Diptera), Hymenoptera, and true dragonflies (Odonata), <b>Heteroptera,</b> and Thysanoptera. The first true species of Diptera are known from the Middle Triassic, becoming widespread during the Middle and Late Triassic. A single large wing from a species of Diptera in the Triassic (10mm instead of usual 2–6mm) was found in Australia (Mt. Crosby). This family Tilliardipteridae, despite of the numerous 'tipuloid' features, should be included in Psychodomorpha sensu Hennig on account of loss of the convex distal 1A reaching wing margin and formation of the anal loop.|$|E
2500|$|Aphids {{are in the}} {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the Sternorrhyncha {{division of}} the order Hemiptera. Late 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon [...] "Homoptera" [...] to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (e.g., cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder <b>Heteroptera</b> containing {{a large group of}} insects known as the true bugs. Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank. The most recent authoritative classifications place all extant taxa into a single large family Aphididae. Despite their names, taxonomically, the woolly conifer aphids like the pine aphid, the spruce aphid, and the balsam woolly aphid are not true aphids, but adelgids, and lack the cornicles of true aphids.|$|E
2500|$|Broscus cephalotes are {{primarily}} carnivorous beetles; however they will consume {{a wide variety}} of food. [...] They are generalists, and the adults do not discriminate much in what they consume. A recent study showed that B. cephalotes, in laboratory conditions, will attack everything that runs across the opening of its burrow, though they preferred to attack and eat woodlice and ants. Some of what has been found in various beetles’ digestive tract include: plant material, various types of ants, Lycosidae, Aphididae, Lepidopterous larvae, Diptera, Acarina, Bibionidae, Coleoptera, adult Lepidoptera, and <b>Heteroptera.</b> However, there has been no evidence of cannibalism in this species of beetle. [...] The food of the larvae of this family has not been as widely studied because the larvae spend their time in subterranean tunnels and are difficult to identify even when not hidden in the soil. [...] What has been studied of the larvae’s diet shows that the larvae are more carnivorous than their adult counterparts and more restricted diet. [...] The limited diet may be due to their subterranean habitat and their small size. [...] Additionally, the larvae of any Carabidae beetle tend to be fluid feeders, regardless of their status as adults.|$|E
2500|$|It can be assumed, that Hahn was {{in close}} contact with the universally known natural {{scientist}} Jakob Sturm and probably with his two sons. He named a spider species after Jakob: Araneus Sturmii, now Atea sturmi (Hahn, 1831). His relationship with Johann Georg Wagler must have been similarly close. He also named a spider species after him: Lÿcosa Waglerii, now Pardosa wagleri (Hahn, 1822). Nothing reliable is known about other contacts within the remarkably productive Nuremberg zoologist scene. Nor is there any proof, that Hahn knew Franz von Paula (von) Schrank personally, a highly regarded natural scientist, to whom he dedicated the [...] "Monograph on Spiders". The scientific value of Hahn's lifework in natural history varies. His ornithological work, for example, never had any discernible influence on this field. On the other hand, Hahn's work on the true bugs (<b>Heteroptera)</b> {{is just as important as}} his works on spiders (Araneae). One species of bug even carries his name: Lopus hahni Stål, 1860. He was also given this honour in the field of arachnology: Carl Ludwig Koch, who continued [...] "Die Arachniden" [...] after Hahn's death, called a genus after him in 1841 (Hahnia), on which later the name of the whole family was based – Hahniidae Bertkau, 1878.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} remains whether this affinity between the Coleorrhyncha and the <b>Heteroptera</b> necessitates {{the imposition of}} a suborder between them and the order Hemiptera. In 1995 Sorensen proposed the name Prosorrhyncha for such suborder. (See the <b>Heteroptera</b> and Prosorrhyncha pages for a discussion).|$|E
50|$|The {{disparate}} angelshark (Squatina <b>heteroptera)</b> is {{a species}} of angelshark. It occurs at depths down to 164 m in the Gulf of Mexico and reaches a length of 49 cm. <b>Heteroptera</b> in its name refers to the difference in size, shape and area of the two dorsal fins.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, the {{modified}} approach of placing Coleorrhyncha 'within' the <b>Heteroptera</b> can be used. Indeed, as that solution preserves the well-known <b>Heteroptera</b> at the taxonomic rank they traditionally hold while making {{them a good}} monophyletic group, it seems preferable to the paraphyletic [...] "Heteroptera" [...] used in older works. In that case, the [...] "core" [...] <b>Heteroptera</b> {{could be considered a}} section - as yet unnamed, mainly because the Prosorrhyncha were proposed earlier - within the [...] "expanded" [...] <b>Heteroptera,</b> or the latter could simply be described as consisting of a basal [...] "living fossil" [...] lineage and a more apomorphic main radiation. Whether the name [...] "Coleorrhyncha" [...] is to be retained for the basal lineage or whether the more consistent [...] "Peloridiomorpha" [...] is used instead is a matter of taste, as described below.|$|E

5000|$|In one revised {{classification}} {{proposed in}} 1995, {{the name of}} the suborder is Prosorrhyncha, and <b>Heteroptera</b> is a rankless subgroup within it. The only difference between <b>Heteroptera</b> and Prosorrhyncha is that the latter includes the family Peloridiidae, which is a tiny relictual group that is in its own monotypic superfamily and infraorder. In other words, the <b>Heteroptera</b> and Prosorrhyncha sensu Sorensen et al. are identical except that Prosorrhyncha contains one additional infraorder, called Peloridiomorpha (comprising only 13 small genera). The ongoing conflict between traditional, Linnaean classifications and nontraditional classifications is exemplified by the problem inherent in continued usage of the name <b>Heteroptera</b> when it no longer can be matched to any standard Linnaean rank (as it falls below suborder but above infraorder). If this classification succeeds, then the [...] "Heteroptera" [...] grouping may be discarded, but in that case it is likely that no ranks will be used at all according to the standards of phylogenetic nomenclature.|$|E
