6000|$|The King's Counsel {{pointed to}} the woman's declaration; to which the counsel replied--"A {{production}} concocted {{in a moment of}} terror and agony, and which approached to insanity," [...] he said, [...] "his learned brother well knew was no sound evidence against the party who emitted it. It was true, that a judicial confession, in presence of the Justices themselves, was the strongest of all proof, insomuch that it is said in law, that 'in confitentem nullae sunt partes judicis.' But this was true of judicial confession only, by which law meant that which is made in presence of the justices, and the sworn inquest. Of <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>confession,</b> all authorities held with the illustrious Farinaceus and Matthaeus, 'confessio extrajudicialis in se nulla est; et quod nullum est, non potest adminiculari.' It was totally inept, and void of all strength and effect from the beginning; incapable, therefore, of being bolstered up or supported, or, according to the law phrase, adminiculated, by other presumptive circumstances. In the present case, therefore, letting the <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>confession</b> go, as it ought to go, for nothing," [...] he contended, [...] "the prosecutor had not made out the second quality of the statute, that a live child had been born; and that, at least, ought to be established before presumptions were received that it had been murdered. If any of the assize," [...] he said, [...] "should be of opinion that this was dealing rather narrowly with the statute, they ought to consider that it was in its nature highly penal, and therefore entitled to no favourable construction." ...|$|E

50|$|Six defendants, {{including}} Peiper, {{complained to}} the court {{that they had been}} victims of physical violence or threats of violence meant to force them to provide <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>confessions.</b> The defendants were invited to confirm the statements they had made under oath. Of the nine who testified, only three had claimed mistreatment they had suffered. For most of the accused, the defense argued that they either had not participated, or had done so by obeying a superior's orders. The court ruled that {{all but one of the}} defendants were guilty in some degree. Forty-three were sentenced to death, including Peiper; the rest were sentenced to from ten years to life in prison. Dietrich received a life sentence and Priess 20 years imprisonment.|$|R
