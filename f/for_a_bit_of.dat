25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
500|$|Sonic Rs soundtrack was {{particularly}} divisive. Nutter described the [...] "storm of controversy [...] surrounds the accompanying music", which [...] "has come in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a slagging on the Internet recently for {{the addition of}} vocals." [...] Although he was [...] "not a particular fan of dance music", Nutter stated that the tracks were [...] "better than most chart stuff", while the included instrumental versions were sufficient [...] "to appease everyone". Sackenheim offered high praise for [...] "One of the most inspired soundtracks I've ever heard", while MacDonald commented: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} more games should have songs with vocals. It gives the game so much more personality". Conversely, Dan Elektro deplored the [...] "unbelievably annoying music". Computer and Video Games complimented the music, saying it [...] "fits the Sonic style perfectly", and is reminiscent of Sonic CDs soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, Lamont and Scottish Labour faced {{criticism}} {{after the}} party voted against an SNP motion that included the introduction of free school meals for pupils in their {{first three years of}} primary education, and a commitment to childcare for pre-school children. The motion also contained measures that would only be implemented in the event of Scottish independence, something Labour said it could not support. Recalling her experience of teaching underprivileged children, Lamont told the parliament that free school meals would not be her priority, and tabled an unsuccessful amendment calling for greater childcare provisions instead. The motion was later passed by a majority of 67–46. In The Daily Telegraph, Cochrane wrote that the strategy had allowed the SNP to claim Labour opposed the principle of free school meals because they [...] "fell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> skulduggery that Ms Lamont and her business managers should have seen coming a mile off".|$|E
500|$|This {{brought the}} {{regiment}} into contact {{for the first}} time with someone it would later meet more seriously, Brigadier Bernard Law Montgomery (often referred to as [...] "Monty"), then commanding the 9th Infantry Brigade in Portsmouth. In 1937, the brigade was on an exercise in Wiltshire and RWY was attached to it for their two-week annual camp. The brigade major wrote that [...] " [...] was run like so much of the TA those days on rather feudal lines...when they heard they were going to have those tremendous exercises – three nights out at a time – they jibbed violently....Most of them had looked forward to exercises all day and then going out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> jollity at night." [...] The upshot was that the regiment was banished to a distant part of the camp where their socialising would not be disturbed by the Regulars. However, apparently the Yeomanry were so intrigued by Monty's exercises that their Commanding Officer (CO) approached him, asking to be included in the last brigade exercise.|$|E
500|$|Most critics felt KMFDM {{stayed close}} to its usual sound on WTF?!. [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic commented, [...] "The 'ultra heavy beat' sounds as 'ultra' and 'heavy' as ever on WTF?!" [...] He {{went on to say}} the album was [...] "an {{outstanding}} blast of dark dancefloor destruction" [...] and saying the album should be on [...] "the top shelf". [...] Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't [...] "break new creative ground" [...] on WTF?!, which he said wasn't the [...] "heaviest, fastest or most experimental album", it was [...] "still rock-solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments". [...] Ilker Yücel of ReGen Magazine called WTF?! a [...] "hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual". [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "In short, it’s KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's not a bad thing at all." [...] Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, [...] "WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person". [...] He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, [...] "This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> roughage on their playlist." [...] Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! [...] "a solid release bursting with power and determination". [...] She also said of KMFDM, [...] "musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which is not a bad thing".|$|E

Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine categorised Hilary Duff as [...] "a virtual companion to Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography, from its rock/dance-pop fusion to its earnest demeanor" [...] and [...] "a varied, ambitious album ... it feels like the soundtrack to the life of a smart, ambitious, popular teenager trying to sort things out".|$|E
2500|$|Triathletes {{will often}} use their legs less vigorously and more {{carefully}} than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes {{to compensate for}} turbulent, aerated water and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use [...] "dolphin kicking" [...] and diving to make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave's energy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> speed {{at the end of}} the swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate [...] "sighting": raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.|$|E
2500|$|In a post-modern {{thesis on}} the superhero genre Michael Lecker wrote, [...] "In the superhero genre, clothes {{do the talking}} through semiotics, which [...] Barthes {{discusses}} in depth in his work: The 'first, literal message serves as a support for a second meaning, of a generally affective or ideological order' (Roland Barthes). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody." [...] In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, [...] "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that {{we know it is}} not. Fetishism is used as an excuse <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalk)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many critics gave [...] "Take Control" [...] {{positive}} reviews. Rolling Stone placed [...] "Take Control" [...] {{at number}} 92 on {{its list of}} The 100 Best Songs of the Year. Ryan Dombal of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "'Take Control' may be an ode to submission, but it hardly holds back." [...] Tom Breihan of The Village Voice named [...] "Take Control" [...] the fifth best single release of {{the fourth quarter of}} 2006, commenting on [...] "how great Amerie's joyous chirp sounds over sharp, percussive old-school funk tracks. Here, Cee-Lo laces her with spy-movie guitars and horn-stabs and a drum track that keeps building and building, adding on congas and handclaps and tambourines without ever disturbing the tense little groove at the song's center [...] and Amerie finally finds room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> grit in her voice." [...] The Guardians Alex Macpherson wrote that the track [...] "twitches and jerks along a nagging Tom Zé sample, but it's a song with such a sparse arrangement that interest has to be sustained entirely by the voice, which Amerie does spectacularly, making it absolutely clear who is really cracking the whip." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speculation {{increased}} when on-location photos emerged, showing Kathy with police outside a house, which looks similar to scenes already shown of Sharon visiting {{the street where}} her father lives, and both scenes took place in Notting Hill. Carl Greenwood from the Daily Mirror said that [...] "Two huge EastEnders storylines could be set to converge" [...] if Gavin is Sharon's father. An EastEnders source said: [...] "Eagle-eyed viewers will spot police {{are in the same}} area as Sharon was looking for her dad". Brown later said that it would [...] "be a treat" [...] to see Gavin revealed as Sharon's father, as it would also make him the grandfather of Dennis [...] "Denny" [...] Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau), Sharon's son with Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), and said [...] "Something tells me that Gavin wouldn't be cheery grandpa offering up the Werther's Originals to Denny while they watch the Antiques Roadshow together. More likely, he'd be getting him down Basher Jim's <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> boxing training before introducing him into his criminal empire." [...] However, All About Soap wondered if Phil had actually sent Sharon to a fake address. Amy Duncan from the Metro said, [...] "perhaps there are just two Gavins with links to Albert Square living in Notting Hill." [...] Duncan Lindsay from the Metro wondered if Phil might know that Gavin is Sharon's father, which is why he did not want Sharon to track down her real father and also speculated that Gavin could be related to the character Dan Sullivan, who was played by Craig Fairbrass between 1999 and 2001 and was one of Phil's enemies.|$|E
2500|$|In early September, it was {{reported}} that Kat would confess the affair to Alfie, but would refuse to name the man involved. Shane Richie spoke to Inside Soap, saying that Alfie has no reason to believe Kat is cheating on him, assumes she is just partaking in harmless flirtation, and fully trusts her. He opined that Alfie believes Kat would not lie to him after having affairs in the past, but does not believe her excuses when she receives flowers from her lover. This leads to Kat confessing. Richie said that Alfie's [...] "heart [...] break in two". Richie went on to describe the Moons' marriage as [...] "a bit staid" [...] because Alfie is [...] "set in his ways" [...] while Kat is [...] "out looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> fun." [...] He explained that Alfie is very committed to Kat, and is [...] "in this marriage for the long run." [...] He said that viewers may not want to see Kat and Alfie totally happy, describing them as [...] "like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor [...] They can't be with each other and they can't be without each other." [...] He then promised that [...] "what happens to Alfie next is absolutely great!" [...] When asked what Alfie might do when he finds out who Kat is having the affair with, Richie said that he would get revenge, as [...] "everyone forgets Alfie's been in jail. Marriage has taken off his edge, but if he finds out his wife has been with one of his closest friends, well, any bloke would want to cut the other blokes knackers [...] off, wouldn't he?" [...] Richie added that the cast were [...] "thrilled" [...] with the storyline, saying that everyone involved is enjoying it. It was confirmed that viewers would not find out who Kat was having the affair with at this time, and that suspects would still be eliminated one at a time. Inside Soap then reported that a second suspect would be eliminated [...] "very soon". Michael was then eliminated in the episode broadcast on 14 September.|$|E
