40|$|STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING ON THE GROWTH RATE OF 5 MONTH OLD INFANT AT THE BOGOR REGENCY Background: Growth faltering {{of infants}} In Indonesia started at their early life i. e 1 - 3 month of their age. Growth faltering appear mainly {{due to the}} {{supplementary}} feeding practice which is not adequate for their requirement. Objectives: The objectives of this research are to evaluate the effect of food supplementation which made by industry. The food contains allmicronutrient as well as macronutrients that are needed {{for the growth of}} 5 month infant. Methods: Research design is quasi experimental. Data analysis were used univariat, bivariat, multivariat analysis (linear regression) to find out independent variable which most influenced to the weight increase of the sample. Sample population are infants 5 month old from the poor families at Kemang and Ciomas district which fulfill the inclusion of criteria. The treatment group (53 samples) received intervention in form of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> made by industry containing energy 197 kcal and 4, 8 gram protein, given 48 gram/day for 4 months period, on the other hand the control group (51 samples) did not receive food intervention. The foods were distributed weekly. Data collection (anthropometries measurement) of infant every months during 4 months period of this research. Results: After 4 months intervention, the weight of treatment group has higher increase  than the control group which is  1, 30 kg for the treatment group and 0, 52 kg for the control group. Growth rate during 4 months period {{can be seen from the}} z score point according to weight for age and weight for length indexes. Z score showed significant difference (p< 0, 005) between the two groups. At treatment group although the growth rate tend to decrease it was stil on the normal rate while in the control group the growth development were sharply decrease below the normal weight (< 2 SD). Conclusions: Intervention by <b>formulated</b> <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> made by industry increased body weight significally.

40|$|Abstract Background Enprocal is a high-protein micro-nutrient rich <b>formulated</b> <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> {{designed}} to meet the nutritional needs of the frail elderly and be delivered to them in every day foods. We studied the potential of Enprocal to improve gut and immune health using simple and robust bioassays for gut cell proliferation, intestinal integrity/permeability, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. Effects of Enprocal were compared with whey protein concentrate 80 (WPC), heat treated skim milk powder, and other commercially available milk derived products. Results Enprocal (undigested) and digested (Enprocal D) selectively enhanced cell proliferation in normal human intestinal epithelial cells (FHs 74 -Int) and showed no cytotoxicity. In a dose dependent manner Enprocal induced cell death in Caco- 2 cells (human colon adencarcinoma epithelial cells). Digested Enprocal (Enprocal D: gut enzyme cocktail treated) maintained the intestinal integrity in transepithelial resistance (TEER) assay, increased the permeability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and did not induce oxidative stress to the gut epithelial cells. Enprocal D upregulated the surface expression of co-stimulatory (CD 40, CD 86, CD 80), MHC I and MHC II molecules on PMA differentiated THP- 1 macrophages in coculture transwell model, and inhibited the monocyte/lymphocyte (THP- 1 /Jurkat E 6 - 1 cells) -epithelial cell adhesion. In cytokine secretion analyses, Enprocal D down-regulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 β and TNF-α) and up-regulated IFN-γ, IL- 2 and IL- 10. Conclusion Our results indicate that Enprocal creates neither oxidative injury nor cytotoxicity, stimulates normal gut cell proliferation, up regulates immune cell activation markers and may aid in the production of antibodies. Furthermore, through downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, Enprocal appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of chronic gut inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Stimulation of normal human fetal intestinal cell proliferation without cell cytotoxicity indicates it may also be given as infant food particularly for premature babies. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of wild birds with <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> has increased substantially over recent decades. While {{it is assumed}} that provisioning birds is beneficial, supplementary feeding can have detrimental ‘carry-over’ effects on reproductive traits. Due to difficulties in monitoring individual feeding behaviour, assessing how individuals within a population vary in their exploitation of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> resources has been limited. Quantifying individual consumption of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> is necessary to understand the operation of carry-over effects at the individual level. We used Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and automated feeders to estimate individual consumption of <b>supplementary</b> winter <b>food</b> in a large wild population of great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. Using these data, we identified demographic factors that explained individual variation in levels of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> consumption. We also tested for carry-over effects of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> consumption on recruitment, reproductive success and a measure of survival. Individual variation in consumption of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> was explained by differences between species, ages, sexes and years. Individuals were consistent across time in their usage of supplementary resources. We found no strong evidence that the extent of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> consumption directly influenced subsequent fitness parameters. Such effects may instead result from <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> influencing population demographics by enhancing the survival and subsequent breeding of less competitive individuals, which reduce average breeding parameters and increase density-dependent competition. Carry-over effects of supplementary feeding are not universal and may depend upon the temporal availability of the food provided.

40|$|The {{amount of}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> humans provide to wild animals is increasing, yet the full {{effects of this}} {{provisioning}} remain unclear. For these effects to be assessed at the levels of both the population and the individual, {{the degree to which}} individuals are using this resource must be quantified. Traditional approaches rely on observations of feeding animals and analysis of gut contents and feces, but these have several limitations. Stable-isotope analysis can overcome some of these. If <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> items are isotopically distinct from natural ones, the relative contribution of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> to the diet may be quantified accurately. We demonstrate how the isotopic signature of <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> can be manipulated to increase their discrimination from natural food sources and provide an example of the utility of this approach in a supplementary feeding study. We provided <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> over a winter, then sampled birds during the following breeding season and analyzed their claws for their isotopic signature to estimate diet choices. The results highlight considerable variation in individuals' use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food,</b> both within a study site and between different sites. Often the results from supplementation experiments are inconclusive. Even within the same species there can be an effect in one year or location but not in others, so a method for quantifying variation in food uptake could help in interpretation of the results.

40|$|Food {{availability}} has {{a considerable}} {{impact on the}} survival and reproductive output of individuals within a population. In order to support natural populations, <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> can be provided to natural populations {{with the aim of}} improving reproduction or survival of individuals. In a less scientific way, <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> is also provided to garden birds as a leisure pursuit. The provision of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> source to garden birds is a widespread and popular activity throughout the UK, but the full impact of this still requires extensive research. Relatively little is known about how a wide range of species use garden bird feeders, but there are also some gaps in our understanding of which individuals within a species are utilising a <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> source, particularly in relation to varying ambient temperature. In this thesis I explored whether there were differences in feeding behaviour between and within species at a <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> source with the overall aim of gaining understanding whether there were particular species or individuals which were more likely to utilise <b>supplementary</b> <b>food,</b> and whether this was influenced by the type of food provided and ambient In order to study behavioural differences between species, European Greenfinch (Chloris chloris) (hereafter Greenfinch), Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) (hereafter Chaffinch), European Robin (Erithacus rubecula) (hereafter Robin), Great Tit (Parus major), Eurasian Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) (hereafter Blue Tit) and Coal Tit (Periparus ater) were observed for a period of four months at feeding stations which provided two types of food. There were differences in feeding frequency and duration between species, and this was influenced by both body mass and ambient temperature. Larger species tended to spend longer at the feeders at lower temperatures, whereas smaller species such as Blue Tit and Coal Tit, spent longer at higher temperatures. Additionally, smaller species tended to visit more often. It was also conclusive that a food type with a shorter handling time was preferred overall. This reveals that garden bird feeders are utilised differently by species and therefore the impact of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> may differ between species. Furthermore, ambient temperature should also be considered when exploring <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> use. To study within species-differences in feeding behaviour, Blue Tits were studied. Individuals were fitted with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags which allowed individuals to be logged at bird feeders which were modified to support Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Data were gathered to inform which individuals were using <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> sources, the time of day they visited and how often they visited. This revealed that there were differences in feeding frequency which can be partially explained by body mass, showing that lighter individuals visited more frequently. Despite predictions that individuals with greater access to <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> would have brighter feathers due to the increased availability of dietary carotenoids, the yellow chroma of the breast feathers did not reflect the use of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> source, but this would benefit from further investigation. The time of day also influenced which individuals were likely to be using a <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> source; in this study lighter individuals tended to visit more frequently in the early morning and midday than their heavier counterparts. This indicates that conspecifics do not use food sources equally and that lighter individuals are probably being supported by supplementary feeding to a greater extent. In conclusion, the continued study of garden birds and their behaviours at <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> sources is necessary to understand how a range of species are using an ever changing environment. Individual-level studies should be considered hand-in-hand with population level studies as both levels of detail are useful and necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of supplementary feeding. With a more complete idea of how feeding may impact garden birds, it is possible to create more informed guidelines for the public who provide <b>supplementary</b> <b>food.</b> This could be beneficial for maintaining species numbers while continuing to engage the public with nature...|$|R

One way to improve the nutritional status of infants was by providing <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> fortifi ed with multiple micronutrients to mothers during pregnancy. Nutritional interventions during pregnancy provided better nutrient reserves for mothers and fetus. Objective: To analyze the impact of multi micronutrient-fortifi ed <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> provision in pregnant mothers on motor development and anemia status of infants in three sub-districts of Bogor District namely: Leuwiliang, Leuwisadeng and Ciampea. Method: A total of 120 infants were followed up in a prospective cohort study. The subjects were divided into three groups, i. e: 40 infants in fortifi ed group (pregnant mothers received <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> (vermicelli, milk and biscuit) fortifi ed with multi-nutrients i. e. iron, iodine, zinc, folic acid, vitamin C and vitamin A), 40 infants in non-fortifi ed groups (pregnant mothers received non fortifi ed foods) and 40 infants in the control groups (pregnant mothers did not receive any <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods).</b> Motor development was measured by methods developed by the Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia. Hb was measured by Cyanmethemoglobin method. Ancova and linear logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: Provision of multi micronutrient-fortifi ed <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> in pregnant mothers substantially improves infant’s motor development (77 % better than other groups). In addition, supplementation of multi micronutrient-fortifi ed foods in pregnant mothers reduced the rate of hemoglobin and hematocrit decline in infants up to the age of 6 months. There were no infants aged 6 months with Hb < 90 g / L in the fortifi ed group, while in the non-fortifi ed group and control group the prevalence of anemia was 8. 3 % and 11. 11 %, respectively.

40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Exclusive {{breast feeding}} is highly {{recommended}} {{for children under}} six months and {{the best time for}} starting <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> is the end of sixth months. Inadequate feeding can lead to malnutrition. Since infants' supplementary feeding pattern is influenced highly by the socio-cultural status; it is necessary to study the subject in diverse conditions. This study aimed to investigate supplementary feeding pattern in 6 - 12 months children referred to Ilam clinics in 2002. Methods &amp; Materials: In this study, 364 mothers with 6 - 12 months children were selected using convenient sampling method from 10 health care centers. Data were collected using a four-sectioned questionnaire including mothers and their babies demographic characteristics, feeding pattern (frequency, the type of milk), <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> (the age of onset and the type of the first <b>supplementary</b> <b>food,</b> the time of starting mixed foods, and the source of information about <b>supplementary</b> <b>food)</b> and mothers' performance about feeding with <b>supplementary</b> <b>food.</b> The questionnaire was filled via interview. Results: Findings showed that the growth curve in 84. 8 % of babies was in the health road. About 38 % of babies were the first child. In 50. 9 % of samples, <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> was started before 6 months of age and in 49. 9 % of the cases, it was started after 6 month old. Supplementary feeding accompanied with breast feeding in 83. 5 % of the infants. The most used <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> was rice mucilage (40. 8 % of the babies). The interval between starting one <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> and the other one was 3 - 4 days in 50. 2 % of the cases. Also 80. 8 % of samples started feeding in the amount of one spoon and increased it gradually. The majority of mothers (64 %) did not add sugar, salt and spices in order to attract their babies. As well, 75. 6 % of samples used spoon and cup for feeding and 92. 9 % knew the safe time for keeping cooked food in the refrigerator. The source of information about supplementary feeding in 65. 4 % of mothers was health care providers and in 5 % were books and booklets.

If food is abundant, energetic constraints may be reduced and the time spent incubating (incubation attendance) may increase. Moreover, the onset of incubation in relation to clutch completion may be advanced, resulting in a higher degree of hatching asynchrony. We measured the effect of experimentally increased food availability on incubation attendance and an estimate of hatching asynchrony in the Australian reed warbler Acrocephalus australis. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>food</b> was provided every other day, from {{a few days before the}} start of egg laying until just prior to hatching. Incubation attendance was measured with temperature loggers at nests receiving <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> and control nests. Hatching asynchrony was inferred from mass and size differences between siblings shortly after hatching. We found that 1) food supplementation resulted in an increase in incubation attendance, when comparing both nests receiving <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> to control nests as well as feeding to non-feeding days in nests receiving <b>supplementary</b> <b>food,</b> and 2) food supplementation resulted in a greater hatching asynchrony, without affecting clutch size, average egg volume or the likelihood of eggs hatching.

40|$|The {{present study}} arrived at {{investigating}} {{the influence of}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> on a developing rodent community on the coastal dune forests north of Richards Bay, South Africa. Four sites were selected for the field experiment. Each of these study sites comprised a treatment and control grid. Sunflower seeds were provided on the treatment grids and the response thereof on rodent population and community variables were measured. Each of the grids were trapped on a monthly bases as to follow the cumulative effects that <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> may have had on the rodent populations and the community. The amount of seed taken was measured. The minimum number of animals alive, {{as well as the}} survival and reproductive rates were calculated for the rodent community and each species on all the grids. Various community variables (richness, diversity and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) were calculated. The diet of each species was investigated as to confirm that the species present take seeds as a food item. Five rodent species were recorded on the newly rehabilitating areas. They include Otomys angoniensis, Mastomys natalensis, Mus minutoides, Saccostomus campestris and Dendromus melanotis. Most of these species are granivores and consume seeds as part of their diet with the exception of 0. angoniensis that is a herbivore. Seeds form {{the main part of the}} diet of M natalensis, M minutoides and S. campestris and it could be assumed that sunflower seeds can form part of their diet. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values indicated that treatment and control grids became more dissimilar as time progressed. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>food</b> had no significant effect on the species richness and rodent community densities. However, the <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> on treatment grids resulted in the significant decrease in species diversity in contrast with control grids. This decrease in species diversity was not as a result in the change in species richness, but was rather the result of the proportional increase in the number of individuals of M natalelensis on the treatment grids. Mastomys natalelensis were the most dominant species. Their numbers increased on the treatment grids where they continued to dominate the rodent community. Mus minutoides was the second most abundant on the study grids. This species, however, did not responded to the food supplied and decreased in numbers on both the treatment and control grids. No relationship could be demonstrated between any pair of species for treatment or control grids. Interspecific interactions between species could therefore not be illustrated. The possible existence of intraspecific interactions for M natalensis is a more plausible explanation as to why their numbers increase on treatment grids were food was no more limiting than on control grids. Species specific survival rate of M minutoides decreased with time for the treatment and control grids combined. This coincide with the decrease in the minimum number of M minutoides alive and may be explained by the successional changes in habitat characteristics. Factors other than the availability of sunflower seeds must therefore influence M. minutoides numbers on the newly rehabilitating areas. The survival probability of M natalensis individuals were not influenced by the <b>supplementary</b> <b>food.</b> Factors other than supposedly increased survival are responsible for their high numbers that were maintained on treatment grids. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>food</b> had no influence on the reproductive rates of adults and the proportion of juveniles present in each of the species present. This imply that the effects that <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> had on the rodent community and the species it contain, were not established through the reproductive effort and output. This suggests that immigration may be the reason for increased numbers of M natalensis individuals rather than their survival probability or reproductive performance. Sunflower seeds were provided as <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> to increase only a small part of the resource spectrum. Food supplementation for this developing rodent community resulted in a decrease in diversity as MacArthur's (1972) model predicted. However, the decrease in diversity 76 was not as a result of a decrease in species richness, but rather the result of the increase and maintained dominance of the pioneer species M natalensis. No interspecific interactions could be demonstrated, and it is speculated that intraspecific interactions play an important role in the M. natalensis population. The rodent community is therefore shaped by factors other than interspecific interactions, with <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> having no effect on species other than M natalensis.

40|$|Providing <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> to {{endangered}} {{bird species}} {{is a common}} management action. Research has {{tended to focus on}} whether or not <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> should be provided, and relatively less {{attention has been paid to}} the form that food should take. Supplementation is also commonly made directly to adult individuals. However, the potentially long-lasting consequences of developmental diet make it relevant to consider what type of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> is most appropriate for nestling birds. We sought to explore these issues in a wild population of hihi (Notiomystis cincta), an endangered New Zealand passerine in which adults in four out of five extant populations receive <b>supplementary</b> <b>food.</b> We directly provisioned nestling hihi with four alternative dietary treatments (protein- or carbohydrate-based diet with or without carotenoids) and assessed the effect of supplementation on nestling growth parameters; survival from hatching to fledging; survival from fledging to recruitment (breeding age). Firstly, we found a sex-specific effect of protein supplementation on growth inflection point: inflection point was later for females that received a high-protein diet compared with controls, and earlier for males. Secondly, we found an interacting effect of sex and diet on survival from hatching to fledging, such that females benefitted from a high-protein diet while males suffered. We also found an interacting effect of protein treatment and carotenoid treatment on survival to fledging, such that the positive effects of carotenoid supplementation were negated if carotenoids were provided in combination with the protein supplement. Finally, we were unable to detect an effect of nestling dietary treatment on survival from fledging to recruitment. Our results suggest that the short-term consequences of nestling supplementary feeding are more pronounced than any long-term effects. We also found evidence that dietary supplementation had opposing effects on male and female nestlings, which may be an important, previously overlooked, consideration when evaluating the conservation value of feeding regimes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Finding {{the most}} {{appropriate}} strategy {{for the prevention of}} moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in young children is essential in countries like Niger with annual "hunger gaps. " Options for large-scale prevention include distribution of <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods,</b> such as fortified-blended foods or lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) with or without household support (cash or food transfer). To date, there has been no direct controlled comparison between these strategies leading to debate concerning their effectiveness. We compared the effectiveness of seven preventive strategies-including distribution of nutritious <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods,</b> with or without additional household support (family food ration or cash transfer), and cash transfer only-on the incidence of SAM and MAM among children aged 6 - 23 months over a 5 -month period, partly overlapping the hunger gap, in Maradi region, Niger. We hypothesized that distributions of <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> would more effectively reduce the incidence of acute malnutrition than distributions of household support by cash transfer. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective intervention study in 48 rural villages located within 15 km of a health center supported by Forum Santé Niger (FORSANI) /Médecins Sans Frontières in Madarounfa. Seven groups of villages (five to 11 villages) were allocated to different strategies of monthly distributions targeting households including at least one child measuring 60 cm- 80 cm (at any time during the study period whatever their nutritional status) : three groups received high-quantity LNS (HQ-LNS) or medium-quantity LNS (MQ-LNS) or Super Cereal Plus (SC+) with cash (€ 38 /month [US$ 52 /month]); one group received SC+ and family food ration; two groups received HQ-LNS or SC+ only; one group received cash only (€ 43 /month [US$ 59 /month]). Children 60 cm- 80 cm of participating households were assessed at each monthly distribution from August to December 2011. Primary endpoints were SAM (weight-for-length Z-score [WLZ]<- 3 and/or mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC]< 11. 5 cm and/or bipedal edema) and MAM (- 3 ≤WLZ<- 2 and/or 11. 5 ≤MUAC< 12. 5 cm). A total of 5, 395 children were included in the analysis (615 to 1, 054 per group). Incidence of MAM was twice lower in the strategies receiving a food supplement combined with cash compared with the cash-only strategy (cash versus HQ-LNS/cash adjusted hazard ratio [HR]= 2. 30, 95 % CI 1. 60 - 3. 29; cash versus SC+/cash HR= 2. 42, 95 % CI 1. 39 - 4. 21; cash versus MQ-LNS/cash HR= 2. 07, 95 % CI 1. 52 - 2. 83) or with the <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> only groups (HQ-LNS versus HQ-LNS/cash HR= 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 35 - 2. 51; SC+ versus SC+/cash HR= 2. 53, 95 % CI 1. 47 - 4. 35). In addition, the incidence of SAM was three times lower in the SC+/cash group compared with the SC+ only group (SC+ only versus SC+/cash HR= 3. 13, 95 % CI 1. 65 - 5. 94). However, non-quantified differences between groups, may limit the interpretation {{of the impact of the}} strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive distributions combining a <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> and cash transfer had a better preventive effect on MAM and SAM than strategies relying on cash transfer or <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> alone. As a result, distribution of nutritious <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> to young children in conjunction with household support should remain a pillar of emergency nutritional interventions. Additional rigorous research is vital to evaluate the effectiveness of these and other nutritional interventions in diverse settings.

40|$|Parental {{investment}} in reproduction is generally limited by food availability, and so avian life-history research has traditionally {{focused on the}} brood rearing phase, when food requirements are greatest. Only relatively recently has the focus extended to the incubation phase, and even more recently to the nestbuilding phase, where observational and comparative evidence suggest that avian nest building is an energetically expensive and time-consuming activity. We aimed to experimentally test the limitations on this cost in a hole-breeding passerine, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), by providing <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> to experimental pairs during the nest-building period. In comparison with control females, that did not receive <b>supplementary</b> <b>food,</b> experimental females constructed heavier nests, with greater amounts of moss base but similar amounts of cup lining, despite there being no differences in the time taken to build the nest. This study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that avian nest building is a costly behaviour, limited by food availability...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a debate}} whether {{supplementary}} feeding of game species is necessary, and what type of <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> is appropriate for them. In our study {{a new type of}} supplemental food for wild game species was evaluated. Fresh tomato pomace mixed with ground maize grains (20 % w/w on a fresh basis) was baled. Different additive treatments were made and crude protein and crude fibre content and fermentation profile were evaluated. Consumption of tomato pomace silage by wild ungulates was also measured. Ground maize grains increased the dry matter content and crude protein : crude fibre ratio of tomato pomace. Tomato pomace mixed silage had a limited fermentation capacity with appropriate pH and fermentation acid content. The special baling technology was suitable to form well-shaped bales. In the investigated hunting preserve tomato pomace was the dominant food component in the diet of ungulate species.

Neoseiulus barkeri is often observed for a limited time on plants in the absence of prey, feeding on alternative and <b>supplementary</b> <b>foods</b> and reaching high population levels. In this study, we test the hypothesis that various fungi (recorded in association with the host plant) could be suitable food source for the predatory mite N. barkeri. In the laboratory, we compared the developmental times, survival and oviposition rates of the predatory mite feeding on the primary food (T. urticae) or mycelium and spores of Aspergillus niger, Alternaria solani, Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum as alternative or <b>supplementary</b> <b>food.</b> Results indicated that the fungi, A. niger, A. solani and P. digitatum are adequate food sources for generalist mite survival and development. Neoseiulus barkeri was able to sustain oviposition when fed on the fungus A. niger, so it was proved to be an alternative food, conversely the predator failed to oviposit when fed on P. digitatum and A. solani, hence, both fungi can be consider as <b>supplementary</b> <b>food</b> for the predator. The fungus P. italicum is proved to be inadequate food, since most of protonymphs failed to complete its development and reach adult female.
