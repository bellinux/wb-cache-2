5|$|Reptile later {{appears in}} the 1995 film Mortal Kombat as a bipedal lizard, camouflaging himself until found by Liu Kang. After being thrown into a statue, Reptile {{transforms}} into a human-looking ninja and battles Liu Kang, but is defeated and then crushed after reverting to his original form. Reptile's lizard form was rendered {{with the use of}} computer-generated imagery, while the character's human form is portrayed by Keith Cooke, clothed similar to Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the film, but green and with a <b>fanged</b> open mouth imprinted on his face mask. Originally not included in the movie, Reptile was added in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the original fights in the film. Actor Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and director Paul Anderson noted that neither knew what Reptile's lizard form would look like until after filming, making the pre-fight sequence difficult to shoot.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her <b>fanged</b> head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

25|$|In the Andes, {{ceramics}} appear {{during the}} Initial Period around 1800 BCE. They were needed for boiling agricultural foods Chavín potters on the Peruvian coast create distinctive stirrup spout vessels, both incised and highly burnished. These thin-walled effigy pots were fashioned to resemble stylized humans, plants, and animals. Two substyles of Chavín stirrup spout pots include the thicker-walls, glossy-on-matte blackware Cupisnique style {{and red and}} black Santa Ana style, both featuring <b>fanged</b> heads. Subsequent Andean cultures revived these ancient ceramics styles and imagery.|$|E
25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a <b>fanged</b> nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening flat-bottomed rails, an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Hammer Films {{produced}} Dracula, a newer, more Gothic {{version of}} the story, starring Christopher Lee as Dracula and Peter Cushing as Abraham Van Helsing. In 2004 it was named by Total Film magazine as the 30th-greatest British film of all time. Although it takes many liberties with the novel's plot, the creepy atmosphere and charismatic performances of Lee and Cushing make it memorable. It was released in the United States as Horror of Dracula to avoid confusion with the earlier Lugosi version. This {{was followed by a}} long series of Dracula films, usually featuring Lee as Dracula. It was Lee who fixed the image of the <b>fanged</b> vampire in popular culture.|$|E

It's a brilliant visual take on a breathtakingly badass verse, but really, they could've just focused in on her incredible facial expressions and called it a day.

Streisand uses the triangle to complete the diamond, transforming herself into a giant mechanical dinosaur version of herself, Mecha-Streisand, and begins to lay waste to South Park with her new form. Maltin and Chef arrive to free the boys, and Maltin asks Chef to call Robert Smith of The Cure [...] for help. Maltin then transforms into a giant robot to battle Mecha-Streisand, but is quickly defeated. The boys evade fiery debris from the fight, but Kenny is killed when he stops to play tetherball and gets strangled by the rope. Actor Sidney Poitier arrives and turns into a giant <b>fanged</b> turtle to fight Mecha-Striesand, but he too is easily defeated. After getting {{a call from the}} boys and Chef, Robert Smith arrives and transforms into a giant moth creature.|$|E
500|$|The Flukeman {{character}} has also attracted positive criticism. Writing for Den of Geek, John Moore listed the Flukeman {{as one of}} his [...] "Top 10 X-Files Baddies", writing that [...] "the idea of a man size biter running around drains in a city near me – looking like a giant, <b>fanged</b> maggot - was always likely to induce a goodly amount of cheek-shifting on the sofa.

Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the character among the [...] "best" [...] monster-of-the-week, describing it as [...] "something of a poster boy for XF villains," [...] and considering that [...] "never has toxic waste seemed so dangerous as when the big slimy white fellow slithers onto the screen and starts attacking people in the sewers." ...|$|E
500|$|To lend {{a strong}} air of realism to Gordon's death, {{the scene was}} created by {{combining}} various special effects during filming with post-production visual effects. Plastic razor wire with blood tubing aided in the initial phases of the decapitation; it would slightly sink into Brown's neck as pressure was applied, forcing out the fake blood. For the aftermath, Brown laid down on the floor, and the visual effects department removed his head from the shot and recreated it as a three-dimensional model. The department decided to [...] "push {{it a little bit}} farther" [...] by having the head rocking into place and the mouth twitching, but Standards and Practices found it too graphic and forced them to remove the motion. Established in the first-season episode [...] "Dead Man's Blood" [...] were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the design has been subtly improved with each vampire episode. Though the special effects makeup department used molds of the actors' mouths to create the <b>fanged</b> acrylic dentures, McNab noted that {{it was very difficult to}} speak while wearing them. Blood-like makeup around the actors' mouths helped to round out the vampiric visages.|$|E
