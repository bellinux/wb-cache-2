5|$|At {{the time}} of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent an {{astronaut}} <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met. By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Kelly co-wrote Astrotwins: Project Blastoff, {{a fictional}} story about twins Scott and Mark who build a space capsule in their grandpa's {{backyard}} {{and try to}} send the first kid <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> He dedicated this book to his real twin brother, astronaut Scott Kelly. The sequel, Astrotwins -- Project Rescue, was published in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Every {{action of}} a group on a set {{decomposes}} the set <b>into</b> <b>orbits.</b> The group acts {{on each of the}} orbits and an orbit does not have sub-orbits (unequal orbits are disjoint), so the decomposition of a set <b>into</b> <b>orbits</b> could be considered as a “factorization ” of the set into “irreducible ” pieces for the group action. Our focus here is on these irreducible parts...|$|R
5|$|The {{impacting}} object {{probably had}} a mass {{comparable to that of}} Mars, and the impact probably occurred {{near the end of the}} period of giant impacts. The collision kicked <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon. The impact was probably the last in the series of mergers that formed the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The outer, {{irregular}} moons {{are thought}} to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> Many are believed to have broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{hypothesis is}} that the Earth–Moon system formed {{as a result of}} the impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth (giant impact), that blasted material <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> about the Earth that then accreted to form the present Earth-Moon system.|$|E

50|$|The Ariane 5 ME uses a new upper stage, with {{increased}} propellant volume, {{powered by the}} new Vinci engine. Unlike the HM-7B engine, it can restart several times, allowing for complex orbital maneuvers such as insertion of two satellites <b>into</b> different <b>orbits,</b> direct insertion <b>into</b> geosynchronous <b>orbit,</b> planetary exploration missions, and guaranteed upper stage deorbiting or insertion <b>into</b> graveyard <b>orbit.</b>|$|R
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} {{explored}} {{on several occasions}} by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.|$|E
5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> from a military base in China.|$|E

5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return <b>into</b> <b>orbit,</b> so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to summon the Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} Saturn I test flights were {{launched}} from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight {{with a live}} S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified {{the safety of the}} translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|Though Q goads Picard into {{punishing}} the Bandi, Picard refuses, instead ordering the Enterprise {{to fire a}} vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint after the station is evacuated. The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells Picard that they have succeeded in their test, but hints that they will meet again.|$|E

5|$|After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk {{arrives in}} the engine room and discovers Spock dying of {{radiation}} poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V. Spock's coffin, having soft-landed, rests on the Genesis planet's surface.|$|E
5|$|Bond escapes {{and calls}} Blofeld, using a similar {{electronic}} device made by Q to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte is kept at his summer house {{outside the city}} and goes there with Felix and the CIA. After a brief battle with Whyte's female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, they rescue Whyte. Saxby attempts to kill Bond outside the summer house, but is fatally shot during the ensuring gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka is {{the outer}} and, at roughly 350km in diameter, the larger and {{brighter}} {{of the two}} moons. Strong absorption features observed at 1.5, 1.65 and 2 µm in its infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface. The unusual spectrum, and its similarity to absorption lines in the spectrum of Haumea, led Brown and colleagues to conclude that {{it was unlikely that}} the system of moons was formed by the gravitational capture of passing Kuiper belt objects <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around the dwarf planet: instead, the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself.|$|E
5|$|The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) {{mission was}} {{launched}} in October 2006.

50|$|Orbit {{insertion}} is {{a general}} term for a maneuver {{that is more than}} a small correction. It may be used for a maneuver to change a transfer orbit or an ascent <b>orbit</b> <b>into</b> a stable one, but also to change a stable <b>orbit</b> <b>into</b> a descent: descent orbit insertion. Also the term orbit injection is used, especially for changing a stable <b>orbit</b> <b>into</b> a transfer <b>orbit,</b> e.g. trans-lunar injection (TLI), trans-Mars injection (TMI) and trans-Earth injection (TEI).|$|R

5|$|In 1957, the Russian {{flight of}} Sputnik 1 {{prompted}} the United States to accelerate its fledgling space program. On July 29, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established NASA and subsumed NACA within this newly created organization. Langley Research Center {{became a part}} of NASA, as did Langley employees such as Kraft. Even before NASA began its official existence in October, Kraft was invited by Gilruth {{to become a part of}} a new group that was working on the problems of putting a man <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> Without much hesitation, he accepted the offer. When the Space Task Group was officially formed on November 5, Kraft became one of the original thirty-five engineers to be assigned to Project Mercury, America's man-in-space program.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was {{launched}} by NASA. This spacecraft {{was designed to}} observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares {{during a time of}} high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} {{about the impact of}} spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the {{technology}} to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> and endure a Micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.|$|E
