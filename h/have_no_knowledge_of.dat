5|$|On {{a mission}} on P4X-639, a planet {{experiencing}} strong solar activity, the SG-1 team encounters an alien archaeologist named Malikai (Robin Mossley). When a geomagnetic disturbance hits its peak, the Stargate activates simultaneously {{on the planet}} and on Earth, and a flash strikes Malikai, Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) near an Ancient altar. Moments later, O'Neill finds himself in the Stargate Command (SGC) cafeteria {{in the middle of}} a breakfast conversation with Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Major Carter (Amanda Tapping), who claim to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the planet. O'Neill and Teal'c later express familiarity with the events, and they are checked and certified to be in perfect health. Before SG-1 can resume their planned mission to the planet, an unscheduled offworld activation of the Earth Stargate, accompanied by flashes, transports O'Neill back to breakfast.|$|E

In 2008, Lieutenant-General (retired) Jamshed Gulzar Kiani— {{at that time}} Kiani was Major-general and served as the Director-General of the Military Intelligence— also {{publicly}} confirmed Sharif's statement of not having the knowledge on Kargil debacle. According to Major-General Kiani, General Musharraf had eye-blinded the Prime minister and did not brief him over the true facts or difficult situation which was faced by the Pakistan Army. During the Kargil debacle, the Indian Air Force's two MiG-29 intercepted the Pakistan Air Force's two F-16 fighter jets of the No. 9 Squadron Griffins, initially gaining a missile lock on these jets. This dogfight made a next-day morning headlines in Pakistan, prompting the prime minister to investigate the matter. However, Chief of Air Staff General Pervez Mehdi denied this incident, later accused the Prime minister for not taking the Air Force in confidence in the matters of national security.|$|E

The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance. Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army: on January 14, Neill approached one of them, Sam Houston, for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.|$|E

Ava had been abducted months earlier, but claims to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> her whereabouts during the time gap. Lily tries to leave the town, but is killed by an Acheri demon, prompting the others to seek refuge in a building, protecting themselves from the demon with barriers of salt. As Dean Winchester (Ackles) and fellow hunter Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) head to Harvelle's Roadhouse—a saloon frequented by hunters—for help and find it burned to the ground with the body of hunter Ash (Chad Lindberg) buried in the wreckage, Andy uses his mind-control abilities to send Dean his location telepathically.|$|E

IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of [...] "nobody knows me" [...] while she ponders thoughts like, [...] "It's no good when you're misunderstood, but why should I care what the world thinks of me?".

Miller, who also wrote for the television series, the first issue details Lex changing the LuthorCorp name to LexCorp, due to his memory loss in the series finale. Tess Mercer's death is ruled a suicide, and Lex sells the ownership rights to the Daily Planet. He also questions why he would befriend the [...] "unsophisticated" [...] Clark Kent, after reading some newspaper clippings. He immediately harbors distrust with [...] "Superman", after the latter reveals himself to the world. In addition, there are remnants of memories left for Lex to continue his hatred towards the superhero but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Superman's secret identity. Lex later discovers that he once knew who Superman is and determined to remember. This leads to a proposal with General Sam Lane to create {{a joint venture between}} LexCorp and the Pentagon for the company's project, [...] "Guardian Defense Platforms", which involves monitoring the world's metahuman and extraterrestrial communities. In the second issue, Lex takes steps to regain his lost memories, having his assistant Otis Berg research the neurotoxin Tess used on him, eventually he discovers that the toxin has caused Lex's brain to operate at a higher percentage than normal, increasing his overall intelligence. In addition, Otis discovers that the toxin not only erased Lex's memories and enhanced his intelligence, but also caused him to mentally bond with Tess's consciousness when she poisoned him. Clark and Oliver eventually discover what happened to Tess, and extracts her consciousness from Lex and uploaded it into the Watchtower's computer until they can clone her a new body. It is also revealed that Lex was friends with Bruce Wayne, the secret identity of Batman, since childhood, but lost touch after the murder of Bruce's parents. Years later, Bruce is secretly aware that Lex is now corrupt.|$|E
