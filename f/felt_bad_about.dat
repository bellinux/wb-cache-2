25|$|In the {{eleventh}} stage, the first mountain {{stage of the}} race, Gino Bartali was away together with French Jean Robic. There {{was a lot of}} crowd, and they pressed forward to see the cyclist coming. This caused Bartali to fall down during the descent of the Col d'Aspin, and this caused Robic to also fall down. Bartali got up and won the stage, but felt threatened by spectators, who punched and kicked him. One spectator had threatened Bartali with a knife. Bartali told his team manager Alfredo Binda that he was leaving the Tour de France, and that all Italian cyclists should abandon the race. Not all Italian cyclists wanted to leave: the members from the second Italian team (the Italian Cadets) and Adolfo Leoni wanted to stay. Some Italian cyclists said they wanted to stay in the race to help Magni defend the leading position. Magni <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> giving up the chance to win the Tour de France, but accepted the decision. The Tour organisation wanted to keep the Italian cyclists in the race, and among other compromises offered to give them neutral gray jerseys, so the spectators would not recognize them. None of this helped, and both Italian teams left the race. As a consequence, the fifteenth stage, that was originally scheduled to end in Italy (Sanremo), was rescheduled to end in Menton.|$|E

Boris explains that he <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> yelling at Minka, and had gone to look for her mother's wine glasses, but had become locked inside when {{the door closed behind}} him (it can't open from the inside). Angelica tests the door, and inadvertently locks them all in again.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} airing of this episode, Mrs. Krabappel names several different diseases Bart has faked {{in order to}} get out of taking his English test, one of which is Tourette's syndrome. After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an actual condition and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend somebody with Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of feel like we made a mistake this time. We <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E

He enjoyed his work there, but <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> the smaller attendance his classes inevitably received. In 1965, the Bacius {{set up their}} own magazine, International Poetry Letter – Mele (from the Hawaiian for [...] "song"), which sought to establish connections between Latino, French, American and Romanian literature. Although noted for the quality of its illustrations, Mele had a very minor circulation, with at most 300 copies per issue, all of them xerographed by Baciu's students.|$|E

50|$|Previously {{standard}} {{issue on}} Marks III and IV, Ford's 7.5-liter (460 cid) V8 (now the industry's largest remaining) was optional for 1977, as a smaller 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 became standard. The 7.5 L V8 {{was not available}} at all on Mark V {{in the state of}} California, as the powerplant was unable to meet that state's tougher EPA certification standards. Lincoln <b>felt</b> so <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> this, that for 1977 only, California-bound Mark Vs were offered with the newly optional turbine-style aluminum wheels as standard equipment, to compensate for their 460-less Californian clientele.|$|R

[...] Dourif feels that [...] "The original version {{was a hell of}} a lot purer and I liked it much more. As it stands now, it's a mediocre film. There are parts that have no right to be there.|$|R
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{theories}} {{hold that}} dysfunctional cognitive schemas and associated information-processing biases {{are involved in}} the maintenance of psychopathology. In eating disorders (ED), these schemas would consist of self-evaluative representations, in which the importance of controlling eating, shape and weight is overrated. We examined whether ED symptoms are associated with a bias towards ED themes in negative self-evaluative autobiographical memories. Undergraduate females (n = 130) retrieved three memories of situations in which they had <b>felt</b> particularly <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> themselves. Prior to retrieval they had completed either an ED-related priming or a control task. Preliminary results suggest that ED symptoms as well ED priming predicted ED-related autobiographical memory.

60|$|He {{was in this}} {{successful}} mood {{when word}} came to him that Mrs. Lapham was going; Tom Corey seemed to have brought it, {{but he was not}} sure. Anyway, {{he was not going to}} hurry. He made cordial invitations to each of the gentlemen to drop in and see him at his office, and would not be satisfied till he had exacted a promise from each. He told Charles Bellingham that he liked him, and assured James Bellingham that it had always been his ambition to know him, and that if any one had said when he first came to Boston that in less than ten years he should be hobnobbing with Jim Bellingham, he should have told that person he lied. He would have told anybody he lied that had told him ten years ago that a son of Bromfield Corey would have come and asked him to take him into the business. Ten years ago he, Silas Lapham, had come to Boston a little worse off than nothing at all, for he was in debt for half the money that he had bought out his partner with, and here he was now worth a million, and meeting you gentlemen like one of you. And every cent of that was honest money,--no speculation,--every copper of it for value received. And here, only the other day, his old partner, who had been going to the dogs ever since he went out of the business, came and borrowed twenty thousand dollars of him! Lapham lent it because his wife wanted him to: she had always <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> the fellow's having to go out of the business.|$|E

5000|$|In season three, {{however, the}} couple separated, and they later divorced, (with Groh {{dropping}} to recurring status during season three, and then making {{only a few}} guest appearances the following season, before being written out entirely). According to Valerie Harper, Groh was written out of the show when the producers decided that Rhoda worked better with its star as a single woman. [...] "We all <b>felt</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> David not continuing," [...] she said. The two remained lifelong friends. However, this change was not embraced by the show's audience and ratings began to decline sharply. Rhoda was eventually canceled {{in the fall of}} 1978. Groh starred in his own series, the short-lived Another Day, and went on to make his Broadway theatre debut in Neil Simon's Chapter Two.|$|R

Kulick later stated, [...] "I just <b>felt</b> really <b>bad</b> that Ron Nevison didn't like the song 'cause then it would have been on [...] "Crazy Nights". But I couldn't control that. And the demo that is out there in bootleg form is pretty good. We did it at Electric Lady with Eric Carr, and it's a full-blown KISS track practically. I actually came up with that riff backstage on tour early on, [...] "Asylum", I think. That's what happens. Paul didn't mind as much; I <b>felt</b> pretty <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> that." [...] The song was offered to Canadian rock band Loverboy, and was re-recorded by their lead guitarist Paul Dean on his 1988 album Hard Core.

Edwards:The whole experience was, in terms of filmmaking, extraordinarily destructive. The temper and tantrums from my producer, William Belasco, were such that he insulted {{me in front of}} the cast and crew and offered to bet me $1,000 that I'd never work in Hollywood again if I didn't do everything his and Aubrey's way. They told me that they didn't want quality, just a viewable film.

40|$|Background: Children of {{commercial}} sex workers (CSW) are deprived from {{almost all the}} rights of the society. More attention is paid to the CSWs but their children are neglected. This study was conducted to estimate the morbidity and psychosocial behaviour of children of CSWs and their needs. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Results: Among 152 children, 72 % were malnourished. Exclusive breast feeding (EBF) practices were poor. Only 47 % were immunized and health status was not at par with national averages. The high prevalence of cerebral palsy may reflect poor antenatal, perinatal and essential new born care. The most popular desired profession was teacher (20 %) followed by player, doctor, and artist. 7 % wanted to become soldier while 8 % <b>felt</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> themselves and 10. 5 % could not sleep well at night. Conclusion: The indirectly elucidated needs regarding health and behaviour of the children of CSWs are only the tip of the iceberg. The children need formal and non-formal health and life skill education and the caregivers need behavioural change communication on health and hygiene...|$|R

This paper analyses the preferences, needs and wants of the vegetable buyers and make them available to farmers so that they can take correct decisions regarding the marketing strategies to be implemented in Rythu Bazaars of Andhra Pradesh State of India. The findings of the study indicate that majority of consumers felt the location of Rythu Bazaar is not conducive; 58 % of the respondents faced some or the other problem in making purchases in Rythu Bazaar.
