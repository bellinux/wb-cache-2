25|$|The current <b>indications</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> {{from the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration include {{short-term}} treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor hot flashes or urogenital atrophy, {{and prevention of}} osteoporosis. In 2012, the United States Preventive Task Force concluded that {{the harmful effects of}} combined estrogen and progestin are likely to exceed the chronic disease prevention benefits in most women. A consensus expert opinion published by The Endocrine Society stated that when taken during perimenopause, or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published, and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology also released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in appropriate clinical scenarios.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{supported}} in part by the US Army has led to a US patent application for the use of galantamine and/or its derivatives for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The <b>indications</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of galantamine in the patent application include poisoning by nerve agents [...] "including but not limited to soman, sarin, and VX, tabun, and Novichok agents". Galantamine was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote atropine. According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between galantamine and atropine in an amount of 6 mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of galantamine from 5 to 8 mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5.times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals.|$|E
