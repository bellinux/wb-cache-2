5|$|The {{widespread}} use of Christian symbolism led to questions about how to produce memorials suitable for non-Christians. Lutyens attempted {{to solve this problem}} for the IWGC through the design of the Stone of Remembrance, or War Stone. This was a large, simple stone, intended to resemble an altar and evoke the theme of sacrifice. In practice, many commentators felt it resembled a sarcophagus. Lutyens wanted it to avoid conventional Christian symbolism and based it on designs in Chinese Ming tombs. One of Lutyens' arguments in favour of his design was that explicit Christian symbolism excluded the <b>Indian</b> <b>and</b> Jewish communities and atheists. The IWGC designs for the <b>Indian</b> <b>and</b> Chinese war cemeteries in Europe deliberately did not use Christian imagery – although, as historian Xu Guoqi notes, the Chinese role in the Allied armies remains largely uncommemorated through memorials.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{describe}} trends in hospitalizations associated with infectious diseases among American <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives. METHODS: Infectious disease hospitalizations and rates among American <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives from 1980 through 1994 were examined via Indian Health Service hospital discharge data and compared with published trends for the general US population. RESULTS: Annual hospitalization rates for infectious diseases among American <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives decreased by 31. 0 % between 1980 and 1994. Infectious disease hospitalizations accounted for 16. 3 % of all hospitalizations in 1980 and 21. 2 % in 1994, an increase of 30. 1 %. In 1994, the age-adjusted infectious disease hospitalization rate for American <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives was 1863 per 100, 000 population, approximately 21 % greater than that for the general US population. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization trends for infectious diseases show {{that there has been}} improvement in the health status of American <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives but also indicate that this population has a higher infectious disease burden than the general US population...|$|R
