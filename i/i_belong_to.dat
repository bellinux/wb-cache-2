As an abortion opponent and a frequent adversary of public employee unions, Coleman's positions put him {{at odds with the}} DFL Party leadership in Minnesota. In a letter to supporters announcing the switch, Coleman wrote that “while the political party <b>I</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> changes, nothing about how I govern or what I believe changes at all.” He was re-elected as St. Paul Mayor in 1997, with nearly 60% of the vote.|$|E

[...] Tom Bryant in The Daily Mirror wrote, [...] "Keith says his songwriting partner 'started to become unbearable' in the early 80s, adding: 'I think Mick thinks <b>I</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> him but I haven't been to his dressing room in 20 years.'" ...|$|E

[...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün.

There is some confusion about whether Kanaga should actually be called a [...] "member" [...] of Group f/64. The announcement for the show at the de Young Museum listed seven photographers in Group f/64 and said [...] "From time to time various other photographers will be asked to display their work with Group f/64. Those invited for the first showing are: Preston Holder, Consuela Kanaga, Alma Lavenson, Brett Weston." [...] However, in 1934 the group posted a notice in Camera Craft magazine that said [...] "The F:64 group includes in its membership such well known names as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke, John Paul Edwards, Imogene [...] Cunningham, Consuela Kanaga and several others."

2500|$|In 1935, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia {{attended}} {{the opening of}} the inaugural exhibit at the Federal Art Project Gallery, accompanied by Audrey McMahon, New York regional director for the Works Progress Administration/Federal Art Project. Among the works on display was Abstraction, a sketch by Swinden; it was the design for a mural planned for the College of the City of New York. A newspaper account described it as consisting of [...] "brightly colored T-squares, triangles and rulers in horizontal, vertical and diagonal positions". La Guardia [...] asked what it was, and upon being told it was a mural design, he said he didn't know what it depicted. Someone joked that it could be a map of Manhattan. The displeased mayor stated that [...] "if that's art, <b>I</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> Tammany Hall." [...] (Tammany Hall, which the Republican mayor referenced, was the New York Democratic Party political society.) Fearing that the mayor's negative attitude could jeopardize the future of abstract art within the Federal Art Project, McMahon dispatched an assistant to summon an artist who could speak to the mayor in defense of abstraction. The assistant returned with Arshile Gorky.|$|E
