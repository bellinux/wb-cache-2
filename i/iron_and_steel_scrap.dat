500|$|Cadmium [...] {{makes up}} about 0.1mg kg−1 (ppm) of Earth's crust. [...] Compared {{with the more}} {{abundant}} 65ppm zinc, cadmium is rare. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>scrap.</b> Production in the United States began in 1907, but not until after World War I did cadmium come into wide use.|$|E

These behaviors were as same as the results obtained by N. Laksh-minarayanaiah. It was found that mild steels could be dissolved well into the saturated FeCl₂ solution as a catholyte of the cell. As Fe⁺⁺ ion could be transferred through the anion exchange membrane (M₋) at lower discharge current density, the higher was the discharge current density, the higher was the producing efficiency of FeCl₂. In any case, the treatment efficiency of spent acid (HCl) was more than 100 %, because H⁺ ion could be transferred easily through the membrane (M₋) by diffusion.
