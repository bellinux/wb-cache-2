5|$|In October 2012, Tanya and Max {{decide to}} remarry. Tanya wants Rainie {{to attend the}} wedding but doesn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and asks Cora to track her down. With help from Jack, Cora manages {{to get in touch}} with Rainie and {{arranges}} to meet her at a pub, but upon arriving, Rainie has sent her sponsor Olivia (Samantha Best), to the pub with a letter. Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is pleased to have been invited to the wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora is the reason for her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she will leave her alone from now on.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Carrisford and his Indian {{assistant}} Ram Dass {{have moved}} into {{the house next door}} to Miss Minchin's school. Carrisford had been Captain Crewe's friend and partner in the diamond mines. After the diamond mine venture failed, both Crewe and Carrisford became very ill, and Carrisford in his delirium abandoned his friend Crewe, who died of his 'jungle fever.' As it turned out, the diamond mines did not fail, but instead were a great success, making Carrisford extremely rich. Although Carrisford survived, he suffers from several ailments and is guilt-ridden over abandoning his friend. He is determined to find Crewe's daughter and heir, although he does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and thinks she is attending school in France or Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Some time later, Rose has a dream {{where she}} hears the Doctor's voice calling her. The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay, where a {{holographic}} image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, I suppose, if {{this is my last}} chance to say it: Rose Tylerâ€”"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. In the TARDIS, tears run down the Doctor's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course. As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. With the Doctor shocked and confused, the mysterious bride angrily demands to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> leading to the events of [...] "The Runaway Bride".|$|E

50|$|A court sentenced Kamilova to {{eleven years}} in prison. Because it {{is a drug}} charge, she cannot appeal. No one <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} (ca. 2015), in Yedioth Ahronoth, Raichel was asked about this and said: [...] "If you have a daughter and someone kidnapped her, you investigate that someone and your child's life is at risk. If she is my daughter, I would do whatever necessary to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{and to get the}} information that would save her life. Regardless if that someone is Muslim, Jewish or Christian. It is an example of unnecessary harsh criticism. The intention of the things was taking out of context".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' said Martin. 'But I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> Not {{having had}} {{the heart to}} write in our distress--you {{yourself}} thought silence most advisable--and consequently, never having heard from her since we left New York the first time, I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> my good fellow.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. HOPE. Well, {{then you}} must just find her. I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> This land {{could be}} no other than the tiny islet of Takokota. It had no lagoon. No one lived upon it.|$|R

60|$|The Silver Shoes took {{but three}} steps, {{and then she}} stopped so {{suddenly}} that she rolled over upon the grass several times before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} more {{she heard her}} own name called. An {{interval}} of another instant passed, and a familiar voice said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> I'll fetch her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} in the world," [...] Francis declared. [...] "I am just as anxious {{to hear from}} her; and to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> as you seem to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Any good! I can't {{say that}} I {{want to do}} any {{particular}} good. The truth is, I think I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> and that she is living under a false name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I know that. I can read. But I {{thought maybe}} it was her back history you were after, and that you'd <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now?" ...|$|R
60|$|Kate turned {{round with}} a little laugh of contempt. Jeanne felt herself {{suddenly}} lifted {{in a pair of}} strong arms. Before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> on the other side. Breathless she followed her guide, who came to a full stop a few yards farther on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He won't {{acknowledge}} <b>where</b> <b>she's</b> gone,' said Fledgeby; 'and I have a fancy that I {{should like}} to have another look at her. Now I <b>know</b> he <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> gone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{find her}} {{and let me}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> and I will make out a home for her somewhere;--that is, if she will be tractable. I'm afraid your father won't take her at the mill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} she's {{not at the}} Burnhams'; I mean that he does or does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> and that in either case he {{is not likely to}} give you information. But I can." ...|$|E
60|$|OONA. Where is the Countess Cathleen? All {{this day}} Her eyes {{were full of}} tears, and when for a moment Her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled, And now I do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> gone.|$|E
60|$|His {{words were}} echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor, who {{sat with her}} head leaning over her work, {{in a state of}} such {{agitation}} as made her hardly <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't stay {{a moment}} longer, sir!" [...] cried the girl. [...] "I've {{been to the}} house--and Mrs. Ormond isn't there--and nobody <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> Get out by the gate, sir, while you have the chance." ...|$|R

60|$|A {{married man}} on the stage knows his wife, because he knows she wears a blue ulster and a red bonnet. The moment she leaves off that blue ulster and red bonnet he is lost and does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe {{but what}} Mr. Bolton had better go {{and wake up}} the Savors. You got to keep her for the night, I presume, but they'd ought to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> {{and you can take}} her over there agin, come daylight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{be sure it}} is; {{the idea}} being that all who can see may act. Now, if we catch the lugger before Captain Cuffe and Sir Frederick even <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> on what {{principle}} can they aid and sustain us in the capture?" ...|$|E
60|$|Florence, in this way, {{was taken}} up stairs and found herself seated by a fire, while three pairs of hands were taking from her her shawls and hat and cloak, almost before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R

60|$|SYLVIA (offhandedly). Hallo, Charteris: how are {{you getting}} on? (She takes his arm familiarly and walks down the room with him.) Have you seen Grace Tranfield this morning?

60|$|So Christie held to her {{resolution}} {{in spite of}} many secret misgivings, and followed Mrs. Black's advice on all points with a docility which caused that sanguine lady to predict that <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> a star before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
