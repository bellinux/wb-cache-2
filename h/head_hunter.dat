5|$|Gromek {{also led}} the AL with twelve hit batsmen in 1954. On August 29, he hit Bill Wilson {{in the fourth}} inning of a 14–3 win against the Athletics. In the ninth inning, Athletics pitcher Marion Fricano, who had a {{reputation}} as a <b>head</b> <b>hunter</b> himself (two days prior, he ended the Chicago White Sox's Cass Michaels' career with a beanball), retaliated and threw at Gromek's back. Gromek charged the mound, causing both dugouts and bullpens to empty. Both players were ejected from the game, and fined by the league. Gromek entered the 1955 Detroit Tigers season as an everyday starting pitcher, though he was not the opening day starter that year. During the offseason, he worked to lessen the control he had on the ball, as he felt his low ERA but league-leading 26 home runs allowed was the result of overly controlling the ball. He remained a starter throughout the season, with the exception of September, in which Gromek pitched three games in relief, earning two wins in the process. He finished the season with 13 wins and 10 losses and a 3.98 ERA in 28 appearances, and led the league with 26 home runs allowed for the second straight year.|$|E

25|$|Head hunting, a male activity, {{would involve}} {{separating}} men from their women before, {{during and after}} coming back from an expedition. The women, as a cultural practice, would encourage men to undertake head-hunting as a prerequisite to marriage. The men would go on an expedition against other tribes or neighbouring kingdoms, and kill to score number of heads {{they were able to}} hunt. A successful <b>head</b> <b>hunter</b> would be conferred a right to ornaments. The practice of head hunting was banned in 19th century India, and is no longer practised among Naga people.|$|E
25|$|In late 2006 AAA owner Antonio Peña died, forcing various changes {{backstage}} including Joaquin Roldan {{taking over}} the booking duties. One {{of the things that}} Roldan changed in AAA was that La Parka was no longer booked as the lone top tecnico any more, focusing the main storyline more on Cibernético. On March 18, 2007 La Parka won his fourth and so far final Rey de Reyes tournament defeating Octagón, Abismo Negro, Rhino, Fuerza Guerrera and Latin Lover in the elimination match final. At Triplemania XV the La Legión team of Ron Killings, Sabu, <b>Head</b> <b>Hunter</b> A and Rikishi Phatu defeated La Parka, El Zorro, Latin Lover and Animal. Over the summer of 2007 La Parka injured his shoulder in a car accident, forcing him to work a lighter schedule and a less risky style. At the 2007 Antonio Peña Memorial Show Kenzo Suzuki aggravated La Parka's injury by accident forcing him to take time off after the event.|$|E

2500|$|After {{ending his}} first stint with AAA El Canek {{turned up in}} International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) next, who {{promoted}} shows in Naucalpan, where El Canek used to main event during his UWA days. Early on he worked a program with Rayo de Jalisco Jr. over the WWA World Heavyweight Championship held by Rayo de Jalisco Jr. While in IWRG he also defended the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he still claimed despite the UWA being inactive for eight years {{at that point in}} time. On May 5, 2005 El Canek and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. faced off against Perro Aguayo Jr. and <b>Head</b> <b>Hunter</b> I in a match where the winning team would then wrestle for the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. Canel and Jalisco Jr won the match, then El Canek defeated Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to become the 13th over all IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. Canek would defend the championship twice in 2006, against Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and eternal rival Dr. Wagner Jr. Late in the year Canek's knees had deteriorated to a rate where he had to take time off to have reconstructive surgery and then rehab and as a result only wrestled sporadically from 2007 to 2009, not just for IWRG but in general. While he was inactive IWRG did not vacate the Heavyweight title, but also did not promote it while El Canek was not working for them. El Canek returned to IWRG in 2009, bringing the championship belt back with him. Canek and El Hijo del Canek won a father/son tag team tournament that took place on December 20, 2009 defeating El Hijo del Pantera and Pantera, Exodia Olímpico, ...|$|E

They admit it to be indefensible; they allege its imperative necessity. One young man, who had seen his father take a head in the late war, spoke of the scene with shuddering revolt, and yet said he must go and do likewise himself in the war which was to come.
