5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Judah {{returns to}} his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her {{arranged}} marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that they <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> false revelation changes Juda's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who <b>died,</b> <b>this</b> disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry II, and the {{accession}} of Richard as king, the monks of Christ Church Priory petitioned Richard to intercede in the long-running dispute {{between them and the}} archbishop. In November 1189, Richard and the whole court, including the Queen Mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, travelled to Canterbury in an attempt to end the controversy before the papacy become involved. Richard finally settled the dispute by persuading Baldwin to abandon his church-building project and to dismiss Norreys. Soon after this, Richard left England and Baldwin declared {{that he was going to}} found the proposed church at Lambeth, and then join Richard on crusade. Both Richard and Baldwin agreed to appoint Norreys to Evesham Abbey, as the previous abbot of Evesham, Adam of Evesham, had recently <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> appointment eventually led, after Baldwin's death, to the Case of Evesham. In August 1189 Baldwin objected to the marriage of Prince John, later King John, to Isabel of Gloucester, on the grounds of consanguinity. John promised to obtain a papal dispensation, but never did so. Baldwin laid John's lands under interdict, but it was lifted by a papal legate who declared the marriage legal. Richard also restored to the archbishops of Canterbury the right to operate a mint, staffed by three moneyers.|$|E
5|$|Douglas practised {{on his own}} until 1884, {{when his}} son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into {{partnership}} and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who {{had been born in}} Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During {{the first decade of the}} 20thcentury, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E.J.Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas <b>died,</b> <b>this</b> partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1917, {{manned by}} an almost entirely new crew, Aurora arrived at Cape Evans {{and picked up}} the seven {{survivors}} of the Ross Sea shore party; Mackintosh, Victor Hayward and Arnold Spencer-Smith had all <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> was the vessel's final visit to Antarctic waters; on return to New Zealand it was sold by Shackleton to a coal carrier. Aurora left Newcastle, New South Wales, on 20 June 1917 bound for Chile, and was never seen again, officially posted as missing by Lloyd's of London on 2 January 1918. Among those lost was James Paton, who had acted as the ship's boatswain throughout the Ross Sea Party expedition and the drift, and on the subsequent relief mission. In 1920 King George V appointed Joseph Stenhouse an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), in acknowledgement of his service aboard Aurora.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1371, Vukašin {{was killed}} and his forces {{defeated}} in the Battle of Maritsa. About two months later, Tsar Uroš <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> formally made Marko {{the king of the}} Serbian land; however, Serbian noblemen, who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman vassal; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukašin were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near Skopje (better known as Marko's Monastery), which was completed in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting for the Ottomans against the Wallachians in the Battle of Rovine.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have <b>died</b> <b>this</b> policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he <b>died.</b> <b>This</b> account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E
