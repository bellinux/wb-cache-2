500|$|Truman {{continues}} to sail until – {{to his surprise}} – his boat punctures {{the wall of the}} dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is [...] "no more truth" [...] in the real world and [...] "I know you better than you know yourself", that he brings comfort to his audience and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: [...] "You never had a camera in my head!" [...] and [...] "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> good night," [...] previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Watching the show at home, Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the audience starts looking for something else to watch.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{the more}} risqué humour of Pete and Dud went farther on long-playing records as [...] "Derek and Clive". The first {{recording}} was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of <b>Good</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>and</b> used material conceived years before {{for the two}} characters but considered too outrageous. One of these audio recordings was also filmed and tensions between the duo are seen to rise. Chris Blackwell circulated bootleg copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further Derek and Clive albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.|$|E
60|$|Before the yeoman had replied {{somebody}} {{opened the}} door, and the firelight shone upon {{the uniform of}} the person they discussed. Festus nodded on recognizing him, wished Mrs. Loveday <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> went out precipitately.|$|E

60|$|What {{he had in}} {{his mind}} I know not, but I bade him <b>good</b> <b>even,</b> <b>and</b> went back into the town, where lights were {{beginning}} to show in the casements. In the space within the gates were many carts gathered, full of faggots wherewith to choke up the fosse under Paris, and tables to throw above the faggots, and so cross over to the assault.|$|R

6000|$|... "I take upon myself, sir," [...] said my guardian, {{laughing}} as he rang the bell, [...] "to reply to your proposals {{on behalf of}} Miss Summerson. She is very sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> wishes you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cap, I {{want to tell}} you, I didn't play no circus {{tricks on}} her. Her head had grown white as snow and she looked kind o' sad and feeble. I began to {{understand}} {{a little of the}} worry I'd been to her. I said <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> she turned and looked at me. Then she opened her arms and called out my name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} indeed {{somewhat}} late, bailie," [...] said he, [...] "and I am greatly obligated to your buff-coat, {{and to the}} time you took to put it on. If the secular arm had arrived some {{quarter of an hour}} sooner, I had been {{out of the reach of}} spiritual grace; but as it is, I wish you <b>good</b> <b>even,</b> <b>and</b> a safe riddance out of your garment of durance, in which you have much the air of a hog in armour." ...|$|R
50|$|Heater was {{described}} as {{the man in charge}} of renting horses and receiving the stolen <b>goods.</b> <b>Even</b> Spiggot <b>and</b> Phillips declared that he was innocent. This declarations and the lack of proofs found against him made the jury acquit Heater.|$|R

60|$|She {{pointed to}} the man whom I had passed on {{entering}} the Mews. My cheeks began to burn and my knees to tremble, for I knew that in tracing the cravat to its owner I was advancing a step toward a fresh discovery. I wished Mrs. Horlick <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> said I would write and mention the day on which I wanted her.|$|E
60|$|They came in, {{looking a}} little scared and still holding one another by the hand. They wished the Professor <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> when he rose they backed away from him. The Professor shook hands with them, {{but they did not}} let go, so that Victoria gave him her right hand and Victor his left, and then at the Professor's {{invitation}} they sat themselves down on the extreme edge of the sofa.|$|E
60|$|He put his 'ead {{over the}} fence and bid 'im <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> said wot a fine night for a stroll it was, and asked 'im whether 'e was waiting for Frederick Scott's aunt.

He got up and shook 'is fist in Bob Pretty's face, and then 'e went off stamping down the road as if 'e was going mad.|$|E

"A long story, my lord," [...] said Captain Dalgetty, [...] "is, {{next to a}} <b>good</b> <b>evening</b> draught <b>and</b> a warm nightcap, {{the best}} shoeinghorn for drawing on a sound sleep.

2500|$|The United States {{has lost}} its world {{leadership}} for high-tech <b>goods.</b> <b>Even</b> computing <b>and</b> communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere.

This going home to clean himself {{is one of the}} man’s incomprehensible compromises with inexorable facts; he, and his hat, and his boots, and his clothes, never showing any trace of cleaning, but being uniformly in one {{condition}} of dust and grit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I must be gone," [...] {{said the}} fascinated noble; [...] "I really have not felt in such spirits for some time; I almost fear I have been vulgar {{enough to be}} amusing, eh! eh! eh! but you young men are sad fellows, eh! eh! eh!

6000|$|It was all {{so fresh}} and {{delightful}} to me--the palms, the Mediterranean, the balmy evening air, the gleaming white town, and pretty Ruby Estcourt--that I {{walked up and down}} on the terrace as long as they would let me; and I was really sorry when good Mrs. Shackleford at last suggested that it was surely getting time for uncle's game of cribbage. As they turned to go, Ruby said <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> then, hesitating for a moment as to my name, said quite simply and naturally, [...] "Why, you haven't yet told us who you are, have you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The priest Francisco stepped forward. He {{was very}} pale and seemed terrified. Leonard, {{watching}} him, wondered what {{had brought him}} into such company, for the man's face was <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>even</b> refined.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Sergeant, {{it is not}} Mabel that I distrust, but myself. I am but a poor ignorant woodsman, after all; {{and perhaps}} I'm not, in truth, as <b>good</b> as <b>even</b> you <b>and</b> I may think me." ...|$|R

60|$|She lost that, {{and walked}} away. Then {{she came back}} and put down two florins on a number, and lost again, and became very red and angry; then she retreated, and came back a third time, and a seat being vacated by a player, Lady Kicklebury {{sat down at the}} verdant board. Ah me! She had a pretty <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> carried off a little money again that night. The next day was Sunday: she gave two florins at the {{collection}} at church, to Fanny's surprise at mamma's liberality. On this night of course there was no play. Her ladyship wrote letters, and read a sermon.|$|E
60|$|I expect mine agent {{down on the}} 14th {{to proceed}} to Lancashire, where I hear from all {{quarters}} that I have a very valuable property in coals, etc. I then intend to accept an invitation to Cambridge in October, and shall, perhaps, run up to town. I have four invitations--to Wales, Dorset, Cambridge, and Chester; but I must be a man of business. I am quite alone, as these long letters sadly testify. I perceive, by referring to your letter, that the Ode is from the author; make my thanks acceptable to him. His muse is worthy a nobler theme. You will write as usual, I hope. I wish you <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> am, etc.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will myself warrant my good faith," [...] said Wayland; {{and taking}} {{a part of the}} medicine, he {{swallowed}} it before them. The Countess now bought what remained, a step to which Janet, by further objections, only determined her the more obstinately. She even took the first dose upon the instant, and professed to feel her heart lightened and her spirits augmented--a consequence which, in all probability, existed only in her own imagination. The lady then piled the purchases she had made together, flung her purse to Janet, and desired her to compute the amount, and to pay the pedlar; while she herself, as if tired of the amusement she at first found in conversing with him, wished him <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> walked carelessly into the house, thus depriving Wayland of every opportunity to speak with her in private. He hastened, however, to attempt an explanation with Janet.|$|E

60|$|On {{receipt of}} this assurance, Mr Tigg shook him heartily by both hands, protesting with much earnestness, {{that he was}} one of the most {{consistent}} and remarkable men he had ever met, and that he desired the honour of his better acquaintance. He moreover observed that there were many little characteristics about his friend Slyme, of which he could by no means, as a man of strict honour, approve; but that he was prepared to forgive him all these slight drawbacks, and much more, in consideration of the great pleasure he himself had that day enjoyed in his social intercourse with Mr Pecksniff, which had given him a far higher and more enduring delight than the successful negotiation of any small loan on the part of his friend could possibly have imparted. With which remarks he would beg leave, he said, to wish Mr Pecksniff a very <b>good</b> <b>evening.</b> <b>And</b> so he took himself off; as little abashed by his recent failure as any gentleman would desire to be.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom {{with careful}} hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Still {{you have to}} get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden {{discovered}} with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.|$|E

50|$|The {{link between}} {{consumer}} {{society and its}} impact on mythical themes stems from one fact: myth has become a consumer <b>good,</b> <b>even</b> a basic <b>and</b> generic product, subject to commercial transactions and the supply and demand model.
