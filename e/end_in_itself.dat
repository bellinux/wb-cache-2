5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good lies not in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E
25|$|Cruelty to animals, {{also called}} animal abuse, animal neglect or simply animal cruelty, is the infliction by {{omission}} (animal neglect) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, {{regardless of whether}} the act is against the law. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for food or for their fur; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> defined as zoosadism.|$|E

Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held {{to be a kind of}} dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E

[...] In The Wings of the Dove James provides a memorable example of how Densher and Kete's sexual passion does enter into {{the rest of their lives}} and becomes much more than the act of a moment.|$|R
40|$|The {{admission}} of non-human animals as sensible beings and possessors of interests {{is a historical}} and cultural process in constant development, no more restricted to the philosophical field, reaching also the legal scope and fomenting the discussion about the use (or not) of animals in experiences. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work is to show how the debate about the non-human animal has been received in Brazil and how its legislation has following this theme. Through a theoretical and legal-normative analysis, the present study concludes that exist an increasing concern in protecting the animals against cruelty, towards their recognition as beings with dignity and also subjects of rights. However, it is necessary that society (which still is deeply anthropocentric) be capable of receive an ethic which respects the animals as <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>itselfs,</b> as well as incorporates the existence of the moral relevance of non-human animals...|$|R

Artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Adolph Gottlieb, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Friedel Dzubas, and Frank Stella, and others often used greatly reduced formats, with drawing essentially simplified to repetitive and regulated systems, basic references to nature, {{and a highly}} articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated overt recognizable imagery in favor of abstraction. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> In pursuing this direction of modern art, these artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image often within series' of related types.|$|E

5000|$|Virtue {{ethics is}} a form of ethical theory which emphasises the {{character}} of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test, such as [...] "Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity as an <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim [...] "Let everyone except me be treated as a means", though seemingly immoral, can be universalised. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.|$|R
25|$|Hinduism has {{an ancient}} and {{extensive}} iconography tradition, {{particularly in the}} form of Murti (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, IAST: Mūrti), or Vigraha or Pratima. A Murti is itself not the god in Hinduism, but it is an image of god and represents emotional and religious value. A literal translation of Murti as idol is incorrect, states Jeaneane Fowler, when idol is understood as superstitious <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a Murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a Murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it.|$|E
25|$|Color Field {{painting}} initially {{referred to}} {{a particular type of}} abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt and several series of paintings by Joan Miró. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Robert Motherwell, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Mark Tobey, and especially Ad Reinhardt and Barnett Newman, whose masterpiece Vir heroicus sublimis is in the collection of MoMA, used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> In pursuing this direction of modern art, artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.|$|E
25|$|In {{his famous}} work, Adhyatmopanisatprakarana {{he argued that}} no body of ‘theory’ (sastra), whether Jain or non-Jain, is to be {{accepted}} merely {{on the basis of}} sectarian interest. Instead, the theory should be subject to testing, just as the purity of a sample of gold is determined by tests involving rubbing, cutting and heating (1.17) In one of the ethical works, the Jnanasara, Yashovijaya describes 32 moral and intellectual virtues that constitute a virtuous character. Out of these, two are distinctive: neutrality (madhyasthata) and groundedness in all view-points (sarvanayasraya). Neutrality is explained in terms of the dispassionate use of reason: a person who embodies this virtue follows wherever reason leads, rather than using reason only to defend prior opinions (16.2). Yashovijaya stresses that neutrality is not an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but a means to another end. We adopt a neutral attitude, he says, in the hope it leads to well-being (hita), just as someone who knows that one among a group of herbs is restorative but does not know which one it is, acts reasonably if they swallow the entire lot (16.8).|$|E
