40|$|A {{study was}} ' {{conducted}} in the Navy {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and efficiency of individualized instruction (II) compared to conventional instruction (CI). Comparisons were made concerning the relationships of method of instruction, ability level, and type of training task to training time, training costs, end-of-course grades, and <b>fleet</b> <b>supervisor</b> ratings for graduates of 19 Naizy "A " Schools including more than 5000 persons. Major findings and conclusions of the study were the following: (1) II and CI were found to be equally effective in preparing sailors for operational fleet jobs; (2) within the II category, self-paced and computer-managed instruction were fouhd to be equally effective training methods; (3) II benefited higher ability students more than it did lower ability students; (4) no evidence was obtained concerning which method of instruction most benefited lower ability personnel; (5) CI did not benefit one ability level of students'over another; and (6,) whether CI or II was more effective in teaching training tasks depended On course content. It was inferred from the study that training time, and thus cost, could be reduced by converting current CI courses to an II format [...] at least for higher mental ability students.

40|$|In the past, fleet {{management}} has primarily had an asset management focus, with safety initiatives being reactive to particular incidents or events. More recently, {{it has been}} recommended that fleet managers should work to facilitate a safety conscious organisational culture/climate, though this {{has not yet been}} empirically investigated in a fleet setting. This study investigated the influence of fleet safety climate upon three self-reported measures of work-related driver safety: 1) current work-related driver behaviour; 2) past crash involvement while driving for work; and 3) past traffic offences while driving for work. A questionnaire was completed by 323 drivers from three Queensland based fleets. There was a significant positive relationship between fleet safety climate perceptions and the safety of work-related driver behaviour (r =. 42). Multiple regression analysis revealed that safety climate perceptions were a significant predictor of current work-related driver behaviour and were a better predictor than other psychological and socio-demographic factors. However, further analyses showed that fleet safety climate did not significantly predict previous work-related crash or offence involvement. Some organisational differences were also explored. These results suggest that while fleet safety climate influences current fleet driver behaviour, the long-term effect of this on crash and offence involvement remains unclear. In practical terms, organisations (particularly <b>fleet</b> managers and <b>supervisors)</b> need to consider the impact of organisational factors upon employee driver behaviour. Further research is required to investigate the association between fleet safety climate and on-road incidents (namely crash involvement and traffic offences) ...|$|R
