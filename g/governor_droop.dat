40|$|The {{inclusion}} of the <b>governor</b> <b>droop</b> and dead-band in dynamic models helps to reproduce the measured frequency response accurately and is a key aspect of model validation. Often, accurate and detailed turbine-governor information are not available for various units in an area control centre. The uncertainty in the droop also arise from the nonlinearity due to the governor valves. The droop and deadband are required to tune the secondary frequency bias factors, and to determine the primary frequency reserve. Earlier research on droop estimation did not adequately {{take into account the}} effect of dead-band and other nonlinearities. In this paper, unscented Kalman filter is used in conjunction with continuously available measurements to estimate the <b>governor</b> <b>droop</b> and the dead-band width. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulation...|$|E
30|$|In stage 2, the {{damping ratio}} with maximum {{renewable}} penetration is maximized by keeping all parameters {{in a safe}} limit. The control variables {{that are used in}} the optimization of damping ratios are the exciter amplifier gain Ka, exciter stabilizer gain Kf and turbine <b>governor</b> <b>droop</b> R. Here, the Newton–Raphson model is mainly used to calculate the eigenvalues and damping ratio.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were: to verify the model of off schedule compressor variable geometry in the T 700 turboshaft engine nonlinear model; {{to evaluate the use}} of the pseudo-random binary noise (PRBN) technique for obtaining engine frequency response data; and to design a high performance power turbine speed governor using modern control methods. Reduction of T 700 engine test data generated at NASA-Lewis indicated that the off schedule variable geometry effects were accurate as modeled. Analysis also showed that the PRBN technique combined with the maximum likelihood model identification method produced a Bode frequency response that was as accurate as the response obtained from standard sinewave testing methods. The frequency response verified the accuracy of linear models consisting of engine partial derivatives and used for design. A power turbine governor was designed using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method of full state feedback control. A Kalman filter observer was used to estimate helicopter main rotor blade velocity. Compared to the baseline T 700 power turbine speed governor, the LQR <b>governor</b> reduced <b>droop</b> up to 25 percent for a 490 shaft horsepower transient in 0. 1 sec simulating a wind gust, and up to 85 percent for a 700 shaft horsepower transient in 0. 5 sec simulating a large collective pitch angle transient...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{modeling of}} a micro-grid with PV-Wind-Diesel generator hybrid {{system and its}} operations. The PV system is modeled with a DC/AC inverter with a pre-defined Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control. Fixed speed induction generator based wind turbines are used to model the wind farm. The diesel generator controls are modeled with <b>droop</b> <b>governor</b> and automatic voltage regulator (AVR). The PV inverter controls, including MPPT and voltage droop, are modeled in the DC/AC inverter itself. The proposed MPPT control is more stable with additional input of PV cell temperature. The complete system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software. Performance of this system is studied on (i) fault tripping of the main grid and (ii) islanded operation of micro-grid with intermittent power from the wind and PV plants. The simulation results confirm the smooth operations of the proposed concept for disturbances from main grid as well as due to the intermittent wind and PV renewable power plants. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
30|$|The Security and Quality of Supply Standard (SQSS) {{states that}} the system {{frequency}} of the GB network under normal operating conditions should be maintained at 50  Hz within operational limits of ± 0.5  Hz [9]. The transmission system operator (TSO), National Grid in this case, imposes its own limits of ± 0.2  Hz. This is achieved by operating some generators on a <b>governor</b> <b>droop,</b> normally 4  % or less, and classifying it as a continuous service. When the largest available generation in the system is tripped or an abnormal event equal to that loss is endured, the maximum allowed system frequency deviation is 0.8  Hz. At present, the loss of generation considered is 1, 320  MW, but {{it is expected to}} increase to 1, 800  MW with the connection of new large generators.|$|E
30|$|Primary {{frequency}} control is an automatic governor response {{in proportion to}} the frequency deviation from the scheduled value. This response, also called frequency responsive reserve, is typically provided by a conventional generator with <b>governor</b> <b>droop</b> control to regulate its power output as a function of frequency deviation and droop setting [50, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. A WTG’s primary frequency regulation resembles that of a conventional generator, which is usually activated within a few tens of seconds and sustained for up to 15 min once the grid frequency deviation exceeds the allowable threshold [67]. It {{plays an important role in}} mitigating the steady-state frequency deviation after inertial response until the secondary {{frequency control}} (automatic generation control, AGC) takes over to achieve zero frequency error in the steady-state condition.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental application of LiFePO 4 battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to primary frequency control, currently being performed by Terna, the Italian transmission system operator (TSO). BESS {{performance in the}} primary frequency control role was evaluated {{by means of a}} simplified electrical-thermal circuit model, taking into account also the BESS auxiliary consumptions, coupled with a cycle-life model, in order to assess the expected life of the BESS. Numerical simulations have been carried out considering the system response to real frequency measurements taken in Italy, spanning a whole year; a parametric study taking into account different values of <b>governor</b> <b>droop</b> and of BESS charge/discharge rates (C-rates) was also performed. Simulations, fully validated by experimental results obtained thus far, evidenced a severe trade-off between expected lifetime and overall efficiency, which significantly restricts the choice of operating parameters for frequency control...|$|E
