Although {{there is no}} clear relationship between obesity <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> consumption, studies suggest that eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> could be helpful in preventing childhood obesity. A few school-based interventions targeting youth have been effective at increasing <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> intake. ^ In Austin, Texas, the Sustainable Food Center delivered the Sprouting Healthy Kids (SHK) program that targeted low socio-economic status children in four intervention middle schools. The SHK program delivered six intervention components. This school-based intervention included: a cafeteria component, in-class lessons, an after-school garden program, a field trip to a local farm, food tasting, and farmers 2 ̆ 7 visits to schools.

5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> juices.

A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
