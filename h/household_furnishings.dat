500|$|The {{accession}} of William III and Mary II {{following the}} Glorious Revolution of 1688 triggered another change in needlework fashions.

2500|$|The Rabbis {{interpreted}} the words [...] "sufficient for his need, whatever is lacking for him" [...] in [...] {{to teach the}} level to which the community must help an impoverished person. Based on these words, the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that if an orphan applied to the community for assistance to marry, the community must rent a house, supply a bed and necessary <b>household</b> <b>furnishings,</b> {{and put on the}} wedding, as [...] says, [...] "sufficient for his need, whatever is lacking for him." [...] The Rabbis {{interpreted the}} words [...] "sufficient for his need" [...] to refer to the house, [...] "whatever is lacking" [...] to refer to a bed and a table, and [...] "for him ( [...] , lo)" [...] to refer to a wife, as [...] uses the same term, [...] "for him ( [...] , lo)," [...] to refer to Adam's wife, whom [...] calls [...] "a helpmate for him." [...] The Rabbis taught that the words [...] "sufficient for his need" [...] command us to maintain the poor person, but not to make the poor person rich. But the Gemara interpreted the words [...] "whatever is lacking for him" [...] to include even a horse to ride upon and a servant to run before the impoverished person, if that was what the particular person lacked. The Gemara told that once Hillel bought for a certain impoverished man from an affluent family a horse to ride upon and a servant to run before him, and once when Hillel could not find a servant to run before the impoverished man, Hillel himself ran before him for three miles. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that once the people of Upper Galilee bought a pound of meat every day for an impoverished member of an affluent family of Sepphoris. Rav Huna taught that they bought for him a pound of premium poultry, or if you prefer, the amount of ordinary meat that they could buy with a pound of money. Rav Ashi taught that the place was such a small village with so few buyers for meat that every day they had to waste a whole animal just to provide for the pauper's needs. Once when a pauper applied to Rabbi Nehemiah for support, Rabbi Nehemiah asked him of what his meals consisted. The pauper told Rabbi Nehemiah that he had been used to eating well-marbled meat and aged wine. Rabbi Nehemiah asked him whether he could get by with Rabbi Nehemiah on a diet of lentils. The pauper consented, joined Rabbi Nehemiah on a diet of lentils, and then died. Rabbi Nehemiah lamented that he had caused the pauper's death by not feeding him the diet to which he had been accustomed, but the Gemara answered that the pauper himself was responsible for his own death, for he should not have allowed himself to become dependent on such a luxurious diet. Once when a pauper applied to Rava for support, Rava asked him of what his meals consisted. The pauper told Rava that he had been used to eating fattened chicken and aged wine. Rava asked the pauper whether he considered the burden on the community of maintaining such a lifestyle. The pauper replied that he was not eating what the community provided, but what God provided, as [...] says: [...] "The eyes of all wait for You, and You give them their food in due season." [...] As the verse does not say [...] "in their season" [...] (in the plural), but [...] "in His season" [...] (in the singular), it teaches that God provides every person the food that the person needs. Just then, Rava's sister, who had not seen him for 13 years, arrived with a fattened chicken and aged wine. Thereupon, Rava exclaimed at the coincidence, apologized to the pauper, and invited him to come and eat.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on testing {{for the presence}} of cyclical asymmetry in consumers' expenditure is extended via the application of tests for time deformation to UK data subject to a high degree of disaggregation.

Closer examination of highly disaggregated expenditure further reveals that time deformation is an intrinsic property of a particular set of expenditure categories including <b>household</b> fittings and <b>furnishings,</b> communication and information technology, vehicles and utilities. These results suggest that such consumers' expenditures 'speed up' during expansions, most likely being driven by the relaxation of credit rationing constraints due to transient income windfalls or the easing of credit conditions, and possibly associated with housing market conditions subsequent to financial market liberalization. ...|$|R

Numerous unfired cover tiles had been carefully placed on the floor to dry under the shade of the roof. As the building caught fire, either in an attempt to put out the fire or to flee from the building, those within the structure trod upon the tiles, leaving their footprints in the drying clay. 4 The fire may have begun in or near the workshop.

The objective of this internship based project is to assess product environmental footprint throughout multiple tiers of the garment supply chain. The approach to resolve the problem is to investigate of the current state of Li & Fung factories, create a mobile tool to collect and analyze data from factories and produce final environmental scores for factories and products. The mobile tool and the environmental scores will allow (1) factories to benchmark against each other in terms of their environmental performance, and (2) provide essential data to brands (Li & Fung customers) to make more conscious sourcing decisions. by Hashim Alhamad.

30|$|As a final {{exercise}} {{aimed at}} more formally determining {{the extent of}} convergence {{in each of the}} 12 COICOP groups of goods and services across the 50 provinces forming Spain, we apply the pairwise convergence approach of Pesaran (2007 a) to each of these groups of goods and services over the 1994.1 – 2015.11 period. This exercise, in line with that conducted by Yilmazkuday (2013), constitutes an indirect way to assess whether the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis holds across the Spanish provinces over the period under scrutiny. If this hypothesis is to hold, convergence among pairs of provincial inflation rates should be more prevalent in those groups involving tradable goods, since cross-province trade would help eliminate inflation differentials. In contrast, for those groups mainly composed of non-tradable goods and services, a lower extent of convergence among provincial inflation pairs is expected. Hence, one would expect a higher degree of convergence for the following groups involving tradable goods and services: food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, clothing and footwear, and transport. A lower degree of convergence is expected in those groups involving a mix of tradables and non-tradables such as <b>furnishings,</b> <b>household</b> equipment and routine housing maintenance, and recreation and culture; and an even lower degree of convergence for those groups involving mainly non-tradables (in most cases services) such as housing, health, communications, education, restaurants, cafés and hotels, and miscellaneous goods and services.|$|R
40|$|Display {{architecture}} was {{a crucial}} marketing strategy for British department stores of the Victorian and Edwardian period. There developed an essential link between the growth of department stores and the complexity in display strategies. For the period 1890 to 1914, the ‘Belle Époque’ of department stores, the level of sophistication in display architecture reached new heights. London department stores such as Whiteleys, Maples, Shoolbred, Heals, Waring & Gillow and Harrods expanded, added new departments and invented enticing ways of making their products more appealing to consumers. A prominent example was the “model room”, a construction of tantalising and impressive modern domestic interiors {{in an array of}} styles and budgets, complete with ceilings, panelled walls, plants and lighting offering viewers a dazzling visual and sensory experience of the real thing. This chapter examines the “model room” as a specific retailing strategy that became instrumental to the highly successful display, advertising and selling of furniture, <b>furnishings,</b> <b>household</b> goods and decorating services in this period. The model or “specimen room”, as it was called at the time, appeared {{as a consequence of the}} massive increase in urban housing in the late-nineteenth century. In response to the growing demand for furniture and furnishings, the stores set up realistically looking domestic interiors. The chapter also discusses the impact of the Antique Movement and the craze for the “period room”, both of which were instrumental in disseminating historicist styles and popularizing model rooms...|$|R
