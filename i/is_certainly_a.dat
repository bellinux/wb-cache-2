25|$|The covered bowl is {{a vessel}} of {{particular}} interest. It is the earliest {{object in the}} hoard, {{and the only one}} whose general area of manufacture within the Roman Empire is known for certain. It belongs to a type that is known to have been manufactured in Gaul in the 3rd century AD. It has a narrow horizontal flange set below the upright rim and decorated with scroll patterns inlaid in niello, and a small nielloed rosette within the centre base. It has a high, domed lid that fits neatly over the vertical rim and has been decorated in a very different style, with two friezes of low-relief decoration. The upper zone consists of conventional foliate ornament, while the lower is a scene of centaurs attacking various wild animals, separated by Bacchic masks. The small raised rim {{at the top of the}} lid would have sufficed for handling it, but set within it is a 'knob' in the form of a silver-gilt statuette of a young, seated triton blowing a conch shell. This figure may well be a secondary addition to the lid; and the lid, in 4th century style, <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> secondary addition to the bowl.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} Parthian art {{work is the}} bronze statue of a local prince found in the Iranian {{province}} of Bachtiyārī at Shami. It was found by farmers in {{the remains of a}} small shrine of Greek gods and Seleucid kings, who eventually became the cult of the gods and also of past rulers. The statue is almost perfectly preserved, with only the hands missing. It is made of two parts and consists of the body and the head, which was carried out separately and fitted later. The prince is standing in Parthian clothes with a dagger on the side. He wears medium length hair and a mustache. He wears long trousers and a tunic that leaves his chest partially exposed. The figure is aligned in front, radiating power and authority, even if the head seems disproportionately small. Daniel Schlumberger remarks that there <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> specific type that would have dressed thus. Here is a typical Parthian nobleman, {{as can be seen in}} the details of the costume. An inscription at the base assigns it to a specific person. The dating is uncertain, ranging somewhere from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD The prince has not yet been identified, though, is often assumed to be Surenas. The high quality of the work sparked a lively debate about the place of manufacture. Theories range from Susa to an artist from Palmyra, who created the work on site.|$|E
25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

This esteem is expressed in the following passage ‘Ezra would have been worthy to have made known the law if Moses had not come before him.’ Truly Muhammad sought to cast suspicion on the Jews’ faith in the unity of God, and thought he had here found a good opportunity of so doing.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{origin of}} the English word [...] is, {{like that of the}} cultivated saffron clone itself, of somewhat uncertain origin. It immediately stems from the Latin word [...] via the 12th-century Old French term [...] The French was borrowed from [...] (za'farān), ultimately from Akkadian azupiranu, [...] "saffron". The Latin form [...] is also the source of the Catalan , Italian , but Portuguese , and Spanish [...] come from the Arabic az-zaferán. The Latin term crocus <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> Semitic loan word. It is adapted from the Aramaic form kurkema via the Arabic term kurkum and the Greek intermediate κρόκος krokos, which once again signifies [...] "yellowish". The Sanskrit kunkumam might be in some way related to the Semitic term.|$|E

Krøyer's own presence at the table indicates that the painting {{might well have been}} based on a photograph. He had bought his first camera in 1885 and by the 1890s had become a keen photographer.

500|$|Although {{the work}} is often thought of as an unflattering and cold look at an ageing pope besieged by cunning and {{opportunistic}} relatives, the reality is more complex and the artist's intention more subtle. It <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> very unguarded portrait {{of one of the}} most powerful men of his day, and in stark contrast to Titian's two earlier portraits of Paul, both of which were deferential. It is widely accepted as one of the most politically difficult portrait commissions in art history, requiring an understanding of the interplay of relationships with a depth [...] "worthy of Shakespeare", in the opinion of art historians Rodolfo Pallucchini and Harold Wethey. However, it was one Titian seems to have resolved; while the complexity of the relationships is all on the canvas, it may have been intended as an indicator to Charles that Paul retained his position as the dominant patriarch– old and frail but still a man of vitality, and in control of his squabbling descendants.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club wrote a mixed {{review and}} gave it a C+. He noted that the episode's closing scene, wherein Jim, Dwight, and Harry talk about Robert California ruining the company, was an example of a retcon that [...] "the shift to a world with actual {{consequences}} <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> {{step in the right direction}} for the series, and one that slightly elevates 'Turf War' if not the season as a whole." [...] However, McNutt was largely critical of the writing, noting that the closure of the Binghamton branch was a [...] "cheap segue" [...] that [...] "render the show's characters as subservient to the narrative whims of the writers." [...] He argued—specifically citing the unconcernedness that the Scranton employees showed after hearing that a neighboring branch was shut down—that many of the characters' motives were not effective because they simply acted as ciphers, through which the larger plots could unfold.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from many music critics.

[...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 is an average comic book all the way around.
