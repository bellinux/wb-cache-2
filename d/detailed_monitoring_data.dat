40|$|A {{new method}} for {{assessing}} the grid interaction of a building’s electricity consumption and generation is presented. It consists of the Grid Support Coefficients GSCabs and GSCrel. GSCabs "weights" the electricity consumption profile with a time-resolved reference quantity which expresses the availability of electricity in the public grid (here: stock electricity price, residual load, cumulative energy consumption or fraction of wind and PV in the electricity mix). GSCrel relates GSCabs to the worst and best achievable values {{on a scale of}} − 100 to 100 in order to increase the comparability of the results. The new evaluation method is applied to analyze the electricity consumption and/or production of 52 different energy supply systems in buildings, where <b>detailed</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> are available. These examples include twelve heat pumps or chillers in office buildings, 38 heat pumps in residential buildings and two combined heat and power units (CHP) in multi-family buildings, all located in Germany.

40|$|Building Energy Performance Simulations (BEPS) {{become more}} and more common in the design process of energy {{efficient}} buildings. Despite the many attempts to improve the user friendliness of these applications there is still an important effort required to create a well-adapted model. One of the main issues is the necessity to re-introduce manually data originating from different sources: project specific geometry as well as component and material properties from manufacturers. This tedious and error prone process can lead to poor judgment or input errors that can have significant impact on the correctness of the model predictions. In order to tackle these issues, studies have recently set their focus on the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and its standard format Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to (partially) automate the BEPS model creation. Nonetheless, most of the existing tools relying on this concept are either commercial software, complex to use for a non BIM expert or still under development. To facilitate the use of an IFC model as a base for BEPS model creation, the focus of this research is to implement and test an open and easy to use PYTHON package which maps IFC objects and their relations to objects of a Modelica library to assist the BEPS modeller. The PYTHON package is intended to reduce the workload and human involvement within the modelling process by generating automatically a “pre-model”. This “pre-model” is a semi- configured BEPS obtained from the IFC to Modelica mapping and contains the relevant information retrieved from the BIM including building geometry, spaces together with a description of their function and occupation, material properties, HVAC components with their properties and how they are connected,… Nevertheless, not all required information for the BEPS-model implementation is present in the BIM and the modeller might want to reduce model complexity, especially in early design stages, or introduce additional aspects. The necessity to manually introduce missing data and to adapt and correct the “pre-model” to obtain the final BEPS-model motivated the use of Modelica which facilitates model modification from top to component level. A two-phase approach was implemented: first the IFC model is parsed, relevant information is extracted and a “space topology” based on the space boundaries characteristics defined in the BIM is generated. In the second step the “pre-model” for building and systems is created using a template corresponding to the Modelica library structure. To investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the implementation, a step-by-step validation was performed. Starting from a simple four walls building a rigorous checking of the mapping consistency was undertaken. Gradually the complexity level of the test cases was increased. A successful mapping to the IDEAS Modelica library was achieved for the BuildingSMART duplex apartment building case. Finally the method was applied to a university building with <b>detailed</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> available. The obtained BEPS-model was calibrated and used for fault detection and diagnosis. Despite some limitations of the current implementation, the PYTHON package significantly improves the process of BEPS-model creation for the studied building and its HVAC system. status: publishe...|$|E

The purpose of the Energy Simulations and Projected State-Wide Energy Savings project is to develop reasonable energy performance and cost models for high performance relocatable classrooms (RCs) across California climates. A key objective of the energy monitoring was to validate DOE 2 simulations for comparison to initial DOE 2 performance projections.

40|$|Spring water {{resources}} are an irreplaceable source {{of drinking water}} supply and therefore must be adequately protected in terms of quality and quantity. The assessment of an aquifer's vulnerability to pollution is the key stage for the sizing of protection areas. The information regarding the type of aquifer and its behavior is rather poor and, {{with the exception of}} data related to geological surveys, few hydrogeological data are available (aquifer tests, geological surveys, etc….). A suitable method to analyze the behavior of an aquifer is to monitor the three parameters of spring water: flow rate, temperature and electric conductivity.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The amount of electricity used in individual UK homes varies considerably. Previous UK energy research has identified that high electricity consuming homes not only use more electricity, compared with others, but appear to be consuming even more electricity over time. Furthermore, there is additional evidence which shows that high consuming dwellings also have a greater potential to make energy savings than those who consume less. It {{has been suggested that}} future UK energy policy might focus on reducing the demand of high electricity consumers in order to reduce overall CO 2 emissions. Therefore, understanding what drives high usage in domestic buildings is essential to support informed decisions. This thesis asserts that to improve knowledge and understanding of the factors affecting high electrical energy consumption in UK domestic buildings, it is necessary to combine an analysis of the occupants socio-economic characteristics, dwelling technical characteristics and appliance related aspects, with <b>detailed</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the ownership, power demand and occupants use of electrical appliances. Using a sample of 315 UK homes, the influence of socio-economic, technical and appliance related characteristics on the probability of a household being a high electrical energy consumer was investigated (Odds ratio analysis). <b>Detailed</b> appliance <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> was collected from 27 UK homes to establish the contributions of appliance ownership, power demand and use to high electrical energy demand (Appliance Electricity Use Survey). The current research found similar skewed electricity distributions towards high electricity consumers for both the 315 and 27 home cohorts. Conflicting results were however obtained from the two household samples with regard to whether high electricity consumers are increasing electrical energy demand over time. The results of the odds ratio analysis and Appliance Electricity Use Survey suggest that high electricity consumption in domestic buildings is related to a combination of the socio-economic characteristics of the building occupants, technical characteristics of the dwelling and the ownership, power demand and use of electrical appliances...|$|R

The DRASTIC model and GIS was used to calculate and produce vulnerability maps. A <b>detailed</b> <b>monitoring</b> of <b>data</b> processing was performed to control {{the accuracy of the}} vulnerability maps. Overall estimates involved identifying errors and uncertainty associated with spatial and descriptive data used to run the model. The data analysed was related to wells, drillings, thematic maps, and also multiple processing data including errors and uncertainty attributed to calculations of the hydraulic conductivity, data interpolations, intersections of spatial data layers, etc. A categorization system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) was proposed to categorize spatial data with respect to the degree and sources of possible uncertainties. This article presents the categorization system used, an example of an application for an study area and a discussion around its usefulness in controlling data processing (GIS and model integration). This work shows that uncertainty associated with spatial data processing and integrating data to a numerical system can be very significant, the main ambiguity occurring when cleaning data, interpolating, classifying and overlaying. Uncertainty characterization on the data processes was a valuable source of information. Monitoring the uncertainty associated with spatial data processing is almost more important to assemble than the model itself. However uncertainty monitoring may be complex and subjective and in fact it is rarely done on a regular basis mainly because it requires much more efforts compare to simply running the model...|$|R

40|$|After closure and {{flooding}} of many deep coal and ore mines {{in the early}} nineties of last century in Czech Republic the very dynamic and dramatic geochemical evolution of mine water occurred. Despite differences in geological setting, type of ore deposit or hydrogeology, a similar behavior was observed. During the period of several weeks to several months after flooding and discharging mine water to the surface, typical stable concentrations of dissolved species included heavy metals were observed. These concentrations were comparable to those observed during mining {{and flooding}}. This initial period was followed by steep increase of dissolved solids concentration by several orders of magnitude. Within {{one or two years}} this trend was reversed and exponential decrease lasting several years was observed. Based on <b>detailed</b> long term <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> from six ore and coal mines in Czech Republic simple three reservoir dynamic model was defined and kinetic parameters were evaluated. Later verification of this model proved that this description is accurate enough to forecast geochemical evolution of mine water chemistry for periods exceeding ten years. All long term trends are strongly modified by seasonal influences but there is no direct or apparent connection between seasonal and long term trends and hydro-meteorological regime on particular locality. Despite of these common features, spatial and temporal separation of individual components (e. g. iron, manganese, uranium...|$|R

The case studies comprise the widening of existing twin road tunnels within Hawkesbury sandstone and the excavation of a large cavern within Ashfield shale. While back-analysis from <b>detailed</b> systematic <b>monitoring</b> has been previously published, this paper presents a relatively simple methodology to derive rock mass modulus and in situ stress from the relatively simple displacement data routinely recorded during tunnelling...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{environmental}} monitoring {{has become an}} important technique for scientific research and integrated management of coastal zone, which could produce {{a large number of}} long- term, fixed-point, continuous, large-scale, multi-factor <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> from space, air, sea surface, underwater, to seabed and etc. In this paper, the framework of the coastal environmental <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> integration was proposed, which aimed to solve three main problems of coastal {{environmental monitoring}}: to acquire and express <b>monitoring</b> <b>data,</b> then to achieve the integration of <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> and services, and finally to apply <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> to visualization and professional applications. The framework could effectively implement collection, transmission, storage, handling and application of these <b>monitoring</b> <b>data,</b> to provide more <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> and applications to end users.
