5|$|MacDougall stated his {{experiment}} {{would have}} to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment is widely regarded as flawed and unscientific due to the small sample size, the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis. The case has been cited as an example of selective reporting. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, and specifically that <b>it</b> <b>weighs</b> 21 grams.|$|E

5|$|The Heilongjiang hand cannon or hand-gun is {{a bronze}} hand cannon {{manufactured}} {{no later than}} 1288 and is possibly the world's oldest confirmed surviving firearm. <b>It</b> <b>weighs</b> 3.55kg (7.83 pounds) and is 34 centimeters (13.4 inches) long. The Heilongjiang hand cannon was excavated during the 1970s in Banlachengzi, a village in Acheng District, Heilongjiang province, China. It was found alongside other bronze artifacts made {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin Dynasty (12th–13th century). The hand cannon was probably used in battles fought nearby Banlachengzi in 1287 and 1288. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander by the name of Li Ting led a group of soldiers equipped with hand cannons into a military camp in 1288, as part of an anti-rebellion campaign for the Yuan dynasty. The cannon currently resides at the Heilongjiang Provincial Museum in Harbin, China.|$|E

5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and <b>it</b> <b>weighs</b> , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E

25|$|The dam was {{topped by}} a monumental lion {{sculpture}} created by Belgian artist Antoine-Félix Bouré, noted for his public lions in Brussels and Charleroi.

In 1970, during work to heighten the dam, the lion was dismantled and moved as a precaution. After the dam construction was completed, it took 40 days to restore the lion to its eastward-facing position atop the wall. A lion is sometimes used as an emblem in promotional materials and tourist brochures for the Vesdre area.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>weighs</b> only 400 pounds {{more than}} the Model 41 cavalry gun, it is {{possible}} that the Model 95 may have been intended to replace that weapon. However, its use on Saipan and its close resemblance to the heavier Model 90 may indicate that the latter weapon was too heavy for efficient horse-draft, and too complex for the capabilities of Japanese industry. Though the Model 95 was split-trailed, it actually weighed less than the improved Model 38 75mm gun. The Model 95 was much lighter than its Schneider prototype, and had a sliding wedge rather than an interrupted thread breechblock. It incorporated all features of modern Japanese design.|$|E
