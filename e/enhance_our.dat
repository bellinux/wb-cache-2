We are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms, where we are able to use lies and deception to <b>enhance</b> <b>our</b> chances of survival and reproduction. Stereotypically speaking, men like to exaggerate about their sexual expertise but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make themselves more respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a ‘scarlet woman’.|$|E
25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that <b>enhance</b> <b>our</b> experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E

A review shows that the definitions of sustainability differ from one disciplinary field to another. Therefore, this article aims to conceptually synthesize the interdisciplinary literature on sustainability, from environmental and ecological perspectives. This article critically explores environmental and ecological literature on sustainability recognizing {{the views of the}} two perspectives, and then synthesizes concepts, where each concept has distinctive synergetic meanings. The analytical process elaborates a set of concepts that together assemble the conceptual framework for <b>enhancing</b> <b>our</b> understanding about sustainability. The research question which this article tries to answer is whether environmental and ecological economics as two perspectives adequately provide synergetic views for <b>enhancing</b> <b>our</b> understanding in view of sustainability. If so, what is the conceptual framework for <b>enhancing</b> <b>our</b> understanding about sustainability...|$|R

60|$|Then in mournful silence {{we turned}} away, {{and that night}} we ate our last mouthful in another valley, and forgot the gnawing hunger in broken sleep, through which a wet face {{persistently}} haunted me. When we arose there {{was not even a}} handful of caked flour in the damp bag, and during a discussion the miner, in reply to Harry's statement, said it did not follow that there were no deer or bear in the country because we had not seen them. Men tramping noisily behind shod horses do not generally chance upon the shy deer, he pointed out; while if two previous hunts had proved unsuccessful, we might do better on the third. It was at least four days' march to the nearest dwelling, and I agreed with his observation that no starving men could march for four days through such a country. So, to <b>enhance</b> <b>our</b> chances, the company divided, agreeing to meet again, if they killed nothing, at the same spot by sunset.|$|E
60|$|The Giesbach is a {{succession}} of falls, whose water comes from a glacier, and which are produced by the sinuosities of the leaps and inclined planes of a mountain side, aided by rocks and precipices. It is very beautiful, and may well rank as {{the third or fourth}} cascade of Switzerland, for variety, volume of water, and general effect. A family has established itself among the rocks, to pick up a penny by making boxes of larch, and singing the different ranz des raches. Your mountain music does not do so well, when it has an air so seriously premeditated, and one soon gels to be a little blasé on the subject of entertainments of this sort, which can only succeed once, and then with the novice. Alas! I have actually stood before the entrance of the cathedral at Rouen, and the strongest feeling of the moment was that of surprise at the manner in which my nerves had thrilled, when it was first seen. I do not believe that childhood, with its unsophistication and freshness, affords the greatest pleasures, for every hour tells me how much reason and cultivation <b>enhance</b> <b>our</b> enjoyments; but there are certainly gratifications that can be felt but once; and if an opera of Rossini or Meyerbeer grows on us at each representation, or a fine poem improves on acquaintance, the singing of your Swiss nightingales is sweeter in its first notes than in its second.|$|E
60|$|It {{may be as}} well {{to speak}} first of the faults which were {{attributed}} to it. It was said that the good people were all fools, and that the clever people were all knaves. When the critics,--the talking critics {{as well as the}} writing critics,--began to discuss Vanity Fair, there had already grown up a feeling as to Thackeray as an author--that he was one who had taken up the business of castigating the vices of the world. Scott had dealt with the heroics, whether displayed in his Flora MacIvors or Meg Merrilieses, in his Ivanhoes or Ochiltrees. Miss Edgeworth had been moral; Miss Austen conventional; Bulwer had been poetical and sentimental; Marryat and Lever had been funny and pugnacious, always with a dash of gallantry, displaying funny naval and funny military life; and Dickens had already become great in painting the virtues of the lower orders. But by all these some kind of virtue had been sung, though it might be only the virtue of riding a horse or fighting a duel. Even Eugene Aram and Jack Sheppard, with whom Thackeray found so much fault, were intended to be fine fellows, though they broke into houses and committed murders. The primary object of all those writers was to create an interest by exciting sympathy. To <b>enhance</b> <b>our</b> sympathy personages were introduced who were very vile indeed,--as Bucklaw, {{in the guise of a}} lover, to heighten our feelings for Ravenswood and Lucy; as Wild, as a thief-taker, to make us more anxious for the saving of Jack; as Ralph Nickleby, to pile up the pity for his niece Kate. But each of these novelists might have appropriately begun with an Arma virumque cano. The song was to be of something godlike,--even with a Peter Simple. With Thackeray it had been altogether different. Alas, alas! the meanness of human wishes; the poorness of human results! That had been his tone. There can be no doubt that the heroic had appeared contemptible to him, as being untrue. The girl who had deceived her papa and mamma seemed more probable to him than she who perished under the willow-tree from sheer love,--as given in the last chapter. Why sing songs that are false? Why tell of Lucy Ashtons and Kate Nicklebys, when pretty girls, let them be ever so beautiful, can be silly and sly? Why pour philosophy out of the mouth of a fashionable young gentleman like Pelham, seeing that young gentlemen of that sort rarely, or we may say never, talk after that fashion? Why make a housebreaker a gallant charming young fellow, the truth being that housebreakers as a rule are as objectionable in their manners as they are in their morals? Thackeray's mind had in truth worked in this way, and he had become a satirist. That had been all very well for Fraser and Punch; but when his satire was continued through a long novel, in twenty-four parts, readers,--who do in truth like the heroic better than the wicked,--began to declare that this writer was no novelist, but only a cynic.|$|E
