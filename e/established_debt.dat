25|$|One of {{the notable}} {{measures}} taken by Huq included using both administrative and legal measures {{to relieve the}} debts of peasants and farmers. He protected the poor agriculturists from the clutches of the usurious creditors by enforcing the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938). He <b>established</b> <b>Debt</b> Settlement Boards {{in all parts of}} Bengal. The Money Lenders' Act (1938) and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938) improved the lot of the peasants. The Land Revenue Commission appointed by the Government of Bengal on 5 November 1938 with Sir Francis Floud as Chairman, submitted the final report on 21 March 1940. This was the most valuable document related to the land system of the country. The Tenancy Act of 1885 was amended by the Act of 1938 and thereby all provisions relating to enhancement of rent were suspended for a period of 10 years. It also abolished all kinds of ABWAB and selamis (imposts) imposed traditionally by the zamindars on raiyats. The raiyats got the right to transfer their land without paying any transfer-fee to zamindars. The law reduced the interest rate for arrears of rent from 12.50% to 6.25%. The raiyats also got the right to get possession of the nadi sekasti (land lost through river erosion and appeared again) land by payment of four years of rent within twenty years of the erosion. Thus several acts enforced during Huq's Premiership helped the peasants to lighten some of their burdens though Huq could not fully execute his programme of Dal-Bhat placed before the people during his election campaigns. Huq also promoted affirmative action for Bengali Muslims.|$|E

40|$|The Treaty of Maastricht <b>established</b> <b>debt</b> and deficit limits {{which states}} should meet {{if they are}} to {{participate}} in a future monetary union. This paper considers the relationship between electoral and legislative institutions on the one hand, and the size of a given European country's budget deficit on the other. Plurality electoral systems have a "winner-take-all" rule where only the top vote-getter in each district wins a seat in Parliament. One way incumbent legislators can appeal for support is to bring home particularistic benefits, such as public works projects. Since her district pays {{only a small portion of}} the central government's tax revenues, however, she will ask for more spending when the central government pays for them when they have to be paid for with local taxes. In states with proportional representation, on the other hand, candidates do not have the same incentive to offer particularistic benefits to their electorates. Parliamentary rules which restrict or eliminate the ability of legislators to amend budgetary bills will consequently have the greatest effect in limiting spending in states with single member districts. One of the most effective restrictions is that legislators can only approve or disapprove the entire budget under a "closed rule. " Such rules give the government near or complete agenda-setting power. Legislators cannot attach extra spending in their districts. This theoretical point stands in contrast to authors who would predict that a move to single member districts alone in a country like Italy would lead directly to lower budget deficits. I will argue that simple change in the electoral system could lead to higher deficits if legislators are not prevented from providing particularistic benefits to their districts. Similarly restrictive parliamentary rules found in France and the United Kingdom are needed in Italy, for instance, if spending is to be limited at the legislative stage...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} bad debt and uncollected accounts in {{the banks and}} other creditors have affected the cash inflow very badly. The transformation of bad debt into cash flow is vey crucial for daily business operation or for further expansion in the future. In view of the above, effective collection and recovery of bad debt strategies are {{very important for the}} business to be successful and mitigate losses. Banks and creditors maintain the current recovery model, the in-house collection activities to recover the bad debt. However, in certain circumstances, the amount recovered is not as expected and as such, alternative options are required. The two most feasible and efficient recovery tools are to outsource the bad debt to an <b>established</b> <b>debt</b> collection agency or to sell the bad debt to an interested buyer to maximize the recovery. The procedures, concepts, and workflow including the guidelines of Bank Negara Malaysia involved in all the three options are outlined to have a better understanding and comparison on the different recovery activities. Literature reviews on the causes of bad debt and other recovery tools are discussed with the relevant examples. These bad debt problems are not only affecting Malaysia, but also has been a major problem in the developed and emerging economies. The worldwide financial crisis has affected a lot of banks and other creditors with substantial amount of bad debt.

Although the work stream guidelines are to be welcomed because they attempt to find a solution for the vagueness and insufficiency of the NCA and Regulations, it is submitted that the situation is still not desirable. Many credit providers and debt counsellors did not form part of the work stream processes and therefore cannot be bound by these agreements. The NCR's application to the High Court for a declaratory order in terms of section 16 (1) (b) (ii) may shed some light on the problems currently experienced, however, it is submitted that the best solution is for the legislator to address these shortcomings in order to bring about a proper and effective debt counselling process. By also taking the Draft Debt Counselling Regulations into consideration, certain issues which, in our view, should be addressed by the legislator are identified and proposals for the amendment of provisions of the NCA are made. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the NCA's provisions to provide debt relief to the over-indebted consumer depends on the co-operation of the different role players and compliance with the spirit of the Act in terms of section 86 (5) (b) to participate in good faith in the review and in the negotiations for debt rearrangement. It is submitted that in theses negotiations the purpose of the Act, namely to protect consumers, should constantly be kept in mind. Credit providers will have to change their attitudes and appreciate the fact that they will have to take greater responsibility for the negative consequences of credit granting. It is furthermore submitted that more should still be done to prevent over-indebtedness and to reduce the need for consumers to resort to the debt relief mechanisms of the Act. The apparent need for consumer education at both the adult and school level should therefore be addressed...|$|E
