40|$|An {{integral}} component within Jerne's idiotype {{network theory}} (1) is the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> antibody (Ab) 1 that bears determinants within the variable (V) region resembling external antigens. <b>Internal</b> <b>images</b> mimicking viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and natural ligands {{have been described}} (2 - 5) and have generated interest in their use as potential vaccines and probes for cellular receptors (6). The structural basis for <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> expression, however, remains largely unknown. Two recent studies using the synthetic (Glub°Ala 3 °Tyrt°) terpolymer (7) and the reovirus hemagglutinin (8) have identified determinants in Ab <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> V regions that appear to match linear or continuous sequences within each respective antigen. Further insight into the molecular nature of <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> and the rules that govern antigen recognition will be crucial for the rational design of <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> vaccines {{and an understanding of}} idiotypic interactions. To investigate <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> expression in a well-defined protein system, we have used the al allotype of rabbit Ig as a model antigen (9 - 11) and have isolated two mouse mAbs that bear al-like determinants within their antigen-binding sites (12) ...|$|R

With {{the use of this}} method users quickly get an idea of what the web page is all about and help in recalling the visited web page. The <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> of web page are usually used to describe the content of a webpage. <b>Internal</b> <b>images</b> in web pages are generally worthy for this purpose. Nevertheless, in many web pages dominant <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> are unavailable. So, we move towards a new approach i. e. external image summarization to summarize web pages without any dominant <b>internal</b> <b>images.</b> But, external images are sometimes unreliable {{because of the way they}} are retrieved from internet. By taking advantage of <b>internal</b> and external <b>images</b> we propose a scheme for visual summarization. To improve the reliability of external images, relevant external images are retrieved from the Internet by considering textual and visual importance between target webpage and hosting webpage. Relevance, Dominance and typicality of the image with respect to web page are the features of images. We propose an Affinity Propagation Clustering based algorithm to select the best of <b>internal</b> and external <b>images</b> as summarization.

40|$|Visual {{summarization}} is {{an attractive}} new scheme to summarize web pages, which can help achieve a more friendly user experience in search and re-finding tasks by allowing users quickly get the {{idea of what the}} web page is about and helping users recall the visited web page. In this paper, we perform a careful study on the recently proposed visual summarization approaches, including the thumbnail of the web page snapshot, the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> in the web page which is representative of the content in the page, and the visual snippet which is a synthesized image based on the <b>internal</b> <b>image,</b> the title, and the logo found in the web page. Moreover, since the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> based summarization approach hardly works when the representative <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> are unavailable, we propose a new strategy, which retrieves the representative image from the external to summarize the web page. The experimental results suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective advantages on different types of web pages. While <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> and thumbnails can provide a reliable summarization on web pages with dominant images and web pages with simple structure respectively, the external images are regarded as a useful information to complement the <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> and are demonstrated very useful in helping users understanding new web pages. The visual snippet performs well on the re-finding tasks since it incorporates the title and logo which are advantageous on identifying the visited web pages...|$|R
40|$|Exploring {{representations}} is {{a fundamental}} step towards understanding vision. The visual sys-tem carries two types of information along separate pathways: One is {{about what it is}} and the other is about where it is (1 – 3). Initially, the what is represented by a pattern of activity that is distributed across millions of photoreceptors, whereas the where is “implicitly ” given as their retinotopic positions. Many computational theories of object recognition rely on such pixel-based representations (4 – 9), but they are insufficient to learn spatial information such as position and size due to the implicit encoding of the where information. Here we try trans-forming a retinal image of an object into its <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> via interchanging the what with the where, which means that patterns of intensity in <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> describe the spatial information rather than the object information. To be concrete, the retinal image of an object is deformed and turned over into a negative image, in which light areas appear dark and vice versa, and the object’s spatial information is quantified with levels of intensity on borders of that image. Inter-estingly, the inner part excluding the borders of the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> shows the position and scale invariance (10, 11). In order to further understand how the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> associates the what and where, we examined the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> of a face which moves or is scaled on the retina. As a result, we found that the <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> form a linear vector space under the object translation and scaling. In conclusion, these results show that the what-where interchangeability might play an important role for organizing those two into internal representation of brain. The <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> (or conjugate image, see figure 1) explicitly involves the where of an object. For instance, 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{title of}} this Bachelor’s thesis is „The <b>Internal</b> <b>Image</b> of Salva Kindlustuse AS” and its subject is the Estonian {{insurance}} company Salva Kindlustuse AS. The company is based on domestic capital and has been operating in the Estonian indemnity insurance market since 1993. The main objective {{of this study was}} to chart and analyse the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> of the company, the employees’ attitudes towards the company and find connections between the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> and other communication activities. The perception of Salva’s <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> among the personnel working at the headquarters and its various agencies was measured quantitatively. The data will be subsequently used as the source material for the creation of a comprehensive communication strategy for Salva. The broader communication strategy forms a basis for the marketing strategy, which is also being prepared and will bring the company to a whole new level of more systematic planning in this field. The empirical research is based on a theoretical framework and the utilisation of different methods that have given a fairly clear picture of the Salva Kindlustuse AS <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> as perceived by the company’s employees. The analysed sample produced a relatively coherent result. The opinions concerning both <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> as well as internal communication and external image were surprisingly similar when comparing the attitudes of people working at the headquarters and at the various agencies. The <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> of Salva Kindlustuse AS was perceived as being very positive, which was indicated by both direct answers and was confirmed in comparison of different blocks of questions. Indifference and negative attitudes regarding the company were practically non-existent. Based on the analysis of the questionnaires most surveyed workers may be categorised as a target group that is active and has a high level of awareness. The surveyed personnel consider themselves justifiably as part of Salva Kindlustuse AS. They consider their behaviour as having influence in Salva and feel a strong connection with the company. Generally people find that there are positive developments and Salva is considered an attractive employer. The author believes that this thesis has reached its objective. The basis for the <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> and <b>internal</b> communication chapters of the subsequent communication strategy has been laid both on the theoretical and empirical level. A statistical and analytical database regarding the company-wide <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> survey has also been compiled. From the perspective of Salva Kindlustuse AS the present thesis may be considered very important. Similar studies have not been conducted at the company in recent years, and therefore the results of the current <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> survey have strongly confirmed several important starting points regarding the communication strategy and also strategic activity in general. Therefore this material provides a good basis for more detailed planning of the company’s communication activities and general management...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{concentrate}} on {{the reconstruction of the}} participants' <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> during spoken discourse. Our question is: What happens if the speaker draws to illustrate something in the discourse? The focus movements should then leave traces in the drawing, that could tell us how the focus of attention moves over the undrawn <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> of speaker and listener. The first part of this paper discusses the correlation between spoken discourse and focus movements, exemplified by an analysis where a speaker uses an abstract drawing as a complement to a descriptive explanation. The second part discusses how we can construct a close representation of the <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> and the focus movements over it.
