5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered <b>her</b> <b>well.</b> When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the common room of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E
5|$|His {{most notorious}} exploit {{took place during}} the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade {{reaching}} the Russian guns before returning, personally unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command {{who took part in the}} charge (although others may have died of wounds later on). The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat <b>her</b> <b>well.</b> The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.|$|E

25|$|Brunt {{then took}} three early wickets for England as Australia faltered to six runs for three wickets, and England's hopes were increasing. No one could support Brunt with the ball, however, and Karen Rolton slashed 16 fours and one six in an unbeaten 96 to guide Australia home with {{fourteen}} deliveries remaining. Kate Blackwell supported <b>her</b> <b>well,</b> making 43, {{and no one}} except Brunt could keep the run rate below 8 an over.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} eight years, Paluma {{conducted}} survey work on the Great Barrier Reef for the Admiralty. The 1893 Brisbane flood ripped Paluma from her moorings and left <b>her</b> <b>well</b> above the high water mark in the nearby botanical gardens. As locals considered how to return her to the Brisbane River, another major flood two weeks later refloated the gunboat, and she was pulled clear without any significant damage. The depression of the 1890s saw Paluma and her sister placed in reserve, being reactivated for annual training at Easter. In 1895, she was returned to the Queensland Government.|$|E

25|$|This {{experience}} served <b>her</b> <b>well</b> {{when her}} husband died on March 28, 1925, {{in the middle of}} his seventh term in Washington, D.C. Spurred by pressure from the Republican Party and the American Legion who approved of her stance on veteran's issues and wanted the sympathy vote, she was urged to run for her late husband's seat. She ran in a special election as the Republican candidate for Representative to the 69th United States Congress from the 5th District of Massachusetts, and beat the former Governor of Massachusetts with a landslide 72 percent of the vote. Like Mae Ella Nolan and Florence Prag Kahn before her, she won her husband's seat.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July 1808 Meleager, {{under the}} command of Captain Frederick Warren, had been sailing from Port Royal, Jamaica, when in the evening the master, believing that land in sight was Portland Point, set a course that would take <b>her</b> <b>well</b> clear of land. Still, less than half an hour later lookouts spotted broken water ahead; {{although}} the helmsman attempted to turn Meleager, she struck. Efforts to get her off or to stem in the inflow of water were unsuccessful. During the night the crew took down the masts and made rafts; once daylight arrived the task became to get everyone safely on shore. A line was strung to the shore of Bare Bush Key and all but three crewmen made it safely ashore. For the next few days the crew worked to salvage a large amount of stores and the guns.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2015, Nichols' {{booking agency}} {{announced}} that she had suffered a mild stroke at her Los Angeles home and had been admitted to a Los Angeles-area hospital. This was barely {{three months after the}} death of her friend and Star Trek co-star Leonard Nimoy. Doctors were conducting tests to determine the severity of the stroke. Nichols was reportedly awake and resting comfortably. An online news article by Frazier Moore of the Associated Press, which cited news updates from the actress's Facebook page, stated that, four days afterward, the hospitalized actress was feeling much better and was improving, remaining cheerful and alert and taking the time to read the messages from fans and well-wishers on her Facebook page, of which there were many. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan did reveal a small stroke but she was able to begin inpatient therapy on June 5, 2015, for rehabilitation and recovery and to further evaluate her condition and determine the prognosis. Her fellow Star Trek actor George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, wished <b>her</b> <b>well</b> on his Twitter account page.|$|E

The next pope, Paul III, broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, [...] "The girl has come to me stark naked." ...|$|E
500|$|The two {{began to}} {{disagree}} about the magazine's direction. Betts felt Vogues fashion coverage {{was getting too}} limited.

[...] Eventually, she left, complaining to The New York Times that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift.
