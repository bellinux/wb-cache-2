40|$|Justice, {{thank you}} so much <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> It is a real {{privilege}} for us to get to talk to you this way, and we know for the entire audience. You have had-as you have now heard (LAUGHS) -an amazing and just tremendously varied career, spanning so many different roles of academic, public interest advocate, judge, now Justice. We can 2 ̆ 7 t possibly cover all of this in the time we have this morning, but what we are hoping to do is {{talk a little bit about}} each of these roles, how each step you took influenced the rest, and then we will be throwing it open after our conversation for questions from the audience...|$|E

40|$|To {{speak about}} the complex reality of China in {{meaningful}} terms {{is a very difficult}} task, and to reflect on business education and its mission in this context is an even bigger challenge. We are very fortunate to have Professor Henri-Claude de Bettignies sharing his experiences and thoughts <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> For a significant part of his life, Professor de Bettignies has been engaged in understanding business in East Asia and China and building bridges between the East and the West. He has showed a strong commitment to assist Chinese business people in raising their ethical awareness and to help steer them through a great deal of complex ethical situations. Thank you <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Before discussing several more specific points, I would like to emphasize the importance of what Henri-Claude said in his introduction. In fact, China has been facing enormous challenges in her development over the last 30 years, and it is hard to overestimate the gravity of those multiple difficulties. Unfortunately, China watchers and critics from abroad too often do not grasp the complexity of China’s process of reform and opening-up and too easily slide into China bashing that deflects the attention from the real problems that exist. The Chinese are still mindful of the invasion of Western powers in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Thus, when the West thinks i...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} to be with you this evening and share some thoughts with you. Sandy and I are delighted to see so many wonderful friends here. I hope {{we have an opportunity to}} greet each of you before the evening is over.

40|$|At {{the outset}} let me mention {{that it is}} indeed a great honour for my country, Sri Lanka and me {{personally}} to have been invited by the President and the Secretary General of IFLA to be a plenary speaker at the World Library and Information Congress in Oslo, Norway. I {{take this opportunity to}} thank the President and Executive Committee of IFLA for this rare privilege bestowed upon me. I must also thank the members of this august assembly, leaders and trail blazers in the library and information field <b>for</b> <b>being</b> here <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in this beautiful Nordic city of Oslo when we share our knowledge and experience in the belief that it would lead to greater understanding and co-operation among those engaged in the field of librarianship. First of all I must apologise to the distinguished audience for speaking about a tragedy at the first session of this mega conference, immediately following the magnificent opening ceremony, which was attended by Norway’s royalty. On a more positive note this particular tragedy is now an event of the past and I believe that many lessons can be learnt from it. It is somewhat fortunate that throughout history large-scale library tragedies have been rare and far between, even though library catastrophes have occurred from Alexandria to Iraq, for reasons ranging from earthquakes to floods and from simple arson to aerial bombing.

"One {{other thing}} surprises us in those Old Pamphlets," [...] says my Constitutional Friend: [...] "How the phrase, 'Cause of Liberty' ever and anon turns up, with great though extinct emphasis, evidently sincere.
