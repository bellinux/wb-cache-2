It is prepared by inoculating cow, goat, or sheep milk with kefir grains. Traditional kefir was made in goatskin bags that were hung near a doorway; the bag would be knocked by anyone passing through {{to help keep the}} milk and kefir grains well mixed.|$|E
5000|$|Samson's riddle is {{a riddle}} {{that appears in}} the biblical {{narrative}} about Samson. Samson wagered a riddle to thirty Philistine guests, in these words: [...] "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet" [...] (Judges 14:14). Instead of a fair riddle that could be discerned with deduction, the riddle {{was based on a}} private experience of Samson who killed a young lion (<b>kephir)</b> and after a while found bees and honey in its corpse. [...] "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" [...] (Judges 14:18) is the answer to the riddle. The Philistines, who could not solve the riddle, extorted the answer from Samson's wife, who persuaded Samson to tell it to her. The wager's prize was 30 soft under shirts (sedin) and good suits (chalipha) to the winner, for which Samson slew 30 Philistine men to pay the terms.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} {{is made of}} {{the growth}} and interaction of two alcohol producing species of yeast, Schizosaccharomyces "Kephir ” and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in both monoculture and mixture as reported by Gause (1934. The struggle for existence. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, M. D.) and modeled by de Wit and Goudriaan (1978. Simulation of ecological processes. A Halsted Press Book. John Wiley & Sons, New York, Toronto.), {{on the basis of}} Lotka-Volterra competition model. The logistic equation of growth has been integrated to represent the inhibition of growth of each species by alcohol in pure culture. This model is expanded for mixed culture, based on the relative inhibition of each species by the other. The proposed model for pure anaerobic culture produces results identical to Lotka-Volterra model for both organisms. For mixed culture, the model shows that both species reach the potential levels expected by the model. However, the relative growth rates of the two organisms are affected differently, one, (<b>Kephir),</b> behaves exactly according to the model, and theother, (S. cerevisiae), exhibits considerable reduction in relative growth rate. This interaction also confirms the general conclusion of de Wit & Goudriaan that in addition to alcohol, some other factor must be involved in mixed culture of the two species. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this diploma thesis was to study {{legislative}} requirements about marking food products with nutrition labels and summarize the activities and procedures of supervising organizations connected to problematic of goods marking. One of the goals was to briefly describe technological and producing methods of selected food - ham, cheese, <b>kephir</b> milk, baby food with fruit, wafer, bread, wholemeal puffed bread and chocolate. Next goal was to evaluate the risks of food consumption with deceptive nutrition labels. In the practical part of this thesis I have determined quantity of saccharides, lipids, proteins and salt in selected food products by standard methods. Simple saccharides were determined by Schoorl's method and starch volume by Ewers's method. Lipids were determined by Soxhlet's extraction and after put through derivatization. In gas chromatograph (GC) were detected fatty acids. Apart from the Soxhlet's extraction was made also extraction according to Hara and Radin (1987) for comparison. Proteins were determined by method using nitrogen according to Kjehdal with adjustments according to Winkler. The amount of salt was detected analytically by argetometric precipitating titration. Determination the volume of nutritive parameters was made in three ranks of selected products. From obtained results were evaluated possible risks, which might be caused by consumption of food products with deceptively stated nutritive labels...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} purposes were (1) to measures {{the competitiveness of}} Indonesian milk derivative product in international market based on its comparative advantage, (2) to analyze the dynamics of Indonesian milk and also to analyze the commodity’s competitive position in the international market through its dynamic export product performance, (3) to analyze dominant factors that influencing Indonesian dairy export growth based on constant market share analysis. The analysis methods {{used to measure the}} competitiveness of Indonesian milk in this research are based on revealed comparative advantage analysis, Export product dynamic analysis (EPD), and constant market share analysis. The result from RCA showed that the Indonesian milk derivative products which are Milk not concentrated nor sweetened 1 – 6 % fat (HS 040120), Milk and cream, concentrated or sweetened (HS 0402) and Buttermilk, curdled milk, cream, <b>kephir,</b> etc (HS 040390) do not have comparative advantage but for Milk and cream powder unsweetened > 1, 5 %  fat (HS 040221), Milk and cream nes sweetened or concentrated (HS 040299) and Cereal, flour, starch, milk preparations and products (HS 19) have comparative advantage. The EPD found that all Indonesian milk derivative products are included in the Rising Star position. The result test using CMS analysis concluded that the most significant factor which affect the export growth for Indonesian HS 040390 and HS 0402 derivative products are the import growth effect, HS 19 is mainly dominated by commodity composition effect, and the export growth for the rest derivative products are dominated with the competitiveness effect. Therefore, it needs to be implemented efforts to enhance the competitiveness of dairy derived products Indonesia Keywords: milk, competitiveness, revealed comparative advantage (RCA), export product dynamic (EPD), constant market share analysis (CMSA) ABSTRAK Penelitian ini bertujuan (1) menganalisis daya saing komoditas susu Indonesia di pasar internasional berdasarkan keunggulan komparatif yang dimiliki, (2) menganalisis dinamika dari susu Indonesia dan menganalisis posisi daya saing komoditas tersebut di pasar internasional melalui performa produk ekspor dinamisnya, (3) menganalisis faktor-faktor dominan dalam memengaruhi pertumbuhan ekspor susu Indonesia berdasarkan analisis pangsa pasar konstan. Metode analisis yang digunakan untuk mengukur daya saing Indonesia adalah revealed comparative advantage analysis, Export product dynamic analysis (EPD), dan constant market share analysis. Hasil dari RCA menunjukkan bahwa produk turunan susu Indonesia untuk Milk not concentrated nor sweetened 1 – 6 %  fat (HS 040120), Milk and cream, concentrated or sweetened (HS 0402) and Buttermilk, curdled milk, cream, <b>kephir,</b> etc (HS 040390) tidak memiliki keunggulan komparatif tetapi untuk Milk and cream powder unsweetened > 1, 5 % fat (HS 040221), Milk and cream nes sweetened or concentrated (HS 040299) dan Cereal, flour, starch, milk preparations and products (HS 19) memiliki keunggulan komparatif. Analisis EPD menemukan bahwa seluruh produk turunan susu Indonesia masuk dalam posisi rising star. Hasil analisis CMS menyimpulkan bahwa sebagain besar faktor yang signifikan memengaruhi pertumbuhan ekspor HS 040390 dan HS 0402 adalah efek pertumbuhan impor, HS 19 didominasi oleh efek komposisi komoditas dan sisanya disebabkan karena efek daya saing. Oleh karena itu, perlu dilaksanakan upaya untuk meningkatkan daya saing produk turunan susu Indonesia.
