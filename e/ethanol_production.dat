Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

5|$|Government {{officials}} and businessmen from Paraguay began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers {{in order to}} import flex cars that run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports. In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program for <b>ethanol</b> <b>production.</b> The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of <b>ethanol</b> <b>production,</b> in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation.

The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazilâ€™s cane genetic improvement programs.

50|$|One {{reason for}} the {{increase}} in food prices may be the increase in oil prices at the same time, leading to increased demand for and production of biofuels.

25|$|<b>Ethanol</b> <b>production</b> was {{expected}} {{to continue to grow}} over the next several years, since the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 required 36 billion US gallons of renewable fuel use by 2022.

Ethanol industries provided jobs in agriculture, construction, operations and maintenance, mostly in rural communities.|$|E
25|$|One {{rationale}} for <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> in the U.S. is increased energy security, from shifting supply from oil imports to domestic sources. <b>Ethanol</b> <b>production</b> requires significant energy, and current U.S. production derives {{most of that}} energy from domestic coal, natural gas and other non-oil sources. Because in 2006, 66% of U.S. oil consumption was imported, compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16% of natural gas (2006 figures), the displacement of oil-based fuels to ethanol produced a net shift from foreign to domestic U.S. energy sources.|$|E
25|$|A {{fraction}} of the maize feedstock dry matter used for <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for monogastric animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{filamentous}} fungus strain designated RB- 1 was isolated into pure culture from Japanese rice field soil through an anaerobic role tube technique. The strain is a mitosporic fungus that grows in both aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions using various mono-, di-, tri-, and polysaccharides with acetate and <b>ethanol</b> <b>productions.</b> The amount of acetate produced {{was higher than}} that of ethanol in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures. The characteristic verrucose or punctuate conidia of RB- 1 closely resembled those of some strains of the genus Thermomyces, a thermophilic or mesophilic anamorphic ascomycete. However, based on phylogenetic analysis with the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences, RB- 1 was characterized {{as a member of the}} class Lecanoromycetes of the phylum Ascomycota. Currently, RB- 1 is designated as an anamorphic ascomycete and is phylogenetically considered an incertae sedis within the class Lecanoromycetes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the {{dissolved}} oxygen on glycerol and <b>ethanol</b> <b>productions</b> by an osmotolerant yeast Hansenula anomala was examined during growth in media at low water activity resulting from the addition of 2 M NaCl in the culture medium. High stirring rate, high culture medium aeration, as well as high mass transfer surface inhibited both glycerol and ethanol biosynthesis. In absence of oxygen, yeast used acetaldehyde as a hydrogen acceptor, leading to the stimulation of ethanol biosynthesis and accounting for the low biomass and glycerol production; the experimental ratio ethanol on glycerol produced was 5. 1 when the available oxygen was lowered (low stirring rate, 500 rpm) and increased to 10. 2 in absence of aeration. Extracellular glycerol production was therefore optimal for a moderate stirring (1000 rpm) and aeration (1. 4 vvm) rates. These optimal conditions resulted in an experimental ratio ethanol on glycerol produced of 4. 1, namely close to the theoretical value of 4, illustrating the osmodependent channelling of carbon towards polyols productio...|$|R
25|$|Cellulosic <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> {{is a new}} {{approach}} that may alleviate land use and related concerns. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from any plant material, potentially doubling yields, {{in an effort to}} minimize conflict between food needs vs. fuel needs. Instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops, cellulosic <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> maximizes the use of all plant materials, including gluten. This approach would have a smaller carbon footprint because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material. The technology for producing cellulosic ethanol is currently in the commercialization stage.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{government}} subsidies for <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> have prompted many farmers {{to switch to}} production for biofuel. Maize is the primary crop used {{for the production of}} ethanol, with the United States being the biggest producer of maize ethanol. As a result, 23 percent of United States maize crops were being used for ethanol in 2006â€“2007 (up from 6 percent in 2005â€“2006), and the USDA expects the United States to use 81 million tons of maize for <b>ethanol</b> <b>production</b> in the 2007â€“2008 season, up 37 percent. This not only diverts grains from food, but it diverts agricultural land from food production.|$|E
25|$|Bioethanol {{is a form}} of {{renewable}} energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks. It can be made from very common crops such as hemp, sugarcane, potato, cassava and corn.
