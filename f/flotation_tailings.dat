40|$|Abstract—A {{major issue}} for the oil sand {{industry}} is the settling of thin fine tailings (TFT) which are a byproduct of the oil sand extraction process. These tailings are deposited in large ponds and settling takes decades. The aim {{of the present study}} was to increase understanding of the role of specific ion types (monovalent/divalent) present in the water in flocculation behavior, and hence the settling of <b>flotation</b> fine <b>tailings</b> of the Athabasca oil sands (which consist predominantly of kaolinite). In this study, two series of measurements were conducted and compared: one with TFT and with varying pH and salinity, and another with kaolinite suspensions with varying pH, salinity, and volume fraction. The volume fraction of kaolinite and TFT used was in the range 0. 011 % volume fraction for any ionic strength or ion. In this range the electrophoretic mobility was constant indicating that there were no particleparticle interactions, a required condition for electrophoretic mobility measurements. Electrokinetic measurements were made as a function of concentration of salt added and pH. The flocculation behavior of both TFT and kaolinite can be linked to the electrokinetic mobility at high ionic strength. The electrophoretic mobility values and therefore the electrokinetic charge of the particles were smaller for divalent salt than for monovalent salt. As a consequence, both kaolinite and fine tailings should and do flocculate more quickly in the presence of a divalent electrolyte during settling-column experiments. The electrophoretic mobility of kaolinite and tailings in electrolytes containing a majority of monovalent ions (NaCl) decreased in absolute values with decreasing pH while their electrophoretic mobility in electrolytes containing a majority of divalent ions (MgCl 2) did not depend on pH. The flocculation of the fine tailings in an electrolyte where divalent ions are predominant is therefore not expected to be influenced by pH...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, over 10 {{million tons}} of {{ultrafine}} coal wastes are discarded every year, typically {{in the form of}} ultrafine slurries. These fines have a high calorific value, and contain sulfur minerals, particularly pyrite. The high calorific value of these discards leads to a waste of energy that could be harnessed and used, while the high sulfur content contributes to adverse environmental effects such as acid rock drainage (ARD). The University of Cape Town (UCT) has developed a two-stage flotation process, which involves coal flotation in the first stage and pyrite <b>flotation</b> of the <b>tailings</b> in the second stage, for mitigating the ARD potential of ultrafine wastes. Research has shown that this two stage froth flotation process was sufficient to render the tailings non-acid forming. At the same time, North West University (NWU) has been carrying out research on coal fines using the recently invented reflux classifier. The reflux classifier is claimed to be capable of separating particles down to 38 ìm in size; however, no work has been done using the reflux classifier to separate pyrite from coal. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of combining flotation and reflux classification for removing sulfide minerals from two South African coal ultrafines, whilst recovering valuable coal, and compares the results to those obtained using the UCT two-stage flotation process. As no previous work has been done using reflux classification to remove sulfide minerals from coal, {{this is the first time}} that the reflux classifier will be investigated for this purpose. Two process routes were investigated: (i) froth flotation followed by reflux classification of the tailings (process route 1), and (ii) reflux classification followed by froth flotation of the overflow (process route 2). Coal flotation, sulfide flotation and reflux classification were conducted on samples of Waterberg and Witbank coals, using a 3 L Leeds-type flotation cell and a 10 L batch reflux classifier constructed at NWU.

40|$|The Baccu Locci stream {{catchment}} (Sardinia, Italy) {{is affected}} by serious As contamination {{as a consequence of}} past mining. The presence of both point and widespread sources of contamination (waste-rock dumps and <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings,</b> respectively) strongly affects surface water chemistry, and produces high As concentrations (hundreds of μg l - 1) in stream waters. Water chemistry of the Baccu Locci stream changes considerably over a distance of about 10 km as a consequence of various, locally concomitant, processes acting along the stream course: (1) mixing with metal-rich SO 4 waters; (2) dissolution/precipitation of metal-bearing phases; (3) mixing with HCO 3 -dominated lake waters; (4) gypsum dissolution coupled with calcite precipitation; (5) mixing with dilute surface and/or ground waters. In contrast to metals (e. g. Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd), whose dissolved concentrations rapidly decrease downstream of the mined area through (co-) precipitation/adsorption mechanisms, As concentrations tend to gradually increase (up to 0. 9 mg l - 1) along the stream course as far as the alluvial plain, though significant variations are locally observed. This behaviour is mainly due to the higher mobility of As than metals under the near neutral-oxidative conditions occurring in the Baccu Locci stream waters. Results of a leaching test indicate that part of the As contained in the <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> occurs as As(III), which is more mobile and less strongly sorbed than As(V). The As released to the waters by various mechanisms (i. e. release/desorption from the Fe(III) -hydroxides coatings of silicate grains, oxidation of residual arsenopyrite, decomposition of scorodite) tends to remain in solution and to be transported long distances.

In the slag inoculated flasks the redox potential was high (600 mV), thus indicating oxidative bacterial activity, however, the obtained results after 15 days showed only around 13 % Ni and 8 % Cu extractions, which were not different {{to those of the}} controls. For the <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> bioleaching extractions were approximately 45 % for Ni and 16 % for Cu while differing figures were obtained for the chemical controls. These were 30 % and 12 % respectively. Here we could observe that the presence of bacterial activity led to a higher solubility of Ni. Acid leaching of slag showed higher nickel and copper extractions: 56 % and 24 % respectively at pH 0. 5 and 21 % and 11 % at pH 1. 0. However, the acid consumption was 320 and 150 Kg/ton of slag, respectively, both much higher than in bacterial assays. These results indicated that Ni and Cu solubilization from the slag is acid dependent no matter the redox potential or ferric iron concentration of the leaching solution. For <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings,</b> acid treatment showed extractions of 23 % for Ni and 16 % for copper at pH 0. 5 and 22 % and 28 %, respectively at pH 1. 0. The acid consumption was also higher: 220 and 120 Kg/ton, at pH 0. 5 and 1. 0, respectively. Based on own findings we could observe that acid leaching is found to be more effective for slag, though the acid consumption is much higher, while for the <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings,</b> bacterial leaching seems to be the best alternative...|$|E

40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines to develop flowsheets for the recovery of tungsten and gold from four Alaskan scheelite-bearing ores. Basic gravity concentration and cyanide leach tests were performed on all samples. About 46 pct of the tungsten and 30 pct of the gold from one sample were recovered in a gravity concentrate containing 24 pet W 03 (tungstic oxide) and 119 troy ounces per short ton (tr oz/st) Au. Froth flotation of the gravity concentrate resulted in separate tungsten and gold products with grades of 38 pct W 03 and 2, 720 tr oz/st Au and recoveries of 60 and 97 pet, respectively. Additional gold was recovered from the gravity and <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> by cyanidation. Overall recoveries of tungsten and gold from this sample were 28 and 94 pet, respeetively. A flowsheet with mill design parameters was developed that consisted of (1) free gold and scheelite recovery by gravity methods and froth flotation and (2) fme-grained gold recovery by cyanide leaching of reground gravity and <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings,</b> followed by a carbon-in-pulp (CIP) circuit. Data were developed from the Bond mill work index, gold and tungsten flotation, conventional and high-rate thickening, cyanide leaching, and CIP adsorption tests...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{differential}} and bulk flotation processes {{have difficulties}} in achieving high recoveries with acceptable grades far zinc, lead and copper from the complex sulfide ores found at Tok, Alaska. Furthermore, gold and silver, {{which account for}} a significant fraction of total value of the ores, are distributed evenly in the <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> and concentrate. Therefore, processing both <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> and concentrate {{would be necessary to}} obtain high recoveries of gold and silver. [...] A mineralogical study revealed that the economic sulfide minerals are interstitially associated with a large preponderance of pyrite. The economic sulfide minerals are 10 to 40 microns in size. These mineralogical facts explain the difficulties encountered in the flotation process. A hydrometallurgical method involving ferric chloride leaching and subsequent steps to recover lead, zinc, silver and copper from the leach liquor has been studied at the Mineral Industry Research Laboratory, University of Alaska Fairbanks for the treatment of Delta ores. This alternative is attractive for processing complex sulfide ores which conventional flotation and smelting cannot handle. In addition, the liberation of sulfur in the environmentally acceptable elemental form, rather than as sulfur dioxide, may prove a major advantage of this hydrometallurgical method because of stringent environmental regulations...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{column flotation}} for recovery of a high-grade fluorite (CaF 2) concentrate and byproduct concentrates from the Fish Creek fluorite deposit in Eureka County, NY. The recovery scheme consisted of (1) grinding the ore to minus 48 mesh, (2) fluorite rougher and cleaner flotation, (3) desliming the rougher fluorite <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> at 20 Jjm, (4) mica flotation, and (5) silicate rougher flotation. Acid-grade fluorspar, mica, free silica (Si 02) sand, and low-grade beryl (Be 3 Al 2 S~ 018) concentrate were produced in a 100 lb/h continuous column flotation unit (CCFU). The highest results achieved were %. 6 -pct CaF 2 recovery in a fIrst cleaner concentrate containing 99. 7 pct CaF 2. Beryl recovery was {{as high as}} 92 pct at a grade of 5. 3 pct BeO. The silica sand, which assayed 98 pct Si 02, was recovered as the rougher beryl <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings.</b> Collector reagent consumption was reduced 45 pct for fluorite and 58 pet for silicate flotation in comparison with bench-scale conventional flotation. All products were signillcantly improved in both grade and recovery over conventional flotation results, and the recovery scheme was simplifIed by removal of several stages of flotation in the fluorite and silicate flotation steps...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} was to assess the {{atmospheric}} pollution with heavy metals due to copper mining Bucim near Radovis, the Republic of Macedonia. The open pit and mine waste and <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> are continually exposed to open air, which leads to winds carrying the fine particles into the atmosphere. Samples of attic dust were examined as historical archives of mine emissions, with the aim of elucidating the pathways of pollution. Dust was collected from the attics of 29 houses, built between 1920 and 1970. Nineteen elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Fe, K, Mg, Mn,Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) were analyzed by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. The obtained values of the investigated elements in attic dust samples were statistically processed using nonparametric and parametric analysis. Factor analysis revealed three factors governing the source of individual chemical elements. Two of them grouping Ca, Li, Mg, Mn, and Sr (Factor 1) and Co, Cr, and Ni (Factor 2) can be characterized as geogenic. The third factor grouping As, Cu, and Pb is anthropogenic and mirrors dust fallout from mining operation and from <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings.</b> Maps of areal deposition were prepared for this group of elements, from which correlation of these anthropogenic born elements was confirmed...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{mining and}} {{metallurgical}} activities in Lavrion over a time span of over 2700 years {{resulted in the}} formation of huge spoils of mining, milling and metallurgical wastes and tailings, most of them characterised as toxic and hazardous. Toxic elements are released by a number of mechanisms and migrate to the surrounding area, contributing to the widespread soil contamination. Three main types of spoils exist: sulphidic <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings,</b> oxidic-carbonaceous-silicate beneficiation tailings and metallurgical slags. This paper deals with the sulphidic <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings.</b> For the estimation of the risk that these tailings pose to the environment and for the conceptual development of a remediation strategy, complete characterisation was done according to the following methodology: Drillholes were placed within the spoils and undisturbed core samples were taken and characterised chemically and mineralogically, their net neutralisation potential (NNP) was determined using static tests and their toxicity using the EPA TCLP test, speciation of the toxic metals was determined in some cases using the sequential extraction technique and the bioavailable fraction determined by EDTA extraction. Some geotechnical characteristics of the spoils, as density and permeability were determined in-situ. Piezometers were installed within the boreholes and the pore water quality and level was monitored. The above information is being critically assessed and employed for the selection and design of the optimum rehabilitation scheme. © 1995...|$|E
30|$|Coal {{tailings}} {{samples were}} collected from the coal preparation plant of Anjir Tange which actively produces washed coke in central Alborz—Iran. Three methods of hand sorting, gravity, and flotation are applied in thia plant to supply coke. The tailings aforementioned processes are accumulated in two depots of <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> and the other processing methods. The mass of the piled tailings is 2 million tons with the average ashes between 40 % and 45 %.
