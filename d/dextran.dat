25|$|<b>Dextran</b> is a {{polysaccharide}} {{derived from}} bacteria; {{it is usually}} produced by enzymes from certain strains of leuconostoc or Streptococcus. It consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose residues. Cross-linked <b>dextran</b> hydrogel beads {{have been widely used}} as low protein-binding matrices for column chromatography applications and for microcarrier cell culture technology. However, it has not been until recently that <b>dextran</b> hydrogels have been investigated in biomaterials applications and specifically as drug delivery vehicles. An advantage of using <b>dextran</b> in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components. AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion. The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides. Copolymerization of Dex-MA with AEMA allowed the macroporous geometry of the scaffolds to be preserved in addition to promoting cellular interactions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dextrans</b> are a {{class of}} {{carbohydrate}} polymers extensively applied in pharmaceutical applications, particularly as drug conjugate macromolecular carriers or drug delivery systems. These polysaccharides improve {{the stability of the}} therapeutics enabling also the control of their release, via either the parenteral and or oral routes. In the latter case, due to their gel forming ability they may have potential as hydrophilic matrix tablets for sustained drug release. In this paper, we investigated the behaviour of different molecular weight (1, 40, 500 and 2300 kDa) <b>dextrans</b> as tabletting excipients. Powder particle size and hygroscopic studies have been reported, together with tabletability, tablet stability and tablet swelling. Moreover we use tramadol as model compound to evaluate the ability of <b>dextrans</b> to control drug dissolution. The results suggest that <b>dextrans</b> with lower molecular weights may be a promising excipient to be used as filler for immediate release tablets, due to their good tabletability and fast dissolution rate, while <b>dextrans</b> with higher molecular weights could be an efficient disintegrant due to their swelling ability...|$|R

500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into <b>dextran</b> (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied, {{mainly in the}} entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified [...] according their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, , chondroitin sulfate, <b>dextran</b> and <b>dextran</b> [...] sulphate, chitosan, polylysine, [...] collagen, carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, agarose, pullulan), or synthetic (PEG, PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, PVA, PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water. An additional classification can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced radical polymerization {{in the case of}} acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides).|$|E
2500|$|Cell {{labeling}} techniques {{advanced the}} field of neural crest because they allowed researchers to visualize the migration of the tissue throughout the developing embryos.

[...] However, this method suffers from drawbacks of stability, since every time the labeled cell divides the signal is diluted. [...] Modern cell labeling techniques such as rhodamine-lysinated <b>dextran</b> and the vital dye diI have also been developed to transiently mark neural crest lineages.|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium {{moisture}} sorptions of two dried aqueous herbal extracts {{and their}} mixtures with <b>dextrans</b> of various molecular weights were investigated {{as a function}} of relative humidity at ambient temperature, and the data were analyzed by both the Guggenheim-Anderson-deBoer (GAB) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equations. Glass transition temperatures (T(g)) of the samples were measured by differential scanning calorimetry, and their dependence on the moisture contents of the extracts was analyzed by the linear, Fox and expanded Gordon-Taylor mathematical models. All dextran-extract mixtures exhibited single T(g) values, indicating that they existed as single homogeneous phases. The BET equation was found adequate for description of the moisture sorption isotherms for all samples. The <b>dextrans</b> appeared to reduce the hygroscopicity of the herbal extracts solely by a dilution effect. The observed increase in T(g) and accompanying decrease in tackiness of the herbal extracts in the presence of <b>dextrans</b> may be explained by the ability of <b>dextrans</b> to restrict the molecular mobility of simple sugars and to counteract the plasticizing effect of water in the extracts. The expanded Gordon-Taylor equation has proved useful in predicting the T(g) of hygroscopic amorphous herbal mixtures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The role of {{the surface}} charge of human red blood cells (RBC's) in {{affecting}} RBC aggregation by macromolecules was studied by comparing the behavior of normal RBC's with that of RBC's treated with neuraminidase, which removes the sialic acids from the cell membrane and reduces the zeta potential. RBC aggregation in <b>dextrans</b> with different molecular weights (Dx 20, Dx 40, and Dx 80) was quantified by microscopic observation, measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and determination of low-shear viscosity. Dx 20 did not cause aggregation of normal RBC's, but caused considerable aggregation of neuraminidase-treated RBC's. Neuraminidase-treated RBC's also showed stronger aggregation than normal RBC's in Dx 40 and 80. Together with the electron microscopic findings that the intercellular distance in the RBC rouleaux varies with the molecular size of <b>dextrans</b> used, the present study indicates that the surface charge of RBC's inhibits their aggregation by <b>dextrans</b> and that the electrostatic repulsive force between cell surfaces may operate over a distance of 20 nm...|$|R

For the <b>dextrans,</b> the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic translational diffusion coefficients amounted to approximately 9 and approximately 15 %, respectively, of the value in dilute buffer. The diffusion coefficients depended inversely on molecular radius, suggesting that diffusion was dominated by viscosity effects. By application of the Stokes-Einstein equation, cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic viscosities were derived to be 6. 6 and 8. 1 cP, respectively, at 23 degrees C. Between 10 and 37 degrees C nucleoplasmic diffusion coefficients increased by approximately 45 - 85 %, whereas cytoplasmic diffusion coefficients were virtually independent of temperature. In contrast to that of the <b>dextrans,</b> diffusion of bovine serum albumin was more restricted. In the cytoplasm the diffusion coefficient was approximately 1. 5 % of the value in dilute buffer; in the nucleus albumin was largely immobile.

2500|$|Early colonizers of {{the tooth}} surface are mainly Neisseria spp. and streptococci, {{including}} S. mutans.

2500|$|Bacteria in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, {{and most}} {{commonly}} sucrose (table sugar) into acids such as lactic acid through a glycolytic process called fermentation. If left {{in contact with}} the tooth, these acids may cause demineralization, which is the dissolution of its mineral content. [...] The process is dynamic, however, as remineralization can also occur if the acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash. [...] Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish may aid remineralization. [...] If demineralization continues over time, enough mineral content may be lost so that the soft organic material left behind disintegrates, forming a cavity or hole. The impact such sugars have on the progress of dental caries is called cariogenicity. Sucrose, although a bound glucose and fructose unit, is in fact more cariogenic than a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. This is due to the bacteria utilising the energy in the saccharide bond between the glucose and fructose subunits. S.mutans adheres to the biofilm on the tooth by converting sucrose into an extremely adhesive substance called <b>dextran</b> polysaccharide by the enzyme dextransucranase.|$|E
