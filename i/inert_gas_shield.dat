This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas.

The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are known}} to exhibit unique {{weldability}} issues, particularly atmospheric contamination from interstitial species such as oxygen. The prevention of such impurities from entering the weld region and surrounding heat affected zones is critical for engineering applications as these species are seen to dramatically alter the microstructure and so mechanical properties of the material. Of greatest concern is embrittlement of the weld region. During this study, the influence of <b>inert</b> <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> on atmospheric contamination by interstitial species, namely hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, was investigated {{as a function of}} post-weld <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> temperature. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) was used to compare samples of commercially pure (CP) titanium and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy formed by conventional manufacturing methods. The influence of post-weld <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> on mechanical properties was quantified ex-situ through microhardness testing with observations of microstructure also made. It is shown that mechanical hardness levels are inversely proportional to the temperature to which continuous post-weld <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> is maintained. Hence interstitial impurity levels within the weld and heat affected zones are seen to increase with increasing post-weld shielding temperature. This effect was more pronounced in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material, and may be attributed to the comparatively low thermal conductivity...|$|R

50|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} manifests as {{a reduction}} in ductility and eventually spalling of titanium surfaces. The effect of hydrogen is {{to a large extent}} determined by the composition, metallurgical history and handling of the Ti /Ti alloy. CP-titanium (commercially pure: ≤99.55% Ti content) is more susceptible to hydrogen attack than pure α-titanium. Embrittlement, observed as {{a reduction in}} ductility and caused by the formation of a solid solution of hydrogen, can occur in CP-titanium at concentrations as low as 30-40 ppm. Hydride formation has been linked to the presence of iron in the surface of a Ti alloy. Hydride particles are observed in specimens of Ti /Ti alloys that have been welded, and because of this welding is often carried out under an <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>shield</b> to reduce the possibility of hydride formation.|$|E
40|$|Fusion™ casting is {{a unique}} Direct Chill (DC) {{continuous}} casting process whereby two different alloys can be cast simultaneously, producing a laminated aluminum ingot. Empirically derived operating ranges exist for Fusion™ casting of specific alloy combinations. When followed, the resulting ingots are of high quality. Despite this, oxide entrainment at the core-clad interface as well as inconsistent clad alloy thickness have reduced product yields. The objective of this thesis was to study the interface formation process in Fusion™ casting, with special emphasis on determining the mechanisms at play. A more fundamental understanding of the process can potentially lead to improvements in Fusion™ ingot yields {{and the ability to}} cast other alloy combinations which are currently not used to make Fusion™ ingots. Both experimental and mathematical modelling methodologies were employed to examine the Fusion™ casting of AA 3003 -core/AA 4045 -clad ingots. Tests were conducted using an analog/immersion test system designed and built at the University of Waterloo. The immersion tests provided a means to examine wetting and bonding between dissimilar aluminum alloys under closely controlled conditions. Results from these analog/immersion tests showed that the AA 3003 sample oxide was permeable and good wetting occurred with the AA 4045 melt provided an adequately inert atmosphere is maintained in the furnace during sample immersion into the melt. Also, the addition of small amounts of Mg to the AA 4045 melt was shown to further facilitate the wetting and interface formation process. In parallel, lab-scale Fusion™ casting plant trials were conducted at the Novelis Global Research and Technology Centre in Kingston, Ontario. Simulations of these experiments were performed to determine the steady-state conditions during Fusion™ casting. Other observations and measurements made during the Fusion™ casting experiments included: oxide motion measurements, AA 3003 surface characterization, metallography of as-cast interfaces, and mechanical testing of as-cast interfaces. It was found that during the lab-scale Fusion™ casting trials, AA 4045 -clad successfully wets and creates a metallurgical and mechanically sound interface with the AA 3003 -core shell. Wetting of the interface is facilitated by the oxide motion on the AA 4045 sump and the AA 3003 sump, providing clean contact between the AA 4045 liquid sump and the AA 3003 solid shell. Although oxides are present on the AA 3003 shell surface, they {{do not appear to be}} an intrinsic barrier to wetting and bond formation. It is postulated that wetting and bond formation is a result of discrete penetration of AA 4045 liquid at AA 3003 oxide defect sites followed by dissolution of the underlying solid AA 3003 by liquid AA 4045 and subsequent bridging between discrete penetration sites. While remelting of the AA 3003 surface was not necessary to obtain a sound Fusion™ cast interface spot exudation on the AA 3003 chill cast surface during reheating and partial remelting of the shell did improve the wetting and bonding process as it provided macroscopic oxide defects along the chill cast surface due to local deformation and fracture of the oxide that facilitated penetration of the AA 4045 liquid through the oxide and into the underlying AA 3003 solid shell. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that further improvements in FusionTM casting yield and interface quality can be made by 1) reducing mold heat extraction and cooling at the sides of the ingot, 2) using a wiper blade in the AA 4045 melt close to the AA 3003 interface to reduce AA 4045 oxide incursion into the interface, 3) providing an <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>shield</b> at the AA 3003 /AA 4045 melt interface and 4) adding small amounts of Mg to the AA 4045 melt...|$|E

40|$|Titanium {{materials}} {{exhibit a}} property profile {{that is just}} as versatile as that of steel materials. Titanium materials therefore have outstanding properties, such as excellent resistance to corrosion and high strength values at low densities, which makes them ideal {{for use in the}} chemical industry and as structural materials in lightweight construction. Due to the high affinity of titanium to atmospheric gases at increased temperatures above 500 degrees C, titanium components have to be welded in a sophisticated process under <b>inert</b> <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> by TIG welding or by an electron beam in a vacuum.

40|$|Laser Bending {{is a new}} {{non-contact}} {{method of}} forming sheet-metal components which does not require any special tools. This process is highly accurate and can be easily automated. This would save {{a great deal of}} time and cost which is essential for tooling design and fabrication in conventional processes. Laser bending also provides flexibility in process planning with various processes such as welding, cutting, cladding and surface treatment that can be carried out at a single Laser workstation. In Laser Bending, the metal sheet is locally heated along a path by a laser beam. This forms a steep temperature gradient across the thickness i. e. between top and bottom surfaces. The top surface expands because of higher temperature, forcing bottom surface to contract. This bends the sheet away from the laser. As soon as the laser source is switched off, the surface starts to cool rapidly and the temperature gradient is reversed due to heat conduction. This results in bending the sheet towards the laser beam and thus giving it the final shape. Bending angle can be controlled by varying a) Laser Power, b) Scan Velocity, c) Beam Diameter, d) Sheet Thickness and e) Number of scans repetitions. Laser bending has already been applied for micro-bending and adjusting curvatures of bent parts used in Computer hard disk drives. Other applications include bending thick plates for Ship-building, repairing welding distortions, straightening sheet-metal parts and sculpture making. Also Laser Bending can be a suitable process for bending high strength materials such as Titanium and its alloys, commonly used in Aerospace Industry and Medical Implants Fabrication. Titanium is usually formed by special hot forming processes such as Hot Brake Forming and Superplastic Forming, which require special die designing and are only suitable for larger components. Laser Bending can be a better alternative to these processes because of its good controllability, less set-up time, ability to form complex shapes and repeatability. In this thesis, the feasibility of a 500 W Nd:YAG Laser to bend Commercially Pure Grade- 2 Titanium is examined. A theoretical model has been developed to predict the bending angle as a function of process parameters. The model is then verified with experiments on the Nd:YAG laser. Due to high temperatures involved in Laser bending and oxide film (α-case) formation, material properties change drastically and that reflects on reducing the bending angle per scan in multi-scan system. To reduce oxidation <b>Inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>shielding</b> has been used. Different nozzle positions and <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> combinations (Argon and Helium) have been used to enhance the bend quality and bend angle.

The effects of these coatings on bending angle and bend quality are covered...|$|R
30|$|In this study, a novel {{variation}} of activated TIG welding method called Gas Pool Coupled Activating TIG (GPCA-TIG) welding with coupling arc electrode is put forward to actualize a TIG welding process simultaneously with deep penetration and high welding speed. This process {{is based on}} a specialized double layers <b>gas</b> <b>shielded</b> TIG welding method named GPCA-TIG welding [32] developed in-house. The inner <b>inert</b> <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> is to prevent tungsten electrode from oxidation. The outer pure/mixing gas contains oxygen and/or nitrogen elements. Oxygen is introduced to dramatically increase weld depth, while nitrogen to improve weld quality. The relative position between the outer and inner convergent nozzles, simplified as a variable h named coupling degree, can be changed to adjust the coupled area and position between the outer activating gas and molten pool surface and control the weld shape and properties. The kind of coupling arc electrode was developed in-house to decrease arc pressure by cutting the tip of normal solid clubbed tungsten into four identical parts. Through analyzing the arc pressure and the influences of welding parameter on weld appearance, the feasibility of this process is discussed in this paper.|$|R

Autogenous arc welding of this steel in <b>inert</b> <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> results in considerable nitrogen losses from the weld pool, characterised by an unstable arc, spattering and violent metal expulsion from the weld pool. Oxygen additions to the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> stabilise the arc and curb nitrogen-induced porosity, but at least 2. 0 % oxygen (by volume) is required to maintain the weld metal nitrogen content {{at the level of}} the parent material prior to welding. The benefi cial effect of oxygen additions to the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> is attributed to the formation of a solid MnCr 2 O 4 spinel phase on the weld pool surface during welding, which retards nitrogen degassing by reducing the area available for the adsorption of nitrogen atoms prior to their recombination to form N 2.

Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|R
