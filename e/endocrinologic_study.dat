40|$|We {{report a}} 45 -year-old female with left adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} resulting in Cushing syndrome. She visited the 3 rd Department of Internal Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital with complaints of moon face, amenorrhea and hypertension. A diagnosis of left adrenal tumor with Cushing syndrome {{was made and}} she was transferred to our clinic. Left thoracoabdominal adrenalectomy was performed. The histologic report was compatible with adrenocortical carcinoma with no invasion into adjunctive tissues. She is now on <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>study</b> and is being administered 1, 1 -dichloro- 2 -[o-chlorophenyl]- 2 [p-chlorophenyl] ethane. There {{is no evidence of}} local recurrence or remote metastasis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging {{findings}} of LYH and pituitary adenomas are similar, but the therapeutic strategies are completely different. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate sellar and parasellar MR imaging findings in patients with both diseases, as well as characteristic clinical findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical findings, including <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>study</b> and MR images of 20 patients with LYH and 22 patients with pituitary adenoma, were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the MR images in relation to the following: 1) the PPHI on T 1 -weighted images, 2) thickened stalk (3. 5 mm), 3) pituitary symmetry, 4) pituitary enhancement pattern, 5) a dural tail, and 6) parasellar signal intensity on T 2 - and T 1 -weighted images. RESULTS: Between patients with LYH and those with pituitary adenoma, a significant difference was identified for the number of patients with loss of PPHI, thickened stalk, pituitary symmetry, homoge-neous enhancement, and parasellar dark signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images by statistical analysis (Fisher exact probability test, P. 05). Among them, only parasellar dark signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images had no false-positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: The parasellar T 2 dark sign can be a specific finding used to distinguish pituitary adenoma from LYH...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic and <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> {{of breast}} cancer {{etiology}} are reviewed {{in the context of}} the Moolgavkar two-stage model for mammary carcinogenesis. Promoters are hypothesized to enhance the growth of stem and intermediate cells, and initiators are assumed to cause stem and intermediate cells to give rise to intermediate and tumor cells, respectively. Although all epidemiologic features {{of breast cancer}} can be explained in terms of the cellular events supposed by the model, the specific causes of breast cancer are largely unknown. Aberrations in endogenous steroid sex hormones most probably act as promoters, although their exact nature and etiology are unclear. Ionizing radiation is the only known initiator. The two-stage model implies that others exist and that they are responsible for both the international variation in risk of breast cancer, and its familial aggregation. Results of <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> suggest either that aberrations in endogenous sex hormones serve as such initiators or are correlated with them, or that familial and international variations in risk are mediated by promoters...|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} insufficiency {{developed over}} 15 {{years in a}} man who had had a sudden episode of left hemiparesis and slurred speech at the age of 45 years. At age 60 radiographic studies revealed no evidence of a sellar or suprasellar neoplasm, and <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies,</b> including stimulation with thyrotropin releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, yielded results consistent with hypopituitarism of hypothalamic origin. Response to thyroid, adrenocortical and testosterone therapy was good...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytic {{hypophysitis}} {{is a rare}} inflammatory disorder {{which is}} caused by autoimmune destruction of the pituitary gland. Almost all reported cases have been in women and the disease {{is often associated with}} pregnancy. We describe here the first male case of lymphocytic hypophysitis in Korea. The patient presented with headache, impotence, decreased libido, and deteriorated vision. <b>Endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> showed panhypopituitarism, and pituitary MRI imaging revealed a homogeneously enhanced pituitary mass with a thickened stalk. Treatment with prednisolone and thyroid hormone for five months was ineffective. Transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary mass was performed successfully with normalization of the visual field defect. Histologic examination revealed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with dense collagenous fibrosis, consistent with lymphocytic hypophysitis. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in differential diagnosis even in men with hypopituitarism and an enlarged pituitary gland...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-nine {{patients}} with Cushing's syndrome, due to adrenocortical tumor, were studied and treated {{during the period}} 1953 through 1983 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Cushing's syndrome is caused by hypercortisolism that can be due to (1) medicinal use of steroids, (2) excess pituitary secretion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (Cushing's disease), (3) adrenocortical tumor, benign or malignant, and (4) the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Clinical and endocrinologic features of Cushing's syndrome are described, and differential diagnosis of adrenocortical tumor by precise <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> is detailed. Computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scan is currently the most accurate imaging modality for preoperative localization of tumors. Preoperative differential diagnosis between adrenocortical adenoma and carcinoma has become fairly accurate. Operative approaches in each category are described. Follow-up from 1 to 30 years has been completed for all patients, except for one who was lost after 7 years. Results of surgical treatment of adrenocortical adenomas are excellent, but the salvage from adrenocortical carcinomas is poor...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed at the}} phenomenologic {{comparison}} of depressive symptoms in elderly patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) or primary depression (depression without a known neuropathology). We investigated 20 patients with PSD and 41 patients with primary depression. A structured clinical interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, self- and observer-based depression rating scales, a clinical neurologic examination, and neuroradiologic analysis based on standardized computed tomographic scan analysis were applied. The Cornell Depression Scale {{was used to compare}} mood-related signs, behavioral distur-bances, physical signs, disturbances of cyclic signs, and ideational disturbances in both groups of patients. Those with PSD exhibited no melancholia and fewer cyclic and ideational disturbances but more physical signs of depres-sion. These findings are in line with those of <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies.</b> Differences between both groups of patients indicate that careful considerations and further research are needed before treatment strategies developed for and evaluated in patients with primary depression are applied to patients with PSD.

40|$|We {{report the}} first case of adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} secreting cortisol (Cushing’s syndrome) and aldosterone (Conn’s syndrome) with extensive distant metastasis {{at the time of}} diagno-sis. A 72 -year-old male with exertional dyspnea sought evaluation at our institution. The pattern of tumor spread (lung, pleura, bone and adrenal gland) and respiratory symptoms secondary to the tumor led clinicians to diagnose the primary tumor site as lung cancer and the adrenal mass as a metastatic site. However, <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> and a biopsy revealed the primary site to be adrenocortical carcinoma. After histopathologic confirmation, the patient was treated with palliative chemotherapy, including mitotane, cisplatin, etoposide and doxoru-bicin. The patient died on the 14 th day after chemotherapy of rapidly progressive and unex-pected pneumonia, which was thought to be an opportunistic infection secondary to Cushing’s syndrome. Our case suggests that a thorough endocrinologic investigation is important in patients with an adrenal mass and clinicians should be aware that patients with adrenocortical carcinoma and Cushing’s syndrome are susceptible to infections and need to be observed carefully for the possible development of unrecognized opportunistic infections. Key words: adrenocortical carcinoma – cortisol – aldosterone – Cushing’s syndrome – Conn’s syndrom...|$|R
40|$|Medullary thyroid {{carcinoma}} (MTC) is a neoplasm {{derived from}} thyroidal C cells. This tumor occurs spontaneously in several animal species and is relatively common in certain strains of rats. Descriptive reports of such neoplasms in mice, however, {{have not been}} published. From several studies using female BALB/c mice, 3 animals were identified that had thyroid neoplasms histologically compatible with MTC. All three primary neoplasms and a first generation transplant from one of them contained calcitonin. Somatostatin was identified in two of three primary thyroidal neoplasms and in the first-generation transplant. Ultrastructurally, the neoplastic cells of the first-generation transplant contained membrane-bound dense-core granules that resembled those seen in normal mouse C cells. Intracisternal Type A retrovirus particles were also identified in neoplastic cells in this case. Transplantation {{of one of the}} neoplasms yielded subcutaneous masses averaging 2 cm in diameter by 3 months following transplantation in the second-generation recipients. These neoplasms resemble MTCs of man, rat, and other species and may prove of value for comparative morphologic and <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> of C cell neoplasms and for studies of factors that regulate the synthesis and secretion not only of calcitonin but also of a variety of regulatory peptides, including somatostatin...|$|R
40|$|A {{multicentre}} maintenance {{trial was}} conducted in 63 peptic ulcer patients to investigate the efficacy and safety of continuous cimetidine maintenance therapy for up to 5 years. In Amsterdam the male patients were investigated yearly for possible endocrinologic changes and to monitor gastric acid secretory capacity. Patients with healed ulcers entered maintenance treatment with a 400 -mg bedtime dose of cimetidine. The yearly relapse rates decreased from 20 % to 6 % from year 1 to year 4. Adverse reactions observed {{in this study were}} not different from those previously reported with cimetidine. <b>Endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> in 10 male patients showed a small but consistent increase in basal gastrin in the 3 rd and 4 th year, stabilizing in the 5 th year. Prolactin levels showed a gradual increase during the first 3 years but remained well within the normal range. In the 4 th and 5 th year they decreased again; however, the changes noted were rather modest. It is concluded from this study that weak nocturnal acid inhibition with cimetidine maintenance treatment not only continues to be effective and safe beyond 1 year but also reduces the risk of relapse over time. No relevant endocrinologic abnormalities are to be expected with this regimen of modest nocturnal acid suppressio...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of DMBA-induced mammary carcinomas in Sprague-Dawley rats depends upon their previous reproductive histories. Young virgin rats (YV) are highly {{susceptible to the}} carcinogen, while old virgin rats (OV) are less susceptible, and parous rats (P) are resistant. The authors performed <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> in these three groups of rats {{in order to determine}} whether the different susceptibility to carcinogenesis, according to the reproductive history, is or is not related to the hormonal milieu. The pituitary, the ovaries, the adrenals, and the mammary glands were processed for light microscopy. Pituitary prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone cells were immunostained by peroxidase-antiperoxidase and quantitated with an image analyzer. Radioimmunoassays of serum and pituitary PRL and serum estradiol were also done. The results showed no differences in the hormonal milieu of YV, OV, and P rats at the time of carcinogen treatment. Several changes were observed after DMBA administration, the most conspicuous being 1) hyperplasia of pituitary PRL cells, 2) high serum PRL levels, 3) nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex, 4) high serum estradiol levels, and 5) lack of adrenal necrosis in P rats and some OV rats. These modifications did not correlate with the degree of susceptibility of YV, OV, and P rats to carcinogenesis, supporting the concept {{of the importance of the}} mammary gland differentiation at the moment of carcinogen administration.

40|$|Alternative {{methods to}} the {{utilization}} of laboratory animal blood and its by-products are particularly attractive, especially regarding hamsters due to their small size and difficulties in obtaining serial blood samples. Steroid hormone metabolite quantification in feces, widely used in studies of free-ranging or intractable animals, is a non-invasive, non-stressor, economical, and animal saving technique which allows longitudinal studies by permitting frequent sampling of the same individual. The present study was undertaken to determine the suitability of this method for laboratory animals. Estradiol and progesterone metabolites were quantified by radioimmunoassay in feces of intact, sexually mature female Syrian hamsters during the estrous cycle (control) and in feces of superovulated females. Metabolites were extracted by fecal dilution in ethanol and quantified by solid phase radioimmunoassay. Median estrogen and progesterone concentrations were 9. 703 and 180. 74 ng/g feces in the control group, respectively. Peaks of estrogen (22. 44 ± 4. 54 ng/g feces) and progesterone (655. 95 ± 129. 93 ng/g feces) mean fecal concentrations respectively occurred 12 h before and immediately after ovulation, which is easily detected in this species by observation of a characteristic vaginal postovulatory discharge. Median estrogen and progesterone concentrations (28. 159 and 586. 57 ng/g feces, respectively) were significantly higher in superovulated animal feces (P < 0. 0001). The present study demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to monitor ovarian activity in Syrian hamsters non-invasively by measuring fecal estradiol and progesterone metabolites. This technique appears to be a quite encouraging method for the development of new <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> on laboratory animals...|$|R
40|$|Nipple {{discharge}} is {{a common}} complaint in women of reproductive age but seldom is caused by serious pathology. Nipple discharge often raises concern {{for the possibility of}} two uncommon but serious conditions—breast cancer and a pituitary tumor. This concern may result in a battery of diagnostic tests, including <b>endocrinologic</b> <b>studies,</b> such as serum prolactin and thyroid function tests, and radiographic imaging, such as mammography, breast ultrasonography, and head CT or MRI imaging. When used indiscriminately, these tests not only have an extremely low yield but often result in false-positive findings, which lead to anxiety and further evaluation or intervention. The goal in evaluating nipple discharge should be to make an accurate diagnosis that results in appro-priate treatment and reassurance. Clinical judgment should prevail rather than reflex diagnostic panels. In most cases, either the correct diagnosis can be made, or appropriate diagnostic studies can be selected based on the history and physical examination. Numerous confusing and complicated classification sys-tems have been used to categorize nipple discharge based on color, consistency, and whether the discharge is spontaneous or provoked, unilateral or bilateral, and uniductal or multiductal. Although there are merits to all of these systems, none reliably differentiates among the various causes of nipple discharge. This article presents an overview of the etiologies and an algorithm for determining a specific diagnosis. A detailed history is the most important element in the evaluation of nipple discharge and, when combined with a careful physical examination, usually results in an accurate differential diagnosis including endocrinologic or local pathology. ENDOCRINOLOGIC CAUSES Endocrinologic causes of nipple discharge result in an appropriate end-organ (breast) response to an inappropriate endocrine signal. All endocrinologi...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recurrent {{pituitary}} adenomas and localisation of microadenomas potentially cause difficulties during transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. Neuronavigation {{might improve}} tumour removal in such cases. METHODS: Between 12 / 98 and 04 / 01 transnasal transsphenoidal adenomectomies were performed in 152 patients at our department. In 16 {{of these patients}} neuronavigation was chosen {{as a means of}} safely approaching the tumour and improving the efficacy of tumour localisation and removal. Mean age of the 7 female and 9 male patients was 51. 8 +/- 13. 7 years. Patients were subdivided according to the underlying pathology, i. e. microadenomas (n = 8, mean diameter: 5. 75 +/- 2. 1 mm), and recurrent adenomas (n = 8). The imaging of adenomas was achieved in preoperatively obtained 1 mm transversely reconstructed magnetic resonance sections from a dynamic enhanced 3 D-FFE sequence (Gyroscan 1. 5 Tesla, Philips). Contour-guided surgery via a transnasal transsphenoidal approach to the sella region was performed using the MKM navigation microscope (Zeiss). RESULTS: <b>Endocrinologic</b> <b>studies</b> revealed secretion of growth hormone (GH), ACTH, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in 5, 4, and 1 patient, respectively. The remaining 7 adenomas did not secrete any hormones. All pituitary tumours were accurately localised by neuronavigation. In all recurrent macroadenomas, the tumours were rapidly and safely approached through the scarred tissue and the tumour volume was significantly reduced. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications occurred in these patients. In hormone-secreting pituitary tumours with far lateral localisation, endocrinologic abnormalities were corrected in 5 patients, while hormone secretion was significantly decreased in 3 patients. In 1 patient with histologically verified adenoma, hormone secretion did not significantly change following surgical removal. CONCLUSIONS: Neuronavigation in pituitary surgery is of use in {{only a small number of}} cases. Nevertheless, we suggest that contour-guided, transsphenoidal adenomectomy may prove helpful in approaching recurrent adenomas and localising lateral microadenomas...|$|R
