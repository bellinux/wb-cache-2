The SMX {{are the key}} method for Kepler's power efficiency as the whole GPU uses a single [...] "Core Clock" [...] rather than the <b>double-pump</b> [...] "Shader Clock". The SMX usage of a single unified clock increases the GPU power efficiency {{due to the fact}} that two Kepler CUDA Cores consume 90% power of one Fermi CUDA Core. Consequently, the SMX needs additional processing units to execute a whole warp per cycle. Kepler also needed to increase raw GPU performance as to remain competitive. As a result, it doubled the CUDA Cores from 16 to 32 per CUDA array, 3 CUDA Cores Array to 6 CUDA Cores Array, 1 load/store and 1 SFU group to 2 load/store and 2 SFU group. The GPU processing resources are also double. From 2 warp schedulers to 4 warp schedulers, 4 dispatch unit became 8 and the register file doubled to 64K entries as to increase performance. With the doubling of GPU processing units and resources increasing the usage of die spaces, The capability of the PolyMorph Engine aren't double but enhanced, making it capable of spurring out a polygon in 2 cycles instead of 4. With Kepler, Nvidia not only worked on power efficiency but also on area efficiency. Therefore, Nvidia opted to use eight dedicated FP64 CUDA cores in a SMX as to save die space, while still offering FP64 capabilities since all Kepler CUDA cores are not FP64 capable. With the improvement Nvidia made on Kepler, the results include an increase in GPU graphic performance while downplaying FP64 performance.|$|E

Variable stabilities of diluted full-length recombinant FVIII Kogenate FS (KG-FS) {{have been reported}} under different storage conditions. We investigated the recovery and stability of diluted KG-FS in vitro and in vivo. Kogenate FS was diluted to 50 - 120 U mL(- 1) and its recovery and stability in glass vials or polypropylene syringes was determined. Furthermore, stability of KG-FS diluted to 80 U mL(- 1) 'administered' via single- and <b>double-pump</b> mock CI systems was tested. Finally, the in vivo stability of KG-FS diluted to approximately 60 U mL(- 1) and administered postsurgically by CI with the <b>double-pump</b> to a paediatric patient with severe haemophilia A undergoing implantable venous access device placement was investigated. Initial KG-FS dilution resulted in a 10 - 20 % FVIII loss; a further 25 - 30 % loss occurred over 72 h in vials or syringes. With the <b>double-pump,</b> 1 h recovery was 35 %, increasing to 80 % by 24 h; the initial losses were because of the Y-infusion of a 10 -fold larger volume of saline concomitantly with the FVIII. In vivo, CI resulted in stable FVIII activity levels within the target range. These in vitro results are important for the generation of CI guidelines for diluted KG-FS in the paediatric haemophilic population. That FVIII losses occur upon dilution and with the <b>double-pump</b> does not preclude use of diluted KG-FS. Indeed, stable FVIII levels were maintained when diluted KG-FS was administered by CI with the <b>double-pump</b> to a paediatric patient postsurgically...|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of laser-irradiated clusters or nanodroplets depends strongly {{on the amount}} of energy delivered to the electrons and can be controlled by using appropriately shaped laser pulses. In this paper, a self-consistent kinetic model is used to analyze the transition from quasineutral, hydrodinamic-like expansion regimes to the Coulomb explosion (CE) regime when increasing the ratio between the thermal energy of the electrons and the electrostatic energy stored in the cluster. It is shown that a suitable <b>double-pump</b> irradiation scheme can produce hybrid expansion regimes, wherein a slow hydrodynamic expansion is followed by a fast CE, leading to ion overtaking and producing multiple ion flows expanding with different velocities.

40|$|Fiber-optic {{parametric}} amplifiers (FOPAs) {{can be used}} in lightwave {{systems for}} several signal-processing applications including optical amplification, phase conjugation, and wavelength conversion. In this review we focus on some of the recent advances in designing broadband FOPAs. The well-known simple theory behind the nonlinear phenomenon of four-wave mixing is discussed first to provide the background material. It is then used to discuss the performance of single-pump and <b>double-pump</b> FOPAs and reveal the important role played by the nonlinear contribution to phase matching. We discuss the design of dual-pump FOPAs and show how they can provide a gain spectrum that is relatively uniform over a bandwidth larger than 100 nm. We also study the impact of fluctuations in the zero-dispersion wavelength along the fiber length and show that fluctuations as small as± 1 nm degrade severely the gain spectrum of FOPAs because they mainly affect its central flat part. This degradation can be avoided to a large extent by moving pump wavelengths closer. Birefringence fluctuations that occur in all practical fibers and lead to polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) also affect the gain spectrum of FOPAs. A vector theory based on the Jones-matrix formalism is developed for this purpose. We discuss how PMD affects the gain spectrum and make the FOPA gain polarization dependent even when orthogonally polarized pumps are used. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{plasmonics}} is {{to exploit}} the strong coupling between photons and collective electron oscillations in metals, so-called surface plasmon polaritons, which enable a strong confinement of the electromagnetic field to metal-dielectric interfaces. The interaction of confined optical states with electronic transitions within matter accelerates these otherwise slow light-matter interactions. This work’s purpose is to investigate accelerated light-matter interactions within plasmonic lasers, which arise due to optical confinement, and how these influence laser dynamics. In particular, this work focuses on the fabrication, demonstration and characterisation of plasmonic lasers. The devices investigated in this work consist of semiconductor nanowires made from zinc oxide (ZnO) placed in the proximity of a silver substrate. In this geometry the metal allows for strong optical confinement, whereas the semiconductor delivers the necessary gain to achieve lasing. Operating at room temperature, the emission from ZnO lies near the surface plasmon frequency, where confinement and loss become maximal, leading to accelerated spontaneous recombination, gain switching and gain recovery compared with conventional - photonic - ZnO nanowire lasers. To assess the lasing dynamics, in this work a novel <b>double-pump</b> spectroscopy technique is used, which exploits the non-linearity of the laser process to allow the investigation of accelerated light-matter interactions. This novel technique is necessary, as the speed of plasmonic devices is too fast for electrical detection, and the emission of single devices is too weak for non-linear spectroscopic techniques. Comparing photonic and plasmonic devices reveals contrasting dynamics between both, highlighting the benefits of plasmonic confinement, but also exposing an important limitation. Plasmonic devices could potentially be faster, but are ultimately limited by internal relaxation processes of the chosen gain medium. The findings of this work will improve the understanding of plasmonic lasers and their limitations, but also lead to improved knowledge of internal semiconductor processes. Open Acces...|$|E

50|$|With this technology, the two ALUs in {{the core}} of the CPU are <b>double-pumped,</b> meaning that they {{actually}} operate at twice the core clock frequency. For example, in a 3.8 GHz processor, the ALUs will effectively be operating at 7.6 GHz. The reason behind this is to generally make up for the low IPC count; additionally this considerably enhances the integer performance of the CPU. Intel also replaced the high-speed barrel shifter with a shift/rotate execution unit that operates at the same frequency as the CPU core. The downside is that certain instructions are now much slower (relatively and absolutely) than before, making optimization for multiple target CPUs difficult. An example is shift and rotate operations, which suffer from the lack of a barrel shifter which was present on every x86 CPU beginning with the i386, including the main competitor processor, Athlon.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{interferometric}} gravitational-wave detectors implement Fabry-Perot cavities {{to increase}} their peak sensitivity. However, this is at cost of reducing their detection bandwidth, which origins from the propagation phase delay of the light. The "white-light-cavity" idea, first proposed by Wicht et al. [Optics Communications 134, 431 (1997) ], is to circumvent this limitation by introducing anomalous dispersion, using <b>double-pumped</b> gain medium, to compensate for such phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian of atom-light interaction, we apply the input-output formalism to evaluate the quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise associated with the parametric amplification process noticed by others, the stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint. Through surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable (not lasing) and stationary, we find {{that there is no}} net enhancement of the shot-noise limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain mediums or different parameter regimes shall be explored for realizing the white light cavity. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a cellular transformation process that is employed repeatedly and ubiquitously during vertebrate morphogenesis to build complex tissues and organs. Cellular transformations that occur during cancer cell invasion are phenotypically similar to developmental EMT, and involve the same molecular signalling pathways. EMT processes are diverse, but are characterised by: a loss of cell-cell adhesion; a gain in cell-matrix adhesion; an increase in cell motility; the secretion of proteases that degrade basement membrane proteins; an increased resistance to apoptosis; a loss of polarisation; increased production of extracellular matrix components; a change from a rounded to a fibroblastic morphology; and an invasive phenotype. This thesis focuses explicitly on endocardial EMT, which is the EMT that occurs during vertebrate embryonic heart development. The embryonic heart initially forms as a tube, with myocardium externally, endocardium internally, with these tissue layers separated by a thick extracellular matrix termed the cardiac jelly. Some of the endocardial cells in specific regions of the embryonic heart tube undergo EMT and invade the cardiac jelly. This causes cellularised swellings inside the embryonic heart tube termed the endocardial cushions. The emergence of the four chambered double pump heart of mammals involves a complex remodelling that the endocardial cushions {{play an active role}} in. Even while heart remodelling is taking place, the heart tube is operating as a single-circulation pump, and the endocardial cushions are performing a valve-like function that is critical to the survival of the embryo (Nomura-Kitabayashi et al. 2009). As the endocardial cushions grow and remodel, they become the valve leaflets of the foetal heart. The endocardial cushions also contribute tissue to the septa (walls) of the heart. Their correct formation is thus essential {{to the development of a}} fully functional, fully divided, <b>double-pump</b> system. It has been shown that genetic mutations that cause impaired endocardial EMT lead to the development of a range of congenital heart defects (Fischer et al. 2007). An extensive review is conducted of existing experimental investigations into endocardial EMT. The information extracted from this review is used to develop a multiscale conceptual model of endocardial EMT, including the major protein signalling pathways involved, and the cellular phenotypes that they induce or inhibit. After considering the requirements for computational simulations of EMT, and reviewing the various techniques and simulation packages available for multi-cell modelling, cellular Potts modelling is selected as having the most appropriate combination of features. The open source simulation platform Compucell 3 D is selected for model development, due to the flexibility, range of features provided and an existing implementation of multiscale models; that include subcellular models of reaction pathways. Based on the conceptual model of endocardial EMT, abstract computational simulations of key aspects are developed, in order to investigate qualitative behaviour under different simulated conditions. The abstract simulations include a 2 D multiscale model of Notch signalling lateral induction, which is the mechanism by which the embryonic heart tube is patterned into cushion and non-cushion forming regions. Additionally, a 3 D simulation is used to investigate the possible role of contact-inhibited mitosis, upregulated by the VEGF protein, in maintaining an epithelial phenotype. One particular in vitro investigation of endocardial EMT (Luna-Zurita et al. 2010) is used to develop quantitative simulations. The quantitative data used for fitting the simulations consist of cell shape metrics that are derived from simple processing of the imaging results. Single cell simulations are used to investigate the relationship between cell motility and cell shape in the cellular Potts model. The findings are then implemented in multi-cell models, in order to investigate the relationship between cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, cell motility and cell shape during EMT...|$|E

40|$|The ever {{shrinking}} {{size of the}} MOS transistors {{brings the}} promise of scalable Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures containing hundreds of processing elements with on-chip communication, all integrated into a single die. Such a computational fabric will provide high levels of performance in an energy efficient manner. To mitigate emerging wire-delay problem and to address the need for substantial interconnect bandwidth, packet switched routers are fast replacing shared buses and dedicated wires as the interconnect fabric of choice. With on-chip communication consuming {{a significant portion of}} the chip power and area budgets, there is a compelling need for compact, low power routers. While applications dictate the choice of the compute core, the advent of multimedia applications, such as 3 D graphics and signal processing, places stronger demands for self-contained, low-latency floating-point processors with increased throughput. Therefore, this work focuses on two key building blocks critical to the success of NoC design: high performance, area and energy efficient router and floating-point processor architectures. This thesis first presents a six-port four-lane 57 GB/s non-blocking router core based on wormhole switching. The router features <b>double-pumped</b> crossbar channels and destinationaware channel drivers that dynamically configure based on the current packet destination. This enables 45 % reduction in crossbar channel area, 23 % overall router area, up to 3. 8 X reduction in peak channel power, and 7. 2 % improvement in average channel power, with no performance penalty over a published design. In a 150 nm six-metal CMOS process, the 12. 2 mm 2 router contains 1. 9 million transistors and operates at 1 GHz at 1. 2 V. We next present a new pipelined single-precision floating-point multiply accumulator core (FPMAC) featuring a single-cycle accumulate loop using base 32 and internal carry-save arithmetic, with delayed addition techniques. Combined algorithmic, logic and circuit techniques enable multiply-accumulates at speeds exceeding 3 GHz, with single-cycle throughput. Unlike existing FPMAC architectures, the design eliminates scheduling restrictions between consecutive FPMAC instructions. The optimizations allow removal of the costly normalization step from the critical accumulate loop and conditionally powered down using dynamic sleep transistors on long accumulate operations, saving active and leakage power. In addition, an improved leading zero anticipator (LZA) and overflow detection logic applicable to carry-save format is presented. In a 90 nm seven-metal dual-VT CMOS process, the 2 mm 2 custom design contains 230 K transistors. The fully functional first silicon achieves 6. 2 GFLOPS of performance while dissipating 1. 2 W at 3. 1 GHz, 1. 3 V supply. It is clear that realization of successful NoC designs require well balanced decisions at all levels: architecture, logic, circuit and physical design. Our results from key building blocks demonstrate the feasibility of pushing the performance limits of compute cores and communication routers, while keeping active and leakage power, and area under control.

40|$|The {{scaling of}} MOS {{transistors}} into the nanometer regime opens {{the possibility for}} creating large Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures containing hundreds of integrated processing elements with on-chip communication. NoC architectures, with structured on-chip networks are emerging as a scalable and modular solution to global communications within large systems-on-chip. NoCs mitigate the emerging wire-delay problem and addresses the need for substantial interconnect bandwidth by replacing today’s shared buses with packet-switched router networks. With on-chip communication consuming {{a significant portion of}} the chip power and area budgets, there is a compelling need for compact, low power routers. While applications dictate the choice of the compute core, the advent of multimedia applications, such as three-dimensional (3 D) graphics and signal processing, places stronger demands for self-contained, low-latency floating-point processors with increased throughput. This work demonstrates that a computational fabric built using optimized building blocks can provide high levels of performance in an energy efficient manner. The thesis details an integrated 80 - Tile NoC architecture implemented in a 65 -nm process technology. The prototype is designed to deliver over 1. 0 TFLOPS of performance while dissipating less than 100 W. This thesis first presents a six-port four-lane 57 GB/s non-blocking router core based on wormhole switching. The router features <b>double-pumped</b> crossbar channels and destinationaware channel drivers that dynamically configure based on the current packet destination. This enables 45 % reduction in crossbar channel area, 23 % overall router area, up to 3. 8 X reduction in peak channel power, and 7. 2 % improvement in average channel power. In a 150 -nm sixmetal CMOS process, the 12. 2 mm 2 router contains 1. 9 -million transistors and operates at 1 GHz at 1. 2 V supply. We next describe a new pipelined single-precision floating-point multiply accumulator core (FPMAC) featuring a single-cycle accumulation loop using base 32 and internal carry-save arithmetic, with delayed addition techniques. A combination of algorithmic, logic and circuit techniques enable multiply-accumulate operations at speeds exceeding 3 GHz, with singlecycle throughput. This approach reduces the latency of dependent FPMAC instructions and enables a sustained multiply-add result (2 FLOPS) every cycle. The optimizations allow removal of the costly normalization step from the critical accumulation loop and conditionally powered down using dynamic sleep transistors on long accumulate operations, saving active and leakage power. In a 90 -nm seven-metal dual-VT CMOS process, the 2 mm 2 custom design contains 230 -K transistors. Silicon achieves 6. 2 -GFLOPS of performance while dissipating 1. 2 W at 3. 1 GHz, 1. 3 V supply. We finally present the industry's first single-chip programmable teraFLOPS processor. The NoC architecture contains 80 tiles arranged as an 8 × 10 2 D array of floating-point cores and packet-switched routers, both designed to operate at 4 GHz. Each tile has two pipelined singleprecision FPMAC units which feature a single-cycle accumulation loop for high throughput. The five-port router combines 100 GB/s of raw bandwidth with low fall-through latency under 1 ns. The on-chip 2 D mesh network provides a bisection bandwidth of 2 Tera-bits/s. The 15 -FO 4 design employs mesochronous clocking, fine-grained clock gating, dynamic sleep transistors, and body-bias techniques. In a 65 -nm eight-metal CMOS process, the 275 mm 2 custom design contains 100 -M transistors. The fully functional first silicon achieves over 1. 0 TFLOPS of performance on a range of benchmarks while dissipating 97 W at 4. 27 GHz and 1. 07 -V supply. It is clear that realization of successful NoC designs require well balanced decisions at all levels: architecture, logic, circuit and physical design. Our results demonstrate that the NoC architecture successfully delivers on its promise of greater integration, high performance, good scalability and high energy efficiency...|$|R
