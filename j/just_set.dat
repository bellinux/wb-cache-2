500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches.

The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I think it was the best music for the whole record.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And you can blame it on me / <b>Just</b> <b>set</b> your guilt free, honey / I don't want to hold you back now love".|$|E

Kind of filled with ghosts. I thought it <b>just</b> <b>set</b> up the album nicely." [...] He summarized the song as consisting of [...] "basically just a cassette and effected hammer dulcimers." [...] The sounds of [...] "Small Horror" [...] were intended to represent [...] "banging depression." [...] Cox described the song as being [...] "the most depressing song" [...] on Let the Blind Lead, and as being [...] "concrete" [...] musically. Instrumental track [...] "Ready Set Glow" [...] is supposed to [...] "create the impression of passing out and falling back into a bed of strobe lights." [...] Another instrumental song, [...] "After Class", is a [...] "sonic rearrangement" [...] of a track produced by Deerhunter for the 2008 compilation album Living Bridge. The self-titled final song of Let the Blind Lead, another instrumental track, was intended to bring the album full circle, having it start and end on an [...] "ambient note". [...] Lockett Pundt, a recurring focus of the album's lyrics, created a guitar loop which was the basis for the song [...] "Cold as Ice".|$|E

Chart Attack called the album a [...] "surprisingly meaty sophomore record," [...] with the group's [...] "dynamic double-guitar attack" [...] benefiting from Machine's [...] "prog-metal predilections". Chart Attack concluded with: [...] "Songs about dead people have rarely sounded so damned full of life." [...] Raziq Rauf of Drowned in Sound wrote that the record had [...] "two great songs on here that fill the unashamed emo cynic with hope, only to be let down" [...] by the remainder of the album.

LAS Magazine writer David Spain called the album [...] "an interesting notch along the battered branch of emo's legacy," [...] with the band giving [...] "its peers food for thought". Spain noted that the group [...] "didn't <b>just</b> <b>set</b> out to create another 40-minute schmaltz fest; they vested thought and idea into their work". Spain concluded by mentioning how the band [...] "succeed in creating a surprisingly original work in a drowning genre".|$|E
2500|$|Gray was a keen {{student of}} medieval history, {{and in time}} came to make a {{particular}} study of the oldest Welsh poetry, though without actually learning the language. [...] Several pages of his commonplace books are devoted to notes on Welsh prosody, and he also mentioned there a legend, now considered quite unhistorical, which he had come across in Thomas Carte's A General History of England (1747–1755). [...] When Edward I conquered Wales, [...] "he is said", wrote Gray, [...] "to have hanged up all their Bards, because they encouraged the Nation to rebellion, but their works (we see), still remain, the Language (tho' decaying) still lives, {{and the art of}} their versification is known, and practised to this day among them". [...] Gray also studied early Scandinavian literature, and found in one Old Norse poem the refrain [...] "'Vindum vindum/ Vef Darradar'", which was to reappear in The Bard as [...] "Weave the warp and weave the woof". [...] In 1755 he began work on The Bard, and by August of that year had completed two thirds of the poem. [...] Initially he worked with a speed and a sense of identification that were both unusual for him. [...] "I felt myself the Bard", he declared. [...] But composing the third and final strophe proved more difficult, and he eventually ground to a halt. [...] For two years the poem remained unfinished, but then in 1757 he attended a concert by John Parry, a blind harpist who claimed that the traditional Welsh harp repertoire went back as far as the druids. [...] Gray was so inspired by this experience that he returned to The Bard with new enthusiasm, and was soon able to tell his friend William Mason, [...] "Mr Parry, you must know, has set my Ode in motion again, and has brought it at last to a conclusion." [...] Gray sold the copyright of this poem and of his [...] "The Progress of Poesy" [...] to the publisher Robert Dodsley for 40 guineas, and Dodsley issued them together under the title Odes by Mr. Gray. [...] The book was printed by Gray's friend Horace Walpole who had <b>just</b> <b>set</b> up a printing press at his home, Strawberry Hill, and who had set his heart on inaugurating the enterprise with Gray's poems. [...] The Odes were published on 8 August 1757 as a handsome quarto, with a print run of 2000 copies priced at one shilling. [...] Walpole prevailed on Gray to add four footnotes to The Bard for the first edition, though Gray told Walpole, [...] "I do not love notes…They are signs of weakness and obscurity. [...] If a thing cannot be understood without them, it had better not be understood at all." [...] These proved, for many readers, inadequate to explain the poem, and Gray complacently wrote to Mason [...] "nobody understands me, and I am perfectly satisfied." [...] Rather against his will, he was persuaded to add a few more notes for the 1768 edition.|$|E
