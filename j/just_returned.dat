5|$|Under {{the command}} of Brigadier George F. Hopkinson, the 1st Airlanding Brigade Group was formed on 10 October 1941 through the re-designation of the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade, which had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to the United Kingdom after {{training}} for mountain warfare in British India.

5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, {{at a party}} held in Athens by court marshal Theodore Ypsilantis, Alexander became re-acquainted {{with one}} of his {{childhood}} friends, Aspasia Manos. She had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
5|$|Now an adult, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) {{watches as}} his new Mr. Cluck's chicken {{restaurant}} gets {{hit by a}} meteorite, killing those inside, including Tricia Tanaka (Sung-Hi Lee), the newswoman who just interviewed him about his lottery winnings. Hurley arrives home, telling his mother his intent to go to Australia to end the bad luck curse he believes was bestowed upon him after he won the lottery. She tries to disprove the curse by revealing his father has returned to them after seventeen years. Suspecting his father of only wanting the lottery money, Hurley reacts angrily. David brings his son to a tarot card reader (Suzanne Krull), who tells Hurley she can 'remove' the curse before admitting that David paid her to say this. Hurley vows to give the money away, and begins packing for Australia. David acknowledges he <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> for the money, but approves of Hurley's decision and promises he will be waiting for him when Hurley gets back.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the North American hard court swing, Murray {{announced}} he was extending his partnership with Amélie Mauresmo {{until the end of}} the US Open, but was ideally looking for a long-term deal. He also revealed he had only <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to a full training schedule following his back surgery last September. Murray reached back-to-back quarterfinals at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters, losing to eventual champions Jo Wilfried Tsonga, after being a break up in the decider, and Roger Federer, after being two breaks up in the second set, respectively. He made it to the quarterfinals of the 2014 US Open, losing to Novak Djokovic, after earning his first top ten win of the year in the previous round against Jo Wilfried Tsonga. This was the first season since 2009 where Murray failed to reach a grand slam final. As a consequence Murray fell outside of the top 10 ranking places for the first time since June 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> {{from a trip}} to Sorrento, {{called for}} a {{government}} meeting on the night of March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict and a speedy relief of tension. It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence, a modified version of Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze, which required the normalization of relations with Lithuania. The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.|$|E

Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes aware of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E

5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E
5|$|On the July 7 {{episode of}} SmackDown, it was {{announced}} that Lesnar would be facing Randy Orton at SummerSlam, who himself had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to WWE from injury. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his drug tests for this fight, but he was not suspended by WWE because he is not a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC drug tests. Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to Raw on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an RKO. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on SmackDown Live, performing an F-5 on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. Much to Shane McMahon's dismay, Lesnar would later attack Shane with an F-5. The end made many people believe Lesnar had gone off script due to the severity of Orton's head wound. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an F-5 to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.|$|E
5|$|When Epstein's {{field goal}} attempt for the 2001 Wolverines was blocked on September 8 with 9:11 {{remaining}} against Washington and run {{back for a}} touchdown, it gave the Huskies a lead {{that they would not}} relinquish {{on the way to a}} 23–18 game. Epstein made a 51-yard field goal against Iowa on October 27 to give Michigan a 6-point lead with 3:57 remaining. The 32–26 score held up. He posted a school record 57-yard field goal against Michigan State in the November 3, 2001 Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry game known as Clockgate. However, later in the game, Epstein's short punt and two Michigan penalties, made way for Michigan State's controversial game-winning drive. He made the game-winning 31-yard field goal against the Wisconsin on November 17, 2001 with 10 seconds left. Epstein set up the field goal when his punt bounced off of Badger Brett Bell and was recovered by Brandon Williams with 14 seconds left. In the game 3 of his 8 punts were downed inside the 20 yard line, including a 48-yarder that was downed on the 1-yard-line to set up Michigan's first score. 3 of his 5 kickoffs were touchbacks and a fourth one into the end zone was <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> 15 yards. Epstein's performance earned him Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition and his 8 points (2 FGs and 2 PATs) gave him the team scoring lead with 69 points. He finished the season with 76 points (13–20 FGs and 37–37 PATs) and 71 punts for 2790 yards (39.3 average/17 inside 20). Epstein's single-season punt yardage total was a school record that was surpassed the following season by Adam Finley. His 76 points just edged out B. J. Askew's 72 points and Marquise Walker's 68 points. Epstein earned All-Big Ten Conference second team honors as a placekicker from the coaches and honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter. He concluded his career by making 2 field goals in the January 26, 2002 Senior Bowl.|$|E
