The simulation begins with an axisymmetric electric field model using AMOS, a full-wave Maxwell solver with lossy (dispersive) electric and magnetic material models. Electric fields calculated by this code determine the spatial distribution of absorbed laser energy {{in the vicinity of}} the nodule. This data is linked to a thermal/stress model and mechanical calculations are executed using the general purpose finite element code COSMOS/M. The simulation estimates the transient temperature response of the nodule and the surrounding medium and predicts the dynamic stresses caused by the thermal impulse.

The principles of mechatronics, which <b>integrates</b> electronics, <b>computers,</b> <b>process</b> control and mechanical systems, have been used to provide a state-of-the-art pressure filtration apparatus capable of performing repeatable experiments over a range of pressure/flow regimes commonly encountered in industrial filtrations. Data obtained at constant pressure and proportionally controlled variable pressure are presented to illustrate the scope of the apparatus and the benefits of removing operator interference and damaging pumping operations from filtration experiments. It is shown how scale-up parameters (obtained for aqueous mineral suspensions) can be used to successfully predict constant pressure filtration performance and the problems which can arise when predictions of more compressible variable pressure filtrations are made using data obtained at constant pressure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{asymptotic}} {{theory for}} nonlinear transformations of fractionally integrated time series is developed. Various nonlinear functions of fractionally integrated series such as ARFIMA time series are studied, and the asymptotic distributions of sample moments of such functions are obtained and analyzed. The transformations considered {{in this paper}} includes a variety of functions such as regular functions, integrable functions and asymptotically homogeneous functions that are often used in practical nonlinear econometric analysis.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} spurious regression and spurious detrending from the usual I (1) processes to the long memory fractionally <b>integrated</b> <b>processes.</b> It is found that when we regress a long memory fractionally <b>integrated</b> <b>process</b> on another unrelated long memory fractionally <b>integrated</b> <b>process,</b> no matter whether these processes are stationary or not, {{as long as their}} orders of integration sum up to a value greater than 0. 5, the t ratios become divergent and spurious effects occur. Our finding suggests that it is the long memory, instead of nonstationarity or lack of ergodicity, that causes such spurious effects. As a result, spurious effects might happen more often than we previously believed as they can arise even between stationary series while the usual first-differencing procedure may not completely eliminate spurious effects when data possess strong long memory.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a bootstrap theory for models including autoregressive time series with roots approaching to unity as {{the sample size}} increases. In particu-lar, we consider the processes with roots converging to unity with rates slower than n− 1. We call such <b>processes</b> weakly <b>integrated</b> <b>processes.</b> It is established that the bootstrap relying on the estimated autoregressive model is generally consistent for the weakly <b>integrated</b> <b>processes.</b> Both the sample and bootstrap statistics of the weakly <b>integrated</b> <b>processes</b> are shown to yield the same normal asymptotics. Moreover, for the asymptotically pivotal statistics of the weakly <b>integrated</b> <b>processes,</b> the bootstrap is expected to provide an asymptotic refine-ment and give better approximations for the finite sample distributions than the first order asymptotic theory. For the weakly <b>integrated</b> <b>processes,</b> the magni-tudes of potential refinements by the bootstrap are shown to be proportional to {{the rate at which}} the root of the underlying process converges to unity. The order of boostrap refinement can be as large as o(n− 1 / 2 +) for any > 0.
