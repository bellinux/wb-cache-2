500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Fairfax High School, Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman. They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. [...] After one of the group's shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack. [...] Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue: [...] "Within {{a few minutes of}} hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> different from most of the people I'd spent time with...He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting." [...] Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Investment {{powers and}} limits on those powers are {{set out in}} Part II of the Act. Section 3(1) states that [...] "subject to the {{provisions}} of this part, a trustee may make any kind of investment {{that he could make}} if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> entitled to the assets of the trust". This is far looser than the previous provisions, which were contained in the Trustee Investments Act 1961. The 1961 Act was repeatedly criticised for its [...] "very conservative investment policy for trustees". The powers of investment trustees were given were restrictive and narrow, {{and at the same time}} the trustees were expected to go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them. This new power of investment is treated as a default provision - it is overridden if the trust instrument itself restricts the ways trust money can be invested. If the trust instrument was created prior to 3 August 1961, however, its provisions regarding investments are treated as void. The new provisions apply retrospectively, i.e. to trusts created before the passage of the Act. They do not, however, apply to trusts governed by the Charities Act 1993, Authorised Unit Trusts or occupational pension schemes.|$|E

500|$|On 28 July 1540 (the {{same day}} Cromwell was executed), Henry married the young Catherine Howard, a first cousin and lady-in-waiting of Anne Boleyn. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> delighted {{with his new}} queen, and awarded her the lands of Cromwell and {{a vast array of}} jewellery. Soon after the marriage, however, Queen Catherine had an affair with the courtier Thomas Culpeper. She also {{employed}} Francis Dereham, who had previously been informally engaged to her and had an affair with her prior to her marriage, as her secretary. The court was informed of her affair with Dereham whilst Henry was away; they dispatched Thomas Cranmer to investigate, who brought evidence of Queen Catherine's previous affair with Dereham to the king's notice. Though Henry originally refused to believe the allegations, Dereham confessed. It took another meeting of the council, however, before Henry believed the accusations against Dereham and went into a rage, blaming the council before consoling himself in hunting. [...] When questioned, the queen could have admitted a prior contract to marry Dereham, which would have made her subsequent marriage to Henry invalid, but she instead claimed that Dereham had forced her to enter into an adulterous relationship. Dereham, meanwhile, exposed Queen Catherine's relationship with Culpeper. Culpeper and Dereham were both executed, and Catherine too was beheaded on 13 February 1542.|$|E
500|$|Lazenby said he {{experienced}} difficulties during shooting, not receiving any coaching despite {{his lack of}} acting experience, and with director Hunt never addressing him directly, only through his assistant. Lazenby also declared that Hunt also asked {{the rest of the}} crew to keep a distance from him, as [...] "Peter thought the more I was alone, the better I would be as James Bond." [...] Allegedly, there also were personality conflicts with Rigg, who was already an established star. However, according to director Hunt, these rumours are untrue and there were no such difficulties—or else they were minor—and may have started with Rigg joking to Lazenby before filming a love scene [...] "Hey George, I'm having garlic for lunch. I hope you are!" [...] Hunt also declared that he usually had long talks with Lazenby before and during shooting. For instance, to shoot Tracy's death scene, Hunt brought Lazenby to the set at 8 o'clock in the morning and made him rehearse all day long, [...] "and I broke him down until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> exhausted, and by the time we shot it at five o'clock, he was exhausted, and that's how I got the performance." [...] Hunt said that if Lazenby had remained in the role, he would also have directed the successor film, Diamonds Are Forever, and that his original intentions were concluding the film with Bond and Tracy driving off following their wedding, saving Tracy's murder for the pre-credit sequence of Diamonds Are Forever. The idea was discarded after Lazenby quit the role.|$|E
2500|$|In Path to Victory: Wallaby Power in the 1980s Mark Ella wrote: [...] "It {{was good}} to see David Campese get that last try because by now he had no {{confidence}} at all. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> shot to pieces. It doesn't really matter in what position Campo plays {{as long as he}} sees the ball. It could be wing or it could be fullback. Nobody's going to argue he shouldn't be in the side. The main thing is to build up his confidence, and this can't be done if Campo is just going to chase all day and not see the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Birleys {{separated}} in 1972 and later divorced in 1975 {{after the birth}} of her second child with James Goldsmith."Our breakup was because of Mark's infidelities, not because I fell in love with Jimmy", she told Vanity Fair writer Maureen Orth after Birley's death. [...] Revealing that Birley had numerous other girlfriends from the beginning of their relationship, she added: [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> incapable of being faithful. He was a serial adulterer. Like a butterfly, he had to seduce every woman. Despite their divorce, the two remained best friends and soulmates, talking to each other every day and holidaying together until Birley's death in August 2007. Birley said they were [...] "the true loves of each other's lives".|$|E
2500|$|Kiedis {{also met}} future bandmate Slovak after seeing him perform with his band Anthym. After the show, Slovak invited Kiedis {{to his house}} for a snack.

[...] Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine, and speed recreationally. Despite his frequent drug use, he excelled in school, often receiving straight A grades. In June 1980, Kiedis graduated with honors from high school. That August, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles to study writing. However, he dropped out {{at the beginning of his}} second year due to his worsening addiction to cocaine and heroin.|$|E
2500|$|Gein and {{his mother}} were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Gein devoted himself to taking care of her. Sometime in 1945, Gein later recounted, he {{and his mother}} visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to {{purchase}} straw. According to Gein, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith home came outside and yelled to stop. Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene. What bothered her {{did not appear to be}} the brutality toward the dog but the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith so had no business being there. [...] "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly. She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. Ed was devastated by her death; in the words of author Harold Schechter, he had [...] "lost his only friend and one true love. And <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> alone in the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1873, British {{army officer}} Major Walter Clopton Wingfield {{designed}} and patented a similar game– {{which he called}} sphairistikè ( [...] , meaning [...] "ball-playing"), and was soon known simply as [...] "sticky" [...] – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales. According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist, [...] "Sports historians all agree that [...] deserves {{much of the credit}} for the development of modern tennis." [...] According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield [...] "popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game [...] and most importantly you had his rules. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874." [...] The world's oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, were first played in London in 1877. The first Championships culminated a significant debate on how to standardize the rules.|$|E
2500|$|Cottam {{took the}} message and {{coordinates}} to the bridge, where the officers on watch were sceptical about {{the seriousness of the}} distress call.. Agitated, Cottam rushed down the ladder to the captain's cabin and awakened Captain Arthur Henry Rostron, who immediately sprang into action and [...] "gave the order to turn the ship around", and then [...] "asked the operator if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> sure it was a distress signal from the Titanic". The operator said that he had [...] "received a distress signal from the Titanic, requiring immediate assistance", gave Titanic's position, and said that [...] "he was absolutely certain of the message". [...] Whilst dressing, Rostron set a course for Titanic, and sent for the chief engineer and told [...] "him to call another watch of stokers and make all possible speed to the Titanic, as she was in trouble." [...] Rostron testified that the distance to Titanic was [...] and took Carpathia [...] three and a half hours. At the same time, Rostron had Carpathias crew prepare hot drinks and soup for the survivors, prepare the public rooms as dormitories, have doctors ready to treat any wounded survivors, and to have oil ready to pour down the lavatories to calm the water {{on the sides of the}} ship should the sea become rough.|$|E
2500|$|The pair separated, with Mark {{unable to}} deal with the revelation. [...] Chrissie was {{informed}} that Mark was not her biological father, but the truth of her paternity was kept from her, resulting in a bitter fall out with her mother. [...] It took many months for Mark and Tricia's relationship began to heal again, and even when they had managed to set the past behind them and move on, things did not run smoothly. Powell elaborated: [...] "Mark and Tricia got back together. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> delighted. On top of that, he knew Tricia had asked for her breast reconstruction to be brought forward following a successful mastectomy." [...] However, Mark then discovered that he had a mild form of anemia that could be hereditary, meaning Chrissie needed to be informed. [...] Rather than revealing that Frank was her real father, Tricia suggested that she pretend to be the one with the condition. [...] Powell continued: [...] "'Chrissie's not stupid and is convinced Tricia's up to something. So, she decides to check her mum's file. Mark gets there first, but when he opens the file later he sees that Tricia has liver cancer and needs chemotherapy immediately - she'd found out recently." [...] He stated: [...] "The outlook is bleak and I've no idea how they'll manage to cope this time".|$|E

2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
