5|$|Two {{comprehensive}} {{histories of}} Engelbart's laboratory and work are in What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry by John Markoff and A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century by Donald Neilson. Other books on Engelbart and <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> include Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing by Thierry Bardini and The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart, by Valerie Landau and Eileen Clegg {{in conversation with}} Douglas Engelbart. All four of these books are {{based on interviews with}} Engelbart as well as other contributors in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along with <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously {{awaits the}} return to Earth of his new rocket ship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space. The rocket is at first thought to be lost, having {{dramatically}} overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is detected by radar and returns to Earth, crash-landing in Wimbledon, London.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory,</b> where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
50|$|Later {{she went}} to work for him in <b>his</b> <b>laboratories,</b> {{especially}} on craniometry.|$|R
50|$|During 35 years, nearly 300 PhD {{students}} and postdoctoral {{researchers have been}} trained in <b>his</b> <b>laboratories.</b>|$|R
50|$|He died on 11 June 1965 in Noorden. <b>His</b> <b>laboratories</b> manager, René Sneyers, {{became the}} second {{director}} of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage.|$|R
5|$|Furniss {{graduated}} LSU with {{an academic}} major in zoology on a pre-medical track, and {{grade point averages}} above 3.5 {{in each of his}} last three years. He took <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> courses during the fall semester, so they did not distract from the baseball season in the spring semester.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Hoffmann did as most chemists have always done, {{starting}} by studying the literature and recreating the published methods. On 10 August 1897 (according to <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> notebooks), Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA, from salicylic acid refluxed with acetic anhydride.|$|E
5|$|Krugers is {{recorded}} {{as having been}} active in film in the mid-1920s, leading the laboratory at N.V. Java Film. He {{may have been one}} of its founders, together with the Dutchman L.Heuveldorp. The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926, when Heuveldorp directed the colony's first feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng. Krugers served as a cameraman for the film, which was based on a Sundanese folktale, also processing the film in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Bandung.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>his</b> <b>laboratory's</b> {{other key}} discoveries {{is a novel}} tumor {{suppressor}} gene, KLF6, which is inactivated {{in a number of}} human cancers, including primary liver cancer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} people who worked for Thomas Edison in <b>his</b> <b>laboratories</b> at Menlo Park or West Orange or at the subsidiary electrical businesses that he supervised.|$|R
5000|$|Happer {{describes}} <b>his</b> <b>laboratory's</b> {{research interests}} in atomic physics: [...] "we're {{interested in the}} mechanisms that limit the performance of optical pumping systems, such as atomic clocks, magnetometers, and laser guide-star adaptive optics systems." ...|$|R
5|$|Later, Bruce Banner, Hulk's former alter ego, is {{approached}} by Captain Marvel at <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> outside Alpine, Utah. Captain Marvel asks Banner {{to step outside}} where the Avengers are waiting to confront him. During the confrontation, Hawkeye shoots Banner dead and is immediately arrested.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} Cersei Lannister's and Loras Tyrell's trials, the High Sparrow and the Faith {{gather in}} the Great Sept. Loras confesses to his crimes and atones by giving up his name and title, and joins the Faith Militant. In the Red Keep, Cersei remains in her chambers, while Qyburn summons Grand Maester Pycelle to <b>his</b> <b>laboratory,</b> where his child spies stab Pycelle to death.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E
50|$|Anderson's {{previous}} work {{focused on the}} development and function of the nervous system, particularly the mechanism of fate determination of neural stem cells. <b>His</b> <b>laboratory's</b> current focus is to dissect genes and neural circuits underlying innate behaviors.|$|R
50|$|This innovation, {{coupled with}} his {{professional}} experience and testing performed in <b>his</b> <b>laboratories,</b> {{allowed him to}} develop and patent his own system of vertical gardening. With his technology, {{more than a hundred}} projects have been developed all around the world.|$|R

5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory,</b> could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Burnet {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, he missed <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> work, {{and he was}} constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet {{was one of three}} contributors to Challenge to Australia, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result {{of the success of the}} book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where {{important}} {{scientists were}} captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn was at <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Tailfingen, while Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin {{had been moved}} to Haigerloch. Henceforth, {{the main focus of}} the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the Württemberg area.|$|E
50|$|Christian Rudolf Hubert Raetz (1946 - August 16, 2011) was the George Barth Geller Professor of Biochemistry at Duke University. He {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences in 2006. <b>His</b> <b>laboratory's</b> {{research}} focused on lipid biochemistry and has contributed significantly to the understanding of Lipid A biosynthesis.|$|R

50|$|Alan Aderem, PhD, is a biologist, {{specializing in}} {{immunology}} and cell biology. Dr. Aderem's particular focus is the innate immune system, {{the part of}} the immune system that responds generically to pathogens. <b>His</b> <b>laboratory’s</b> research focuses on diseases afflicting citizens of resource poor countries, including AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and influenza.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{his images}} {{were among the}} photos that were {{distributed}} to news media with {{the announcement of the}} first atomic bomb and the secret project that created it. In the weeks before the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, prints of 18 of his photographs were made in secrecy in preparation for the announcement. The photographs were declassified and distributed as part of the press kit. He also processed film taken by the damage assessment teams in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Oak Ridge. It took three days to print them. Armed guards outside the darkroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, while {{reviewing the}} station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton {{staring at the}} floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. The agents visit Polarity Magnetics, where they meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty). He identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> {{in which he was}} locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles. His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{protagonist of}} FireRed and LeafGreen {{is a child}} {{who lives in a}} small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher, {{explains}} to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> where the player meets Oak's grandson, another aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels. The rival then challenges the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E
50|$|Among <b>his</b> <b>laboratory's</b> many {{subsequent}} discoveries, he {{is recognized}} for the cloning of the patched gene family and demonstration {{that a human}} homolog PTCH1 is a key tumor suppressor gene for the Hedgehog signaling pathway {{as well as the}} causative gene for the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, or Gorlin syndrome.|$|R
50|$|Vern L. Schramm (born November 9, 1941) is a Professor & Ruth Merns Chair in Biochemistry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. Schramm {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences in 2007. <b>His</b> <b>laboratory's</b> {{research}} focuses on the elucidation of enzymatic mechanisms and transition state structure.|$|R

5|$|The story centres {{on a young}} engaged couple whose car {{breaks down}} in the rain near a castle where they seek a {{telephone}} to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover {{the head of the}} house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparent mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in <b>his</b> <b>laboratory.</b> The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to enter}} Cortex's castle after getting there via bridge, Crash climbs the tower walls, {{and enters the}} castle through the window he had {{previously}} escaped from. After making {{his way through the}} dark hallways and the Castle's many machines, Crash is confronted by Brio inside <b>his</b> <b>laboratory.</b> Brio uses chemicals to mutate himself into a monster. While Crash is successful in defeating Brio, the castle laboratory catches on fire during the struggle. Crash escapes to Cortex's airship, where he confronts Cortex himself as the castle burns. Cortex attacks him with a plasma gun, but Crash deflects his own projectiles against him and sends Cortex falling out of the sky. Tawna embraces Crash as the two escape the burning castle on Cortex's airship.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Accum's {{establishment}} was {{the only}} significant institution in England that provided lectures on the theory of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice. Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge. Accum's teachings attracted various prominent students. These included the well-known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland. Additionally, <b>his</b> <b>laboratory</b> {{was the first in}} Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States, among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck. When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College (precursor to Yale University) in New Haven, he ordered his first laboratory equipment from Accum in London. Accum's biographer, Charles Albert Browne, stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum's London business.|$|E
25|$|From 1951 Sanger was {{a member}} of the {{external}} staff of the Medical Research Council and when they opened the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1962, he moved from <b>his</b> <b>laboratories</b> in the Biochemistry Department of the university to the top floor of the new building. He became head of the Protein Chemistry division.|$|R
50|$|The FDA sued Koch twice, in 1943 and 1946, {{but failed}} to get a conviction. After an {{inspection}} of <b>his</b> <b>laboratories</b> by the FDA, Koch announced his retirement, and moved to Brazil in 1950. A product known as the Koch treatment continued to be sold in Mexico long after it disappeared in the United States.|$|R
