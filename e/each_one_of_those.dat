Even though Letterman's show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson were strong ratings winners and Jeopardy! was able to retain a good amount of the {{audience}} from its lead in shows, a late night time slot is not usually considered beneficial for a first run series. WNBC, however, was not left with much choice in the matter. At the time, the station cleared the NBC daytime lineup in its entirety and aired {{two and a half hours}} of news beginning at 5:00p.m. The only available slots the station had were the 9:00a.m. hour between the end of Today and the beginning of the daytime schedule, the 4:00p.m. hour between the end of the daytime schedule and Live at Five, and the 7:30p.m. slot between the end of NBC Nightly News and the beginning of primetime. <b>Each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> slots was spoken for, however. The popular Donahue was one of the station's biggest ratings draws in daytime and was not going anywhere (especially considering NBC's New York base was about to become its home), which precluded Jeopardy! from moving there. WNBC, as a network-owned station, had also picked up the syndicated edition of Family Feud when it premiered along with the rest of the stations NBC owned, which took away the 7:30 slot. King World looked for a way out of its unfavorable situation with WNBC, but there was not much to be done. The two other major network affiliates in New York, WABC and WCBS, both had the same issue as WNBC in that both stations cleared their network's schedule completely and had other programming filing the holes in their schedules.|$|E

60|$|Why, however, has the coco-nut three pores {{at the top}} {{instead of}} one, and why are two out of the three so {{carefully}} and firmly sealed up? The explanation of this strange peculiarity is only {{to be found in}} the ancestral history of the coco-nut kind. Most nuts, indeed, start in their earlier stage as if they meant to produce two or more seeds each; but as they ripen, all the seeds except one become abortive. The almond, for example, has in the flower two seeds or kernels to each nut; but in the ripe state there is generally only one, though occasionally we find an almond with two--a philipoena, as we commonly call it--just to keep in memory the original arrangement of its earlier ancestors. The reason for this is that plants whose fruits have no special protection for their seeds are obliged to produce a great many of them at once, in order that one seed in a thousand may finally survive the onslaughts of their Argus-eyed enemies; but when they learn to protect themselves by hard coverings from birds and beasts, they can dispense with some of these supernumerary seeds, and put more nutriment into <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that they still retain. Compare, for example, the innumerable small round seedlets of the poppyhead with the solitary large and richly stored seed of the walnut, or the tiny black specks of mustard and cress with the single compact and well-filled seed of the filbert and the acorn. To the very end, however, most nuts begin in the flower as if they meant to produce a whole capsuleful of small unstored and unprotected seeds, like their original ancestors; it is only at the last moment that they recollect themselves, suppress all their ovules except one, and store that one with all the best and oiliest food-stuffs at their disposal. The nuts, in fact, have learned by long experience that it is better to be the only son and heir of a wealthy house, set up in life with a good capital to begin upon, than to be one of a poor family of thirteen needy and unprovided children.|$|E
