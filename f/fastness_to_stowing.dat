To conduct this project work, twelve samples of four different structures having four GSM were taken. At first the samples were dyed with suitable recipe in a proper method. The pretreatment and after treatment of dyeing knit fabric were properly done. Then the color <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> rubbing was tested. <b>To</b> asses color <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> rubbing, standard procedure was followed.

Aluminum acetate at 5 % owf concentration gave slightly higher Gray Scale ratings for colorfastness to laundering of coreopsis and weld. All treatments had negligible to no staining on cotton. Weld had slightly better colorfastness to light ratings than the other dye types with 20 % aluminum potassium sulfate rating highest. Even though the aluminum acetate mordant improved the colorfastness to laundering on weld and coreopsis at the 5 % and 10 % owf concentrations, it did not improve <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> light and resulted in slightly lower <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> light grades on coreopsis...|$|R

40|$|Poor colour {{fastness}} in textile products {{is one of}} the major sources of customer dissatisfaction and leads to fading or bleeding of textile colour by various type of external influences like water, perspiration, rubbing etc., during textile manufacturing and in daily use. Moreover, poor {{colour fastness}} may also prove hazardous due to the bleeding and subsequent penetration of the dye molecules and metal ions into the human skin. This article has tried to find a solution to mitigate the poor colour <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> perspiration particularly for dark shade on silk fabrics. This paper shows a comparative analysis of different type of fastness properties of natural silk fabrics and their strength loss while dyeing with reactive and metal complex dyes following different national and international standards like ISO, ASTM standards etc. In this study, it has been revealed that colour <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> perspiration of reactive dyed silk fabric against all types of fibres is comparatively better than that of metal complex dyed silk fabric. Percentage of strength loss is not affecting the subsequent processes of weaving preparatory and weavability of dyed silk yarn.

The staining of the cotton cloths was assessed to be 4 – 5 for both GS- 04 and GS- 06 under wet and dry conditions.
