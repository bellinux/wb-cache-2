40|$|The {{focal point}} of a high-numerical-aperture (NA) {{ultrasonic}} transducer {{can be used as}} a virtual <b>point</b> <b>detector.</b> This virtual <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> detects omnidirectionally over a wide acceptance angle. It also combines a large active transducer surface and a small effective virtual detector size. Thus the sensitivity is high compared with that of a real <b>point</b> <b>detector,</b> and the aperture effect is small compared with that of a finite size transducer. We present two kinds of high-NA-based virtual <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> and their successful application in photoacoustic tomography.

40|$|A design {{concept for}} the {{receiver}} {{portion of a}} proposed free-space optical-communication terminal calls for integration of its communication and <b>pointing</b> <b>detectors.</b> As explained below, this would entail a departure from prior designs, in which <b>pointing</b> and communication <b>detectors</b> have been separate. As used here, communication detector denotes a single high-speed photodetector used for reception of a laser beam that has been modulated to convey information, while <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> denotes an array of photodetectors (typically, a quad-cell detector or a charge-coupled device) used in sensing the pointing error (the error in the aim of a receiver telescope, relative to the laser-beam axis). The <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> of this or any free-space optical-communication receiver is necessary for proper acquisition and tracking of the received laser beam. The suitably processed output of the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> is fed back to a fine-steering mirror to reduce any pointing error and thereby maintain optimum reception. Heretofore, it has been common practice to pass the incoming laser beam through a beam splitter that sends about 10 percent of the beam power to a <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> and the rest to a separate communication detector, as illustrated in {{the upper part of}} the figure. One disadvantage of this is that because only 10 percent of the received signal power is available for use by the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector,</b> the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> is lower than it otherwise would be. The performance of the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> is correspondingly limited. Another disadvantage is that the alignment between the communication and <b>pointing</b> <b>detectors</b> is critical and must be ensured by means of a calibration procedure. According to the proposal, there would be no beam splitter. The communication and <b>pointing</b> <b>detectors</b> would be positioned coaxially in the same focal plane, as shown in the lower part of the figure: the communication detector would occupy the central part of the focal plane, while the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> would occupy the surrounding area. This arrangement would inherently ensure the proper alignment of the detectors with each other...|$|R

50|$|An open path {{detector}} usually {{costs more}} than a single <b>point</b> <b>detector,</b> so there is little incentive for applications that play to a <b>point</b> <b>detector's</b> strengths: where the <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> can be placed at the known location of the highest gas concentration, and a relatively slow response is acceptable. The open path detector excels in outdoor situations where, even if the likely source of the gas release is known, the evolution of the developing cloud or plume is unpredictable. Gas will almost certainly enter an extended linear beam before finding its way to any single chosen <b>point.</b> Also, <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> in exposed outdoor locations require weather shields to be fitted, increasing the response time significantly. Open path detectors can also show a cost advantage in any application where a row of <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> would be required to achieve the same coverage, for instance monitoring along a pipeline, or around the perimeter of a plant. Not only will one detector replace several, but the costs of installation, maintenance, cabling etc. are likely to be lower.|$|R

This paper formalizes the notion of saliency and evaluates three state-of-the-art interest <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> with respect to their capability of selecting salient image features in two recognition settings. ...|$|R

30|$|The aspect {{models that}} we present {{in this paper}} allow to {{classify}} image regions into two classes, based on an estimated patch class likelihood {{taking advantage of the}} availability of a patch histogram. The method can be applied to image collection of regions defined randomly, by a regular grid (with or without overlap), or obtained with an interest point/region detector. Depending on what the considered image regions are, the resulting spatial distribution of class labels can produce local image classification with no label overlap (e.g., when using grid patches) [1, 3, 27], or a density-based image patch classification (when using interest <b>point</b> <b>detectors)</b> [2, 6]. In the later case, as shown on Figure 1, the classification of patches obtained by an interest <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> produces a sparse regional image classification. However, one advantage of using an interest <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> is that the identification of stable regions may exhibit better correspondence across the images than an arbitrary grid image division.

Provision of travel time distribution information, including both mean and variance, {{can be very}} useful for travelers to make reliable path choice decisions to ensure higher probability of on-time arrival.

40|$|Abstract. The {{interesting}} point is important features in images, which is frequently used for image registration, scene analysis, object tracking. Many algorithms for detecting the {{interesting point}}s {{have been developed}} up to now. Among them, the Harris interesting <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> is proved most stable against rotation and noise, while it is also very sensitive to scale change. In order to solve this problem, a new multi-scale Harris interesting point detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm consists of two main stages. In stage one, we build a multi-scale representation for Harris measure and find candidate interesting points at each scale level. In stage two, a novel measure is defined to measure the stability of each point. Based on the measure, the final interesting point is selected from candidates. The experiments on both optical and sar data sets have shown that, compared with stand Harris interesting <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> and some other multi-scale interesting <b>point</b> <b>detectors,</b> our algorithm is more robust...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of matching and object recognition methods based on interest points depends {{on both the}} properties of the underlying interest points and the associated image descriptors. This paper demonstrates the advantages of using generalized scale-space interest <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> when computing image descriptors for image-based matching. These generalized scale-space interest points are based on linking of image features over scale and scale selection by weighted averaging along feature trajectories over scale and allow for a higher ratio of correct matches and a lower ratio of false matches compared to previously known interest <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> within the same class. Specifically, it is shown how a significant increase in matching performance can be obtained in relation to the underlying interest <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> in the SIFT and the SURF operators.
