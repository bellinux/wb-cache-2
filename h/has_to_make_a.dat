5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice, in direction 0 the next time it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

In truth she has been going to Granny's at 7:15 every morning to see David (Dallas) getting coffee for himself and Kathryn (Griffith). Emma, who can always spot a lie, follows Mary Margaret to call out her {{stalking}} behavior and suggests she stop seeing him. Mary Margaret buys some chocolate to drown her woes and runs right into Kathryn, who is picking up a pregnancy test. Regina notices this, and warns Mary Margaret to stay away from David, and it was their personal life.|$|E

25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} is {{a psychological}} process thought to underlie {{a number of}} cognitive biases and perceptual illusions. It occurs when an individual <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute. This substitution is thought of as {{taking place in the}} automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place. This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show regression toward the mean.|$|E

Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> phone call.

He {{subsequently}} gets drunk and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> run for the bathroom, knocking over everyone {{between him and the}} bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively-choreographed version of the song [...] "Shipoopi" [...] after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who apparently have no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them.|$|E

500|$|Kindler wrote both {{parts of}} [...] "Sanctuary for All", as well [...] "Fata Morgana", [...] "Kush", [...] "The Five", [...] "Requiem", [...] "Instinct", {{and the second}} part of [...] "Revelations". He penned his scripts quickly, with [...] "Kush" [...] being written in three and a half days. Wood contributed to the story of [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] by {{bringing}} up the idea of incorporating the Morrígan from Irish mythology, which would start giving the season an ancient and mythological feel. [...] "Kush" [...] introduces a series of episodes involving the working relationship between Will and Magnus. [...] "The Five" [...] became {{a significant part of the}} series mythology, revealing the Five, which Magnus is a part of, how Magnus got her longevity, and that Henry Foss is actually part werewolf. Tapping believed that introducing the Five was a [...] "cool concept". Kindler introduced vampires in the episode, and felt it would be best to introduce them as a dead species. He also felt that including real-life historic figures such as Tesla was a [...] "very ballsy thing". In [...] "Requiem", Kindler wanted a scenario in which Will <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difficult decision to deal with Magnus when she becomes the threat of the episode. Though Kindler at first believed it was not a good episode, it ended up as a highlight of the season according to the producers. In writing [...] "Instinct", Kindler, inspired by Cloverfield, wanted to show the audience the protagonists hunting an abnormal in real-time, where it does not always go according to plan.|$|E
500|$|Spears was {{credited}} with leading the revival of teen pop. The Daily Yomiuri reported that [...] "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scene." [...] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, [...] "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, [...] "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a [...] "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." [...] Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album [...] "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." [...] In 2010, the album {{was included in the}} book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

Art director Andy Fackrell warmly welcomed the technique, commenting: [...] "When {{you can get it}} all in one take, it becomes more natural.
