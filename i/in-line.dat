5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, {{they found that the}} <b>in-line</b> inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld <b>in-line</b> inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E
5|$|According to Teeuw, {{after the}} {{publication}} of Atheis Mihardja immediately became famous. Maier notes that the fame and warm reception to which Atheis was released was influenced not only by the novel's strengths, but also by Mihardja's personality and stature. These qualities were <b>in-line</b> with the nascent government's need to use literature, as the most developed of the new national culture, for nation-building; in 1969, Atheis received a literary award from the government of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, <b>in-line</b> aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|The Elmer S. Dailey was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Claire B. Follette when it was built by William H. Follette in 1915 at Tonawanda, New York. In 1928, the ship was rebuilt by Brown Drydock on Staten Island and acquired the name Elmer S. Dailey. Brown Drydock installed two Fairbanks-Morse <b>in-line</b> six-cylinder diesel engines and added the pilothouse and stack. At an unspecified later date, one engine was removed and a direct-drive engine, rated at 180 or 210 horsepower, operated on compressed air. In its final configuration, the vessel was manned by a three-man crew.|$|E
5|$|The RLM {{was still}} not {{interested}} in the Ju 87 and was not impressed that it relied on a British engine. In late 1935, Junkers suggested fitting a DB 600 <b>in-line</b> engine, with the final variant to be equipped with the Jumo 210. This was accepted by the RLM as an interim solution. The reworking of the design began on 1 January 1936. The test flight could not be carried out for over two months {{due to a lack of}} adequate aircraft. The 24 January crash had already destroyed one machine.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct <b>in-line</b> breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|Celski {{was born}} in Monterey, California where his father Robert Celski was serving in the U.S. Army. He was raised in Federal Way, Washington. His father, Robert, is of Polish descent and his mother, Sue, is of Filipino descent. Celski has two older brothers, Chris and David; David serves as Captain in the United States Army, and Chris is a {{salesperson}} at Nordstrom. Celski attended Lakewood High School in Lakewood, California as well as Todd Beamer High School in Federal Way, Washington, graduating from Lakewood with high honors in the Merit Scholars Program. Before switching to speed skating after seeing the 2002 Winter Olympics, Celski was a national champion <b>in-line</b> skater. He missed the minimum age requirement for the 2006 Winter Olympics by 17days.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} built between 1972 and 1975, {{after years of}} planning and engineering. The first interchange, at Wellington Street, was opened 25 years later in 2001. In late 2013, a second interchange was completed at Laird Road. The Government of Ontario {{has announced plans to}} build a new Highway7 freeway bypass joining the current northern terminus of the Hanlon Expressway to the Conestoga Parkway in Kitchener; <b>in-line</b> with this work, the Hanlon Expressway will be upgraded to 400-series standards. Long-term plans call for a potential extension south of Highway401 to meet Highway6 south of Freelton.|$|E
5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an <b>in-line</b> or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E

25|$|As {{stated in}} Telcordia {{industry}} requirements document , {{there are two}} principal configurations for closures: butt closures and <b>in-line</b> closures. Butt closures permit cables to enter the closure from one end only. This design may also {{be referred to as}} a dome closure. These closures {{can be used in a}} variety of applications, including branch splicing. <b>In-line</b> closures provide for the entry of cables at both ends of the closure. They can be used in a variety of applications, including branch splicing and cable access. <b>In-line</b> closures can also be used in a butt configuration by restricting cable access to one end of the closure.|$|E
