2500|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{the plate}} is inserted between the perpendicular polarizers {{at an angle}} of 45 degrees. This allows two different procedures {{to be carried out}} to investigate the mineral under the crosshairs of the microscope. More simply, in ordinary cross polarized light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical indicatrix relative to crystal elongation – that is, whether the mineral is [...] "length slow" [...] or [...] "length fast" [...] – based on whether the visible <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. A slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with interference figure techniques to allow measurement of the optic angle of the mineral. The optic angle (often notated as [...] "2V") can both be diagnostic of mineral type, as well as in some cases revealing information about the variation of chemical composition within a single mineral type.|$|E

5000|$|It has a Hermann-Mauguin {{notation}} of mm2 and {{the respective}} space group is Cmc21. In nature Nyerereite is naturally twinned and is pseudohexagonal with triad twinning; meaning {{that this is}} a six sided crystal that apparently has a hexagonal shape but is not in the hexagonal system. Triad twinning is the intergrowth of three orthorhombic crystals that turn at their center and form hexagonally shaped crystals. Nyerereite is biaxial negative, and has a 2v of 29 degrees. It shows a center acute bisectrix and a birefringence of approximately 0.023.

50|$|These {{extremely}} thin {{cuts are}} important for use with transmission electron microscope (TEM) and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM), and are sometimes also important for light-optical microscopy. The typical thickness of these cuts is between 40 and 100 nm for transmission electron microscopy and often between 30 and 50 nm for SBFSEM. Thicker sections up to 500 nm thick are also taken for specialized TEM applications or for light-microscopy survey sections to select an area for the final thin sections. Diamond knives (preferably) and glass knives are used with ultramicrotomes. To collect the sections, they are floated {{on top of a}} liquid as they are cut and are carefully picked up onto grids suitable for TEM specimen viewing.

40|$|Abstract. The study {{describes}} the interference color of anodic TiO 2 nanotube arrays on titanium foil. TiO 2 nanotube arrays are prepared by oxidizing titanium foil {{in an aqueous}} electrolyte solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF, 0. 5 wt. %). The morphologies of the oxide film are characterized by FESEM. The empirical color properties are obtained using the L*a*b * system. The different <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> of oxidized Ti samples are obtained depending on the anodization time. The anodization time clearly indicates a strong effect on the reflectance at the visible wavelength region, thus confirming the observed color differences. Consequently, the <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> can be controlled by the anodization time. By observing the coloration of Ti during the anodization, the <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> can be utilized to identify the thickness of oxide layer {{and the formation of}} nanotubes on Ti sheet...|$|E
