5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the <b>drift</b> <b>angle,</b> either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The <b>drift</b> <b>angle</b> was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction.

In {{order to assess}} effects of ground motion characteristics on wooden house damages, a method using of equivalent-performance response spectrum[1] {{is applied to the}} principal area of damaged wooden houses (PADH) in Mihara city during the 2001 Geiyo earthquake.

50|$|The third {{method of}} {{determining}} the wind is {{used in conjunction with}} the wind gauge bar. The aircraft is flown on three different headings, typically 120 degrees apart, and the time for the aircraft to travel a certain distance was measured with the timing beads. The bearing plate was rotated to match the compass heading of each leg, and the cursor was moved along the bar to draw a line on the bearing plate along that direction. After three such measurements a small triangle was formed. The aircraft then turned onto the bomb line. Using the <b>drift</b> <b>angle</b> measured from the auxiliary drift bar, the compass was rotated to that <b>drift</b> <b>angle,</b> and the cursor moved so it lay above the center of the triangle. This indicated the direction and speed of the wind.|$|E

50|$|To {{accomplish}} this, the SABS multiplied {{the error}} angle by four times before {{sending it to}} the pilot's display. By chasing the dial, the pilot automatically overcorrected the heading, bringing the aircraft back towards the proper approach.
