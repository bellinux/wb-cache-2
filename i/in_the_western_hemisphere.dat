5|$|The Armada was {{constantly}} being modernized {{with the latest}} developments in naval warfare.

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held at the time of a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period.

5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents {{argue that the}} zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Aletta was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Aletta developed from an area of disturbed weather located south-southwest of the Mexican port of Acapulco, Guerrero. It gradually gained organized convection and was classified as a tropical depression early on May27, and became a tropical storm later that morning, the first of 2006 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Hemisphere.</b> Aletta strengthened to a tropical storm with 45mph (75km/h) sustained winds, while moving towards the Guerrero coast in southwestern Mexico. The storm became stationary, though it later turned {{to the west and}} weakened on May29. Aletta continued to weaken until it dissipated on May31. The storm dropped moderate rainfall along the Mexican coast, and generated winds that downed trees and caused minor damage.|$|E
5|$|When the Crypto Jews {{arrived on}} the island of Puerto Rico, they were hoping to avoid {{religious}} scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet lives. They practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic. Still, since Jews weren't permitted to worship, the Crypto Jews eventually intermarried with Catholics and therefore, Puerto Rico virtually had no Jewish history of which to speak.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Allen was a {{rare and}} {{extremely}} powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that struck the Caribbean, eastern and northern Mexico, and southern Texas in August 1980.

It was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on three separate occasions, and spent more time as a Category5 than all but two other Atlantic hurricanes. Allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190mph (305km/h), thus making it the strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.
