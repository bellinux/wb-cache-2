FEM {{simulations}} of squashing and bending process of large diameter elbow {{was applied to}} analyze the influence of squashing velocities, {{one of the key}} process parameters, on the deformation of the tube. In this study the squashing distance of <b>first</b> <b>step</b> is 300 <b>mm</b> after several simulation attempts, corresponding to different squashing speeds and different bending velocities of second step. The simulation results of different velocities are compared and discussed. In the end the final velocities of the two steps are given...|$|R
40|$|Snow {{transport}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominant processes influencing the snow cover accumulation and ablation in high alpine mountain environments. Hence, the spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover is significantly modified with respective consequences on the total amount of water in the snow pack, on the temporal dynamics of the runoff and on the energy balance of the surface. For the presented study we used the snow transport model SnowTran- 3 D in combination with MM 5 (Penn State University – National Center for Atmospheric Research MM 5 model) generated wind fields. In a <b>first</b> <b>step</b> the <b>MM</b> 5 wind fields were downscaled by using a semi-empirical approach which accounts for the elevation difference of model and real topography, as well as aspect, inclination and vegetation. The target resolution of 30 m corresponds to the resolution of the best available DEM and land cover map. For the numerical modelling, data of six automatic meteorological stations were used, comprising the winter season (September–August) of 2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05. In addition we had automatic snow depth measurements and periodic manual measurements of snow courses available for the validation of the results. In this paper we describe the downscaling of the wind fields and discuss the results of the snow transport simulations with respect to the measurements and remotely sensed data...|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{dark clouds}} are massive, dense clouds seen in {{extinction}} against the IR Galactic background. Many {{of these objects}} appear {{to be on the}} verge of star and star cluster formation. Our aim is to understand the physical properties of IRDCs in very early evolutionary phases. We selected the filamentary IRDC G 351. 77 - 0. 51, which is remarkably IR quiet at 8 μm. As a <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> we observed <b>mm</b> dust continuum emission and rotational lines of moderate and dense gas tracers to characterise different condensations along the IRDC and study the velocity field of the filament. Our initial study confirms coherent velocity distribution along the infrared dark cloud ruling out any coincidental projection effects. Excellent correlation between MIR extinction, mm continuum emission and gas distribution is found. Large-scale turbulence and line profiles throughout the filament is indicative of a shock in this cloud. Excellent correlation between line width, and MIR brightness indicates turbulence driven by local star formation. Comment: accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|International audiencethe {{modelling}} of mass movements susceptibility (MMS) {{is essential}} for land-use planning and decision-making especially in the mountainous areas of Morocco. The main objective {{of this study is}} to create an MMS map for the Province of Chefchaouen in the north-western part of the Moroccan Kingdom using an index based approach (heuristic model). As a <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> mass movements (<b>MM)</b> features are identified in the study area by the interpretation of high-resolution remote-sensing data and from field investigations. Lithology, fault density, slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, stream density, land use, rainfall, and earthquakes equal-depths are identified as the main parameters controlling the occurrence of MM. Then, each parameter map is classified into a number of significant classes based on their relative influence for MM genesis. Rating values are assigned for each class, representing their influence on slope instability. The weights are extracted from real statistical data to reduce the subjectivity of the method. Finally, ROC (receiver operator characteristic) curves are drawn, and the areas below the curve (AUC) are measured to evaluate the degree of the model fit, and identify the best MMS map. This type of map can be valuable for general land-use planning, especially in Mediterranean mountainous areas...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to {{construct}} locally robust semiparametric GMM estimators, meaning equivalently moment conditions have zero derivative {{with respect to}} the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> and the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> does not affect the asymptotic variance. They are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustment term for <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimation. Locally robust estimators have several advantages. They are vital for valid inference with machine learning in the <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> see Belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to the specification of the <b>first</b> <b>step.</b> They are doubly robust for affine moment functions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one <b>first</b> <b>step</b> component is incorrect. Locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that is flatter as a function of <b>first</b> <b>step</b> smoothing leading to improved small sample properties. Series <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimators confer local robustness on any moment conditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, {{in the direction of the}} series approximation. Many new locally and doubly robust estimators are given here, including for economic structural models. We give simple asymptotic theory for estimators that use cross-fitting in the <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> including machine learning. Comment: 42 page...|$|R

40|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> Project was {{developed}} by the Education Department of Western Australia to facilitate literacy learning of students who were perceived to be 2 ̆ 2 at risk 2 ̆ 2. The project has resulted in state-wide professional development for teachers, and the subsequent marketing of the program interstate and overseas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present an insight into the various ways that teachers use <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> in their classrooms and to discover where different teachers stand within the theoretical framework of language learning, and what orientation and experiences lead them to make the planning, teaching and evaluation choices they make. The study examined the literacy teaching practices of teachers in four classrooms in Perth metropolitan schools. In two of these classrooms, two teachers taught together in team-teaching situations. The teachers reflected a diversity of professional development experiences related to <b>First</b> <b>Steps.</b> One teacher had received <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> professional development in a Core School, which was supported by four Collaborative Teachers. Another teacher had learned about <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> as part of her teacher education program at University. The other teachers in the study had received their professional development through Central or District Office, and two of these had received further training as <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> Focus Teachers. Data was collected through participant-observation and interviews. Using a form of educational criticism (Eisner, 1985), a case-study was constructed for each classroom and a cross-case analysis was performed to identify patterns of shared or conflicting understandings and the ways in which these understandings influenced language learning events. All the teachers in the study used a variety of <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> teaching strategies, and all teachers, to varying extents, used the <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> developmental continua. Teachers who appeared to have a deeper understanding of the philosophies of literacy development underpinning <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> were more able to manipulate <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> resources and teaching strategies to suit to needs of their own particular teaching situation. While all teachers made planning decisions on the basis of the assessment of their students 2 ̆ 7 progress, this process 2 ̆ 7 most often happened in teachers 2 ̆ 7 heads, rather then being recorded in any documents. Teachers who demonstrated a deep understanding of <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> theoretical principles appeared to have internalised the <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> developmental indicators as part of their tacit monitoring system. Other teachers seemed to have their own sets of indicators, which they translated to 2 ̆ 2 <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> language 2 ̆ 2 when the time came to record students 2 ̆ 7 progress on the developmental continua. The study demonstrates that, while all case-study teachers used a variety of <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> practices in their classrooms, both for teaching and assessing students 2 ̆ 7 learning, the extent to which teachers used and adapted <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b> materials was influenced not only by their professional development experiences, but also by their own life histories and the context of their teaching situations, and the ways in which these factors impacted on their understandings about the nature of literacy development...|$|R
