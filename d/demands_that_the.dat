5|$|Members of the Art Institute Board met the {{day after}} the {{incident}} and agreed not to display Mirth & Girth any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers. After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Washington, Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director Walter Skinner and the Smoking Man for his actions. Mulder claims he still had enough {{evidence}} with the days missed to prosecute {{the subject of his}} assigned wiretap, and that his own phone calls were being monitored. Skinner then <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the tape reel, Mulder finds it blank due to a power surge during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.|$|E
5|$|Weber listed several {{preconditions}} for {{the emergence}} of the bureaucracy: The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy– these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new system treat everybody equally.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{a seminal}} case in {{administrative}} law {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that all power has legal limits {{and the rule of}} law <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister of Home Affairs, which had been an authority for the application of a subjective test until it was overruled by Chng Suan Tze.|$|E

5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E
5|$|Lord Walder Frey {{receives}} {{word that}} Riverrun has been retaken by Brynden Tully, {{commonly known as}} the Blackfish, Catelyn Stark's uncle and a staunchly loyal officer in Robb Stark's army. Walder chastises his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers, who had been ordered to hold the castle. They defend their loss, as several Riverlords, including House Mallister and House Blackwood, have risen in rebellion against the Freys, and the Brotherhood Without Banners are raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated by not being able to hold a single castle. He orders his men to bring in Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, and declares that they will use him to retake Riverrun.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Magic Mirror {{informs the}} Queen that Snow White {{is now the}} fairest in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E

5|$|Salim {{rebels and}} amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is {{sentence}}d to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs {{to have a few}} hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make {{the portion of the}} relay in Taiwan appear {{to be part of the}} torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese <b>demands</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E
