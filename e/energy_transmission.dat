With the knowledge of a routing tree from all sensors to a destination node, we present a digital <b>transmission</b> <b>energy</b> planning algorithm {{as well as an}} analog <b>transmission</b> <b>energy</b> planning algorithm for progressive estimation in multihop sensor networks. Unlike many iterative consensus-type algorithms, the proposed progressive estimation algorithms along with their <b>transmission</b> <b>energy</b> planning further reduce the network <b>transmission</b> <b>energy</b> while guaranteeing any pre-specified estimation performance at the destination node within a finite time.

25|$|In Transrapid vehicle {{versions}} TR08 and earlier, when travelling {{at speeds}} below , the vehicle levitation system and all on-board vehicle electronics were supplied with power through physical {{connections to the}} track guideway. At vehicle speeds above , all on-board power was supplied by recovered harmonic oscillation of the magnetic fields created from the track’s linear stator. (Since these oscillations are parasitic, they cannot be used for vehicle propulsion). A new <b>energy</b> <b>transmission</b> system, version TR09, has since been developed for Transrapid, in which maglev vehicles now require no physical contact with the track guideway for their on-board power needs, regardless of the maglev vehicle speed. This feature helps to reduce on-going maintenance and operational costs.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{transfer}} of energy through directed radio frequency waves {{has the potential}} to realize perennially operating sensor nodes by replenishing the energy contained in the limited on-board battery. However, the high power energy transfer from energy transmitters (ETs) interferes with data communication, limiting the coexistence of these functions. This paper provides the first experimental study to quantify the rate of charging, packet loss due to interference, and suitable ranges for charging and data communication of the ETs. It also explores how the placement and relative distances of multiple ETs affect the charging process, demonstrating constructive and destructive energy aggregation at the sensor nodes. Finally, we investigate the impact of the separation in frequency between data and <b>energy</b> <b>transmissions,</b> as well as among multiple concurrent <b>energy</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Our results aim at providing insights on radio frequency-based energy harvesting wireless sensor networks for enhanced protocol design and network planning...|$|R

2500|$|The {{president}} of the European Council Donald Tusk has said that Nord Stream 2 {{is not in the}} EU's interests. [...] Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have questioned the different treatment of Nord Stream II and South Stream projects. [...] The project is considered to violate the long-term declared strategy of the EU to diversify its gas supplies. [...] A letter, signed by the leaders of nine EU countries, has been sent to the EC in March 2016, warning that the Nord Stream 2 project contradicts the European energy policy requirements that suppliers to the EU should not control the <b>energy</b> <b>transmission</b> assets, and that access to the energy infrastructure must be secured for non-consortium companies. A letter by American lawmakers John McCain and Marco Rubio to the EU also criticized the project in July 2016. Isabelle Kocher, chief executive officer of Engie, criticised American sanctions targetting the projects, and said they were an attempt to promote American gas in Europe. Although construction has started on Nord Stream 2, the government of Denmark wants to have its foreign ministry prevent it being routed through Danish waters, and a bill is proposed to go through Parliament in October 2017, giving the foreign ministry the ability to do this on foreign policy grounds. Supporters of the pipeline, including Germany, believe that unlawful deferrence has been made to US wishes of the project not proceeding.|$|E
