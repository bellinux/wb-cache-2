50|$|The postwar {{structure}} {{was built to}} replace a dilapidated military installation erected on a dolphin {{as part of the}} Port Phillip bay defence system shortly before 1942. This earlier structure is often said to have supported an optical mount, or magic eye which transmitted two piezo <b>electronic</b> <b>beams</b> across the Rip to a large mirror, and then to two reflectors, respectively Station P, and Station S, at the heads of Point Lonsdale. Any break in transmission in such a system was designed to set off an alarm to signal the possible presence of enemy vessels. The mechanism apparently did not function as expected, and the equipment was removed two years later, in 1944. Some doubts, however, have been expressed regarding the existence of this interception system: the site certainly was equipped in wartime with underwater indicator loops to detect submarines.After it was abandoned, the dilapidated remains were used as a perch for both recreational fishing and as an anchorage. It rested on a circular concrete caisson base, roughly 7 metres in diameter, raised on a sandy shoal some 6 metres below the waterline.|$|R

It is operating in High Frequency waves (6 to 28 MHz) that bounce on the ionosphere,reaching areas far beyond the horizon. As an early warning radar system, its primary purpose was the detectionof aircraft at long ranges from 700 to 3 000 km. Whereas over-the-horizon (OTH) radars are usually bistatic andrequire huge linear antenna networks to beam the signals, the special surface distribution of Nostradamus makes itpossible to control the <b>electronic</b> <b>beams</b> both in azimuth and elevation. This original conception of the system allowsits use in many scientific fields. In the past years, research have been carried out on the ionosphere, on oceanography and on seismology. Morerecently, the radar has been used at trans-ionospheric frequencies to do radar astronomy by detecting meteoritesand the Moon, and radio astronomy by observing Jovian and Solar radio emissions. Few large instruments operateat decameter wave mainly because of man made radio frequency interference and because of the poor signal tonoise ratio of cosmic sources. However, interest for this frequency domain have recently been making something ofa comeback, as new giant telescopes are being built. After a quick presentation of the OTH radar, we present somespace observations that have been made. These radio observations are compared to data coming from a decameterradio telescope, the Nancay Decameter Array located in France. Finally, we will discuss about possible other experimentsthat could be carried out in the future...|$|R

The various techniques of generating offset beams, sequential lobing, conical scan, and single channel monopulse, {{have proven to be}} acceptable, cost effective means of autotracking. These techniques and a new, generalized <b>electronic</b> scanned <b>beam</b> configuration will be discussed with their inherent advantages and disadvantages for various mission applications.

The ESCAN tracking antenna concept will be shown to have superior side lobe characteristics to previous <b>electronic</b> scanned <b>beam</b> approaches due to its capability to control side lobes in both the scanned, offset beam plane and the orthogonal plane. ESCAN offers improved capability in reducing crosstalk between the two orthogonal tracking channels, offset beam control vs frequency, and wider frequency bandwidth.

Since ESCAN is an electronic scanning technique the rate of scan can be controlled at any fixed rate or for variable rates (including random variations in rate) within the capabilities of solid state switches.

In this technique, cheaper pre-pregs instead of the more expensive impregnated paper layers in the production of fiber boards is applied.

Because the surface of Trespa Plate has a dense molecular coating, it is virtually impervious to weather (temperature, UV radiation and humidity). Also, any contamination, such as graffiti, can be removed quite easily.
