He made over two dozen rolls for Ampico, mostly of a nonmodernist repertoire; the composers he performed most often were Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Two rolls contained his own compositions: Berceuse (Cradle Song) (c. 1920–21) and Prélude tragique (1924). Ornstein never recorded, in any format, even a single example of his futurist pieces which had brought him fame.|$|E

40|$|Antitrust {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> have anticompetitive, or at best neutral effects, if no efficiencies are generated. In contrast, this paper shows that <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> can have procompetitive effects, provided buyers are imperfect downstream competitors and contract breach is feasible. In that case an efficient entrant is not necessarily foreclosed through <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracting</b> but induces buyers to breach. Because breaching buyers have to pay expectation damages to the incumbent, the downstream profits they obtain when breaching must be large enough. Therefore, the entrant needs to set a lower wholesale price than absent <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracting,</b> leading to lower final consumer prices and higher welfare. ...|$|R

After Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to James at Lockdown, James agreed to give her a rematch on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title, Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne.

40|$|<b>Exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} topics in the economic analysis of antitrust. Yet, very few empirical papers analyze the determinants and the consequences of <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts.</b> In this paper, I study <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> between hamburger restau-rants and Israeli shopping malls, in which mall owners commit to prohibiting additional hamburger restaurants from entering their malls. I investigate the determinants of these <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> and examine how such contracts affect the number of hamburger restau-rants and their sales. I show that <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> are less likely to be adopted in larger malls, in malls that face more competition from other malls, and in malls that opened before 1993, when McDonald’s and Burger King entered the Israeli market. I then use the mall’s opening year- before or after 1993 - as an instrumental variable to estimate a negative effect of <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> on the number of restaurants and on total mall ham-burger sales. My findings are generally consistent with anti-competitive vertical foreclosure models. ∗This paper is a revised chapter of my PhD dissertation.

In contrast with the previous literature, <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> are shown to generate higher profits for manufacturers and retailers selling highly differentiated products, who thus have an incentive to insist on <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracting.</b> However, if the products are close substitutes no exclusivity will emerge in equilibrium.

We show that <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> intensify the competition among the firms, increasing consumer surplus, improving efficiency, and reducing profits. Firms would gain if these contracts were prohibited, but are caught in a prisoner’s dilemma if they are permitted. In this latter case, allowing firms to offer also market-share discounts unambiguously weakens competition, reducing efficiency and harming consumers. However, starting from a situation where <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> are prohibited, the effect of market-share discounts (which include <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> as a limiting case) is ambiguous. common agency; exclusionary contracts; market share discounts; price competition...|$|R

He ran several events in the #38 late in 2005, but failed to produce results. In 2006, he was scheduled to run the entire Busch Series schedule in the #38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award. However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an <b>exclusive</b> <b>contract</b> with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team.

Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year <b>exclusive</b> <b>contract</b> with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story.

5|$|Aigler {{also played}} an {{important}} role in securing the Big Ten's long-term contract with the Rose Bowl. Prior to the 1947 season, the visiting spot in the Rose Bowl was open to all conferences, and the Big Ten champion only appeared in the Rose Bowl on rare occasions. In November 1946, Aigler was appointed to a five-person steering committee assigned to negotiate an <b>exclusive</b> <b>contract</b> with the Rose Bowl. The Big Ten approved the exclusive arrangement by a vote of 7 to 2, with Illinois and Minnesota the only opponents. The relationship was negotiated at meetings between Aigler and the Big Ten steering committee and the Pacific Coast Conference held in Berkeley, California in November 1946. Aigler traveled to California again in May 1947 with William Reed to negotiate administrative details of the Rose Bowl arrangement with Pacific Coast Conference representative William C. Ackerman. The University of Michigan was the first Big Ten participant in the new Rose Bowl arrangement, defeating the USC Trojans 490 in the game held on January 1, 1948.|$|E

This is the case because when commitment to <b>exclusive</b> <b>contracts</b> is not assumed, an increase in current borrowing levels deteriorates future borrowing conditions. This does not occur when commitment is assumed. This finding stands in sharp contrast with the results in previous work that study environment where current borrowing does not affect future borrowing opportunities.
