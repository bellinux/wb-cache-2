60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{others and}} shook hands with Shaggy and Tik-Tok.|$|E
60|$|When {{the door}} had closed behind her, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window and looked out, {{drumming}} absently with his knuckles on the pane.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Asaph was unusually brisk and active; and very soon after breakfast <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village tavern to see Mr. Rooper.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> White Fang {{and began}} {{talking to him}} gently and soothingly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{his little}} desk, {{sat down and}} drew a check book from his pocket.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{where the}} mate stood, {{close to the}} wheelhouse, giving {{directions}} to the pilot of the Rainbow.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Jacob Spraggins's plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secretary's {{desk and}} showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger.|$|E
60|$|Dick did {{not make}} any answer to this remark. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, {{to see that it}} was closed, then he {{suddenly}} wheeled to confront his brothers.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{table that}} John Clayton had built {{so many years}} before {{to serve as a}} desk, and on it he saw two notes {{addressed}} to Tarzan of the Apes.|$|E
60|$|I didn't like this, and I don't think Rectus did, either. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the}} windows, {{and looked}} out into the street.|$|R
60|$|A day or {{two before}} starting, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> say goodbye to Mrs. Shrewsbury. He stopped as he passed the smithy and, seeing Jacob Priestley at work alone, he went in.|$|R
6000|$|Hutchinson {{laughed as}} he got up on his feet. It was a nervous, {{apprehensive}} laugh. It was a case where it was more awkward to win than lose. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his partner, who whirled upon him fiercely:- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect {{all that}} we want is right here," [...] he said. And {{at the sight of}} the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled. Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} suggestion. What a funny formal little note we should think it now! It was not funny to Stephen--then. He read it, and {{he read it}} again, and finally <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, still holding it in his hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window. 'I {{must give}} her time!' he thought; then seized by unreasoning terror at this silence, spun round, and caught {{her by the}} arms. Rozsi held back from him, swayed forward and buried her face on his breast....|$|E
50|$|Next, Bugs {{switches}} Rocky's cigarette with a dynamite stick. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Mugsy and imitates Rocky's voice {{asking for}} a light. Mugsy gladly does and Rocky is blown up. Rocky snaps, ties Mugsy up and shuts him in a corridor.|$|R
60|$|During the {{remainder}} of the day Vane was busy on board the sloop, but in the evening <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Horsfield's house with Mrs. Nairn and found Jessy and her brother at home. Horsfield presently took Vane to his smoking-room.|$|R
60|$|Joe was not quick-witted, but on {{the battlefields}} of France he had learned prompt {{obedience}} to orders. Josie, as a government agent, was now his commander, so he merely nodded <b>to</b> her as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> unlock the outer door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is my poor opinion {{really worth}} {{anything}} to you?" [...] he said, and rising <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girl {{and touched her}} hand, which made her start a little. [...] "I wish to see your eyes--won't you look at me?" [...] He spoke very gently.|$|E
60|$|Braithwaite's {{expression}} changed slightly. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dory {{and helped}} Mary Stella {{out of it}} while Benjamin made the painter fast. When the latter turned, Mary Stella was walking across the rocks with her cousin. Benjamin's blue eyes darkened, and he strode moodily over to the boats.|$|E
60|$|Ernest {{smiled at}} her volubility, and {{followed}} her quickly into the big bare billiard-room. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire and began to warm himself, while Hilda took down a cue and made stray shots in extraordinary angles at impossible cannons, all the time, as she went on talking to him. 'Was it very cold on the way down?' she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "’Speak kind to ’im, sir,’ ses the fireman. ’I’ll {{have a try}} if you don’t mind.’ He {{cleared his}} throat first, an’ then <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Joe and {{puts his hand on}} his {{shoulder}} an’ ses very soft an’ pitiful like: ...|$|R
60|$|Alured {{was well}} again, but inert and crushed, and heartless about doing anything, except that <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Spinney Lawn, and brought home Trevor's dog, {{to which he}} gave himself up all day, and insisted on having it in his room at night.|$|R
60|$|But Farmer Brown's boy didn't do {{anything}} of the kind. No, Sir, he didn't. Instead he shouted to Bowser and called him away. Bowser didn't want to come, but he long ago learned to obey, and very slowly <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where his master was sitting.|$|R
60|$|Just then Aunt Hester {{brought in}} the map, {{handling}} it like a baby with eruptions. With the assistance of Euphemia it was laid on the piano, a small Colwood grand, last played on, it was believed, the summer before Aunt Ann died, thirteen years ago. Timothy rose. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piano, and stood looking at his map while they all gathered round.|$|E
60|$|Crouching {{over the}} tiny fire, he cooked himself {{a bit of}} the buffalo meat and ate it. Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river and {{procured}} a drink. On every side he could see nothing but the prairie, with the stream running through it like a huge serpent. Close to the water's edge were a few bushes, and some of these he pulled up with ease, with which to replenish the fire.|$|E
6000|$|This remark {{suddenly}} {{brought home}} to Shelton the conviction that he was further than ever from avoiding the necessity for speaking. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window. The rain was coming down with fury, though a golden line far down the sky promised the shower's quick end. [...] "For goodness' sake," [...] he thought, [...] "let me say something, however idiotic, and get it over!" [...] But he did not turn; a kind of paralysis had seized on him.|$|E
5000|$|Groucho Marx parodies {{this play}} in the 1930 Marx Brothers film, Animal Crackers. On {{the first of three}} [...] "interludes", he says, [...] "Pardon me while I have a strange interlude", whereupon <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the camera and makes ersatz {{philosophical}} comments to himself and the audience.|$|R
60|$|Hannah's voice echoed pitifully {{through the}} silence of the flat. So appealing, so heartbroken was the cry one might have thought that Lise, {{wherever}} she was, would have heard it. Edward was dazed by the shock, his lower lip quivered and fell. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Hannah's chair and {{put his hand on her}} shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "With that he riz up," [...] {{continued}} Dan'l, {{ignoring his}} sister, [...] "and, takin' them counterfeit notes from my hand, sez he: 'Them notes belong to ME now,' sez he, 'and I'm goin' to destroy 'em.' And with that <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the fire as stiff as a poker, {{and held them}} notes in it until they were burnt clean up." ...|$|R
60|$|The boy's {{first act}} was {{to walk over}} to where the palace had stood and search the ruins until he found some scraps of food that had been {{overlooked}} by the enemy. He sat upon a block of marble and ate of this, and tears filled {{his eyes as he}} gazed upon the desolation around him. But Inga tried to bear up bravely, and having satisfied his hunger <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> well, intending to draw a bucket of drinking water.|$|E
60|$|Dorian Gray {{lifted his}} golden {{head from the}} pillow, and with pallid face and tear-stained eyes looked at him, as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, {{it was for the}} long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at last. He was going to rip up the canvas.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it wasn't the kiss." [...] <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{railing and}} leaned against it, facing her. [...] "But it was about you all the same, and I may as well tell you. You remember, I warned you long ago what would happen when you {{wanted to become a}} partner in Berande. Well, all the beach is gossiping about it; and Tudor persisted in repeating the gossip to me. So you see it won't do for you to stay on here under present conditions. It would be better if you went away." ...|$|E
60|$|So when Reddy Fox {{turned to}} speak to Shadow the Weasel, he found himself alone. At least he thought himself alone, and he smiled a wicked, selfish smile as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Billy Mink's duck. He was {{thinking}} how smart {{he had been to}} get rid of all the others, and of how he would enjoy the feast all by himself.|$|R
60|$|Leroux {{had found}} lodgings at Mijoux, and twice daily <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Gex {{to consult with}} me. We met, mornings and evenings, at the café {{restaurant}} of the Crâne Chauve, an obscure little tavern situated {{on the outskirts of}} the city. He was waxing impatient at what he called my supineness, for indeed so far I had had nothing to report.|$|R
60|$|Going {{through the}} post-office <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Warren Street and thence down to College Place. There was a coffee-stand upon the corner, {{and here he}} bought two {{doughnuts}} for a cent each, and began munching them, noticing {{at the same time}} that they were not of the best, being dry, and that the flavor wasn't to be compared to that of those Grace was in the habit of turning out at home.|$|R
