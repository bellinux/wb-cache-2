40|$|Traditional {{bacteriological}} {{cultivation of}} samples for salmonellae typically have involved a preenrichment in buffered peptone water, particularly for samples suspected of harboring low numbers of salmonellae. Many researchers; however, have since dispensed with this initial step (4 - 6, 13, 17 - 20), opting instead for <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> in tetrathionite broth, especially for samples suspected of containing nonhost adapted serotypes.

Currently, MSCs are isolated indirectly by using a culture step and then the generation of fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-fs). Unprocessed or native BM MSCs {{have not yet been}} fully characterised. We have previously developed a <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> method for the isolation of MSCs from human BM by using the CD 49 a protein (alpha 1 -integrin subunit). As the CD 49 a gene is highly conserved in mammals, we have evaluated whether this <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> can be employed for BM cells from rodent strains (rat and mouse). We have also studied the native phenotype by using both immunodetection and immunomagnetic methods and have compared MSCs from mouse, rat and human BM. As is the case for human BM, we have demonstrated that all rodent multipotential CFU-fs are contained within the CD 49 a-positive cell population. However, in the mouse, the number of CFU-fs is strain-dependent. Interestingly, all rat and mouse Sca- 1 -positive cells are concentrated within the CD 49 a-positive fraction and also contain all CFU-fs. In human, the colonies have been detected in the CD 49 a/CD 133 double-positive population.

The abundance of cultivable bacteria ranged from 0 – 295  CFU mL− 1 to 0 – 1720  CFU mL− 1 in two incubations {{with a total of}} 1385 isolates obtained. Comparing to <b>direct</b> cultivation, <b>enrichment</b> cultivation recovered more bacteria. Pigment-producing bacteria accounted for an average of 84. 9 % of total isolates. Such high percentage suggested that pigment production may be an adaptive physiological feature for the bacteria in ice core to cope with strong ultraviolet radiation on the glacier. The abundances of cultivable bacteria and pigment-producing isolates varied synchronously along depth: higher abundance in the middle and lower at the top and bottom. It indicated that the middle part of the ice core was hospitable for the microbial survival. Based on the physiological properties of the colonies, eighty-nine isolates were selected for phylogenetic analysis. Obtained 16 S rRNA gene sequences fell into four groups: Firmicutes, Alpha-Proteobacteria, Gamma-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with the Firmicutes being dominant. Microbial compositions derived from <b>direct</b> and <b>enrichment</b> cultivations were not overlapped. We suggest that it is a better way to explore the culturable microbial diversity in ice core by combining the approaches of both <b>direct</b> and <b>enrichment</b> cultivation...|$|R

All tetrathionate-brilliant green broth cultures were incubated at 42 degrees C for 24 to 48 h before plating. Significantly more isolations of salmonellae were obtained by delayed secondary enrichment than by <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> or preenrichment. Salmonellae were isolated from 417 of 2, 283 (18. 3 %) samples of litter, intestinal contents, and feces cultured by all three methods. Of these positive specimens, <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> detected 208 (49. 9 %), preenrichment detected 282 (67. 6 %), and delayed secondary enrichment detected 373 (89. 4 %).

40|$|Background: Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) offer a virtually unlimited source of neural cells for structural repair in neurological disorders, such as stroke. Neural cells {{can be derived from}} hESCs either by <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment,</b> or by isolating specific growth factor-responsive and expandable populations of human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Studies have indicated that the <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> method generates a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain residual undifferentiated stem cells that could lead to tumor formation in vivo. Methods/Principal Findings: We isolated an expandable and homogenous population of hNSCs (named SD 56) from hESCs using a defined media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory growth factor (LIF). These hNSCs grew as an adherent monolayer culture. They were fully neuralized and uniformly expressed molecular features of NSCs, including nestin, vimentin and radial glial markers. These hNSCs did not express the pluripotency markers Oct 4 or Nanog, nor did they express markers for the mesoderm or endoderm lineages. The self-renewal property of the hNSCs was characterized by a predominant symmetrical mode of cell division. The SD 56 hNSCs differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout multiple passages in vitro, as well as after transplantation. Together, these criteria confirm the definitive NSC identity of the SD 56 cell line. Importantly, they exhibited no chromosome abnormalities and did not form tumors after implantation into rat ischemic brains and into naïve nude ra...|$|E

Carcass-halves were then sampled by either a preenrichment procedure (lactose broth) or by a shorter <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> (selenite cystine broth) procedure. The marker organisms were detected on 73 of 79 inoculated carcass-halves when preenrichment was used, and on 79 of 80 when sampling was by <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Recoveries were also good when whole carcasses inoculated with either 20 cells of S. heidelberg or S. senftenberg were stored for 3 and 6 months at — 23 C.

Campylobacters were isolated from 259 (31 %) of 846 faecal specimens. The highest isolation rate was found in pigs (66 %); lower rates were found in cattle (24 %) and sheep (22 %). In pigs all the isolates were C. coli, in sheep and cattle about 75 % were C. jejuni. Only five isolations of C. fetus subsp. fetus were made, all from cattle. More pigs with diarrhoea had C. coli in their faeces than healthy pigs (77 % vs 47 %), but such a clear difference in isolation rate between sick and healthy animals was not seen in cattle or sheep.

40|$|The {{presence}} and abundance of short lived radioisotopes (SLRs) ^ 26 Al and ^ 60 Fe in chondritic meteorites {{implies that the}} Sun formed {{in the vicinity of}} one or more massive stars that exploded as supernovae (SNe). Massive stars are more likely to form in massive star clusters (> 1000 M_) than lower mass clusters. However, photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs from massive stars and dynamical interactions with passing stars can inhibit planet formation in clusters with radii of ∼ 1 pc. We investigate whether low-mass (50 - 200 M_) star clusters containing one or two massive stars are a more likely avenue for early Solar system enrichment as they are more dynamically quiescent. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of these low-mass clusters and find that a similar fraction of stars experience supernova enrichment than in high mass clusters, despite their lower densities. This is due to two-body relaxation, which causes a significant expansion before the first supernova even in clusters with relatively low (100 stars pc^- 3) initial densities. However, because of the high number of low mass clusters containing one or two massive stars, the absolute number of enriched stars is the same, if not higher than for more populous clusters. Our results show that <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> of protoplanetary discs from supernovae occurs as frequently in low mass clusters containing one or two massive stars (> 20 M_) as in more populous star clusters (1000 M_).

The combined use of <b>direct</b> <b>enrichment</b> in tetrathionate broth containing brilliant green dye and pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water followed by enrichment in tetrathionate broth made it possible to detect all 37 of the contaminated samples. All of the isolates were Salmonella bareilly, the only serotype recovered in a previous study. All but one of the isolations were made from moist or wet samples. S. bareilly was isolated from rabbit dung and litter collected near the weather pools, but attempts to trap rabbits for study were unsuccessful. Random samples taken along a side of the mountain yielded S. bareilly in weather pools within the upper third of the mountain; below this level, S. weslaco and S. memphis were recovered, but not S. bareilly...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} high-energy {{electron}} beam irradiation on {{the survival of}} Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on commer-cial chicken breast meat was evaluated. Fresh chicken breast meat was purchased from a local poultry processor, inoculated with 8 log 10 cfu/mL Salmonella, packaged in Styrofoam trays and over wrapped with a polyvinyl chlo-ride film, and subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 kGy of irradiation. The packaged samples were stored at 4 °C and analyzed for Salmonella Typhimurium and psychrotrophic organ-isms at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d of storage. <b>Direct</b> plating and <b>enrichment</b> methods were used for S. Typhimurium (Key words: chicken breast meat, irradiation, psychrotroph, Salmonella...|$|R
40|$|<b>Direct</b> plating, {{selective}} <b>enrichment,</b> {{and cold}} enrichment followed by secondary selective enrichment procedures were compared for detecting and enumerating Listeria monocytogenes in chopped cabbage stored at 5 degrees C {{for up to}} 64 days. Addition of Fe 3 + to solid media enhanced detection of the organism. Cold enrichment (5 degrees C) in nutrient broth and brain heart infusion broth followed by secondary enrichment (48 h, 30 degrees C) in Trypticase soy-yeast extract-antibiotic broth and thiocyanate-nalidixic acid broth and plating on selective agar media (Doyle and Schoeni selective enrichment agar [minus acriflavin hydrochloride, supplemented with 5 micrograms of Fe 3 +/ml] and McBride Listeria agar) resulted in the detection of highest populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Salmonella enterica {{serotype}} Virchow is {{the most}} common cause of invasive nontyphoid salmonellosis in North Queensland, particularly in infants, but the zoonotic source is unknown. This study aimed at determining (i) the prevalence of the introduced Asian house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, in houses in North Queensland and (ii) whether they were a potential source of Salmonella Virchow. Methods: Asian house geckos were collected in a random survey of houses in Townsville, North Queensland. Gut contents underwent microbiological analysis within 2 [*]h of removal using both <b>direct</b> plating and <b>enrichment</b> broth methods. Any organism found to be a presumptive Salmonella spp. was then sent to a reference lab for confirmation of genus/species, serotyping, and phage typing if indicated. Results: One hundred Asian house geckos were collected from 57 houses. Geckos were present in 100...|$|R
