50|$|The {{ability of}} yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been {{harnessed}} by the biotechnology industry to produce ethanol fuel. The process starts by milling a feedstock, such as sugar cane, field corn, or other cereal grains, and then adding dilute sulfuric acid, or fungal alpha amylase enzymes, {{to break down}} the starches into complex sugars. A <b>glucoamylase</b> is then added to break the complex sugars down into simple sugars.

5000|$|Some {{carbohydrates}} are degraded into simple sugars, or monosaccharides (e.g., glucose). Pancreatic amylase {{breaks down}} some carbohydrates (notably starch) into oligosaccharides. Other carbohydrates pass undigested {{into the large}} intestine and further handling by intestinal bacteria. Brush border enzymes take over from there. The most important brush border enzymes are dextrinase and <b>glucoamylase,</b> which further break down oligosaccharides. Other brush border enzymes are maltase, sucrase and lactase. Lactase is absent in some adult humans and, for them, lactose, like most poly-saccharides, is not digested in the small intestine. Some carbohydrates, such as cellulose, are not digested at all, despite being made of multiple glucose units. This is because the cellulose {{is made out of}} beta-glucose, making the inter-monosaccharidal bindings different from the ones present in starch, which consists of alpha-glucose. Humans lack the enzyme for splitting the beta-glucose-bonds, something reserved for herbivores and bacteria from the large intestine.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{foods are}} {{composed}} of largely indigestible components depending on the enzymes and effectiveness of an animal's digestive tract. The most well-known of these indigestible compounds is cellulose; the basic chemical polymer in the makeup of plant cell walls. Most animals, however, do not produce cellulase; the enzyme needed to digest cellulose. However some animal and species have developed symbiotic relationships with cellulase-producing bacteria (see termites and metamonads.) This allows termites to use the energy-dense cellulose carbohydrate. [...] Other such enzymes are known to significantly improve bio-assimilation of nutrients. Because {{of the use of}} bacterial derivatives enzymatic dietary supplements now contain such enzymes as amylase, <b>glucoamylase,</b> protease, invertase, peptidase, lipase, lactase, phytase, and cellulase. These enzymes improve the overall bioassimilation in the digestive tract but are still not proven to increase bloodstream bioavailability. Basically the enzymes and other breakdowns make the bigger substances of food smaller so they can go through the rest of their digestion more easily.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{contemporary}} process, corn is milled to extract corn starch and an [...] "acid-enzyme" [...] process is used, {{in which the}} corn-starch solution is acidified to begin breaking up the existing carbohydrates. It is necessary {{to carry out the}} extraction process in the presence of mercuric chloride (0.01 M) in order to inhibit endogenous starch-degrading enzymes. High-temperature enzymes are added to further metabolize the starch and convert the resulting sugars to fructose. The first enzyme added is alpha-amylase, which breaks the long chains down into shorter sugar chains - oligosaccharides. <b>Glucoamylase</b> is mixed in and converts them to glucose; the resulting solution is filtered to remove protein, then using activated carbon, and then demineralized using ion-exchange resins. The purified solution is then run over immobilized xylose isomerase, which turns the sugars to ~50-52% glucose with some unconverted oligosaccharides and 42% fructose (HFCS 42), and again demineralized and again purified using activated carbon. Some is processed into HFCS 90 by liquid chromatography, then mixed with HFCS 42 to form HFCS 55. The enzymes used in the process are made by microbial fermentation.|$|E
