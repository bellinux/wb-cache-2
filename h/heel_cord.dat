5000|$|Exercises. Stretching {{exercises}} help relieve tension {{from the}} Achilles tendon. These exercises are {{especially important for}} the patient who has a tight <b>heel</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Achilles tendon or <b>heel</b> <b>cord,</b> {{also known}} as the calcaneal tendon ( [...] Tendo calcaneus), is a tendon {{of the back of the}} leg, and the {{thickest}} in the human body. It serves to attach the plantaris, gastrocnemius (calf) and soleus muscles to the calcaneus (heel) bone. These muscles, acting via the tendon, cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle, and (except soleus) flexion at the knee.|$|E
5000|$|This {{treatment}} requires stretching. The foot is repositioned to {{the normal}} position then a cast (the [...] "Ponseti cast") is placed on top of it. The baby’s foot is then continually repositioned and placed back into a cast {{once a week for}} several months. Towards {{the end of the process}} after being in a cast, the doctor will then surgically lengthen the <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> (aka Achilles tendon). After the foot has been realigned, maintenance involves routine stretching. The child also has to wear special shoes or braces full-time for three months, then just nightly for three years. This method can be compared to wearing braces on your teeth. Parents have to follow the doctor’s orders for when to wear and not wear the brace to keep the foot corrected. Failure will occur if the brace is not worn and the foot will return to its odd shape.|$|E
50|$|Bethlem {{myopathy}} affects about 1 in 200,000 people. Contractures of {{the fingers}} are a typical symptom of Bethlem myopathy but not of the related Ullrich's myopathy (which does include contractures of arms and legs, as does Bethlem myopathy). Serum creatine kinase is elevated in Bethlem myopathy, as there is ongoing muscle cell death. Patients with Bethlem myopathy may expect a normal life span and continued mobility into adulthood. There is currently no cure for this disorder, but the contractures of the legs can be alleviated with heel-cord surgery followed by bracing and regular physical therapy. Repeated surgeries to lengthen the <b>heel</b> <b>cords</b> may be needed as the child grows to adulthood.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{hundred and}} forty-four boys who had Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} were managed {{at a single}} center between 1953 and 1994 and were followed for a mean of 8. 9 years. The long duration of follow-up provided an opportunity {{to examine the effects}} of phys-ical therapy and orthopaedic treatment on contractures of the lower extremities and on the duration of the ability to walk. Contractures of the lower extremities were controlled best when patients were managed with a combination of daily passive stretching exercises, pre-scribed periods of standing and walking, tenotomy of the Achilles tendon, posterior tibial-tendon transfer, and application of knee-ankle-foot orthoses. Approximately two years after bracing, the severity of the contracture of the <b>heel</b> <b>cords</b> was similar in the patients who had ha...|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the good}} {{clinical}} outcomes {{that can be}} achieved, living with a frame can result in significant morbidity. Four of fourteen patients in this report had problems with infected pin sites. Foster et al. [13] in their paper reported a 23  % rate of pin-site infection in 40 complex tibial fractures treated with a circular frame. Saw et al. [14] reported a 6  % rate of pin-site infection with increased rates in half pins and distally sited wires. Other complications of circular frames include pain, soft tissue tethering and <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> tightness. Garcia-Cimbrelo et al.

40|$|Background: A {{child with}} {{recurrent}} or incompletely corrected clubfoot after previous extensive soft tissue release is treated frequently with revision surgery. This leads to further scarring, pain and limitations in range of motion. We have utilized the Ponseti method of manipulation and casting and when indicated, tibialis anterior tendon transfer, instead of revision surgery for these cases. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review {{of all children}} treated since 2002 (n = 11) at our institution for recurrent or incompletely corrected clubfoot after previous extensive soft tissue release was done. Clinical and operative records were reviewed to determine procedure performed. Ponseti manipulation and casting were done until the clubfoot deformity was passively corrected. Based on the residual equinus and dynamic deformity, <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> lengthening or tenotomy and tibialis anterior transfer were then done. Clinical outcomes regarding pain, function and activity were reviewed. Results: Eleven children (17 feet) with ages ranging from 1. 1 to 8. 4 years were treated with this protocol. All were correctable with the Ponseti method with one to eight casts. Casts were applied until the only deformities remaining were either or both hindfoot equinus and dynamic supination. Nine feet required a <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> procedure for equinus and 15 required tibialis anterior transfer for dynamic supination. Seven children have follow-up greater than one year (average 27. 1 months) and have had excellent results. Two patients had persistent hindfoot valgus which required hemiepiphyseodesis of the distal medial tibia. Conclusion: The Ponseti method, followed by tibialis anterior transfer and/or <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> procedure when indicated, can be successfully used to correct recurrent clubfoot deformity in children treated with previous extensive soft tissue release. Early follow-up has shown correction without revision surgery. This treatment protocol prevents complications of stiffness, pain and difficulty in ambulating associated with multiple soft tissue releases for clubfeet...|$|E

40|$|A lesão medular causa prejuízos nos aspectos físico, psicológico e social da pessoa. Há predomínio de indivíduos do sexo masculino, jovens e o {{principal}} motivo são os acidentes automobilísticos. A lesão neurológica e o desuso dos membros acometidos produzem espasticidades, contraturas, osteoporose e deformidades, principalmente nos pés. Uma estratégia para diminuir estas complicações nos lesados medulares é a estimulação elétrica neuromuscular (EENM). Há poucos estudos na literatura descrevendo o comportamento de pés e tornozelos de lesados medulares submetidos à EENM, bem como sobre avaliação da osteoporose nestes indivíduos utilizando UQC (ultrassonografia quantitativa de calcâneo). Portanto, o objetivo principal deste estudo foi analisar os efeitos da EENM nos pés e tornozelos de lesados medulares e compará-los a grupo de lesados que não realizam EENM e a grupo de indivíduos normais. O objetivo secundário é avaliar a utilidade da ultrassonografia quantitativa de calcâneo no diagnóstico de osteoporose em lesados medulares. No período {{de janeiro}} a outubro de 2009, trinta pacientes do ambulatório de lesados medulares no Hospital das Clínicas da Unicamp que realizam EENM (Grupo A) tiveram seus pés e tornozelos submetidos à avaliação clínica e radiográfica e foram comparados a grupo de lesados que não realizam EENM (Grupo B) e a grupo de indivíduos normais (Grupo C). Foi também avaliada a densidade óssea utilizando UQC e densitometria óssea (DEXA) de 15 pacientes que iniciariam EENM no ambulatório de lesados medulares no Hospital das Clínicas da Unicamp (Grupo D), comparando-a com um grupo de pacientes normais (Grupo E). A avaliação clínica dos pés e tornozelos envolveu deformidades, condições de pele e mobilidade articular da talocrural, da talocalcânea e do médio pé. A avaliação radiográfica consistiu na análise dos ângulos hálux valgo, intermetatarsal, ângulo talocalcâneo no sentido dorso plantar e perfil, tálus em relação ao primeiro osso metatarsal, calcâneo-solo e tibiocalcâneo. Para avaliação estatística foram utilizados o teste de Kruskal-Wallis, Mann- Whitney e Wilcoxon Pareado. Quando o valor de p 0. 05 there was significant difference. As regards {{the results of}} Groups A, B and C, the mobility of the subtalar joint was 23. 4 º in Group A; 13. 5 º in Group B and 28. 9 º in Group C. In the comparison of subtalar mobility between Groups A and B, B and C {{significant differences were found}} (0. 0092 and 0. 0034 respectively). In the midfoot joint the mean mobility was 22. 5 º in Group A; 15. 3 º in Group B and 24. 1 º in Group C. When comparing the midfoot mobility among Groups A and B, B and C significant differences were obtained (0. 0184 and 0. 0022 respectively). The mean mobility of the ankle joint was 41. 4 º in Group A; 34. 3 º in Group B and 63. 6 º in Group C. When this mobility was compared between Groups A and B, B and C significant differences were presented (0. 0009 and 0. 0008 respectively). The mean measurement of the hallux valgus angle was 17. 5 º for Group A; 14. 8 º for Group B and 15. 6 º for Group C. The mean of the intermetatarsal angle was 9. 1 º (Group A); 8. 1 º (Group B) and 10. 1 º (Group C). The mean for the talocalcaneus angle in AP was 23. 5 º (Group A), 18. 9 º (Group B) and 24 º (Group C). The mean of the calcaneal-ground angle was 25 º for Group A; 25. 3 º for Group B and 26. 8 º for Group C. The talocalcaneal angle in profile presented the following means: 44. 7 º for Group A; 36. 8 º for Group B AND 31. 1 º for Group C. When this angle was compared between Groups A and C, B and C, there were significant differences (0. 0184 and 0. 0040, respectively). The mean angle between the talus in relation to the first metatarsal and first metatarsal was 13. 8 º (Group A), 19. 3 º (Group B) and 4. 0 º (Group C). When this angle was compared between Groups A-C and B-C, it presented significant differences (0. 0089 and 0. 0075, respectively). The mean tibiocalcaneal angle in Group A was 81 º, in Group B 80. 6 º and in Group C it was 81. 8 º. The deformities found in the feet of subjects in Group A included two patients with clawed toes, and one with bilateral flat feet, while in Group B one foot with Grade 1 ulcer on the lateral malleolus and one foot with an ulcer on the calcaneus were found. As regards the bone density results of Groups D and E, the values of the T score in the femoral neck with DEXA (0. 0022) and T score of the calcaneus with QUS of the calcaneus (0. 0005) presented significant difference between the groups, with higher means in the normal group in comparison with the spinal cord injuries group, who began undergoing NMES (p > 0. 05). The spinal cord injuries group presented significant differences between the T score of QUS of the calcaneus and the T score of the lumbar spine and the femoral neck with DEXA. It is possible to conclude that the partial-load NMES maintained the feet and ankles of patients with spinal cord injuries in an adequate walking position. This finding indicates a favorable aspect of new technologies that may allow these patients to regain independent walking capacity. As regards the evaluation of bone density due to the low mechanical stress on the <b>heels</b> of spinal <b>cord</b> injuries patients, it could be concluded that QUS did not present results that could be correlated with DEXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. It was not possible to affirm that QUS is a good choice for the diagnosis and follow-up of spinal cord injuries patient...|$|R

40|$|Background : Though {{described}} long back, {{there has}} been a renewed interest towards Ponseti method of conservative treatment of clubfoot recently. Methods : Forty children with idiopathic clubfeet were treated by Ponseti technique. The median age at presentation was 9 days. Twenty-six children with bilateral and 12 children with unilateral clubfeet were graded by the Pirani method at the commencement of treatment and then at the final follow-up. Feet were graded as excellent if the Pirani score was zero, fair, if the sum of mid-foot and hind-foot score was one or less and poor, if the score was more than one. Thirty four children need a <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> tenotomy and all children received conventional ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) and foot-abduction orthosis (FAO) to maintain correction. Results : Twenty-eight children had excellent correction, four had a fair outcome and eight cases had relapse in their deformity.

40|$|Five {{patients}} with symptomatic flexible pes planus unre-sponsive to conservative therapy underwent nine open wedge anterior calcaneal osteotomies and {{advancement of the}} posterior tibial tendon. The average follow-up was 6 years, 8 months. Three patients exhibited medial and plantar talonavicular subluxation and naviculocuneiform sag. There were three excellent results, three very good, two good, and one poor. The patient with a poor rating was asymptomatic, had normal foot motion, and was sat-isfied with the procedure. Juvenile pes planus is a common condition {{with a wide range}} of physical findings and symptomatology. Typically the foot exhibits midfoot abduction, heel val-gus, and flattening of the longitudinal arch. The subtalar and midtarsal joints are hypermobile, and there may be compensatory forefoot supination and <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> short-ening.

40|$|Objective The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the causes of plantar heel pain and find differences in the clinical features of plantar fasciitis (PF) and fat pad atrophy (FPA), which are common causes of plantar heel pain, for use in differential diagnosis. Method This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 250 patients with plantar heel pain at the Foot Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital from January to September, 2008. Results The subjects used in this study were 114 men and 136 women patients {{with a mean age of}} 43. 8 years and mean heel pain duration of 13. 3 months. Causes of plantar heel pain were PF (53. 2 %), FPA (14. 8 %), pes cavus (10. 4 %), PF with FPA (9. 2 %), pes planus (4. 8 %), plantar fibromatosis (4. 4 %), plantar fascia rupture (1. 6 %), neuropathy (0. 8 %), and small shoe syndrome (0. 8 %). PF and FPA were most frequently diagnosed. First-step pain in the morning, and tenderness on medial calcaneal tuberosity correlated with PF. FPA mainly involved bilateral pain, pain at night, and pain that was aggravated by standing. <b>Heel</b> <b>cord</b> tightness was the most common biomechanical abnormality of the foot.

40|$|Kaminski, Thomas W. To {{perform a}} proper squat, athletes must be mobile in the ankle, knee, and hip while {{maintaining}} a strong torso to protect the musculature surrounding the spine. Deficits in mobility, especially at the foot and ankle can cause compensation resulting in the widening of the feet and/or turning the toes outward to achieve proper squat depth. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the overhead squat (OHS) in a group of female collegiate athletes and implement an appropriate ankle dorsiflexion mobility exercise program to improve squat performance. A total of 44 female student-athletes (age 18 - 25) were randomly divided into three treatment interventions: (1) Traditional Calf Stretch technique; (2) a joint-capsule release intervention termed "Banded <b>Heel</b> <b>Cord</b> (Anterior Bias) (TM) "; and (3) a soft tissue intervention termed "Barbell Calf Smash(TM) ". A series of measurements were made to analyze the OHS including ankle dorsiflexion motion and movement analysis (torso angle, squat depth, shin angle, knee flare, foot width, and ankle eversion motion) at baseline and following 6 weeks of training. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests were used for comparisons between and within the three intervention groups. Improvements in DF ROM following the 6 week intervention period averaged greater than 20 % in both the BHC(TM) and BCS(TM) groups; leading to significant improvements in squat depth in both groups as well. Two contemporary and novel ankle mobility exercises proved beneficial in significantly enhancing DF ROM and squat depth in our population of female student-athletes, who were considered novice to the OHS.

In the second patient the hallux varus was bilateral. The probable etiological relationship of these underlying disorders {{to the development of}} the sponta-neous hallux varus is discussed. The purpose of this paper is to report two very rare cases of spontaneous hallux varus occurring in late adulthood. The first case, which was unilateral, oc-curred at the age of 72 years. The patient had a history of childhood poliomyelitis involving this ex-tremity. The second patient developed bilateral hallux varus at the age of 59 years. X-rays revealed bilateral congenital absence of the fibular sesamoids. CASE 1 The patient, a 74 -year-old female, complained of pain and stiffness of her left ankle. She also noted a painless left sided hallux varus deformity developing 2 years ago. The patient is a diabetic. She gave a history of contracting poliomyelitis in childhood.

We eval-uated 63 feet in 57 patients who underwent a triple ar-throdesis using rigid internal fixation for the treatment of hindfoot deformities associated with symptomatic ar-throsis. Twenty-four men and thirty-three women, with an average age of 54 years, were evaluated. The average follow-up was 30 months. Multiple diagnoses contrib-uted to hindfoot deformities with secondary arthrosis. Iliac crest bone graft was used in 56 of 63 cases (89 %). Percutaneous <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> lengthening was done in 53 of 63 cases (84 %). Twenty-four of the thirty patients (80 %) returned to work. Twenty-five patients were retired and two were unemployed before surgery. All patients ex-cept two (97 %) were satisfied with the surgery and would have the surgery again. The average American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot pre-operative score was 28 points, and the average postop-erative score was 81 points (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|HPI: A 26 -year old male {{presented}} to the emergency department after experiencing the acute onset of left ankle pain while playing basketball. Upon jumping, he felt a “pop” in his left posterior ankle, followed by pain and difficulty ambulating. His exam was notable for a defect at the left Achilles tendon on palpation. The practitioner performed a Thompson test, which was positive (abnormal) on the left. Significant Findings: The left Achilles tendon had a defect on palpation, while the right Achilles tendon was intact. When squeezing the right (unaffected) calf, the ankle spontaneously plantar flexed, indicating a negative (normal) Thompson test. Upon squeeze of the left (affected) calf, the ankle did not plantar flex, signifying a positive (abnormal) Thompson test. The diagnosis of left Achilles tendon rupture was confirmed intraoperatively one week later. Discussion: The Achilles tendon (also: calcaneal tendon or <b>heel</b> <b>cord)</b> {{is derived from the}} medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, as well as the soleus muscle. Rupture of the Achilles tendon most commonly occurs in the distal tendon, approximately 2 - 6 cm from its attachment to the calcaneal tuberosity, in an area of hypovascularity known as the “watershed” or “critical” zone. 1 - 3 The Thompson test (also: Simmonds-Thompson test), described by Simmonds in 1957 and Thompson in 1962, is done while the patient is in the prone position, with feet hanging over the end of a table/gurney, or with the patient kneeling on a stool or chair. 4 - 5 Squeezing the calf of an unaffected limb will cause the ankle to plantar flex, but squeezing the calf of a limb with an Achilles tendon rupture will cause no motion.

40|$|Background: Relapse of clubfoot {{deformity}} following correction by Ponseti {{technique is}} not uncommon. The relapsed feet progress from flexible to rigid if left untreated and can become {{as severe as}} the initial deformity. No definitive classification exists to assess a relapsed clubfoot. Some authors have used the Pirani score to rate the relapse while others have used descriptive terms. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the relapse pattern in clubfeet that have undergone treatment with the Ponseti method and propose a simple classification for relapsed clubfeet. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one children (164 feet) with idiopathic clubfeet who underwent treatment with Ponseti technique presented with relapse of the deformity. There were 68 boys and 23 girls. Mean age at presentation for casting was 10. 71 days (range 7 - 22 days). Seventy three children (146 feet, 80 %) had bilateral involvement and 18 (20 %) had unilateral clubfeet. The mean Pirani Score was 5. 6 and 5. 5 in bilateral and unilateral groups respectively. Percutaneous <b>heel</b> <b>cord</b> tenotomy was done in 65 children (130 feet, 89 %) in the bilateral group and in 12 children (66 %) with unilateral clubfoot. Results: Five relapse patterns were identified at a mean followup of 4. 5 years (range 3 - 5 years) which forms the basis of this study. These relapse patterns were classified as: Grade IA: decrease in ankle dorsiflexion from 15 degrees to neutral, Grade IB: dynamic forefoot adduction or supination, Grade IIA - rigid equinus, Grade IIB - rigid adduction of forefoot/midfoot complex and Grade III: combination of two or more deformities: Fixed equinus, varus and forefoot adduction. In the bilateral group, 21 children (38 feet, 28 %) had Grade IA relapse. Twenty four children (46 feet, 34 %) had dynamic intoeing (Grade IB) on walking. Thirteen children (22 feet, 16 %) had true ankle equinus of varying degress (Grade IIA); eight children (13 feet, 9. 7 %) had fixed adduction deformity of the forefoot (Grade IIB) and seven children (14 feet, 10. 7 %) had two or more fixed deformities. In the unilateral group seven cases (38 %) had reduced dorsiflexion (Grade IA), six (33 %) had dynamic adduction (Grade IB), two (11 %) had fixed equinus and adduction respectively (Grade IIA and IIB) and one (5 %) child had fixed equinus and adduction deformity (Grade III). The relapses were treated by full time splint application, re-casting, tibialis anterior transfer, posterior release, corrective lateral closing wedge osteotomy and a comprehensive subtalar release. Splint compliance was compromised in both groups. Conclusion: Relapse pattern in clubfeet can be broadly classified into three distinct subsets. Early identification of relapses and early intervention will prevent major soft tissue surgery. A universal language of relapse pattern will allow comparison of results of intervention...|$|E
