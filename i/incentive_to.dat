5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited.

Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} affects the <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> ratify international environmental agreements (IEAs). In particular, we study the effects of two aspects on the <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> join a coalition. First, we analyze cross-country differences in adaptation costs. Second, we investigate the role of carbon leakage. We find that the <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> join IEAs remain unchanged with cross-country differences in adaptation when there is no carbon leakage, while these cross-country differences may strengthen the <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> join IEAs with leakages. Our results emphasize that policies directed at reducing cost differences and carbon leakage may also affect the success and failure of IEAs. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies suggest}} that analysts have <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> bias their {{earnings}} forecasts, especially for longer horizon forecasts. We use the difference between analysts’ two-year and one-year-ahead earnings forecasts (FECH) {{as a measure of}} analysts’ biased incentives. We find that high FECH firms underperform low FECH firms by 0. 85 % in the following month and the underperformance persists up to at least six months. In addition, the negative FECH-return relation is more pronounced when analyst <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> bias forecasts are higher. Finally, high FECH firms have significantly negative future forecast errors and forecast revisions when their <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> bias forecasts are high. Overall, our study indicates that analyst <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> bias forecasts have implications for stock market efficiency...|$|R

He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{investigates the}} factors that influence firms' <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> innovate. We study the variables stimulating, enabling and conditioning the idea generation process in small and medium-sized service firms.

Of the final set of explanatory variables, the most significant 'manageable' variable is the formulation of clear innovation objectives in the corporate strategy. Furthermore, fostering freedom to experiment and applying multifunctional teams have positive effects on the <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> innovate. Besides, two factors (quality competition and high� uncertainty of market demand) are market related. Finally, in contradiction to our expectations, having well-educated employees has a negative effect on the <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> innovate. ...|$|R

NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
