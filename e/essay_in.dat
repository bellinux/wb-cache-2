5|$|On June 25, 2014, James {{opted out}} of his {{contract}} with the Heat and officially became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. On July 11, he revealed via a first-person <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> Sports Illustrated {{that he intended to}} return to the Cavaliers. In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received. On July 12, he officially signed with the team, who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure. A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Minnie's birthdate vary widely. The National Gallery of Victoria {{estimates}} around 1915; Birnberg's biographical {{survey of}} Indigenous artists from central Australia gives a birth date of around 1920; The new McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art suggests around 1922; Elizabeth Fortescue's biographical <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> Art of Utopia offers a range between 1910 and 1920. The uncertainty arises because Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth {{by comparison with}} other events, especially for those born before contact with European Australians. Minnie was one of six children, and had three sisters: Molly, born around 1920, Emily, born around 1922, and Galya, born in the 1930s. She was of the Anmatyerre and Alyawarre Aboriginal language groups.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other <b>Essays</b> <b>in</b> 1940 and Critical <b>Essays</b> <b>in</b> 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with Shooting an Elephant and Other <b>Essays</b> <b>in</b> 1950, England Your England and Other <b>Essays</b> <b>in</b> 1953—which was revised as Such, Such Were the Joys—and Collected <b>Essays</b> <b>in</b> 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George Orwell from 1954, 1956's The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected <b>Essays</b> <b>in</b> 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other <b>Essays</b> and <b>in</b> abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the Great Ideas series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), Some Thoughts on the Common Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009).

5|$|Richard Edward O'Connor {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Glebe on 4 August 1851. His mother was Mary Anne, née Harnett, while his father was Richard, an Irish-born Catholic who at that time served as {{librarian}} to the New South Wales Legislative Council, and would later become Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, chairing its first meeting. His family believed itself to be descended from the Irish republican rebel Arthur O'Connor, and also counted the prominent Tasmanian pioneer Roderic O'Connor among their relations. Richard Edward, sometimes known as Dick, attended St Mary's College, a Benedictine school in Lyndhurst, from 1861 to 1866 before matriculating at Sydney Grammar School in 1867 and studying at the University of Sydney. From a young age his closest friend was Edmund Barton, in whose Cabinet O'Connor would later serve. He won the Wentworth medal for the best English <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> 1870, and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1871 and a Master of Arts in 1873.|$|E
5|$|Under the Earl of Danby the {{government}} now undertook a political realignment, {{and prepared to}} enter the war against France. The new alliance with the Dutch, together with {{the expansion of the}} English army, opened important prospects for Churchill in military and diplomatic spheres. In April 1678, Churchill (accompanied by his friend and rising politician, Sidney Godolphin), departed for The Hague to negotiate a convention on the deployment of the English army in Flanders. The young diplomat's <b>essay</b> <b>in</b> international statecraft proved personally successful, bringing him into contact with William, Prince of Orange, who was highly impressed by the shrewdness and courtesy of Churchill's negotiating skills. The assignment had helped Churchill develop a breadth of experience that other mere soldiers were never to achieve, yet because of the duplicitous dealings of Charles II's secret negotiations with LouisXIV (Charles had no intention of waging war against France), the mission ultimately proved abortive. In May, Churchill was appointed temporary rank of Brigadier-General of Foot, but hopes of promised action on the Continent proved illusory as the warring factions sued for peace and signed the Treaty of Nijmegen.|$|E
