5|$|A {{species of}} sphenodontine is {{known from the}} Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Whether it is refereable to Sphenodon proper is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear,</b> but {{is assumed to be}} closely related to tuataras.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland {{to those in}} Ireland is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b> Given {{the proximity of the}} two countries and the similarity of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres undoubtedly settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E
50|$|In March 1945, the Kronprinzenpalais was gutted in an Allied bomb attack. Until 1958, {{a ballet}} school used a {{remaining}} rear section, but {{the site was}} <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> in 1961.|$|R
50|$|Indonesia's lowland {{tropical}} forests, {{the richest}} in timber resources and biodiversity, are most at risk. By 2000 {{they have been}} almost <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> in Sulawesi, and predicted to disappear within few years in Sumatra and Kalimantan.|$|R
50|$|French {{inaction}} on the Martel case, {{combined with}} de Vosjoli's very public dismissal, {{eventually led to}} a complete breakdown in French-US intelligence sharing beginning in 1964. The issues were not <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> up for three years, after which normal communications resumed.|$|R
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{for activities}} in Greece {{during the years}} 355–352 BC is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear</b> (see below). Philip certainly started besieging Methone, the last Athenian possession in Macedon, during this period, but different historians choose different dates for this siege. There are two main theories, either 355–354 BC, as favoured by, for instance, Buckler, or 354–353 BC, as favoured by Cawkwell.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b> Photographic evidence shows that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{chain of}} {{events leading up to}} Bishop Tempier's {{condemnation}} of 1277 is still not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b> The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle's teachings on the eternity {{of the world and the}} unicity of the intellect.|$|E
60|$|And {{in truth}} there was ground for his remark, for the mists had {{by that time}} <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> away, leaving {{unveiled}} a sea so calm and bright that the innumerable islets off the coast appeared as if floating in air.|$|R
60|$|They {{were hardly}} {{anchored}} before the gale {{showed signs of}} breaking, {{and in a few}} hours the sun shone out and the wind subsided. The destruction of the timber on the hillsides had been prodigious, and large spaces were <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 1941, German policy evolved further, {{calling for}} the {{complete}} destruction of the Polish people, whom the Nazis regarded as [...] "subhumans" [...] (Untermenschen). Within ten to twenty years, the Polish territories under German occupation were to be <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> of ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists.|$|R
5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages {{produced by a}} shortened pathway are not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b> However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, {{as well as other}} factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear</b> why Burt {{made such}} an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core}} of his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear</b> why {{secondary}} infection {{with a different}} strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E
30|$|The model {{does not}} {{identify}} unreported studies (leakage) or unreported backlog—it assumes that all studies are reported. An Irish {{national survey of}} unreported studies published in December 2010 confirmed that, while small unreported backlogs had existed in 2008 and 2009, these had been <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> by October 2010 [13].|$|R
50|$|In 1902, Richard Hudnut was exonerated on {{smuggling}} charges {{alleged to}} have been conducted by a steamship steward. The steward was arrested for smuggling violet essence and musk into the United States, some of which was traced to Hudnut's pharmacy. On further investigation, the collector <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> Hudnut of any wrongdoing.|$|R
50|$|The {{abolition}} of Limehurst Rural District in 1954 enabled the County Borough of Oldham to extend development into the former semi rural area, building the Alt estate {{and its associated}} schools, playing fields etc. Development did not however encroach upon Alt Fold, though this ancient area was <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> in the late 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Renaissance {{scholars}} commonly practised astrology. Gerolamo Cardano {{cast the}} horoscope of king Edward VI of England, while John Dee was the personal astrologer to queen Elizabeth I of England. Catherine de Medici paid Michael Nostradamus in 1566 {{to verify the}} prediction {{of the death of}} her husband, king Henry II of France made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included Tycho Brahe in the royal court of Denmark, Johannes Kepler to the Habsburgs, Galileo Galilei to the Medici, and Giordano Bruno who was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600. The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b> Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} next is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear,</b> but Heraclius certainly won {{a crushing}} victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall}} of 622. The key factor was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear</b> whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
25|$|One early {{technique}} involved slaughtering all {{the wild}} animals tsetse fed on. For example, {{the island of}} Principe off {{the west coast of}} Africa was <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> of feral pigs in the 1930s, which led to the extirpation of the fly. While the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s, the new population of tsetse was free from the disease.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{traces of}} the station's platform, {{lampposts}} and nameboard posts remained in September 1987, the site has now been <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> by the local farmer except for a pole which once held the station's lighting. Large stretches of the trackbed towards [...] do however remain intact. The station's access road remains in use by the farmer.|$|R
60|$|Hour {{after hour}} passed. The night {{appeared}} interminable. From {{time to time}} Rupert dived so as {{to look through the}} loophole, and at last was rewarded by seeing a faint dull light. Day was beginning; and Rupert had no doubt that with early morning the sluices would be opened, and the moat <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> of water.|$|R
5|$|Buckler {{suggests}} the following: According to the Athenian politician Demosthenes, Kersebleptes met Philip at Maroneia (in Thrace), {{together with the}} Theban general Pammenes, and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, he states that Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time. Demosthenes says that the Athenian general Chares filed the report about the meeting between Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet {{off the coast of}} Neapolis. Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC. It is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear</b> what occasioned this meeting between Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently indeed; {{although}} the Second Athenian Confederacy was dissolved, the Athenians {{were allowed to}} keep their colony on Samos, and their prisoners were freed without ransom. Philip's motives are not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear,</b> but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians. Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations; both received Macedonian garrisons. He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely {{to take advantage of}} the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese. The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons not}} <b>entirely</b> <b>clear,</b> on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg {{to take his}} {{division}} of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Günzburg to Wertingen {{in preparation for the}} main Austrian advance out of Ulm. Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions– Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Nicolas Oudinot's grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians lost nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner. The Battle of Wertingen had been an easy French victory.|$|E
50|$|The Uwharries {{lie within}} the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. They give their {{name to the}} Uwharrie National Forest. Once <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> for timber and farmland, the {{mountains}} were designated a U.S. National Forest in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. The woodlands have since returned, providing a haven for a diversity of wildlife, recreational facilities, and numerous Native American archeological sites.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} {{of the old}} station, albeit <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> of station buildings, remained partly in place into the 1980s until the A467 development began, but a wire fence stood {{between it and the}} singled line. Station House, the one-time home of the stationmaster and the one remaining building associated with Abertillery Station, remains as a private dwelling on the town's Oak Street.|$|R
50|$|Then, {{later that}} day, another {{counter-attack}} with more artillery support was launched. This was a success, as the battered Finnish company managed to infiltrate Soviet positions. After over seven hours of continuous fighting, {{the majority of}} Soviet resistance collapsed, though with a high cost. By the morning of December 28, the area was <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared,</b> and the Battle of Kelja was over.|$|R
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet <b>entirely</b> <b>clear.</b> It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not <b>entirely</b> <b>clear</b> how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
60|$|With {{the death}} of Vorlange we bring our story to a close. By what was said during the man's last hours on earth, Mortimer Arbuckle was <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> of the cloud which had hung over his honorable name. Soon after this his right mind {{came back to him}} and to-day he is as well and happy as it is {{possible}} to imagine.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the main}} points at issue is the precise meaning of [...] "cleared the {{neighbourhood}} around its orbit". Alan Stern objects that [...] "it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets," [...] and that since neither Earth, Mars, Jupiter, nor Neptune have <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the IAU definition.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June 2005 workers began {{demolishing}} the Egyptian-styled façades. Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills {{started the}} demolition by tearing {{down the front}} arch with a front-end loader. The land has since been <b>entirely</b> <b>cleared</b> of all Nuwaubian structures and the property was sold to a developer, who has since built a log style hunting lodge on the property. The property is owned by White Oak Plantation as of 2012.|$|R
