5|$|In September 2009, {{the company}} {{announced}} that as of March 31, 2010, PokerTracker Holdem v2 {{would no longer be}} supported.

5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{appointment}} of Abu-Ubaidah as commander in chief, he sent a small detachment to the annual fair held at Abu-al-Quds, modern day Abla, near Zahlé 50km east of Beirut. There was a Byzantine and Christian Arab garrison guarding that fair, however {{the size of the}} garrison was miscalculated by the Muslim informants. The garrison quickly encircled the small Muslim force. Before it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed, Abu Ubaidah, having received new intelligence, sent Khalid to rescue the Muslim army. Khalid engaged and defeated them in the Battle of Abu-al-Quds on 15 October 634 and returned with tons of looted booty from the fair and hundreds of Roman prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> eliminated.|$|E

In 1523, the monastery was transferred to the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I. In addition, the monastery was given a full reign over its territory. In 1555, the complex consisted of four churches, including and one cave church.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} work {{took place}} in the later part of the 15thcentury. It is thought that it began with the south arcade, followed by the north arcade and the addition of a clerestory. The rebuilding was probably complete by about 1525, although the north aisle may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> re-roofed until the early 17thcentury. The west porch was probably started in the 14thcentury, and the upper two storeys added in the following century. The nave roof was repaired in 1615. During the civil war, while nearby Biddulph Hall was under siege, SirWilliam Brereton's Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. They damaged the medieval glass windows and removed some of the church furniture, including the organ. There have been few significant changes since that time. The church was restored during the 19thcentury by Anthony Salvin, and later, in about 1857, by George Gilbert Scott, who removed plaster from the walls and built a small gallery. During the Victorian era, the reredos and most of the stained glass were added.|$|E

5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines. Either system would have to produce at least 256,000shaft horsepower (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on the South Dakota hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the hull form, particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have had to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E
5|$|Rappaport died in 1994, and in January 1995 {{developer}} P Associates {{announced its}} agreement {{to buy the}} properties from his estate. The developer also disclosed {{plans to build a}} luxury residential tower at the site. The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York Row houses would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new plan that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The new plan, which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the roof ridge line.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward {{was created}} during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug {{to the west}} of the {{innermost}} ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. HenryIII created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by EdwardI. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13towers that stud the curtain wall. Anti-clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.|$|E
