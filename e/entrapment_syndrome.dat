Only 1 patient (with CTS) showed significant clinical improvement after surgical decompression; the other 4 demonstrated a slight recovery of conduction without lasting clinical relief after conventional treatment. To explain these failures we hypothesized that these <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes</b> were the clinical expression of underlying diffuse damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The conduction values of nerves unaffected by <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes</b> were within normal limits, but almost all distal velocities were below the mean of controls.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} upper limb <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{in a sample of}} veterans with lower limb amputations. Design: A descriptive survey, pilot study. Setting: 2008 National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic. Participants: Twenty participants with various lower limb amputations. Methods: All study participants completed a questionnaire that included symptoms of both upper limbs, medical history, time since amputation, medication history, use of assistive technology, and wheelchair characteristics. A physical examination and electrodiagnostic testing were then performed on each participant. The physical examination included an assessment of bilateral upper limb weakness or sensory abnormalities, thenar/hypothenar atrophy, deep tendon reflexes, Tinel test of the wrist and elbow, and the Phalen maneuver. All nerve conduction studies were performed by an American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine-certified physiatrist. Outcome Measures: Correlation between symptoms, examination findings, and electrodiagnostic findings with the participant's demographic data in the questionnaire. Results: Twenty participants (19 men and 1 woman) were enrolled in the study, with a total of 38 upper limbs evaluated. The mean age of the study population was 59 ± 13 years, with an average of 23 years since the amputation. Sixteen (80 %) of 20 participants had electrodiagnostic findings consistent with median neuropathy across the wrist (26 / 38 affected limbs, 6 participants with unilateral and 10 with bilateral findings), and 14 (70 %) of 20 participants had ulnar entrapment neuropathy across the elbow (22 / 38 affected limbs, 6 participants with unilateral and 8 with bilateral findings). Several participants (6 of 20, 30 %) were found to have electrodiagnostic evidence of ulnar entrapment neuropathy across the wrist (10 of 38 affected limbs, 2 participants unilateral and 4 bilateral findings). Conclusion: A high number of veterans with lower limb amputations presented with upper limb nerve <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Careful attention to these nerve <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes</b> in lower limb amputees is necessary because the symptoms may be confounded by other chronic pain-related disorders. © 2010 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|The {{surgical}} treatment of peripheral nerve <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes</b> is frequently associated with very good results. However there exist {{a lot of}} interesting fields where the results are not so perfect. From 1996 to 2002 we aimed our effort to the field of <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndromes</b> of the upper arm, where these chronic focal neuropathies are most frequent. The main part of our work was devoted to carpal canal syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome. During the above-mentioned time period, we used 4 different surgical techniques to decompress the carpal canal; classical mid-palmar approach, uniportal endoscopic technique, twin incision technique and flexor carpi radialis approach. On the basis of our results we preferred minimally invasive techniques, especially endoscopic approach. In severe cases we especially preferred the classical approach. Cubital tunnel syndrome - the results of several techniques were compared. Subcutaneous anteposition of the ulnar nerve, simple decompression and parial ulnar epicondylectomy were the most frequent approaches. We also performed other surgical techniques -submuscular anteposition with Z lengthening plastic and anteposition with vascular bundle of the ulnar nerve. In our series the best results were observed in minimally invasive technique, if the indications to these techniques were correct.

Usually, in this case, motor function of the lower leg will not be impaired. This is a key distinction between saphenous nerve neuropathy and lower back radiculopathy.

50|$|In {{carpal tunnel}} syndrome, {{one of the}} tendons or tissues in the carpal tunnel is inflamed, swollen, or fibrotic and puts {{pressure}} on the other structures in the tunnel, including the median nerve. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most commonly reported nerve <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Carpal tunnel syndrome {{is often associated with}} repetitive motions of the wrist and fingers; jobs like typists, pianists, and meat cutters are at particularly high risk. The tough flexor retinaculum {{along with the rest of}} the carpal tunnel cannot expand, putting pressure on the median nerve running through the carpal tunnel with the flexor tendons of the wrist. This results in the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The {{nutcracker}} syndrome (NCS)—is a manifest {{variant of}} nutcracker phenomenon, renal vein <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or mesoaortic compression {{of the left}} renal vein. It results most commonly from the compression of the left renal vein between the abdominal aorta (AA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), although other variants exist. The name derives from the fact that, in the sagittal plane and/or transverse plane, the SMA and AA (with some imagination) {{appear to be a}} nutcracker crushing a nut (the renal vein).There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria are not well defined, which frequently results in delayed or incorrect diagnosis.This condition is {{not to be confused with}} superior mesenteric artery syndrome, which is the compression of the third portion of the duodenum by the SMA and the AA.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the general}} population, popliteal artery <b>entrapment</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PAES) has an {{estimated}} prevalence of 0.16%. It is most {{commonly found in}} young, physically active males. If fact, sixty percent of all cases of this syndrome occur in athletically active males {{under the age of}} 30. The predilection of this syndrome presents in a male to female ratio of 15:1. This discrepancy in prevalence may be partially attributed to the findings that males are generally found to be more physically active than females or because {{a large portion of the}} data accumulated for PAES is from military hospitals that treat mostly male populations. The prevalence of PAES varies through different populations; it increases in those who participate in running, soccer, football, or rugby. [...] During embryonic development, the medial head of gastrocnemius migrates medially and superiorly. This migration can cause structural abnormalities, such as irregular positioning of the popliteal artery, and can account for the rare instances of entrapment caused by the popliteus muscle. Less than 3% of all people are born with this anatomical defect that progresses into PAES, and of those who are born with the anatomical defect, the majority never develop symptoms. Bilateral presentation of PAES is found in approximately 25% of cases.|$|E
