The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting Porsche 956 in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime, however its results were hampered by poor reliability and fuel economy and it only managed to win three European and World Endurance Championship races. The team's <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> against the dominant Porsche 956 and 962 sports cars led it {{to drop out of}} sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Kruczek {{guided the}} team as a Division I-A {{independent}} until 2002. After six difficult years as an independent, UCF played its much-anticipated first season {{as a member of}} the Mid-American Conference in 2002. They finished runner-up in the East division with a 6–2 conference record. They finished the season 7–5 overall, completing their 14th winning season in the past 17 years. The excitement, however, would be short-lived. After signing a three-year contract extension at the beginning of the 2003 season, Kruczek was fired following a 3–7 start. Kruczek was replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach and former player Alan Gooch who finished out the dismal 3-9 season with losses to Mid-American Conference rivals Marshall and Miami (OH). The Marshall game marked UCF's first nationally televised home football game as it was aired on ESPN2. Kruczek ended his 6–year stewardship of UCF with a 36–30 (.545) record. An increasing travel burden, <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> with much better MAC teams, and lack of natural rivals within the midwest-based MAC saw UCF begin to explore the possibility of a different conference affiliation after just a couple years in the conference. In 2003, UCF was invited as an all-sports member of Conference USA beginning with the 2005 season.|$|E
500|$|Most {{publications}} {{agreed that}} the Wii counterpart of Mario & Sonic had clean textures and well-done animations; N-Europe's Iun Hockley thought that each character was pleasingly rendered, and Thomas added that the graphics were [...] "crisp and colorful". Mark Bozon preferred the remixed Nintendo and Sega music and thought the general Olympic-related music [...] " [...] be a bit generic". GameDaily's Robert Workman called the background music [...] "mostly forgettable". Echoing this sentiment for the DS version, Emily Balistrieri of GamePro thought [...] "most of the music [...] too interesting". Compared to the Wii version, the DS version's visuals are of the same style and its graphics are nearly on the same level. Due to the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> against other players online, Harris regarded Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games limited use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a [...] "missed opportunity". Many reviewers, including Gibson and Pro-G's James Orry, found the uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process. Although the home console version also has online rankings, it lacks direct competition between players. Disappointed with the aforementioned aspect, Bozon rationalized that the leaderboards [...] "certainly [...] sense for a game like this".|$|E
40|$|Frustration refers <b>to</b> the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> satisfy <b>competing</b> {{interactions}} simultaneously, often {{leading to}} {{a large number of}} degenerate ground states. This can suppress ordering tendencies, sometimes resulting in a spin liquid phase. An intrinsic effect lifting this degeneracy is entropic order-by-disorder. We present strong evidence that a classical nearest neighbor Heisenberg model on the swedenborgite lattice exhibits both an extended spin-liquid phase as well as entropic order-by-disorder choosing planar configurations after a first order transition. We argue that this observation renders magnetic insulators such as RBaCo_ 4 O_ 7, where R denotes a rare earth atom, prime candidates for displaying spin liquid behavior and entropic order-by-disorder physics due to their large exchange constant.

50|$|Male red paper wasps {{engage in}} the role of the patroller as an {{alternative}} mating tactic to the role of the territorial male (who chases away intruders). Patrollers have a smaller body size than territorial males. There is significant competition over the possession of territories. Although these territories do not necessarily hold any resources or nesting sites, owning a territory tends to lead to a greater number of mating opportunities. Males attract females to these territories by rubbing their abdomens across the territories to apply pheromones. Because of their <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>compete</b> against the larger territorial males for territories, smaller males resort to patrolling. But patrollers do not just wait around for territories to be vacated; they will sneak matings with females in territories when the territorial males are temporarily away or distracted.|$|R

50|$|Male red paper wasps {{engage in}} two {{alternative}} mating tactics: {{the role of}} the territorial male (who chases away intruding patrollers) and {{the role of the}} patroller (who flies from tree to tree and does not chase other males). Patrollers have a smaller body size than territorial males. Because of their <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>compete</b> against the larger territorial males for territories, these smaller males resort to patrolling. While physical altercations between territorial males and intruding patrollers are rare (<5% of the time) as the intruders typically quickly depart, there is still significant competition over the possession of territories. Owning a territory tends to lead to more copulations although the territory itself does not hold any resources or nests. The defense of these territories represents a lek polygyny mating system that is not based on resources. But rather, females perhaps incentivize males <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> for territories by restricting mating to these territories; this way, females know that the territorial males they choose to mate with are strong, healthy males. To attract females to the territories, males can rub their abdomens across the territories to apply pheromones. The patrollers do not just wait around for territories to be vacated; they will sneak matings with females in territories when the territorial males are temporarily away or distracted.|$|R
40|$|Fermentation-based {{chemical}} production strategies {{provide a}} feasible route for the rapid, safe, and sustainable {{production of a}} wide variety of important chemical products, ranging from fuels to pharmaceuticals. These strategies have yet to find wide industrial utilization due <b>to</b> their <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> economically <b>compete</b> with traditional extraction and chemical production methods. Here, we engineer for the first time the complex microbial biosynthesis of an anthocyanin plant natural product, starting from sugar. This was accomplished through the development of a synthetic, 4 -strain Escherichia coli polyculture collectively expressing 15 exogenous or modified pathway enzymes from diverse plants and other microbes. This synthetic consortium-based approach enables the functional expression and connection of lengthy pathways while effectively managing the accompanying metabolic burden. The de novo production of specific anthocyanin molecules, such as calistephin, has been an elusive metabolic engineering target for over a decade. The utilization of our polyculture strategy affords milligram-per-liter production titers. This study also lays the groundwork for significant advances in strain and process design toward the development of cost-competitive biochemical production hosts through nontraditional methodologies...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in theoretical condensed matter physics is the physics of strongly correlated systems in regimes in which all interactions are nearly equally strong. This is particularly the case in quantum spin systems on geometrically frustrated lattices where, the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously satisfy <b>competing</b> exchange interactions, often results {{in the selection of}} magnetically ordered or exotic disordered spin liquid ground states. We report the existence of a quantum macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold in a simple model, the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ model on the kagome lattice, for the ratio of Ising to antiferromagnetic transverse coupling $J_z=- 1 / 2 $.

40|$|The {{literature}} on {{length of stay}} and hospital discharge {{is often used to}} inform policy regarding hospital payment and quality. This literature has evolved from the use of ordinary least squares estimation of linear and log-linear models to the use of survival and competing risk models that control for unobserved patient and hospital heterogeneity. However, the authors tend to adopt different distributional assumptions and often motivate the choice of specific functional forms for the baseline hazard based on the visual inspection of the hazard rate plots. We contribute to this literature by showing that parameter estimates for patient and hospital characteristics in length of stay models are particularly sensitive to underlying assumptions regarding the hazard function. Moreover, we demonstrate that the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between <b>competing</b> risks of discharge destination may lead to distortions in the effect of important explanatory variables such as intensive care utilization.

40|$|In {{response}} to economic globalization and uncertainty, big business mobilized politically in the 1970 s and 1980 s and state managers set up neoliberal economic policies that restructured the institutional arrangements in which corporations are embedded. This article xamines why corporations change {{or do not}} change their form {{during a period of}} economic uncertainty (1981 - 1993). Using a sample of the 100 largest U. S. industrial parent companies, we examine why some corporations organize all or most of their business units as subsidiaries while others retain their multidivisional form. The event-history analysis shows that whereas business political behavior significantly reduces the probability of change to the MLSF, capital dependent corporations are significantly more likely to change from the multidivisional form to the multilayered subsidiary form (MLSF). The case study of Enron Corporation shows that in the absence of regulation, the MLSF results in opportunistic managerial behaviors. In the 1970 s, the political economy of the United States began to undergo a transition. Many corporations experienced lower profits and higher debt. By the early 1980 s, big busi-ness mobilized politically in an attempt to cope with capital shortages and an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> effec-tively <b>compete</b> in domestic and global markets.

40|$|Prolonged severe {{exercise}} {{stresses the}} cardiovascular {{system with the}} need <b>to</b> address the <b>competing</b> demands of blood flow to both the exercising muscles and the skin, while maintaining arterial blood pressure for adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain. With the imposition of an environmental heat load in addition to a high metabolic heat load, core temperature steadily increases along with a number of associated circulatory adjustments that inevitably signal an increasing strain on homeostatic control. Whether endurance performance under these conditions is limited by the rise in core temperature (critical core temperature hypothesis) or is limited by the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> meet the <b>competing</b> demands for blood flow is debatable. The “critical core temperature ” hypothesis is centered on an elevated body temperature providing peripheral afferent feedback from temperature-sensitive sites to the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in reduced CNS drive to the exercising muscles. Alternatively, exercise endurance in the heat may be limited by the rise in heart rate (HR) toward maximum HR that accompanies the increase in core temperature. The rise in HR is thought to compensate for a decrease in stroke volume (SV) as central venous pressure declines due to increased skin blood flow. However, recent research suggests that the upward drift in HR is the primary event that causes a decline in SV. Thus, the circulatory strain associated with HR approaching maximum and an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> maintain cardiac output may signal fatigue in prolonged exercise in the heat...|$|R
30|$|The {{groundwater}} {{that used}} for irrigation {{all the time}} contains computable quantities of dissolved substances, which are called salts. The salts existing in the groundwater, besides affecting {{the growth of the}} plants directly, also affect the soil structure, permeability and aeration, which indirectly affect the plant growth. The most influential water quality guideline on crop productivity is the water salinity hazard measured by electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids (Ahmad et al. 2002). Water used for irrigation can vary greatly in quality depending upon type and quantity of dissolved salts. The primary effect of high EC water on crop productivity is the <b>inability</b> of plant <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> with ions in the soil solution for water leading to physiological drought. The higher the EC, the lesser the water available to plants, even though the soil may appear wet. Since plants can only transpire “pure” water, usable plant water in the soil solution decreases dramatically as EC increases (Kumar et al. 2014).|$|R
