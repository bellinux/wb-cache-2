40|$|A {{wingsail}} {{is a solid}} symmetrical aerofoil section {{which creates}} thrust {{in the same manner}} as a conventional sail. Wingsails may either be used as a sole power unit, e. g. for a yacht or catamaran, or as an auxiliary power unit on a larger craft, e. g. fishing vessels, cargo ships or passenger liners. To augment the thrust created by the wingsail, high lift devices are employed to increase both the maximum lift and the stall incidence of the aerofoil. A wingsail must be symmetrical and capable of creating an equal lift force with the flow approaching the leading edge from either side of the wing centreline, i. e. the wingsail surface must act as either the upper, or lower pressure surface. Initial experimental work proved that using a symmetrical slat as a leading edge <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> both delayed the separation of flow over the wingsail upper surface and increased the effective camber of the aerofoil. To increase the thrust created still further, this leading edge <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> was combined with a trailing edge <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>device,</b> a symmetrical single slotted flap. Due to the large number of possible model configurations, a commercially available CFD package was introduced to assist with the design. A series of validation tests comparing the CFD with published and experimental results showed a qualitative agreement with these results. However, the CFD predictions were not sufficiently accurate to be used quantitatively. The computationally designed triple element model was tested experimentally.

40|$|The <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> {{systems of}} modern-day {{commercial}} airplanes are highly effective systems providing the required lift during take-off and approach at low flight velocities. State-of-the-art <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems consist of movable control surfaces which when deployed increase <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> performance. Typical <b>devices</b> are slats and fowler flaps which consist of rigid parts supported and driven by complex mechanical systems. To achieve the goals {{defined in the}} “Vision 2020 ”, technologies to consequently reduce drag and airframe noise will be necessary. In this context especially the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems {{at the leading edge}} are of major interest. Most experts agree that laminarisation is the only technology which has the potential for step changes in drag reduction within a suitable ti-meframe. But this technology requires high quality surfaces and does not comply with conventional <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> like slats. Because of the gap which forms between the slat and the main wing the flow is disturbed and causes transition to turbulent flow immediately after the slat gap. Additionally, the construction space in the next generation high aspect ratio wings is limited due to the employ-ment of slim profiles. Furthermore in recent research programs the slat gap is identified {{to be one of the}} most dominant airframe noise sources in take-off and approach. Therefore smart seamless and gapless <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> especially at the wings leading edge are a mandatory enabler for futu-re wings of significantly increased aerodynamic efficiency.

40|$|Very large {{aircraft}} - {{such as the}} planned Airbus A 3 XX - require correspondingly <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> forces and extended landing gear structures, thus causing potentially very high airframe noise levels during landing approach.

Experimental tests were made in the Cal Tech - Merrill low speed wind tunnel at Pasadena City College on both types of wing with and without fuselage. <b>High</b> <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> investigated were extended leading edge flaps, plain leading edge flaps, extended trailing edge flaps, and split flaps.

All force data was reduced to standard non-dimensional lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients, and the results presented in standard graphical form. In addition, photographs of tuft surveys were made for typical configurations. The maximum lift coefficient obtained from the basic wings was approximately the same for both, but the angle of attack for maximum lift was appreciably lower for the straight wing than for the sweptforward wing. The addition of the fuselage increased the maximum lift coefficient of both the basic wings and of the sweptforward wing with flap configurations, but the fuselage was detrimental to the lift for the straight wing with flap configurations. Straight wing configurations gave respectively <b>higher</b> maximum <b>lift</b> coefficients and larger lift curve slopes than on the comparable sweptforward wing models. All <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> investigated were more effective on the straight wing than on the sweptforward wing. Extended trailing edge flaps were the most effective of the flaps investigated in increasing the maximum lift, but gave the largest negative increase in the pitching moments.
