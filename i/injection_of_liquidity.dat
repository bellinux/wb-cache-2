40|$|Banks {{rely heavily}} on {{incoming}} payments from other banks to fund their own payments. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, destroyed facilities in Lower Manhattan, leaving some banks unable to send payments through the Federal Reserve's Fedwire payments system. As a result, many banks received fewer payments than expected, causing unexpected shortfalls in banks' liquidity. These disruptions also made it harder for banks to redistribute balances across the banking system in a timely manner. In this article, the authors measure the payments responses of banks to the receipt of payments from other banks, both under normal circumstances and during the days following the attacks. Their analysis suggests that the significant <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> by the Federal Reserve, first through the discount window and later through open market operations, were important in allowing banks to reestablish their normal patterns of payments coordination.

40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, {{one of the most}} prominent examples of unconventional monetary stimulus was Japan's "quantitative easing policy" (QEP). Most analysts agree that QEP did not succeed in stimulating aggregate demand sufficiently to overcome persistent deflation. However, it remains unclear whether QEP simply provided little stimulus, or whether its positive effects were overwhelmed by the contractionary forces in Japan's post-bubble economy. In the spirit of Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Hosono (2006), this paper uses bank-level data from 2000 to 2009 to examine the effectiveness in promoting bank lending of a key element of QEP, the Bank <b>of</b> Japan's <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> into the interbank market. We identify a robust, positive, and statistically significant effect <b>of</b> bank <b>liquidity</b> positions on lending, suggesting that the expansion of reserves associated with QEP likely boosted the flow of credit. However, the overall size of that boost was probably quite small. First, the estimated response <b>of</b> lending to <b>liquidity</b> positions in our regressions is small. Second, much of the effect of the BOJ's reserve injections on bank liquidity was offset as banks reduced their lending to each other. Finally, the effect <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> on lending appears to have held only during the initial years of QEP, when the banking system was at its weakest; by 2005, even before QEP was abandoned, the relationship between liquidity and lending had evaporated.

The empirical analysis shows that, in addition to credit risk, a relevant variable for explaining the interbank rate dynamics is the outstanding volume in the Asset Backed Commercial Paper market. In short, the large spread observed in the market is explained by the inter-relationship between collateralized short-term debt markets and the unsecured interbank market.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an equilibrium {{model for the}} demand and supply of liquidity {{and its impact on}} asset prices and welfare. Costs of participation in the market prevent agents from synchronizing their trades. The resulting order imbalances generate the need for and the supply of liquidity endogenously. The liquidity need, driven purely by idiosyncratic shocks, causes large price deviations from fundamentals, giving rise to excessively volatile and fat-tailed returns. Moreover, market mechanism leads to inefficient liquidity provision as it fails to fully internalize the positive externality from trading and supplying liquidity. The failure of the market in supplying liquidity yields interesting welfare implications. For example, lowering the cost of spot participation (e. g., through direct <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> or relaxation of ex post margin constraints) can decrease welfare while forcing full participation (e. g., through coordination of trading) can improve welfare...|$|E

50|$|Drawing {{lessons from}} the 2007-2008 {{financial}} crisis, in a May 2013 Journal of Governance and Regulation article Pichet suggests a new central banking theory for the world’s older industrialised countries. The idea is that central bankers in the Global North failed to anticipate the crisis but were still able to adopt emergency measures saving the banking and financial systems: conventional measures such as massive cuts in interest rates (and a similarly massive <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidities</b> into the bank system in exchange for strong guarantees, i.e. financial assets with an at least BBB- rating); and non-conventional measures, including huge purchases of state debt. The article strongly criticises the European Central Bank’s May 2010 decision to purchase Greek state debt in large quantities (totalling €40 billion by 2013) {{at a time when}} the country was being downgraded. This policy ran counter to prudential doctrine, according to which central banks are only supposed to purchase investment grade assets. It also failed to lower Greek Treasury bond yields and exposed the ECB to heavy losses in case Greece defaulted. This contrasted with the actions taken by the US and UK central banks, who bought secure AA+ rated securities issued by their national governments.|$|R
40|$|The United States (US) {{subprime}} crisis, {{driven by}} the decline in US house prices and the subsequent threats of mortgage defaults, has had a significant (negative) impact on financial markets. From 2006 onwards, threats of US mortgage loan defaults heightened and prices of collateralized asset-backed securities (ABS) containing subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) tumbled, all of which resulted in an almost complete halt in trading and disruption in the normal price discovery process. Furthermore, financial markets suffered from significant recessionary expectations as both market and funding liquidity shrunk within the financial system. Caruana and Kodres (2008) {{point out that the}} average maturity of US short-term asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) shortened by six days with outstanding ABCP declines amounting to approximately $ 300 billion from August 2007 onwards. As the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> both money markets and structured credit markets withered, the ability of banking institutions to raise external funds was severely impaired. Meanwhile, the level of interbank lending also declined as evidenced by the widening of LIBOR overnight index swap spreads. These national effects evolved into a global (and catastrophic) context, and was followed by a series of collapses and bailouts of renowned financial institutions, most notably, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual, AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All of these effects led to a prolonged period of global economic recession characterized by frequent <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and rescue actions by central banks and government authorities...|$|R

By definition an increase in aid must go toward {{a reduction in the}} current account balance (absorbed aid), an increase in capital outflows, or reserve accumulation. It is found that short-run absorption is typically very low, with much aid exiting through the capital account. Moreover, aid spending, defined in terms of the increase in government fiscal expenditures as a result of aid, is significantly greater than aid absorption, implying that aid systematically leads to an <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>liquidity</b> in recipient economies. The evidence here may help illuminate the rather weak link between aid and growth found in the literature.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to examine the link between monetary policy and financial stability. We begin with a general discussion {{in the form of}} a literature review. No doubt, proper regulation and effective supervision are crucial to keeping the financial system stable. We claim that financial deregulation has undermined these conditions. Under such circumstances monetary policy may particularly easily create conditions which are propitious to the development of financial imbalances. Monetary policy may be a reason for asset price booms (and bust) and financial distress even though goods and services prices remain stable. This suggests a need for activist policy targeted at financial stability which we discuss in the second part of the paper. It shows that policy oriented at contradicting asset price inflation has not been generally accepted. In particular, under “Greenspan’s doctrine ” any activist policy promoting financial stability as a goal independent from price stability has been refuted. This leads us to a closer look at the Fed’s monetary policy under Greenspan in the third part of the paper. We claim that this policy was successful in many respects but it failed to recognize the risks of financial instability and eventually it became pro-cyclical. In this sense the present financial and economic crisis is a part of Greenspan’s legacy. In the fourth part of the paper we analyze the Fed’s policy in face of the crisis under the current Chairman Ben Bernanke. This policy is based on very aggressive <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> on the scale never experienced before which creates risks for healthy financial foundation of the economy.

40|$|Defaults {{arising from}} {{illiquidity}} {{can lead to}} private workouts, formal bankruptcy proceedings or even liquidation. All these outcomes can result in deadweight losses. Corporate illiquidity {{in the presence of}} realistic capital market frictions can be managed by (a) equity dilution, (b) carrying positive cash balances, or (c) entering into loan commitments with a syndicate of lenders. An efficient way to manage illiquidity is to rely on mechanisms that transfer cash from "good states" into "bad states" (i. e., financial distress) without wasting liquidity in the process. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of costly equity dilution as a method to deal with illiquidity, and characterize its effects on corporate debt prices and optimal capital structure. We show that equity dilution produces lower firm value in general. Next, we consider two alternative mechanisms: cash balances and loan commitments. Abstracting from future investment opportunities and share re-purchases, which are strong reasons for corporate cash holdings, we show that carrying positive cash balances for managing illiquidity is in general inefficient relative to entering into loan commitments, since cash balances (a) may have agency costs, (b) reduce the riskiness of the firm thereby lowering the option value to default, (c) postpone or reduce dividends in good states, and (d) tend to inject liquidity in both good and bad states. Loan commitments, on the other hand, (a) reduce agency costs, and (b) permit <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> in bad states as and when needed. Then, we study the trade-offs between these alternative approaches to managing corporate illiquidity. We show that loan commitments can lead to an improvement in overall welfare and reduction in spreads on existing debt for a broad range of parameter values. We derive explicit pricing formulas for debt and equity prices. In addition, we characterize the optimal draw down strategy for loan commitments, and study its impact on optimal capital structure.

Our measure <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data.

This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity.

The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profi t, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> where almost all the variables considered were signifi cant.

Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outfl ow <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the infl uence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions.
