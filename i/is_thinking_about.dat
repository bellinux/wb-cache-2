He {{has once again}} become bored with human society and <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> taking one of his periodic sabbaticals, alone in a spaceship far away from other people. He meets Nessus, a Pierson's puppeteer, who offers him a mysterious job with almost no details. Intrigued, Louis eventually accepts.

25|$|Meanwhile, Chaereas {{has heard}} she is alive, and has gone looking for her, but is himself {{captured}} and enslaved, {{and yet they}} both come {{to the attention of}} Artaxerxes, the Great King of Persia, who must decide who is her rightful husband, but <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> acquiring her for himself. When war erupts, Chaereas successfully storms the Persian stronghold of Tyre on behalf of the Egyptian rebels, and then wins a naval victory against the Persians, after which the lovers are finally reunited. Callirhoe writes to Dionysius, telling him to bring up her son and send him to Syracuse when he grows up. Chaereas and Callirhoe return in triumph to Syracuse, where Callirhoe offers prayers to Aphrodite, who has guided the events of the narrative.|$|E

25|$|It is {{relatively}} difficult {{to start a}} housing co-op because if the idea is, for instance, to build a building or group of buildings to house the members, this usually takes a significant mortgage loan for which a financial institution will want assurances of responsibility. It may also take {{a year or more}} for the members to organize the design and construction, as well as time and foresight to establish even basic organizational policies. It is rare that these kinds of skills of organization are available in a random group of people who often have pressures on their existing housing. It may be somewhat easier to organize a group of closely related housing units. This opportunity may arise, for example, if an existing apartment building's owner <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> selling it.|$|E

500|$|The pilot episode {{introduces}} the six main {{characters of the}} series, {{as well as the}} cast of supporting characters. Casey McCall, one of the co-anchors of Sports Night, a sports television roundup show running at 11pm on CSC, the [...] "number 3 sports network" [...] – a channel modeled on ESPN and similar – is displaying a negative attitude, both on and off screen, {{as a result of his}} recent divorce. Dan Rydell, his co-anchor, tries to get back his positive attitude, while J.J. and the network executives begin to get vocal about his need to improve or leave the company. Dana Whitaker, his producer, vociferously defends him to the executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, even while she tries to get him to shape up before they override her shielding of him. At the same time, Casey himself <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> quitting sports broadcasting, citing the moral decay he's seen on the job, in spite of Dan's observation that he'd only be doing it for the wrong reasons. Dana also hires a new associate producer, the highly strung but brilliant Jeremy Goodwin, who co-producer Natalie Hurley takes a liking to. At the end of the episode, a unique sporting event involving the return of a 41-year-old injured athlete to the running track makes Casey change his mind.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a relationship you had and then lost. I {{think one of the most}} powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, because a lot of people can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the narration in Os Lusíadas consists of grandiloquent speeches by various orators: the main narrator; Vasco da Gama, recognized as [...] "eloquent captain" [...] ("facundo capitão"); Paulo da Gama; Thetis; and the Siren who tells the future in Canto X. The poet asks the Tágides (nymphs of the river Tagus) to give him [...] "a high and sublime sound,/ a grandiloquent and flowing style" [...] ("um som alto e sublimado, / Um estilo grandíloquo e corrente"). In contrast to the style of lyric poetry, or [...] "humble verse" [...] ("verso humilde"), he <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> this exciting tone of oratory. There are in the poem some speeches that are brief but notable, including Jupiter's and the Old Man of the Restelo's.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first and}} best known book, Being and Time (1927), though unfinished, {{is one of}} the central {{philosophical}} works of the 20th century. In the first division of the work, Heidegger attempted to turn away from [...] "ontic" [...] questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called Dasein ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of Being-in-the-world, in opposition to Rationalist thinkers like René Descartes who located the essence of man in our thinking abilities. For Heidegger thinking <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open [...] "possibility-for-being." [...] He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are [...] "always already" [...] concerned with, and to our Being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.|$|E
2500|$|Hassan {{explained}} that Lynsey does not {{cope with the}} challenge very well as she has already been pushed to breaking point over recent months and now she is trapped having to play Silas' psychotic game. Lynsey can not rest as she <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the challenge, she is losing sleep and she has already lost her friends over her claims. It {{is a lot to}} have [...] "resting on her shoulders - she knows that somebody's life is in her hands. Lynsey tries to stand up to Silas, but he outwits her at every turn". At her [...] "lowest ebb", Lynsey confides in Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) whose girlfriend, Jenny (Daisy Turner), was killed by Silas. Hassan {{explained that}} Lynsey takes a big risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows her a lot of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling like she has no way of figuring the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone. Hassan said that by the time Halloween arrives Lynsey feels [...] "totally tired and exhausted". Silas reveals that Lynsey is the woman he intended to kill but she escapes. Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed.|$|E

2500|$|The analogy he {{provides}} {{to explain his}} theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human <b>is</b> potentially <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. Therefore, {{he says that the}} First Intellect must always <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's [...] "acquired intellect" [...] and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.|$|R
