2500|$|Waltrip {{began his}} career with Fox, in the 2001 Daytona 500. His younger brother, Michael Waltrip, won the race, but Michael's victory was overshadowed {{by the death of}} Dale Earnhardt. On the last lap, Earnhardt's car made contact with Sterling Marlin, as the black #3 drifted low on the track, {{probably}} attempting a blocking maneuver so that either Michael Waltrip or Dale Earnhardt, Jr., could win the race. Both cars were fielded by DEI, although Earnhardt (Sr.) himself drove for RCR. After contacting the Marlin car, Earnhardt's car suddenly veered right and slammed hard into the retaining wall in turn four along with Ken Schrader. This was before NASCAR mandated the use of the HANS device {{to reduce the risk of}} catastrophic head and neck injuries, and the [...] "SAFER" [...] (Steel and Foam Energy Reduction) barriers used at all NASCAR tracks today. After the cars of Earnhardt and Schrader came to rest in the infield, Schrader immediately exited his car and went to the attention of Earnhardt. Schrader <b>gestured</b> <b>for</b> the rescue crews to hurry to the Earnhardt car, but Earnhardt had died instantly during the crash. Meanwhile, Michael Waltrip won the race with Darrell Waltrip shouting for joy as he called the final run to the checkered flag. His joy at his brother's victory soon gave way to concern for Earnhardt as he watched replays of the crash. Waltrip and Earnhardt had been bitter rivals on the track in the 1980s but as the years passed, the rivalry and bitterness had given way to a deep respect and close friendship. After the race, Waltrip was taken from the Fox Broadcast booth to the Halifax Medical Center to meet with the Earnhardt family and his brother Michael. Waltrip later gave the invocation at the Earnhardt funeral and gave the invocation at the following week's race praying for Earnhardt and the promise of moving on from the tragedy.|$|E

This paper presents a case-study on the design and development of a tangible product based on the Skweezee system, namely a cushion remote.

5000|$|On October 15, 2015 he {{was arrested}} from Dhaka's Uttara area, after the Supreme Court {{cleared the way for}} his arrest in two cases filed for {{shooting}} a 10-year-old boy and vandalizing a house in Gaibandha. Witnesses allege that on October 2, Liton shot 10 year old shot Sourav Mia in both legs when he was taking a morning walk with his uncle at Gopalcharan village in Gaibandha. Liton was travelling in his car when <b>gestured</b> <b>for</b> Sourav Mia's uncle, Shahjahan to come near him. Scared, Shahjahan started running away. This prompted the enraged Liton his personal gun. Two bullets tore through Sourav's right leg and one through the left. Sourav's father Saju Mia also alleged that Liton also tried to prevent them from taking his critically wounded son to Rangpur Medical College Hospital. The following day, the victim's father filed a case with Sundarganj Police Station, accusing Liton of attempted murder. The other case was filed on October 6 against Liton and nine of “his men” on charges of vandalising a house and looting furniture and corrugated iron sheets from its roof in a Gaibandha village soon after the shooting. The incident triggered a furore in Liton’s constituency with residents calling for the cancellation of his Parliament membership. Responding to reporters’ questions, Home minister Asaduzzamnan Khan said: [...] "No one is above the law… The administration will now take action against the MP in accordance with the court instructions," [...] and assured the judiciary in support for the case.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the third}} round was about to begin, Tyson {{came out of his}} corner without his mouthpiece. Lane ordered Tyson back to his corner to insert it. Tyson {{inserted}} his mouthpiece, got back into position and the match resumed. Tyson began {{the third round}} with a furious attack. With forty seconds remaining in the round Holyfield got Tyson in a clinch, and Tyson rolled his head above Holyfield's shoulder and bit Holyfield on his right ear, avulsing a one-inch piece of cartilage {{from the top of the}} ear, and spitting out the piece of ear on the ring floor. As Holyfield shrieked in pain and jumped in circles, he managed to push Tyson away at which Lane called for a time-out. As Holyfield turned to walk to his corner, Tyson shoved him from behind. Lane sent Tyson to a neutral corner as an enraged Holyfield <b>gestured</b> <b>for</b> Mills Lane to look at his bitten ear which was rapidly bleeding. The fight was delayed for several minutes as Lane debated what to do. Lane's original decision was to immediately disqualify Tyson, but after the ringside doctor determined that Holyfield was able to continue despite the massive bite, Lane announced he would be deducting two points from Tyson and the fight would continue. Bobby Czyz, who was calling the fight with Steve Albert for Showtime, said, [...] "I wonder how this would have played in Mitch Halpern's eyes," [...] and Albert told Czyz, [...] "That's a thought, Bobby." [...] As Lane explained the decision to Tyson and his cornermen, Tyson asserted that the injury to Holyfield's ear was the result of a punch. [...] "Bullshit," [...] retorted Lane.

40|$|Controlling {{a virtual}} {{character}} {{with a pen}} input device is difficult. Pen input devices require freeform gestures and users are not confined to particular mapping of a key or a button that is exactly repeatable.

In this paper, we explore user preferred input <b>gestures</b> <b>for</b> character control through user experiments. Most previous pen input gesture sets {{are based on the}} preference of the developer.

For our experiment, we have chosen navigational motions that are common for controlling a character in a virtual world.
