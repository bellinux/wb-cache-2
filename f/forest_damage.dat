Today the Steinwald in Northeast Bavaria {{is one of the main}} areas of concern. This is due to the high levels of sulphur dioxide emission from the burning of brown coal in the nearby Eger Basin, to acid rain and to the many days of mist and fog. The <b>forest</b> <b>damage,</b> which is clearly visible, has remained since 1986 at about the same level of 32%. Research to date has shown that its causes are complex and involve biotic and abiotic factors, however environmental pollution plays a significant role.Forestry management measures include fertilising in order to counteract the lack of magnesium which causing a yellowing of the pine needles.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problem in the Swedish forestry is damages caused by wild deer. The damages result in great consequences, not only economical due to quality and production loss, they also effect the biodiversity in the forest. The main principle in Swedish forestry is that damages should be avoided. Different measures are available to prevent and reduce already existing damages, the measures are many and of different character. The report Survey of <b>forest</b> <b>damages</b> and wild deer {{is the result of a}} cooperation with Södra forest owner association. With 50 000 members and 36 000 connected forest farms, Södra is the largest forest owner association in Sweden. The purpose of the study Survey of <b>forest</b> <b>damages</b> and wild deer is to examine and map how members within Södra experience problems caused by wild deer, what kind of help is requested from Södra and which measures are made by the members to prevent damages. The report is based on a survey sent to members within the Kinna region. The survey contained 31 questions and was sent to 152 randomly selected members. 41 answers were returned and later processed. The answers collected shows that almost every one of the respondents conducts measures to prevent unacceptable damages caused by wild deer. The most common measure is hunting. The most common measure to save value in already <b>damaged</b> <b>forest</b> is pruning. Among the measures to provide game with feed, environmental regard in connection to forestry measures is most commonly occurring. The main part of the forest owners state that they have little problems with damages caused by fallow and red deer while damages caused by elk and roe deer are more common. Södras members asks for more information about the wild deer -elk and roe deer. How to create feed for wild game, how to save value in already <b>damaged</b> <b>forests</b> and how to avoid unacceptable damages caused by wild deer are other areas where the members want more information from the association...|$|R

Previous diebacks were regionally limited, but starting {{at the end of the}} 1970s a decline took over the forests of Central Europe and parts of North America. The <b>forest</b> <b>damage</b> in Germany was different because the decline was severe, up to 50% of the trees, prolonged, over 5 years, and widespread across tree species.
