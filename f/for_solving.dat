5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, {{theorists have}} {{discovered}} many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved {{are generally not}} viable models of the real world, but they have certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful <b>for</b> <b>solving</b> problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model <b>for</b> <b>solving</b> problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
