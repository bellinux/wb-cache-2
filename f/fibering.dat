40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of <b>fiber</b> {{dimensional}} irregularities on the tensile behavior of <b>fiber</b> bundles is modeled, using the finite element method (FEM). <b>Fiber</b> dimensional irregularities are simulated with sine waves of different magnitude. The specific stress-strain curves of <b>fiber</b> bundles and the constituent single <b>fibers</b> are obtained and compared. The results indicate that <b>fiber</b> diameter irregularity along <b>fiber</b> length has {{a significant effect on}} the tensile behavior of the <b>fiber</b> bundle. For a bundle of uniform <b>fibers</b> of different diameters, all constituent <b>fibers</b> will break simultaneously regardless of the <b>fiber</b> diameter. Similarly, if <b>fibers</b> within a bundle have the same pattern and level of diameter irregularity along <b>fiber</b> length, the <b>fibers</b> will break at the same time also regardless of the difference in average diameter of each <b>fiber.</b> In these cases, the specific stress and strain curve for the bundle overlaps with that of the constituent <b>fibers.</b> When the <b>fiber</b> bundle consists of single <b>fibers</b> with different levels of diameter irregularity, the specific stress-strain and load-elongation curves of the <b>fiber</b> bundle exhibit a stepped or “ladder” shape. The <b>fiber</b> with the highest irregularity breaks first, even when the thinnest section of the <b>fiber</b> is still coarser than the diameter of a very thin but uniform <b>fiber</b> in the bundle.

40|$|This study {{approaches}} the phenomena of thermomechanical defibration of wood by examining single <b>fiber</b> properties. A hypothesis was formed based on literature: The defibration patterns due to impacts during <b>fiber</b> separation and high-consistency refining {{are related to}} the morphological properties of <b>fibers.</b> This is because: The effects caused by the action of defibration vary in morphologically different <b>fibers,</b> and The defibration action in the plate gap is influenced by the properties of the <b>fiber</b> material in the plate gap and changes as the properties of the <b>fiber</b> material in the plate gap change. In other words: the character of the <b>fiber</b> material affects the defibration result through two routes: firstly the defibration patterns of <b>fibers</b> {{are related to the}}ir properties, and secondly the character of the <b>fiber</b> bed in the plate gap influences the defibration action. The defibration patterns of <b>fiber</b> shortening, <b>fiber</b> wall thickness reduction and changing of <b>fiber</b> wall internal structure are discussed. The experimental part focuses on the defibration effects which are the measurable deformations in the <b>fibers</b> as a result of defibration actions. Defibration patterns are a set of defibration effects that develop the stiff wood <b>fibers</b> into papermaking <b>fibers</b> and fines particles. These concepts can be applied to all mechanical pulping processes, but this thesis focuses on their application to the TMP process and spruce as raw material. <b>Fiber</b> shortening was the result of cutting of <b>fibers</b> during the <b>fiber</b> separation stage. Fast-grown and thinner-walled <b>fibers</b> were more resistant than thick walled slow growth <b>fibers</b> towards the harsh conditions prevailing during <b>fiber</b> separation. Faster warming up of the <b>fiber</b> wall as a result of compression and relaxation of the material as well as encountering fewer shear forces than thick-walled incompressible <b>fiber</b> material were suggested as explanations for the different response of these <b>fibers.</b> The gradual peeling off of layers from the <b>fiber</b> surface resulted in reduction of <b>fiber</b> wall thickness. Different types of <b>fibers</b> produced different types of fines. The fibrillar fines were formed mainly from thick-walled <b>fibers,</b> and 50 - 100 % of the fibrillated <b>fibers</b> originated from latewood. The flake-like fines originated both from outer layers of latewood and earlywood <b>fibers</b> during <b>fiber</b> separation stage but also from pieces of the thinwalled earlywood <b>fibers</b> during the later stages of the whole defibration process. Only half of the fines fraction was formed as a result of peeling off of <b>fiber</b> wall. The rest consisted of ray cells, pieces of <b>fibers</b> and <b>fiber</b> wall formed as a result of <b>fiber</b> cutting or splitting. The differences in the <b>fiber</b> wall thickness did not explain the flexibility differences between initially refined and highly refined samples. From this was concluded that the <b>fiber</b> wall flexibility increased and <b>fiber</b> wall structure loosened during the defibration. Local swelling of the <b>fiber</b> wall was revealed using optical sectioning by confocal laser scanning microscopy.
