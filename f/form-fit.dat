50|$|One of {{the most}} {{defining}} features of the flex layout {{is its ability to}} <b>form-fit,</b> based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in size—either decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to be constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than those, for example, of the block and inline display types, which are generally uni-directional. Indeed, not only can flex directional flow be specified, at the style level, as rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards; individual items within a flex container may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.|$|E

50|$|The Big Classic was {{introduced}} in September 1986 {{as part of a}} line of sandwiches that were launched during a major corporate restructuring of Wendy's. Initially, it was in a clamshell-style styrofoam; this was a clam container that <b>form-fitted</b> the sandwich but was replaced later on with its signature foil wrapper as a result of environmental concerns. Some years later the recipe was changed so that two strips of bacon were added, and the name changed to the Big Bacon Classic. It was replaced on the menu with the Baconator in June 2007, but one can still order the sandwich. The Big Bacon Classic returned to Wendy's menu in October 2009, was called the Bacon Deluxe, and contained four strips of bacon instead of two until its discontinuation in June 2012.

40|$|Joining by {{electromagnetic}} forming is a non-contact assembling {{method that}} is especially suitable for connections in aluminum space frame structures. By reason of increased joint strength along with lower charging energies, <b>form-fit</b> connections are favored over interference-fit connections for this joining process. In contrast to conventional <b>form-fit</b> concepts, {{in which the}} inner joining partner has grooves or pockets, the use of knurled surfaces offers several advantages like easier machinability or the resistance against combined axial and torsional loadings.

For that reason, experimental studies were conducted: In addition to pull-out tests to determine the axial strength of joints, first computed tomographic images and, afterwards, micrographs of joined components were produced to analyze the contact zone between tube and mandrel and the deformation behavior of the inner joining partner by non-destructive and destructive means.

By the use of joining by forming, the interference- fit, preload and <b>form-fit</b> of macro-fiber arrays are achieved in a single process step. The paper describes investigations of the joining by forming process in formal planned experiments using the design of experiments method.

40|$|Skeletal muscle {{metabolism}} is impaired in disorders like diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease. The skeletal muscle echo planar imaging (EPI) signal (SEPI) {{and its relation}} to energy metabolism are still debated. Localised 31 P MRS and SEPI data from gastrocnemius medialis of 19 healthy subjects were combined in one scanning session to study direct relationships between phosphocreatine (PCr), pH kinetics and parameters of T 2 time courses. Dynamic spectroscopy (semi-LASER) and EPI were performed immediately before, during and after 5 min of plantar flexions. Data were acquired in a 7 T MR scanner equipped with a custom-built ergometer and a dedicated 31 P/ 1 H radio frequency (RF) coil array. Using a <b>form-fitted</b> multi-channel 31 P/ 1 H coil array resulted in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). PCr and pH in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle were quantified from each 31 P spectrum, acquired every 6 s. During exercise, SEPI(t) was found to be a linear function of tissue pH(t) (cross-correlation r = – 0. 85 ± 0. 07). Strong Pearson’s correlations were observed between post exercise time-to-peak (TTP) of SEPI and (a) the time constant of PCr recovery τPCr recovery (r= 0. 89, p< 10 6), (b) maximum oxidative phosphorylation using the linear model, Qmax, lin (r= 0. 65, p= 0. 002), the adenosine-diphosphate-driven model, Qmax,ADP (r= 0. 73, p= 0. 0002) and (c) end exercise pH (r= 0. 60, p= 0. 005). Based on combined accurately localised 31 P MRS and T 2 weighted MRI, both with high temporal resolution, strong correlations of the skeletal muscle SEPI during exercise and tissue pH time courses and of post exercise SEPI and parameters of energy metabolism were observed.

50|$|With a {{production}} budget of $3.3 million, Splash, Too {{was the first}} movie to be filmed at the then-new Disney-MGM Studios complex. Dozens of actresses were looked at {{to play the role}} of Madison, but none were right for the role until the producers found Amy Yasbeck, who did a screen test for director Greg Antonacci, was cast at the start of 1988. Yasbeck had to wear a blonde wig (over her red hair, which was cut to her shoulders to accommodate wearing the wig) when playing Madison. Yasbeck went through a crash course in scuba diving as well as extensive physical training to prepare to play Madison in the underwater swimming shoots with her mermaid tail costume. Yasbeck was originally going to wear the mermaid tail costume worn and used by Daryl Hannah from the original Splash (1984) film, but she could not fit into it. (Daryl Hannah's Splash mermaid tail was designed and constructed by Academy Award-winning visual effects artist Robert Short. Thom Shouse was the project foreman on Short's mermaid crew.) After undergoing a bodycast, new <b>form-fitted</b> mermaid tails were made for both her and her stunt double Arlene Klein, by Shouse, best known as the Tail Man. The tails made for Splash, Too were easier to put on than the one made for Hannah since they had been made with a zipper.

Yasbeck received instructions when swimming to only use the tail, and never to use her arms, keeping them at her sides. Yasbeck would spend an hour at a time underwater, frequently taking breaths from the oxygen tanks of nearby divers. The tail was heavy for the actress to wear.|$|R

40|$|As a way {{to reduce}} a vehicle's weight, the {{application}} of space frame structures has been increasing. This innovative lightweight design concept is already commonly applied in the low volume production of cars. Due to the high stiffness and low mass, extruded aluminum profiles are particularly suitable for the manufacturing of such structures. But the potential for great weight reduction using space frames is curtailed by the difficulties associated with manufacturing the space frames. These structures have complex demands on joining technologies, and conventional processes often are pushed to their technological limits. A promising alternative to connect extruded aluminum profiles without heating or penetration is joining by electromagnetic crimping. Compared to adhesive bonding and welding, the process also requires a less extensive preparation of the joining zone. This technique {{is characterized by the}} use of pulsed magnetic fields to form a profile made of an electrically conductivity material into <b>form-fit</b> elements, like grooves, of the other joining partner. Thereby, an interlock is generated which enables the load transfer. A fundamental process understanding of the manufacturing and the load transfer of <b>form-fit</b> connections manufactured by electromagnetic crimping is developed in this thesis.

Limited information is available about how much endosteal cortical contact can actu-ally be achieved with these expensive implants. The aim of this study was therefore to verify the exact cortical contact of a custom made stem using microsections and compar-ing it to a standard stem with similar design. In 8 human femurs (3 matched pairs and 2 separate specimens), custom femoral prosthe-ses (Adaptiva; 5 femurs: 3 matched and 2 sep-arate) and conventional femoral prostheses (Alloclassic; 3 matched femurs) were implant-ed. Endosteal cortical contact was determined from CAD planning drafts and microsections cut from the specimens with a diamond saw. Microsection {{analysis of}} the paired femurs showed that contact between prosthesis and bone varied clearly {{along the length of the}} femoral stem. Total cortical contact was con-siderably greater in custom prostheses than conventional prostheses (custom, 47 %; con-ventional, 32 %), but markedly less than the total contact predicted by the manufacturer (84 % to 90 %).

On 15 February 1969, just one month after the Sheridan's arrival in South Vietnam, an M551 from the 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry detonated a 25-pound pressure-triggered land mine, which ruptured its hull and ignited the 152mm shells, resulting in a secondary explosion that destroyed the tank. In late 1969, nine Sheridans from the 4th Squadron, 12th Cavalry were fording a river near the DMZ, when three of the M551s detonated mines, completely destroying them. On March 1971, five Sheridans from the 11th ACR were lost in one day to RPG fire; all five vehicles burst into flames and were totally destroyed. It became a common scene to observe melted Sheridan hulls with their sunken steel turrets sitting at odd angles with their gun tubes pointing towards the sky {{in various parts of the}} country, either awaiting final disposition, or simply forgotten.|$|R
