40|$|The first officially {{registered}} {{outbreak of}} {{infectious salmon anaemia}} (ISA) started in Norway in November 1984 (Thorud and Djupvik, 1988). It was a chronically proceeding disease among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr in a hatchery on the West Coast of Norway (Bremnes). Affected salmon were lethargic with pale <b>gills,</b> fin <b>rot,</b> exophthalmia, and haemorrhages in the anterior eye chamber and abdominal skin. Other clinical signs were a dark, pale or yellowish liver, a dark and swollen spleen, congested intestinal walls, petechia in periviceral fat, ascitic fluid, oedemas, haemorrhages in the swim bladder wall, and muscular haemorrhages. About 80 % of the parr in the hatchery died during that winter and spring. Judging from the pathological findings, "Hitra disease" was suspected, however, no bacteria were isolated from diseased fish and oxytetracycline did not reduce mortality. In the following years a disease with similar clinical and pathological signs occurred in smolt and adult salmon in marine farms that had received smolt form this hatchery (Thorud 1991). The first official registration of ISA came at a very bad time for Norwegian salmon production. One problem was an ongoing discussion {{of the causes of}} "Hitra disease". Some insisted it was caused by malnutrition (Poppe et al 1986; Salte et al 1987), while others believed it was a bacterial disease (Holm et al 1985; Egidius et al 1986; Totland et al. 1988) and even managed to culture the bacterium that was later named Vibrio salmonicida (disease: cold water vibriosis). The dispute about the causes of "Hitra disease" goes back {{to the end of the}} seventies, and later studies have indicated that the reason for the disagreement was probably that "Hitra disease" encompassed at least three different diseases: cold water vibriosis, cardiomyopathy and ISA. There are several indications of this in articles published in Norwegian (cf. Frisk Fisk brochure from this period, i. e. published reports from the Norwegian Research council). In some electron microscopic studies of tissues from salmon with "Hitra disease", the authors were not able to detect any bacteria and described pathological changes that later studies have shown to be associated with ISA. Even as late as in 1987 the three diseases were confused. One farm in Northern Norway was given the diagnosis Bremnes syndrome (i. e. ISA), but this was later changed to cardiomyopathy. The reason for the confusion was of course the lack of a safe diagnosis. The first indication of ISA can probably be found as early as in 1977 (cf: Poppe et al. 1983). The authors give a review of haemorrhagic syndrome of Atlantic salmon in Norwegian aquaculture. The first case of haemorrhagic syndrome was registered in September/October 1977 in a fish farm close to Hammerfest, Northern Norway. They were not able to isolate any infective agent and therapy with oxytetracycline did not influence the mortality. The same disease was also registered in 1978 and in 1979 it was found in other areas in Northern Norway. Several explanations were given for this syndrome: stress, environmental stress, genetics, water temperature, malnutrition, virus (VHS, but it was not possible to isolate this virus), bacteria (it was not always possible to isolate bacteria, but in some farms Vibrio spp. were found), and physical factors. Studies of tissues from fish with haemorrhagic syndrome have later revealed the presence of ISA virus particles in some of these tissues (A. Nylund, pers. com.). ISA was first named "Bremnes syndrome" after the locality of the first official appearance. This was later changed to Salmon anaemia syndrome (SAS). However, protest from an airline company made another change of name necessary and in 1990 ISA (Infectious Salmon Anaemia) was recognised by the Office International des Epizooties. In the period from the first official outbreak in 1984 until 1991 there was a steady increase in the number of outbreaks of the disease with around 80 in 1990 and 1991 (Figure 1). This increase lead to changes in the structure of salmon farming in Norway. The farmers introduced a system with separate generations at each site and the Norwegian Food Authorities introduced a number of regulatory actions like introduction of zones to combat outbreaks. This lead to a new situation in 1994 with only one official outbreak of ISA (cf. HÃ¥stein et al 1999). The number of outbreaks since 1994 up to the present has increased again to around 10 - 15 outbreaks every year. The number of outbreaks does not reflect the increase in the amount of salmon produced in the same period (1994 - 2010), indicating a certain degree of stabilisation...|$|R

40|$|Fish {{cage culture}} is a rapid aquacultural {{practice}} of producing fish with more yield compared to traditional pond culture. Several species cultured by this method include Cyprinus carpio, Orechromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zilli, Clarias lazera, C. gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Citharinus citharus, Distochodus rostratus and Alestes dentes. However, the culture of fish in cages has some problems that are due to mechanical defects of the cage or diseases due to infection. The mechanical problems which may lead to clogged net, toxicity and easy access by predators depend on defects associated with various types of nets which include fold sieve cloth net, wire net, polypropylene net, nylon, galvanized and welded net. The diseases problems are of two types namely introduced diseases due to parasites. The introduced parasites include Crustaseans, Ergasilus sp. Argulus africana, and Lamprolegna sp, Helminth, Diplostomulum tregnna: Protozoan, Trichodina sp, Myxosoma sp, Myxobolus sp. the second disease problems are inherent diseases aggravated by the very rich nutrient environment in cages for rapid bacterial, saprophytic fungi, and phytoplanktonic bloom resulting in clogging of net, stagnation of water and low biological oxygen demand (BOD).

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} fungal disease of freshwater fishes in Natore district of Bangladesh from September 2005 to February 2006. A total of 2097 fish specimens where about 300 fishes under 15 fish species (8 culturable and 7 non culturable) were infected with fungal disease. Among culturable species most fungal infected fishes was C. mrigala (24. 71 %) where the total length, total weight and group of this infected fish was 10. 8 to 40 cm, 10 to 995 g and 10. 1 to 15 cm respectively followed by C. idellus (16. 28 %) and L. rohita (13. 43 %). Among non culturable species the most fungal infected fish was C. punctatus (22. 42 %) where the total length, total weight and group of this infected fish was 11 to 23 cm, 15 to 20 g and 20. 1 to 25 cm respectively followed by C. striatus (16. 88 %) and P. ticto (15. 31 %).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the isolation and identification of Tenacibaculum maritimum from infected sea bass by using bacteriological, histopathological, and molecular methods. Fish were reared in five different floating net cage farms and two hatcheries located in several regions on the Aegean Sea coast of Turkey. We observed external erythemic and erosive jaw and operculum superficial or deep ulcerative skin lesions {{on the head and}} body surfaces, <b>gill</b> <b>rot,</b> hemorrhagic and erythemic fins in infected individuals, and slight exophthalmia was also detected. In addition, internal hemorrhages and hyperemia in the visceral organs and bloody fluid in the peritoneal cavity were observed. Bacteria isolated from the kidney and skin lesions of the infected fish produced flat, pale colored colonies on Flexibacter maritimus medium (FMM), marine enriched Cytophaga agar (MECA) and Marine Agar (MA) and were identified as Tenacibaculum maritimum, Vibrio sp. and motile or non-motile Aeromonas species. Histopathologically, degeneration and liquefactive necrosis in liver, kidney, and spleen was observed in the individuals infected with Tenacibaculum maritimum. The identification of T. maritimum was performed directly from the infected fish tissue using nested polymerase chain reaction. In this study, T. maritimum induced mostly mixed infection with Vibrio sp. and motile or non-motile aeromonad species in the four fish farms resulting in 25 % mortality. However, this bacterium produced an unmixed infection with the same mortality in young sea bass from only one farm...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to know the culture strategies and fish health and disease problems in pond aquaculture in Mymensingh, Bogra and Pabna districts of Bangladesh. Questionnaire interview and participatory rural appraisal tools like focus group discussion (FGD) were conducted with selected fish farmers. In total 90 farmers were interviewed and 9 FGD sessions were conducted. Most of the respondents practiced carp and pangas polyculture and they had disease problems in their ponds. Prevalence of fish disease varied with cultured species and locations. The most prevalent diseases as reported by the farmers were pop eye (57. 78 %), ventral reddening (55. 55 %), tail and fin rot (48. 89), hemorrhagic lesion over the body surface (45. 56 %), dropsy (40 %), <b>gill</b> <b>rot</b> (40 %), white spot (40 %) and epizootic ulcerative syndrome or EUS (33. 33 %).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to know the status of biosecurity and health management at some selected fish hatcheries in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh district from January to May 2012. Data was collected from 30 hatchery owners through questionnaire interview. The hatcheries produced seeds of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Indian major carps, Thai koi (Anabas testudineus) and Thai pangus (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). The hatchery production activities took place during late February and continued up to September. The peak season of seed production was found during April to May. Biosecurity status of the hatcheries was assessed through some selected activities that have generally been practiced to prevent or spread diseases. The biosecurity status of hatcheries was found quite satisfactory. It was observed that all the hatcheries (100 %) cleaned their hatchery units regularly and majority (83. 33 %) of them maintained good hygine in hatcheries. They also maintained proper water temperature (80 %), disinfected equipments (76. 66 %), stoked disease free broods (76. 66 %) and followed quarantine procedure (66. 66 %). Other biosecurity measures were also used but in very limited state. No hatchery was seen to use vaccine to their brood fish against certain disease. They also did not use any protective clothing. Hatchery owners reported some diseases in brood which included argulosis (34. 09 %), epizootic ulcerative syndrome or EUS (28. 41 %), <b>gill</b> <b>rot</b> (9. 09 %), dropsy (11. 36 %) and nutritional diseases (5. 68 %).

40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{the current status of}} fish disease and health {{management}} practices in rural freshwater aquaculture, a questionnaire survey and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools were used in five districts of Bangladesh namely Mymensingh, Comilla, Jessore, Natore and Dinajpur. A total of 500 farmers were interviewed and 25 PRA sessions were conducted. Most of the farmers (87. 8 %) interviewed had disease problem in their fishponds. Prevalence of fish disease varied with districts and the size of farms. Average prevalence of fish disease was highest in Jessore district (18. 2 %) followed by Comilla (13. 4 %), Mymensingh (11. 4 %) and Dinajpur district (10. 4 %). Minimum prevalence (5. 5 %) was recorded from Natore district. Small farms (0. 4 ha) suffered from high disease prevalence (13. 8 %) followed by medium (0. 2 - 0. 4 ha) and large (> 0. 4 ha) farms with 12. 4 and 9. 3 % of diseases, respectively. The most prevalent disease was tail and fin rot (20. 5 %), followed by epizootic ulcerative syndrome or EUS (18. 9 %), nutritional diseases (15. 3 %), red spot (13. 0 %) and <b>gill</b> <b>rot</b> (12. 3 %). Other conditions like argulosis, dropsy and white spot were also reported by the farmers but with lower incidence. The diseases occurred mainly in the winter season. Overall, the knowledge of the farmers on basic fish health management was found very poor. Most of the farmers (83. 8 %) used treatment measures in response to particular disease problem. For disease treatment, 46 % farmers used combination of lime and potassium permanganate, 22. 4 % farmer used only lime and about 10 % farmer used lime and salt together.

40|$|Thai pangas, Pangasius hypophthalmus {{is one of}} the {{important}} aquaculture species in Bangladesh. Over the last few years spectacular development has been taking place in Thai pangas farming in Mymensingh district. Due to availability of easy breeding and culture techniques as well as quick return, {{more and more people are}} converting their rice fields into pangas farms overnight. The present study was carried out to examine health and disease status of Thai pangas mainly through clinical, histopathological and bacteriological techniques. In addition, for collecting primary data on disease and health status of Thai pangas and the resultant socioeconomic impacts on rural households, questionnaire interview and participatory rural appraisal tools were used with selected farming households in three upazilas of Mymensingh district. The most prevalent diseases as reported by the farmers were red spot, followed by anal protrusion, tail and fin rot, pop eye, dropsy and <b>gill</b> <b>rot.</b> Other conditions like cotton wool type lesion, ulceration and white spot were reported but with lower incidence. Four isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila were recovered from kidney and lesion of diseased fish. Hemorrhage over the body especially near mouth and caudal region was noticed in the fishes associated with aeromonad infection. Internally, kidney, liver and spleen became swollen and enlarged. The isolates varied with their pathogenicity. All the four isolates were sensitive to Nitrofurantoin, Cotrimoxazole and Tetracycline but were resistant to Amoxycilline. An attempt was made to treat diseased fish with extracts from neem leaf, garlic and turmeric. Recovery of infection was monitored through mortality and histopathology. General histopathological changes of different organs were also studied. Extract from neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf gave better result. Telangiectasis, lamellar hypertrophy and hyperplasia hemorrhage, lamellar fusion, necrosis of lamellar epithelial cells, presence of parasites and their cysts were the major pathology of gills. Hemorrhagic lesion, pyknotic nuclei and melanomacrophage centers (MMC) were found in the liver of fish. Major pathologies in kidney of fish included presence of MMC, necrotic and ruptured kidney tubules, severe haemopoietic necrosis, and hemorrhage. The economic loss due to disease in Thai pangas farming was estimated from the difference between expected production and actual production. On an average, Thai pangas farmers of Mymensingh incur a loss of Tk. 23, 104 /ha/cycle due to fish disease (3. 6 % of expected total production). The loss, however, varied with location and size of farms, type of farmers and management practices. The study also highlighted fish health management related problems and recommended further work for the development of user-friendly farmer-oriented fish health management packages...|$|E
