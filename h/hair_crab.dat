40|$|Genetic {{variation}} and population structure of <b>hair</b> <b>crab</b> (Erimacrus isenbeckii) were examined using nucleotide sequence analysis of 580 bp in the 3 ' {{portion of the}} mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) of 20 samples collected from 16 locales in Japan (the Hokkaido and Honshu Islands) and one in Korea. A total of 27 haplotypes was defined by 23 variable nucleotide sites in the examined COI region. Pairwise population FST estimates and neighbor-joining tree inferred distinct genetic differentiation between the representative samples from the Pacific Ocean off the Eastern Hokkaido Island and the Sea of Japan, while others intermediated these two groups. AMOVA also showed a weak but significant differentiation among these three groups. The present results suggest a moderate population structure of <b>hair</b> <b>crab,</b> probably influenced by high gene flow between regional populations due to sea current dependent larval dispersal of this species...|$|E
40|$|Over 230 {{metric tons}} of octopus is {{harvested}} as bycatch annually in Alaskan trawl, long-line, and pot fisheries. An expanding market has fostered interest {{in the development of}} a directed fishery for North Pacific giant octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini). To investigate the potential for fishery development we examined the efficacy of four different pot types for capture of this species. During two surveys in Kachemak Bay, Alaska, strings of 16 – 20 sablefish, Korean <b>hair</b> <b>crab,</b> shrimp, and Kodiak wooden lair pots were set at depths ranging between 62 and 390 meters. Catch per-unit-of-ef for t estimates were highest for sablefish and lair pots. Sablefish pots caught significantly heavier North Pacific giant octopuses but also produced the highest bycatch of commercially important species, such as halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) ...|$|E
