25|$|While much of {{the debate}} focused on the law's precise language, there was {{considerable}} opposition in the Senate, almost entirely from Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson, the former speaking in defense of free speech and the latter assailing the administration for <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well. President Wilson and his Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid hearings that would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from the Justice Department {{and placed it in}} the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality.

25|$|At {{their annual}} meeting in September 1861, Robert Skey stated that the canals brought some £60,000 in trade to the LNWR each year. However, the {{relationship}} with the LNWR was not always smooth, who were castigated at the 1862 meeting for <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> powers which the Shropshire Union already had, to gain control of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire through the construction of new railways. At that time, the Shropshire Union were busy converting and extending a tramway which ran from Pontcysyllte to Afon-eitha to allow locomotives to run on it. The work was finished in 1867, and ran for a time with a borrowed locomotive, until they bought their own from Crewe works in 1870. To save money on the maintenance of Trench Inclined Plane on the Shrewsbury Canal, the company leased Lubstree Wharf on the Humber Arm of the Newport Branch from 1870, and built a railway to Lilleshall Works, which provided most of the traffic on the Shrewsbury Canal.|$|E
25|$|Although Cather {{began her}} writing {{career as a}} journalist, she made a {{distinction}} between journalism, which she saw as being primarily informative, and literature, which she saw as an art form. Cather's work is often marked by its nostalgic tone, her subject matter and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains. Some critics have charged Cather with being {{out of touch with}} her times and <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> more experimental techniques, such as stream of consciousness, in her writing. However, others have pointed out that Cather could follow no other literary path but her own: She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style. Cather's style is not the accumulative cataloguing of the journalists, nor the fragmentary atomism of psychological associations.|$|E

25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis essay {{sets out}} to compare {{discourse}} features and communicative practices {{in the use of}} textese in Whatsapp across two different generations. Textese, and other ways of online writing, has been associated with plenty of voices expressing a concern for the way young people adopted this practice (Humphrys, 2007; Sutherland, 2002). This prompted a “moral panics”, stating that textese triggers a failure in young people's ability <b>to</b> communicate <b>using</b> the standard variety of a language. Contrary to these voices, this paper defends the idea that online writing should not always be linked to the failure mentioned above. Results from this article prove that <b>using</b> textese and <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> communicate <b>using</b> the standard variety of a language cannot be systematically associated with teenagers’ literacy/communicative practices. They also provide evidence to support those voices arguing that the use of textese is intentionally adopted according to the circumstances surrounding a particular communicative situation...|$|R
50|$|Relatedly, the {{hypocrisy}} induction - {{a form of}} strong internal justification for changing attitudes and behaviors - {{has been used in}} recent decades {{to prevent the spread of}} HIV/AIDS. The hypocrisy induction is the arousal of dissonance by having individuals make statements that do not align with their own beliefs, and then drawing attention to the inconsistencies between what they advocated and their own behaviors, with the overall goal of leading individuals to more responsible behaviors. In 1991, Aronson and colleagues asked two groups of college students to compose a speech describing the dangers of HIV/AIDS and advocating the use of condoms during every sexual encounter. One group just composed the arguments; the other also recorded their arguments in front of a video camera that they were told was going to be seen by an auditorium of high school students. Additionally, half the students in each group were made mindful of their own <b>failings</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> condoms. The researchers found that the students who had made the video and thought about their own behaviors - they had the highest level of internal justification and thus the highest dissonance condition - were far more likely to buy condoms afterwards than the students in any other group. Those who only performed a single action, like composing the written arguments, were much more easily able to attribute what they were doing to external justification (i.e.- I’m doing this because the researcher told me to.) Furthermore, they found these results to be steady even several months after the study concluded.|$|R
