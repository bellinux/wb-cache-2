China witnessed a lack of <b>data</b> protection <b>law.</b> It wants to upgrade its legal arrangement on personal data protection. Accordingly, Chinese legislators consider cloning European <b>data</b> protection <b>law.</b> The plan raises a number of questions: Can European <b>data</b> protection <b>law</b> {{improve the quality of}} data protection in China? If so, how do the historic and cultural contexts matter for <b>data</b> protection <b>laws</b> unfolding in Europe and in China? Chinese policymakers assume that the european <b>data</b> protection <b>law</b> is complete, but it is not. How should China process the EU experiences to achieve a positive impact for how personal data are deployed and protected in the commercial world? In this book, these questions are examined.

Suppose however that one has available a fully observed shadow variable, which is associated with the outcome but independent of the missingness process conditional on covariates and the possibly unobserved outcome. Such a variable may be a proxy or a mismeasured version of the outcome available for all individuals. We have previously established necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of the full <b>data</b> <b>law</b> in such a setting, and have described semiparametric estimators including a doubly robust estimator of the outcome mean. Here, we propose two alternative doubly robust estimators for the outcome mean, which may be viewed as extensions of analogous methods under missingness at random, but enjoy different properties.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{identification and}} estimation with an outcome missing not at random (MNAR). We study an identification strategy {{based on a}} so-called shadow variable.

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for identification of the full <b>data</b> <b>law</b> given a valid shadow variable under MNAR, and also sufficient conditions which are convenient to verify in practice. The conditions are satisfied by many commonly-used models, and thus essentially state that lack of identification is not an issue in many situations. Focusing on estimation of an outcome mean, we describe three semiparametric estimation methods: inverse probability weighting, outcome regression and doubly robust estimation.

40|$|Nonmonotone {{missing data}} arise {{routinely}} in empirical studies {{of social and}} health sciences, and when ignored, can induce selection bias and loss of efficiency. In practice, {{it is common to}} account for nonresponse under a missing-at-random assumption which although convenient, is rarely appropriate when nonresponse is nonmonotone. Likelihood and Bayesian missing data methodologies often require specification of a parametric model for the full <b>data</b> <b>law,</b> thus a priori ruling out any prospect for semiparametric inference. In this paper, we propose an all-purpose approach which delivers semiparametric inferences when missing data are nonmonotone and not at random. The approach is based on a discrete choice model (DCM) as a means to generate a large class of nonmonotone nonresponse mechanisms that are nonignorable. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, and a general framework for fully parametric and semiparametric inference under an arbitrary DCM is proposed. Special consideration is given to the case of logit discrete choice nonresponse model (LDCM) for which we describe generalizations of inverse-probability weighting, pattern-mixture estimation, doubly robust estimation and multiply robust estimation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the overlap between <b>data</b> {{protection}} <b>law</b> and competition law in what I have defined as data markets in the big data era. Most recently, the discussion has focused on whether these markets can be regulated through competition law. As such, the argument of my thesis is threefold. I: Does competition <b>law</b> ensure effective <b>data</b> protection? Firstly, I ask how and with what modifications can competition law {{be used as a}} means to protecting data. I argue that competition law can be used to regulate some aspects of <b>data</b> protection <b>law,</b> {{but at the same time}} traditional competition law analysis needs to be modified in order to grasp the particular characteristics of data markets. This is because although, a firm in a dominant market position abusing its position by using its data will be caught by traditional competition laws, there exists conduct in these data markets, which though not an infringement under competition law, nevertheless impedes effective competition on the market. II: Does <b>data</b> protection <b>law</b> ensure effective competition? Secondly, I bring a new twist into the discussion and question whether <b>data</b> protection <b>law</b> can act as a means to protecting effective competition on the market. I argue that increasingly in situations where there is a need to regulate the market and a market failure is not caught by existing competition laws, they can be regulated by <b>data</b> protection <b>law.</b> This is particularly so in the big data economy. III: Is <b>data</b> protection <b>law</b> the new intellectual property law? Finally, I finish the thesis by trying to understand the new framework that is developing between competition <b>law</b> and <b>data</b> protection <b>law.</b> I do this by comparing it with the well-known discussion between the balance of competition law and intellectual property. Consequently, the thesis is titled Is <b>data</b> protection <b>law</b> the new intellectual property law – Competition law enters into uncharte(re) d territory...|$|R
