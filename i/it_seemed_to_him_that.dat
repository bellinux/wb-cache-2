For <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> to wear any other finery was less beautiful, and that to put on ornaments or arms made of gold worked by hammering, stamping, or by other means, was a vulgar and common thing.In the Muisca territories, {{there were a number of}} natural locations considered sacred, including lakes, rivers, forests and large rocks. People gathered here to perform rituals and sacrifices mostly with gold and emeralds. Important lakes were Lake Guatavita, Lake Iguaque, Lake Fúquene, Lake Tota, the Siecha Lakes, Lake Teusacá and Lake Ubaque.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Arjona {{started the}} first leg of his world tour, named the Adentro Tour. The tour resumed in 2007 for a second leg, in which he visited more countries. Approximately two million people {{attended}} the performances. The tour was officially closed on 14 September 2007 on the mainland city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela, during the International Fair, in front of more than 100,000 people. On 21 August 2007, Arjona released his fifth compilation album, Quién Dijo Ayer. The album is a two-disc set which contains, on the first disc, new versions of past hits, some of them including featured artists such as Marta Sánchez on [...] "Tarde (Sin Daños a Terceros)" [...] from Sin Daños a Terceros; Panteón Rococó on [...] "Si El Norte Fuera el Sur", from the album of the same name; Marc Anthony on [...] "Historia de Taxi", from Historias; Eros Ramazzotti on [...] "A Ti", from Adentro, and Sandro on [...] "Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo", from Historias, and which was the last song recorded by the singer, who died on 4 January 2010. Arjona's manager told Argentinian newspaper Clarín that [...] " [...] had the idea of inviting Roberto [...] for his album, he [...] showed enthusiasm and manifested the same degree of appreciation to Arjona. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he [...] was an artist who proclaims the same values he proclaimed." [...] The second disc contained remastered versions of the hits on the first disc, but in their original versions. It was the second time Arjona collaborated with Torres.|$|E

500|$|The {{defeat at}} Myriokephalon {{has often been}} {{depicted}} as a catastrophe in which the entire Byzantine army was destroyed. Manuel himself compared the defeat to Manzikert; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon complemented the destruction at Manzikert. In reality, although a defeat, it was not too costly and did not significantly diminish the Byzantine army. Most of the casualties were borne by the right wing, largely composed of allied troops commanded by Baldwin of Antioch, and also by the baggage train, which was the main target of the Turkish ambush.* K. Paparrigopoulos, History of the Greek Nation, Db, 141 The limited losses inflicted on native Byzantine troops were quickly recovered, and {{in the following year}} Manuel's forces defeated a force of [...] "picked Turks". John Komnenos Vatatzes, who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion, not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way, allowing him to score a victory over the Turks at the Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir, a sign that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western Asia Minor was still successful. After the victory on the Meander, Manuel himself advanced with a small army to drive the Turks from Panasium, south of Cotyaeum. In 1178, however, a Byzantine army retreated after encountering a Turkish force at Charax, allowing the Turks to capture many livestock. The city of Claudiopolis in Bithynia was besieged by the Turks in 1179, forcing Manuel to lead a small cavalry force to save the city, and then, even as late as 1180, the Byzantines succeeded in scoring a victory over the Turks.|$|E

2500|$|John Marsden was {{inspired}} to write Tomorrow, When the War Began while watching an ANZAC Day march. [...] A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they {{were placed in the}} same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media’s view of the average young person as [...] "illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole bludger, or all of the above" [...] was wrong. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> like the generations before them modern teenagers would [...] "dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism".|$|E
2500|$|Eickemeyer {{executed}} the capitulation, withdrawing {{the remaining}} troops.

[...] A week after the surrender of the fortress, he {{sent a letter to}} the Elector of Mainz, Karl Theodor von Dalberg and returned his officer's commission. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> in the prime of his life, he could expect for little advancement in service to an elector who would not even spend money on fortifications and who fled at the first hint of danger. On the other hand, the scope of significant activity under the banner of France seemed infinite.|$|E
2500|$|After his father's death, {{he started}} {{thinking}} seriously about the priesthood. In October 1942, while the war continued, {{he knocked on}} the door of the Bishop's Palace in Kraków and asked to study for the priesthood. Soon after, he began courses in the clandestine underground seminary run by the Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Cardinal Sapieha. On 29 February 1944, Wojtyła was hit by a German truck. German Wehrmacht officers tended to him and sent him to a hospital. He spent two weeks there recovering from a severe concussion and a shoulder injury. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> this accident and his survival was a confirmation of his vocation. On 6 August 1944, a day known as [...] "Black Sunday", the Gestapo rounded up young men in Kraków to curtail the uprising there, [...] similar to the recent uprising in Warsaw. Wojtyła escaped by hiding in the basement of his uncle's house at 10 Tyniecka Street, while the German troops searched above. More than eight thousand men and boys were taken that day, while Wojtyła escaped to the Archbishop's Palace, where he remained until after the Germans had left.|$|E

2500|$|At the [...] in March 1975, Claude Vorhilon {{staged a}} purging of leaders which {{hampered}} his own creativity. In the following month, Claude Vorhilon {{called for a}} meeting of the MADECH organization, which held its headquarters in Paris, and as its president, he conducted it with the intention to rid the organization from the kind of occultism and pseudoscience which contradicted his physicalist point of view. In addition to this, the MADECH officials had an increasing desire to blend in {{with the rest of the}} ufologists and trekkies and were becoming less interested in the Raëlian view of Elohim extraterrestrials. [...] A schism was becoming more apparent among the officials, and subsequently Vorilhon dismissed all of them. [...] Their positions were replaced by an inner circle of seven people whose mission was to inform the public of the Raëlian messages and to raise funds for building an embassy for extraterrestrials. [...] Vorilhon says he resigned as president of MADECH by that June, because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> MADECH could survive on its own and that he had made a mistake by structuring it into a form that he likened to a [...] "petanque club or a war veterans' association." [...] Then he speaks of a personal desire to settle in the countryside and write an autobiography of events happening prior to his purported extraterrestrial encounters beginning on 13 December 1973.|$|E
2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E
2500|$|In Fox's own {{constituency}} of Westminster {{the contest}} was particularly fierce. An energetic campaign in his favour {{was run by}} Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, allegedly a lover of Fox's who {{was said to have}} won at least one vote for him by kissing a shoemaker with a rather romantic idea of what constituted a bribe. In the end Fox was re-elected by a very slender margin, but legal challenges (encouraged, to an extent, by Pitt and the King) prevented a final declaration of the result for over a year. In the meantime, Fox sat for the Scottish pocket borough of Tain or Northern Burghs, for which he was qualified by being made an unlikely burgess of Kirkwall in Orkney (which was one of the Burghs in the district). The experience of these years was crucial in Fox's political formation. His suspicions had been confirmed: <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> George III had personally scuppered both the Rockingham-Shelburne and Fox-North governments, interfered in the legislative process and now dissolved Parliament when its composition inconvenienced him. Pitt – a man of little property and no party – seemed to Fox a blatant tool of the Crown. However, the King and Pitt had great popular support, and many in the press and general population saw Fox as the trouble-maker challenging the composition of the constitution and the King's remaining powers. He was often caricatured as Oliver Cromwell and Guy Fawkes during this period, as well as Satan, [...] "Carlo Khan" [...] (see James Sayers) and Machiavelli.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Bahn of The A.V.

Bahn also commented that Liz's [...] "cynicism and skepticism [...] was a good quality for a scientist, but also a sometimes offputting character tic". In an analysis of Doctor Who and the Silurians for Doctor Who: The Television Companion, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were positive towards Liz, who they said was [...] "very good foil, far removed from the naïve young companions of the past". Radio Times writer Mark Braxton wrote that, despite her short appearance, [...] "Liz established herself thanks to her brilliant mind, a succession of crazy outfits and Caroline John's consummate professionalism as an actress". Braxton also felt that [...] "she was too caring to be cold" [...] and despite not having the [...] "companionly affection" [...] later seen with Jo Grant and Sarah Jane Smith, they had an [...] "innate respect" [...] for each other. Braxton's colleague Patrick Mulkern, while calling John a [...] "gifted actress", criticised the way Liz was [...] "severely styled" [...] in her first appearance. SFX Ian Berriman also criticised Liz in Spearhead from Space, writing that she was [...] "so snarky she's annoying". Will Salmon of the magazine listed Liz's departure as one of the worst in the series since she just [...] " [...] between seasons". DVD Talk's John Sinnott felt that John could come across as [...] "a bit stiff" [...] and did not have much chemistry with Pertwee, most likely due to their personal relationship. In 2010, readers of Radio Times voted Liz the 27th best companion, out of 48 options. In Ridley Scott's 2012 film Prometheus, Noomi Rapace's character is named Dr. Elizabeth Shaw; Dr. Nicolas Pillai, a lecturer from the University of Warwick's Film and Television Studies department, argues that this is a reference to the Doctor Who character, as Scott used to work for the BBC as a designer.|$|E
