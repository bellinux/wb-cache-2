30|$|Based on the {{described}} results {{we conclude}} that LaKS 400 produces a bacteriocin with an expected size of 7.5  kDa. This molecular weight is {{within the range of}} the most frequently reported bacteriocins from Lactobacillus spp. (Vuyst and Vandamme 1994). In fact, for Lactobacillus acidophilus, the size described for bacteriocins ranges from 2.5 to 100  kda (Barefoot and Klaenhammer 1983; Muriana and Klaenhammer 1991; Zamfir et al. 1999). In addition, no decrease on antimicrobial activity was observed for bacteriocin extract in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. This result suggests that the activity was not related to the presence of disulfide bridges. These are characteristic of class II bacteriocins, since its contains at least two cysteines in their composition that forms a bond (Ennahar et al. 2000). Disulfide bridges have been described in some Lactobacillus spp., such as L. curvatus (Tichaczek et al. 1993), L. plantarum (Ennahar et al. 1996) and L. sake (Schillinger and Lücke 1989), among others.

40|$|Abstract Background Microorganisms {{are used}} as cell {{factories}} to produce valuable compounds in pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and other industrial processes. Incorporating heterologous metabolic pathways into well-characterized hosts is a major strategy for obtaining these target metabolites and improving productivity. However, selecting appropriate heterologous metabolic pathways for a <b>host</b> <b>microorganism</b> remains difficult owing {{to the complexity of}} metabolic networks. Hence, metabolic network design could benefit greatly from the availability of an in silico platform for heterologous pathway searching. Results We developed an algorithm for finding feasible heterologous pathways by which nonnative target metabolites are produced by host microorganisms, using Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as templates. Using this algorithm, we screened heterologous pathways for the production of all possible nonnative target metabolites contained within databases. We then assessed the feasibility of the target productions using flux balance analysis, by which we could identify target metabolites associated with maximum cellular growth rate. Conclusions This in silico platform, designed for targeted searching of heterologous metabolic reactions, provides essential information for cell factory improvement. </p...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} {{of various}} industrial microorganisms to produce chemicals, fuels, and drugs has raised interest {{since it is}} environmentally friendly, sustainable, and independent of nonrenewable resources. However, microbial metabolism is so complex {{that only a few}} metabolic engineering efforts have been able to achieve a satisfactory yield, titer or productivity of the target chemicals for industrial commercialization. In order to overcome this challenge, 13 C Metabolic Flux Analysis (13 C-MFA) has been continuously developed and widely applied to rigorously investigate cell metabolism and quantify the carbon flux distribution in central metabolic pathways. In the past decade, many 13 C-MFA studies have been performed in academic labs and biotechnology industries to pinpoint key issues related to microbe-based chemical production. Insightful information about the metabolic rewiring has been provided to guide the development of the appropriate metabolic engineering strategies for improving the biochemical production.

30|$|Escherichia coli {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as a <b>host</b> <b>microorganism</b> {{for the production of}} recombinant proteins because of many expression advantages including simplified downstream processing, increased biological activity, enhanced product stability and solubility and authenticity of N-terminus of expressed proteins (Mergulhao et al. 2005). Considerable attention has been given to extracellular production of recombinant enzymes in E. coli as it has substantial advantages over periplasmic or cytoplasmic productions (Sommer et al. 2010). For heterologous gene expression in E. coli a number of different expression vectors and host strains are used. Liang et al. (2009) cloned Bxyl gene from Bacillus halodurans C- 125 with its own promoter and transcription terminator into pQE 80 L expression vector and transformed into E. coli JM 109. Using p-nitrophenyl-β-Xylose (pNPX) as a substrate the crude enzyme was analyzed for its xylosidase activity which was estimated to be 11 U from 450  mL cultivated cells of E. coli. The open reading frame of another β-Xylosidase gene (xysB) along with its promoter region was isolated from Aeromonas caviae ME- 1 and cloned into pT 7 -Blue vector to express in E. coli DH 5 α (Suzuki et al. 2001).

40|$|Background: Though {{n-butanol}} {{has been}} proposed as a potential transportation biofuel, its toxicity often causes oxidative stress in the <b>host</b> <b>microorganism</b> and {{is considered one of}} the bottlenecks preventing its efficient mass production. Results: To relieve the oxidative stress in the host cell, metallothioneins (MTs), which are known as scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS), were engineered in E. coli hosts for both cytosolic and outer-membrane-targeted (osmoregulatory membrane protein OmpC fused) expression. Metallothioneins from human (HMT), mouse (MMT), and tilapia fish (TMT) were tested. The host strain expressing membrane-targeted TMT showed the greatest ability to reduce oxidative stresses induced by n-butanol, ethanol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and nickel. The same strain also allowed for an increased growth rate of recombinant E. coli under n-butanol stress. Further experiments indicated that the TMT-fused OmpC protein could not only function in ROS scavenging but also regulate either glycine betaine (GB) or glucose uptake via osmosis, and the dual functional fusion protein could contribute in an enhancement of the host microorganism’s growthrate. Conclusions: The abilities of scavenging intracellular or extracellular ROS by these engineering E. coli were examined, and TMT show the best ability among three MTs. Additionally, the membrane-targeted fusion protein, OmpC-TMT, improved host tolerance up to 1. 5 % n-butanol above that of TMT which is only 1 %. These results presented indicate potential novel approaches for engineering stress tolerant microorganism strains...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT 1 -Butanol is a large-volume, {{intermediate}} chemical with favorable {{physical and chemical}} properties for blending with or directly substituting for gasoline. The per-volume value of butanol, as a chemical, is sufficient for investing into the recom-mercialization of the classical acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) (E. M. Green, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 22 : 337 – 343, 2011) fermenta-tion process. Furthermore, with modest improvements in three areas of the ABE process, operating costs can be sufficiently de-creased to make butanol an economically viable advanced biofuel. The three areas of greatest interest are (i) maximizing yields of butanol on any particular substrate, (ii) expanding substrate utilization capabilities of the <b>host</b> <b>microorganism,</b> and (iii) reduc-ing the energy consumption of the overall production process, in particular the separation and purification operations.

Although apoplast-associated ROS production by plasma membrane NADPH oxidases have been most thoroughly studied, recent observations suggest that ROS are generated in chloroplasts earlier in the response and {{play a key role in}} execution of LCD. A model is presented in which the initial outcome of successful pathogen detection is ROS accumulation in plastids, likely mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and caused by dysfunction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain.

They have emerged as a promising group in the production of bioproducts and biofuel, {{as well as for the}} remediation of effluents. Indigenous populations have used microalgae for centuries and the commercial application of microalgae has been extensively reviewed [1 – 4]. The efficiency of the microalgal production process depends on higher biomass, yield, productivity, and process robustness.

The lack of knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms of key enzymes and the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype are still barriers to the development of efficient cell factories. The overexpression, deletion, or introduction of heterologous genes in specific metabolic pathways does not always result in the desired phenotype. Recent remarkable innovations in platforms for omics-based research and application development have provided crucial solutions to these problems.

However, genetic, physiological and environmental factors inﬂuence the plasmid replication and cloned gene expression in a highly complex way. To control and optimize the recombinant expression system performance, it is very important to understand this complexity. Therefore, the development of rap-id, highly sensitive and economic analytical methodologies, which enable the simultaneous characterization of the heterologous product synthesis and physiologic cell behavior under a variety of culture conditions, is highly desirable. For that, the metabolic proﬁle of recombinant E. coli cultures producing the pVAX-lacZ plasmid model was analyzed by rapid, economic and high-throughput Fourier Transform Mid-Infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy. The main goal of the present work is to show as the simultaneous multivariate data analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) and direct spectral analysis could represent a very interesting tool to monitor E. coli culture processes and acquire relevant information according to current quality regulatory guidelines. While PCA allowed capturing the energetic metabolic state of the cell, e. g. by identifying different C-sources consumption phases, direct FT-MIR spectral analysis allowed obtaining valuable biochemical and metabolic information along the cell culture, e. g. lipids, RNA, protein synthesis and turnover metabolism.

Field application vectors have been designed {{for the purpose of}} creating a temporary niche for the host in such environments. This technique involves the addition to the target environment of a selective substrate readily utilizable by the <b>host</b> <b>microorganism</b> but unavailable to most indigenous species. Thirteen nonionic and anionic detergents, representing a wide range of structural complexities and molecular weights, were screened as potential selective substrates. Competition experiments in soil, using Warburg respirometry, indicated that isolates from six different detergent enrichment cultures were more active on their corresponding detergents than the indigenous microorganisms. Detergents of intermediate structural complexities and molecular weights were most effective for use as selective substrates. A field application vector that utilizes 1. 0 % Igepal CO- 720 (detergent) as the selective substrate and Pseudomonas paucimobilis 1 IGP 4 as the host was tested for its ability to increase the presence of nonadaptive tetracycline resistance marker genes in soil. In soil amended with the selective substrate, strain 1 IGP 4 plate counts increased by three orders of magnitude and tetracycline-resistant transformant (pRK 293) counts increased from 1. 8 × 106 /g of soil to 4. 3 × 108 /g in 2 days. Inoculation in the absence of substrate amendment or amendment with a nonselective substrate did not result in growth of strain 1 IGP 4.

40|$|Mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) {{pathways}} play crucial roles in developmental and adaptive responses. Depending on the stimulus, MAPK activation regulates {{a wide variety}} of plant cell responses, such as proliferation, differentiation and cell death, which normally require precise spatial and temporal control. In this context, protein phosphatases play important roles by regulating the duration and magnitude of MAPK activities. During infection by non-host and incompatible <b>host</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> MAPK activity can promote a local cell death mechanism called hypersensitive response (HR), {{which is part of the}} plant defence response.

Therefore, {{to speed up the}} development process and to control this critical manufacturing step it is relevant to develop monitoring techniques allowing simultaneous characterization of the heterologous product synthesis and of the physiologic cell behavior under a variety of culture conditions. In the present work high-throughput mid-infrared (MIR) spectral analysis of dehydrated E. coli cell pellets and in situ near infrared (NIR) spectral analysis of the whole culture broth were compared to monitor the bioproduction of a model plasmid along recombinant Escherichia coli cultures. Good partial least square regression models were built, either based on MIR or on NIR spectral data. Besides being conducted in situ, NIR spectroscopy allowed building regression models as accurate as those obtained from the MIR setup, and even better models for estimating biomass and glycerol. However, MIR spectroscopy allows retrieving valuable biochemical and metabolic information along the cell culture, e. g. lipids, RNA, protein synthesis and turnover metabolism. This information contributed to better understand the complex interrelationships between the recombinant cell metabolism and the bioprocess environment. In resume, since NIR spectroscopy enables the in situ and real time monitoring without the risk of culture contamination, thus represents an appealing tool for control purposes specially at industrial (i. e. large-scale) productions. On the other hand, MIR spectroscopy is better suited for optimization processes, as it enables the analysis of hundreds of samples at ounce, and to acquire off line historical information along industrial production processes.

40|$|The growth {{temperature}} {{adaptation of}} six model proteins {{has been studied}} in 42 microorganisms belonging to eubacterial and archaeal kingdoms, covering optimum growth temperatures from 7 to 103 °C. The selected proteins include three elongation factors involved in translation, the enzymes glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, the cell division protein FtsZ. The common strategy of protein adaptation from cold to hot environments implies the occurrence of small changes in the amino acid composition, without altering the overall structure of the macromolecule. These continuous adjustments were investigated through parameters related to the amino acid composition of each protein. The average value per residue of mass, volume and accessible surface area allowed {{an evaluation of the}} usage of bulky residues, whereas the average hydrophobicity reflected that of hydrophobic residues. The specific proportion of bulky and hydrophobic residues in each protein almost linearly increased with the temperature of the <b>host</b> <b>microorganism.</b> This finding agrees with the structural and functional properties exhibited by proteins in differently adapted sources, thus explaining the great compactness or the high flexibility exhibited by (hyper) thermophilic or psychrophilic proteins, respectively. Indeed, heat-adapted proteins incline toward the usage of heavier-size and more hydrophobic residues with respect to mesophiles, whereas the cold-adapted macromolecules show the opposite behavior with a certain preference for smaller-size and less hydrophobic residues. An investigation on the different increase of bulky residues along with the growth temperature observed in the six model proteins suggests the relevance of the possible different role and/or structure organization played by protein domains. The significance of the linear correlations between growth temperature and parameters related to the amino acid composition improved when the analysis was collectively carried out on all model proteins...|$|E

In this study, the potential for Tat-dependent heterologous protein secretion was compared in the three Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus carnosus, Bacillus subtilis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a model protein. In all three microorganisms, fusion of a Tat signal peptide to GFP resulted in its Tat-dependent translocation across the corresponding cytoplasmic membranes.

A total of 111 of the nifH (a gene coding a nitrogen fixation enzyme, Fe protein) clones were obtained from different depths of the core sediments, and the phylogenetic analysis of the clones indicated the genetic diversity of nifH genes. The predominant group detected (methane seep group 2), representing 74 % of clonal abundance, was phylogenetically related to the nifH sequences obtained from the Methanosarcina species but was most {{closely related to the}} nifH sequences potentially derived from the anoxic methanotrophic archaea (ANME- 2 archaea). The recovery of the nif gene clusters including the nifH sequences of the methane seep group 2 and the subsequent reverse transcription-PCR detection of the nifD and nifH genes strongly suggested that the genetic components of the gene clusters would be operative for the in situ assimilation of molecular nitrogen (N 2) by the <b>host</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> DNA-based quantitative PCR of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene, the group-specific mcrA (a gene encoding the methyl-coenzyme M reductase α subunit) gene, and the nifD and nifH genes demonstrated the similar distribution patterns of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene, the mcrA groups c-d and e, and the nifD and nifH genes through the core sediments.

To exclude the influence of exogenous DNAs on viromes, the virus particles were purified with nuclease (DNase I and RNase A) treatments and cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The metagenomic analysis of viromes without exogenous DNA contamination and microbiomes of vent samples indicated that viruses had compensation effects on the metabolisms of their <b>host</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Viral genes not only participated in most of the microbial metabolic pathways but also formed branched pathways in microbial metabolisms, including pyrimidine metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; nitrogen metabolism and assimilation pathways of the two-component system; selenocompound metabolism; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism.

Thus, efforts to study and improve E. coli as the <b>host</b> <b>microorganism</b> {{for the production of}} recombinant proteins can be of considerable importance. Secretion of recombinant proteins into the extracellular medium via the Type-I secretion system (TISS) in E. coli offers several advantages in comparison to the cytoplasmic accumulation and the periplasmic secretion such as simplifying detection and purification of the target protein and also providing a better folding environment. Studies have shown that the premature termination of the RutR protein, a transcription factor encoded by the ycdC gene, can enhance the secretion levels of recombinant proteins via the TISS. Here, the construction of an E. coli ΔycdC strain is described that enhances the extracellular levels of α-hemolysin (HlyA) and GILL-β- lactamase (GILL-Bla) (3. 03 -fold) proteins via the TISS. Previous experiments have shown that synonymous rare codon substitutions in the parent gene sequence can enhance the extracellular levels of multiple proteins via the TISS. Here, the combined effect of synonymous rare codon substitutions in the parent gene sequence and the ycdC gene knockout on the secretion levels of recombinant proteins via the TISS is investigated. The results suggest that the optimal levels of expression for an enhanced secretion of Bla and GILL-Bla proteins via the TISS may vary for the E. coli parent and the ΔycdC strain. In addition, synonymous rare rare codon substitutions in the predicted amphiphilic helix region of the C-terminal signal sequence can enhance extracellular levels of HlyA and Bla (2. 07 -fold) proteins via the TISS. These results describe the experimental strategies {{that can be used to}} enhance the secretion of recombinant proteins via the TISS. Next, two kinetic models of the TISS are illustrated that describe the secretion of the HasA protein from an E. coli parent and a ΔsecB strain. The SecB protein is a molecular chaperone required for efficient secretion of HasA via the TISS. The models incorporate multiple cellular events including HasA synthesis, protein folding, aggregation, chaperone interactions, degradation, transporter synthesis, reportertransporter interactions, catalytic cycle of the transporter, protein secretion into the extracellular medium and cell growth. The model simulation results are consistent with the qualitative trends in the experimental data available from the literature. A combination of techniques including parameter variation, sensitivity analysis, and nondimensionalization shows that the optimization of the extracellular concentration of HasA requires a balance between multiple factors including the HasA synthesis rate, the transporter synthesis rate and culture time. These results demonstrate the utility of a kinetic modeling approach towards enhancing extracellular recombinant protein secretion in E. coli.

40|$|Reactions {{in which}} organic {{compounds}} are oxygenated or hydroxylated are {{of great value}} for organic synthesis. The “oxyfunctionalization” of aromatic compounds is a modification of primary interest for the pharmaceutical and food industries allowing to obtain high-value-added compounds, characterized by {{a wide array of}} biological activities, starting from cheap and commercially available molecules. Selective oxyfunctionalization of organic substrates, however, can be a significant problem in organic synthesis, as these reactions are often carried out with strong oxidizing agents and occur with little chemo-, regio-, and enantio- selectivity. Thus, growing attention has been dedicated in the last years to the development of biotransformations, also known as bioconversions, which make use of the metabolic versatility of either purified enzymes or whole microorganisms to perform oxyfunctionalization of organic substrates of industrial interest. These methodologies, compared with already established chemical processes, are appealing alternatives for obtaining active aromatic compounds under mild experimental conditions and without employing toxic reagents. In this thesis project several aspects of this kind of biotransformation were analyzed; more in detail the attention was focused on: - The use of the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase ToMO from Pseudomonas sp. OX 1 for the production of novel hydroxylated antioxidants starting from commercially available aromatic precursors such as 2 -phenoxyethanol, 2, 3 -dihydrobenzofuran, 2 -indanol and phtalan. The antioxidant potential of the hydroxylated compounds obtained in ToMO-catalyzed bioconversion was assessed both in vitro, by using the DPPH assay, and ex vivo on the embryionic rat cardiomyoblast cell line H 9 C 2 subjected to oxidative stress induced by sodium arsenite. Not all compounds showed antioxidant potential in the DPPH assay; however, when cells where incubated with each of them, a differential protective effect towards the oxidative stress induced by sodium arsenite was observed. - The recombinant expression of ToMO in the GRAS <b>host</b> <b>microorganism</b> Bacillus subtilis to analyze the potential use of this bacterium for the industrial scale-up of ToMO-catalyzed hydroxylation of aromatic substrates of interest. To this purpose, ToMO gene cluster was cloned in two different shuttle vectors, a non- integrative plasmid indicated as pHT 01, and Pr 19, a vector that allows instead the direct integration of the recombinant gene in B. subtilis chromosomal DNA through single crossing-over. In this latter case, no integration was observed. When using a non-integrative shuttle vector, the ToMO system was efficiently expressed in E. coli, but RT-PCR experiments showed that almost no mRNA corresponding to the tou gene cluster appeared to be transcribed when the plasmid was inserted in B. subtilis. - The expression and purification of the Baeyer Villiger 3, 6 -diketocamphane 1, 6 monooxygenase (3, 6 DKCMO) and its flavin reductase component from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 10007. The optimization of the expression and the purification of these proteins will pave the way to the future biochemical characterization of this flavoenzyme and to its biotechnological use for the oxyfunctionalization of aromatic compounds of industrial interest...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophobins are a {{large family}} of small {{cysteine}} rich proteins (about 100 amino acids) {{that appear to be}} ubiquitous in the Fungi kingdom. The ability of hydrophobins to modify surface properties by interfacial self-assembly and their high surface activity provide a potential for several applications. A hydrophobin secreted by the basidiomycete fungus Pleurotus ostreatus has been purified, and identified as vmh 2 - 1 (TrEMBL entry Q 8 WZI 2 _PLEOS). The hydrophobin production has been optimized using different conditions, the highest production (~ 60 mg/l) has been obtained when P. ostreatus mycelium was grown in minimum medium under static conditions. The pure protein is insoluble in water, whereas complexes formed between the hydrophobin and glycans, present in culture broth containing amylose (PDY), are water soluble. The structure of these glycans, analyzed by GC-MS, MALDI-MS and NMR, matches to cyclic structures of α 1 - 4 linked glucose containing from 6 to 16 monomers (cyclodextrins). In the presence of these glycans, the hydrophilicity of the hydrophobin increases, nevertheless the protein is prone to self aggregation. On the other hand when the pure hydrophobin is dissolved in 60 % ethanol, its self assembly is prevented. Recombinant P. ostreatus hydrophobin has been expressed in a <b>host</b> <b>microorganism,</b> Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein has been obtained fused to GST, separated by an aminoacidic sequence recognized by TEV protease. Purification of the recombinant protein has been achieved using the self-assembling properties of the native hydrophobin. The set up procedure has allowed us to obtain about 12 mg/litre of the pure, correctly structured (by CD analysis) recombinant hydrophobin. The pure protein from P. ostreatus, deposited on a silicon hydrophobic surface, forms a very stable biofilm, whereas the biofilm has not been detected on a oxidized silicon hydrophilic surface. When the water-soluble cyclodextrin-hydrophobin complex was used, thick biofilms have been obtained on both surfaces. The hydrophobin biofilm is resistant to hot 2 % SDS and it is able to protect silicon surface from basic dissolution, a procedure used in micromachining process. The pure hydrophobin self-assembles also on other surfaces, like porous silicon and oxidized porous silicon, changing the wettability of these surfaces (from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa) but leaving unaltered the sensing ability of the surface. The features of the Languimir Blodgett (LB) film formed by the P. ostreatus hydrophobin have been investigated. When the LB film is transferred onto a silicon substrate, AFM observations revealed the coexistence of a LB monolayer and rodlets. The observed rodlets have a hydrophilic character and are formed by hydrophobin bilayers embedded in the LB monolayer. We have also demonstrated that the hydrophobin biofilm is suitable for peptides and proteins immobilization. The monolayer acts as a bioactive substrate to bind other proteins. These results can be the starting point in the manufacture {{of a new generation of}} hybrid devices for proteomics applications...|$|E
40|$|In December 2016, a {{panel of}} experts in microbiology, {{nutrition}} and clinical research was convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics to review the definition and scope of prebiotics. Consistent with the original embodiment of prebiotics, but aware of the latest scientific and clinical developments, the panel updated the definition of a prebiotic: a substrate that is selectively utilized by <b>host</b> <b>microorganisms</b> conferring a health benefit. This definition expands the concept of prebiotics to possibly include non-carbohydrate substances, applications to body sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, and diverse categories other than food. The requirement for selective microbiota-mediated mechanisms was retained. Beneficial health effects must be documented for a substance to be considered a prebiotic. The consensus definition applies also to prebiotics for use by animals, in which microbiota-focused strategies to maintain health and prevent disease is as relevant as for humans. Ultimately, the goal of this Consensus Statement is to engender appropriate use of the term ‘prebiotic’ by relevant stakeholders so that consistency and clarity can be achieved in research reports, product marketing and regulatory oversight of the category. To this end, we have reviewed several aspects of prebiotic science including its development, health benefits and legislation...|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately, {{industrial}} production of second-generation biofuels faces significant obstacles, as {{the production process}} is much more laborious than that of first-generation biofuels. The microbial process for converting lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel typically consists of three steps: pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. At the pretreatment step, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are released through decomposition of the complex structure of lignocellulosic biomass. At the enzymatic hydrolysis step, cellulosic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are converted into saccharified solution containing mixed sugars. Finally, the saccharified solution is fed to microorganisms as a carbon source in the fermentation step (Ho et al. 2014; Islam et al. 2015). However, lignin is composed of heterogeneous aromatic acids that commonly used industrial <b>host</b> <b>microorganisms</b> such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli cannot efficiently assimilate. On the contrary, several aromatic acids produced by lignin decomposition cause membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition and DNA damage in microbial cells, ultimately reducing productivity. A few bacteria, including Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus erythropolis and Streptomyces coelicolor, are known to assimilate lignin (Ahmad et al. 2010). However, these microorganisms are not suitable for {{industrial production}} of second-generation biofuels, because their culture conditions are intricate and their growth are relatively slow. Here we report screening, isolation and characterization of a lignin-degrading bacterium from leaf soil sample. This bacterium exhibited rapid growth on solid medium containing alkali lignin as the sole carbon source and assimilated lignin-associated aromatic monomers.|$|R
30|$|Heparinase III (HepIII) is a 73 -kDa {{polysaccharide}} lyase (PL) that degrades the heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides at sulfate-rare regions, {{which are}} important co-factors for {{a vast array}} of functional distinct proteins including the well-characterized antithrombin and the FGF/FGFR signal transduction system. It functions in cleaving metazoan heparan sulfate (HS) and providing carbon, nitrogen and sulfate sources for <b>host</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> It has long been used to deduce the structure of HS and heparin motifs; however, the structure of its own is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the HepIII from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron at a resolution of 1.6 Å. The overall architecture of HepIII belongs to the (α/α) 5 toroid subclass with an N-terminal toroid-like domain and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain. Analysis of this high-resolution structure allows us to identify a potential HS substrate binding site in a tunnel between the two domains. A tetrasaccharide substrate bound model suggests an elimination mechanism in the HS degradation. Asn 260 and His 464 neutralize the carboxylic group, whereas Tyr 314 serves both as a general base in C- 5 proton abstraction, and a general acid in a proton donation to reconstitute the terminal hydroxyl group, respectively. The structure of HepIII and the proposed reaction model provide a molecular basis for its potential practical utilization and the mechanism of its eliminative degradation for HS polysaccarides.|$|R
