25|$|Berengar was {{the only}} one of the reguli (petty kings) to crop up in the {{aftermath}} of Charles' deposition besides Arnulf of Carinthia, his deposer, who was made king before the emperor's death. Charter evidence begins Berengar's reign at Pavia between 26 December 887 and 2 January 888, though this has been disputed. Berengar was not the undisputed leading magnate in Italy at the time, but he may have made an agreement with his former rival, Guy of Spoleto, whereby <b>Guy</b> <b>would</b> have West Francia and he Italy on the emperor's death. Both Guy and Berengar were related to the Carolingians in the female line. They represented different factions in Italian politics: Berengar the pro-German and Guy the pro-French.|$|E
25|$|Othon's wife {{name was}} Isabel (and its variant Elisabeth). She is {{generally}} {{described as the}} daughter and heiress of Guy, lord of Ray-sur-Saône in the Free County of Burgundy. According to Longnon however, she {{was the daughter of}} Clarembaud IV of Chappes, a lord from Champagne. She gave birth to two sons, Guy and Othon. Othon inherited the lordship of Ray. Guy is traditionally held to have inherited La Roche, while the duchy is said to have passed to a nephew of Othon's also named Guy. Longnon has challenged this view according to a chart in which Othon of Ray, son of Othon de la Roche, presents the duke Guy as his brother - meaning that <b>Guy</b> <b>would</b> be Othon's son and not his nephew. While most members of the La Roche family lived in the Free County of Burgundy, some of them settled in Athens.

25|$|When Capcom {{produced}} the original Street Fighter Alpha in 1995, <b>Guy</b> <b>would</b> {{be one of}} two Final Fight characters {{to be included in}} the game along with the game's second stage boss Sodom. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's Product Planning and Design section, Capcom included Guy in the game because he was extremely popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre. In this game, Guy's character design was altered slightly, with his jika-tabi replaced by sneakers (a change that was retained when Guy was brought back into the Final Fight series in Final Fight 3), although his fighting style mimics that of his Final Fight counterpart. Guy and Sodom would be joined by Rolento in 1996's Street Fighter Alpha 2 and by Cody in 1998's Street Fighter Alpha 3, followed by Maki's appearance in the portable versions of Alpha 3. Guy's new design would be used in the second Final Fight sequel for the SNES, Final Fight 3 and along with Cody's Street Fighter Alpha rendition, are also hidden characters in Final Fight One (Final Fight for the Game Boy). In the Alpha games, Guy's Bushin predecessor is revealed to be a man named Zeku, who would appear in Guy's ending in Street Fighter Alpha 2 to test Guy for his successor-ship. Zeku's presence in the game contradicts Final Fight 2, which identifies Genryusai as Guy's sensei, as designers of the Alpha games did not take into account the SNES Final Fight sequels when developing the games. Zeku was mentioned once again in Guy's bio in Street Fighter Alpha 3.|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review came from EW.com's Ken Tucker, {{who called the}} animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look like state-of-the-art.

He also called the show [...] "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows". Even before it aired the pilot had received some criticism from the Parents Television Council, a watchdog; the creator of this website L.

Jackson's lyrical expression has been noted {{as one of the}} key elements of the album's success. Author Dave Marsh in The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made (1999) comments: [...] "Certainly, Janet must have written her own lyrics, which went after men—in particular, not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband—more venomously than another <b>guy</b> <b>would</b> have dared.

Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy, wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking {{for a man with}} an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it [...] "less outrageous in real life", and that people who watch The Simpsons but not Family <b>Guy</b> <b>would</b> be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman {{declined to comment on the}} joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was [...] "pretty funny... in context". A spokeswoman from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said [...] "I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke." ...|$|E

Simpson's vocals were recorded by Dan Hetzel at Sony Music Studios, New York City, and the track was mixed by Hetzel along with Richie Jones at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York. Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is for guys {{to listen to the}} girl".

Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a <b>guy</b> <b>would</b> be tedious." ...|$|E
