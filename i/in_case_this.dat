25|$|While the {{enforcement}} in theory {{could lead to}} a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of Look to Windward relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent's mind (with certain precautions <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>this</b> rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU Grey Area). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (Look To Windward).|$|E
500|$|Rousseau's unknown fate in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{was heavily}} {{discussed}} among critics. [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that the}} relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored, which made Rousseau's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene. BuddyTV's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive, mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons, and thought her death would ensure it would not happen. Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene, noting, [...] "I wasn't shocked to see Danielle get killed, but the scene felt like it was tossed in just <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>this</b> had to serve as the season finale." [...] Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death. [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman described it as [...] "a rude and lazy {{way to get rid of}} Rousseau". John Kubicek, also of BuddyTV, found her death scene unsatisfactory, commenting, [...] "Then we have that entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial, like I accidentally flipped over to a different show. While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow is shocking, is this really what the show has come to? Arbitrarily putting a recurring character's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger?" ...|$|E

Discussing this rumor in his 1946 {{correspondence}} with Deliu Petroiu, Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu speculated about the possibility that his friends were merely seeking to survive in a new society facing communization: [...] "A certain political indifferentism gives an absurd hue to all hopes for the best. The red dies are cast. [...] The boys have affiliated with the communists. That is to say Nego, Regman and Doinaş. They were promised a weekly magazine, funds etc. Nego even hopes for a visa and a passport to France." [...] Sîrbu expressed a belief that the Sibiu Circle cell could form [...] "an honest island in this chaos of asserted and legalized ignorance", and stated that, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>this</b> was not possible, he would join them in planning an escape, through Arad County, to a Western Allied-controlled territory.|$|E

Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>this</b> needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I think that that is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E
