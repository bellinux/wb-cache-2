5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Hubbard wrote all of {{the music}} for the album, with {{contributors}} utilizing instruments including synthesizers, bass, woodwinds, strings, and a bouzouki. She plays piano on the album. Most of the pieces on the album are of three to four minutes in duration. Wayne Isaak served as the Waterhouse Records publicist for the album. In publicity for the album, marketing compared Hubbard's musical writing style to that of Erik Satie. The album cover was marketed with a sticker on the outside wrapping advertising the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> endorsed by Stanley Clarke.|$|E
5|$|In April 1936, {{he and the}} Minister of the Interior Ion Inculeț {{allowed the}} a youth {{congress}} to gather in Târgu Mureș, aware of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca's memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in Târgu Mureș, made public their violent anti-Semitic agenda. It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading {{to the murder of}} Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.|$|E
5|$|Russian planes bombed Gori on 12 August, {{killing a}} seven people and {{wounding}} over thirty. Dutch television journalist Stan Storimans {{was among those}} killed and another foreign correspondent was injured. Georgian officials said that the Russians targeted the city's administrative buildings. The air raids set {{the post office and}} the Gori University on fire. The Gori Military Hospital was struck by a missile, in spite of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flying a Red Cross flag, killing one doctor.|$|E

5|$|That same year, a {{group of}} liberal ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views known as the Auburn Affirmation due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the work}} of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, the Affirmation claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to the Affirmation, the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to the five fundamentals.|$|E
5|$|The Norse-American medal {{is not a}} coin, and is {{not legal}} tender. Due to its {{similarity}} to a coin, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected {{as part of the}} U.S. commemorative coin series. Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the silver-plated one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair, and display damage or wear.|$|E
5|$|The house {{owes its}} name to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{formerly}} mistakenly identified with the Abbey’s tribunals, where secular justice was administered for Glaston Twelve Hides. The name may have been first used by John Collinson in his History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset in 1791, however whwen investigated by Richard Warner in 1826 he could not identify where the name had originated. It was also thought to be the site of trials by Judge Jeffreys for the Bloody Assizes after the Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Universal Pictures spent $2.1million {{to market}} the film in a 30-second {{television}} spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to Spider-Man on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of workprints were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not the final editing cut of the film.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd {{as he made his}} way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at its farthest distance from the ecliptic {{at the time of}} its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|In Japan {{during its}} opening week, Path of Radiance sold over 100,357 copies, selling through 64.16% of its initial shipment. By {{the end of}} 2005, the game had sold 156,413 copies. In its UK debut, it {{reached the top of}} the GameCube charts. Although no exact sales figures have been published, Nintendo cited the game as being among its {{successful}} GameCube titles for 2005. According to the developers, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> released near the end of the GameCube's lifespan affected sales, but it still managed to help sell the hardware and convinced Nintendo that the Fire Emblem had selling power on home consoles.|$|E
5|$|In {{clear and}} {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted the state sovereignty theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.' He {{called attention to the}} disregard with which 'an unrestrained majority' had received the memorials and protests of some of the 'sovereign states,' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away 'the solder of the Federal chain;' also to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> then 'strongly insinuated' that the states could not 'interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure.' Such a course, he was certain, could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered on May 18, 2015, at the 68th Cannes Film Festival, in an out-of-competition screening. In the United States, it premiered on June 8, 2015, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, and {{received}} a wide theatrical release starting on June 19, 2015, in 2D, 3D, and select IMAX 3D theatres. It was the first animated movie {{to be released in}} Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema and the second for Disney following Tomorrowland. Also notable was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of two feature films (the other being The Good Dinosaur) released by Pixar in the same calendar year, a first for the company.|$|E
5|$|The first {{religious}} building raised after Milford Haven {{was founded}} was St. Katharine's and St. Peter's, an Anglican church, {{it is considered}} to be the town's parish church due to its central position within the town and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> built by Charles Francis Greville the founder of Milford Haven. Other Anglican buildings include St. David's in Hubberston, St. Mary's (1927) and the Church of the Holy Spirit (1971) in Hakin and St. Peter's and St. Cewydd's in Steynton. St. David's is a Norman church and {{is believed to be the}} oldest building in Milford still in regular use. St. Mary's was built in 1927 largely by funds from the local residents of Hakin.|$|E
