25|$|The main {{differences}} of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the ephedrines are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both {{direct and indirect}} sympathomimetics. One {{of the main reasons}} for these <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{evidence}} shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 μM, which {{is higher than the}} activation level of ERs. At the concentration below 1 μM, activation of ERs may play a dominant role. At higher concentrations (>1 μM), both ERs and PPARs are activated. Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> in a dose-dependent way. The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{subwoofer}} is a woofer driver {{used only}} for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200Hz for consumer systems, below 100Hz for professional live sound, and below 80Hz in THX-approved systems. Because the intended range of frequencies is limited, subwoofer system design is usually simpler in many respects than for conventional loudspeakers, often consisting of a single driver enclosed in a suitable box or enclosure. [...] Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by diffraction, the speaker aperture {{does not have to}} face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted {{in the bottom of the}} enclosure, facing the floor. [...] This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies; [...] such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> {{of various}} {{wavelengths}} {{of light on}} the human cornea and skin are sometimes called the [...] "erythemal action spectrum.". The action spectrum shows that UVA does not cause immediate reaction, but rather UV begins to cause photokeratitis and skin redness (with Caucasians more sensitive) at wavelengths starting near the beginning of the UVB band at 315nm, and rapidly increasing to 300nm. The skin and eyes are most sensitive to damage by UV at 265–275nm, which is in the lower UVC band. At still shorter wavelengths of UV, damage continues to happen, but the overt effects are not as great with so little penetrating the atmosphere. The WHO-standard ultraviolet index is a widely publicized measurement of total strength of UV wavelengths that cause sunburn on human skin, by weighting UV exposure for action spectrum effects at a given time and location. This standard shows that most sunburn happens due to UV at wavelengths near the boundary of the UVA and UVB bands. Bioolympics discover UV reaction index to detect the leak of UV light.|$|E

60|$|Similarly {{with other}} assemblages of objects which are alike in their primary traits but unlike in their {{secondary}} traits. When simultaneously {{exposed to the}} same set of actions, some of these actions, rising to a certain intensity, may be expected to work on particular members of the assemblage changes which they cannot work in those which are markedly unlike; while others of the actions will work in all of them similar changes, because of the uniform relations between these actions and certain attributes common to all members of the assemblage. Hence it is inferable that on living organisms, which form an assemblage of this kind, and are unceasingly exposed in common to the agencies composing their inorganic environments, there must be wrought two such sets of effects. There will result a universal likeness among them consequent on the likeness of their respective relations to the matters and forces around; and there will result, in some cases, the differences due to the <b>differential</b> <b>effects</b> of these matters and forces, and in other cases, the changes which, being life-sustaining or life-destroying, eventuate in certain natural selections.|$|E
60|$|An observant rambler along shores, will, {{here and}} there, note {{places where the}} sea has {{deposited}} things more or less similar, and separated them from dissimilar things--will see shingle parted from sand; larger stones sorted from smaller stones; and will occasionally discover deposits of shells more or less worn by being rolled about. Sometimes the pebbles or boulders composing the shingle {{at one end of}} a bay, he will find much larger than those at the other: intermediate sizes, having small average differences, occupying the space between the extremes. An example occurs, if I remember rightly, some mile or two to the west of Tenby; but the most remarkable and well-known example is that afforded by the Chesil bank. Here, along a shore some sixteen miles long, there is a gradual increase in the sizes of the stones; which, being at one end but mere pebbles, are at the other end immense boulders. In this case, then, the breakers and the undertow have effected a selection--have at each place left behind those stones which were too large to be readily moved, while taking away others small enough to be moved easily. But now, if we contemplate exclusively this selective action of the sea, we overlook certain important effects which the sea simultaneously works. While the stones have been differently acted upon in so far that some have been left here and some carried there; they have been similarly acted upon in two allied, but distinguishable, ways. By perpetually rolling them about and knocking them one against another, the waves have so broken off their most prominent parts as to produce in all of them more or less rounded forms; and then, further, the mutual friction of the stones simultaneously caused, has smoothed their surfaces. That is to say in general terms, the actions of environing agencies, so far as they have operated indiscriminately, have produced in the stones a certain unity of character; {{at the same time that}} they have, by their <b>differential</b> <b>effects,</b> separated them: the larger ones having withstood certain violent actions which the smaller ones could not withstand.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A phenomenological {{anisotropic}} {{theory of}} viscoplasticity that takes {{account of the}} difference between the nonlinear rate-dependent behaviors of unidi-rectional carbon fiber-reinforced composites under off-axis tensile and compressive loading conditions is presented. The plane-stress representation of the effective stress associated with the pressure-modified Hill’s anisotropic yield criterion is modified into a new form that allows consideration {{of the difference between}} the shear flow stress levels under transverse tension and compression, i. e., a shear flow <b>differential</b> <b>effect,</b> {{as well as of the}} difference between the transverse tensile and compressive flow stress levels, i. e., a transverse flow <b>differential</b> <b>effect.</b> The shear flow <b>differential</b> <b>effect</b> is modeled in two ways by assuming the sensitivity and insensitivity to transverse stress, respectively. The rate-dependent plastic deformation of unidirectional compo-sites is modeled on the basis of the concept of overstress and the irreversible thermo-dynamics with internal variables. The viscoplasticity model proposed in the present study can be reduced to the form developed in an earlier study, which facilitates identification of material constants and comparison with other existing theories...|$|R
