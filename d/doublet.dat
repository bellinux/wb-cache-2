40|$|Single-motor-unit {{activity}} was recorded from flexor carpi radialis of two human subjects. 2. A {{large number of}} units showed repetitive <b>doublets</b> {{at the onset of}} slow recruitment. A unit starting with <b>doublets</b> would transfer to a normal firing pattern as the force increased. 3. At different speeds of ramp contractions, the number of <b>doublets</b> discharging at the onset of contraction decreased as the speed of contraction increased. 4. Both low- and high-threshold units discharged repetitive <b>doublets.</b> Motor units which could discharge <b>doublets</b> showed higher maximal firing rates than those units which did not fire <b>doublets.</b> 5. Short interspike intervals were also observed at the onset of ballistic movements. From the comparison of these short interspike intervals and the short intradoublet intervals we suggest that the two arise from two distinct phenomena in the spinal cord. 6.

40|$|Proximity, AE <b>doublets</b> are {{introduced}} {{as a new}} category of AE <b>doublets</b> in this paper. Proximity AE <b>doublets</b> have a similar wave form, and they occur in a succession with a short interval. Proximity, AE <b>doublets</b> have the second event that arrives before attenuation of the first event. Their interval is shorter than 1 s. On the other hand, interval between events of the conventional AE doublets/multiplets ranges from some seconds to some days. Because of this short interval of the proximity AE <b>doublets,</b> relative location between AE sources can be estimated more accurately in the proximity AE <b>doublets</b> analysis than in the conventional AE doublets/multiplets analysis. This paper also describes a signal processing technique to detemline intervals of P-wave and S-wave between two events of proximity AE <b>doublets.</b> It is difficult to estimate similarity between the two waveforms and their interval because the two events overlap each other. Cepstrum analysis is applied to estimate both the interval and the similarity. Proximity AE <b>doublets</b> {{have one or two}} peaks in their cepstrum, and quefrencies of the peaks are intervals of P-wave and S-wave between the two events. Three-component AE signal is rotated in the directions of P-wave and S-wave, and data before the first S-wave arrival is replaced with zeros so that the intervals can be determined from the peaks in the cepstrum analysis. Cepstrums of these processed three-component AE signal can show intervals of P-wave and S-wave between the two events of proximity AE <b>doublets...</b>|$|R

Progress in the detection and resolution of several types of degeneracies formed by whisker weaving are discussed. These examples include so-called knife <b>doublets,</b> triple <b>doublets,</b> through-cells and through-chords. Knife <b>doublets</b> and triple <b>doublets</b> are resolved by preventing their formation a-priori, which forces whisker weaving to remove the element(s) causing the degeneracy. Through-chords and through-cells are left in the weave and resolved after the weave has been closed. The paper concludes with three examples of geometries ``closed`` by whisker weaving...|$|R

All cohomologies are computed in the space of integrated local formal power series. We drop the usual assumption that the counting operator for the <b>doublets</b> commutes with s (decoupled <b>doublets)</b> and discuss the general case where the counting operator does not commute with s (coupled <b>doublets).</b> The techniques used are purely algebraic and do not rely on power-counting arguments. The main result is that the full cohomology that includes the <b>doublets</b> can be obtained directly from the cohomology of the doublets-independent component of s.

25|$|The key {{method to}} {{distinguish}} between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions ("coupling") and exact decay processes ("branching ratios"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs <b>doublet</b> couples to up and down quarks, while the second <b>doublet</b> does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions ("gauge-phobic") or just gauge bosons ("fermiophobic"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs <b>doublet</b> only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks. The heavily researched Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) includes a Type-II 2HDM Higgs sector, {{so it could be}} disproven by evidence of a Type-I 2HDM Higgs.|$|E
