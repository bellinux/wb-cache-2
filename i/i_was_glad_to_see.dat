Critics praised the scenes which involved Bud, Joan {{as well as}} Megan and Derek; [...] "the banter" [...] and [...] "opposites attracting", calling the episode [...] "tense" [...] and {{saying that it was}} the [...] "most gripping episode of this season so far".

500|$|A November 2005 demo {{contained}} thirteen songs, {{which included}} rough versions of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] and [...] "Halo". [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] contained what Flynn {{described as a}} [...] "totally fucking lame [...] "Angel of Death" [...] rip off. I hated it every time we played it so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that part go!" [...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production. Phil Demmel resumed lead guitar duties and Adam Duce returned as bassist.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening. Flynn {{originally}} presented it to the band as [...] "The Thrashterpiece" [...] which became the songs working title, because according to Flynn [...] "it owes a huge debt to the band Exodus, (there's) a lot of Bay Area thrash worship {{going on in this}} song." [...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off. I hated it every time we played it so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that part go!" [...] The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in Oakland, California on August 21, 2006 to begin recording. Production duties were handled by Flynn with assistance from Mark Keaton, and mixing by Colin Richardson.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E

[...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship.
