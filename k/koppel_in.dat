NBC News also began continuous coverage, with Tom Brokaw, about an hour later.

500|$|Røkke and Gjelsten {{appointed}} a new club chairman, Charles <b>Koppel,</b> <b>in</b> January 2001. According to Stephen Morrow in The People's Game?: Football, Finance and Society (2003), Koppel {{had never been}} to a football match before becoming involved with Wimbledon and [...] "gave the impression of being completely unaware of the relationship that exists between a football club and its supporters." [...] He was interested in an [...] "enabling development" [...] whereby a stadium could be created and funded as part of a business or leisure opportunity—exactly the kind of proposition put forward by Winkelman.|$|E

500|$|A month later, Winkelman {{offered his}} Milton Keynes stadium site to QPR, {{promising}} that the club's name and blue-and-white hooped strip {{would be kept}} in Buckinghamshire and that the fans would be represented {{on the board of}} directors. [...] "We have real resources to put behind the club," [...] said Winkelman. [...] "They are fast running out of solutions and we are the answer to their problems." [...] QPR dismissed the offer, leading the developers to once again contact Wimbledon later that month. With <b>Koppel</b> <b>in</b> charge, Wimbledon were more receptive this time around—Koppel said that Wimbledon's owners were subsidising the club to the tune of £6million per year and that such action was necessary to prevent its liquidation. As talks progressed, Winkelman approached the owner of Milton Keynes City, attempting to buy the club name. It soon became clear that the bulk of Wimbledon's support strongly opposed a move of this kind.|$|E
