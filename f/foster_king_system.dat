40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{describe}} a breastfeeding theory based on <b>King's</b> Conceptual <b>System.</b> Method: Theoretical study that used analysis of concept, assertion synthesis, and derivation of theory {{for the creation}} of a new theory. Results: <b>King's</b> <b>system</b> components were associated with elements of the breastfeeding process and a middle-range theory was created, which describes, explains, predicts, and prescribes breastfeeding by analyzing factors that precede and affect it, as well as their consequences on the breastfeeding process. Conclusion: The Breastfeeding Interactive Model is abstract enough to be applied in different social, cultural, political, and economic contexts, because it conceptualizes breastfeeding in systemic, dynamic, and procedural aspects. Based on a conceptual model of nursing, it contributes to the scientific construction of the subject; however it can also potentially be applied by other professionals involved in breastfeeding assistance...|$|R

60|$|The {{history of}} the policy of {{authority}} towards the Encyclopædia is only one episode in the great lesson {{of the reign of}} Lewis XV. It was long a common mistake to think of this <b>king's</b> <b>system</b> of government as violent and tyrannical. In truth, its failure and confusion resulted less from the arbitrariness of its procedure, than from the hopeless absence of tenacity, conviction, and consistency in the substance and direction of its objects. And this, again, was the result partly of the complex and intractable nature of the opposition with which successive ministers had to deal, and partly of the overpowering strength of those Asiatic maxims of government which Richelieu and Lewis XIV. had invested with such ruinous prestige. The impatience and charlatanry of emotional or pseudo-scientific admirers of a personal system blind them to the permanent truth, of which the succession of the decrepitude of Lewis XV. to the strength of his great-grandfather, and of the decrepitude of Napoleon III. to the strength of his uncle, are only illustrations.|$|R
