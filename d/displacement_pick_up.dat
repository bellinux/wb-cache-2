40|$|Abstract Vivid motion illusions {{created by}} some Op art {{paintings}} {{are at the}} centre of a lively scientific debate about possible mechanisms that might underlie these phenomena. Here we review emerging evidence from a new approach that combines perceptual judgements of the illusion and observations of eye movements with simu-lations of the induced optic flow. This work suggests that the small involuntary saccades which participants make when viewing such Op art patterns would generate an incoherent distribution of motion signals that resemble the perceptual effects experienced by the observers. The combined experimental and computational evidence sup-ports {{the view that the}} illusion is indeed caused by involuntary image <b>displacements</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by low-level motion detectors, and further suggests that coheren...|$|R
