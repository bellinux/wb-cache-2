500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
2500|$|After the American {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, al-Masri went to Iraq via the United Arab Emirates in 2002, {{according to the}} subsequent account given by his widow. He lived initially in Baghdad's Karrada, then in the Amiriya fainal, and then al-Jadida, where he took charge of al-Qaeda’s operations {{in the southern part}} of the country. The United States military said that Masri [...] "helped draw other insurgent groups into al-Qaeda’s fold." [...] DefenseLINK News reported that Masri [...] "helped establish the Baghdad cell of al-Qaeda in early 2003". Soon after, he [...] "worked the ‘rat line’ down the Euphrates River Valley supplying suicide bombers via Syria." [...] After the US-led invasion, the family left Baghdad for Diyala to the north. Hasna related [...] "The two-storey house where we were was hit in a US air raid. Then, one of the men was killed but my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> able to escape to Fallujah" [...] [...] Al-Masri participated in the major 2004 battle of Fallujah. After US troops stormed the town in November 2004, the family moved again, this time to the town of Abu Ghraib, on the western outskirts of the capital. In 2007, al-Masri and his family moved to the Lake Tharthar area. [...] "We were changing houses the whole time, right up to his death," [...] claimed Hasna.|$|E
60|$|The {{confusion}} that followed was indescribable. The doors were almost barricaded. My {{sister and her}} <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> allowed through easily enough, as we {{were known to be}} subscribers, but almost every one else seemed to be undergoing a sort of cross-examination. My brother-in-law was disposed to be irritable.|$|E
5000|$|My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a {{short-lived}} black-and-white British sitcom starring Evelyn Laye <b>and</b> her <b>husband</b> Frank Lawton, who played themselves.

5000|$|My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a typical}} {{domestic}} sitcom {{made for the}} refined <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> wife team Evelyn Laye and Frank Lawton.

6000|$|... "The theatres?" [...] {{said another}} lady. [...] "How {{you must have}} enjoyed them. I just love the theatres. Last week my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> at the Palatial--it's moving pictures--where they have that film with the motor {{collision}} running. It's just wonderful. You see the motors going at full speed, and then smash right into one another--and all the people killed--it's really fine." ...|$|E
6000|$|In England {{we should}} {{certainly}} {{not have done}} all this in public, and my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> terribly put to the blush; indeed, I felt my whole head and neck burning, and {{caught a glimpse of}} myself in a dreadful mirror, my white bridal dress and flaxen hair making my fiery face look, my brothers would have said, 'as if I had been skinned.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that night}} we sat together, our arms round each other, each {{strengthening}} each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next evening had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{on our way to}} London, but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger, and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus far, {{you know}} {{little or nothing}} about me, Mr. Dexter," [...] I said. [...] "You <b>are,</b> as <b>I</b> believe, quite unaware that my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> not living {{together}} at the present time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know Junius half {{as well as}} I wish I did," [...] said Annie, as she {{finished}} the letter, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very sure, indeed, that he will make a good <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad he has got Roberta March--as he wants her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> good Presbyterians, and I {{had never}} given {{much thought to}} spirits or spiritualism, but after our little boy died Robert began to study up, {{and every time we}} went to the city he'd go to see a psychic, and that troubled me. As a good church-member I thought he ought not to do it, and so one day I said, 'Robert, I think you ought to tell Mr. McLane'--that was our minister--'what you are doing. It isn't right to visit mediums and go to church, too--one or the other ought to be given up.' He said--I {{remember}} his exact words: 'I can't live without these messages of comfort from my boy. They say he is going to manifest himself soon--here in our own home.' I remember that was his exact expression, for I wondered what it was to manifest. That very night things began." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a thing almost {{against nature}} {{for a woman}} to try to part true lovers," [...] {{answered}} the yeoman's wife, after a pause; [...] "but I'll speak as truly to you as if these were my dying words. Though my husband told you some of our troubles, he didn't mention the greatest, and that which makes all the rest so hard to bear. If you and your sweetheart marry, you'll be kind and pleasant to each other for a year or two, and while that's the case, you never will repent; but, by and by, he'll grow gloomy, rough, and hard to please, and you'll be peevish, and full of little angry fits, and apt to be complaining by the fireside, when he comes to rest himself from his troubles out of doors; so your love will wear away by little and little, and leave you miserable at last. It has been so with us; and yet my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> true lovers once, if ever two young folks were [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Makely very {{promptly}} seized her chance: [...] "Well, then, in {{the first}} place, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> talking it over last night after we left you, {{and that was one}} of the things that kept us awake; it turned into money afterward. It isn't so much that a whole continent, as big as Australia, remained undiscovered till within such a very few years, as it is the condition of things among you: this sort of all living for one another, and not each one for himself. My husband says that is simply moonshine; such a thing never was and never can be; it is opposed to human nature, and would take away incentive and all motive for exertion and advancement and enterprise. I don't know what he didn't say against it; but one thing, he says it's perfectly un-American." [...] The Altrurian remained silent, gravely smiling, and Mrs. Makely added, with her most engaging little manner: [...] "I hope you won't feel hurt, personally or patriotically, by what I've repeated to you. I know my husband is awfully Philistine, though he is such a good fellow, and I don't, by any means, agree with him on all those points; but I would like to know what you think of them. The trouble is, Mrs. Camp," [...] she said, turning to the invalid, [...] "that Mr. Homos is so dreadfully reticent about his own country, and I am so curious to hear of it at first hands, that I consider it justifiable to use any means to make him open up about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "These cups," [...] she said, [...] "were all the {{personal}} property of my <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> therefore free to take them. Many {{of them have}} been in his family for a very long time. Their sale will enable me to live until I can form some plans for the future." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was beginning, [...] "Oh no, oh no," [...] but I cut in. [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{on our way}} to {{the next}} Regionic capital, and we are {{somewhat}} hurried. You will be quite well looked after by the neighbors here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> see that we are rather in your housekeeper's way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was when}} the first Child Harold came out upon Lord Byron's return from Greece that I first had the misfortune {{to be acquainted with}} him--at that time I was the happiest and gayest of human beings I do believe without exception--I had married for love and love the most romantic and ardent--my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> so fond of each other that false as I too soon proved he never would part with me. Devonshire House was at that time closed from my Uncle's death for one year--at Melbourne House where I lived the Waltzes and Quadrilles were being daily practised, Lady Jersey, Lady Cowper, the Duke of Devonshire, Miss Milbanke and a number of foreigners coming there to learn--You may imagine what forty or fifty people dancing from 12 in the morning until near dinner time all young gay and noisy were--in the evenings we either had {{opposition}} suppers or went out to Balls and routs--such was the life I then led when Moore and Rogers introduced Lord Byron to me--What you say of his falling upstairs and of Miss Milbanke is all true. Lord Byron 3 days after this brought me a Rose and Carnation and used the very words I mentioned in Glenarvon--with a sort of half sarcastic smile--saying, 'Your Ladyship I am told likes all that is new and rare for a moment'--I have them still, and the woman who through many a trial has kept these relics with the romance of former ages--deserves not that you should speak of her as you do. Byron never never could say I had no heart. He never could say, either, that I had not loved my husband. In his letters to me he is perpetually telling me I love him the best of the two; and my only charm, believe me, in his eyes was, that I was innocent, affectionate, and enthusiastic.|$|E
5000|$|One day, as Margarete and Söfren sit by Mari's bedside, Margarete confesses: [...] "My first <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> engaged {{for many}} years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow. We knew that the widow was weak and could {{scarcely}} live long. It was a sore temptation to us. God forgive us ... we built our happiness on the hope of another's death." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Amy Roloff {{commented on}} the {{beginnings}} of the show: [...] "TLC came to us about five or six years ago, and so we suddenly realized we were given a great opportunity to educate people about dwarfism. When it was offered that we do a show about our lives, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> like, [...] "Wow, nothing like this has even been on the air." [...] Nothing had depicted dwarfism in an everyday way. Lo and behold, a few episodes turned into six seasons. And here we are." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Lassie {{doing well}} with the TV audiences, Tommy Rettig sought release from his {{contract}} in the popular series' fourth season.

6000|$|... "You don't suppose I've {{enjoyed the}} last quarter of an hour, do you?" [...] said Lady Blemley bitterly. [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> very fond of Tobermory--at least, we were before this horrible {{accomplishment}} was infused into him; but now, of course, the only thing is to have him destroyed as soon as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor young woman. She {{has lost}} her <b>husband,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid, now has lost her friends also. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{told that she}} is not well off;--and from what <b>I</b> see <b>and</b> hear, <b>I</b> fancy that here in England a young lady without a dowry cannot easily replace a lover. I suppose, too, Miss Trefoil is not quite in her first youth." ...|$|R
5000|$|Case 3: [...] "On Friday {{night my}} <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{watching}} television. My husband remarked {{that he was}} tired. I asked, 'How are you tired?

5000|$|In 1980, the US House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging began {{what became}} a {{four-year}} investigation into health care scams that preyed on older people; the committee received testimony {{from a woman}} desperate to treat her husband's cancer who accepted treatment from Steven and Ellen Haasz, disciples of Wigmore, and eventually from Wigmore's facility in Boston, instead of standard care which the Haaszes strongly discouraged from her pursuing. She said: [...] "I know now that I was foolish to listen to Haasz and to spend about $2,000, including the trip to Boston, on the raw food things. But my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> married for 37 years {{and when he got}} sick, I was looking for magic. Their false promise of hope may have actually shortened my husband's few numbered days on this Earth."

5000|$|Early in {{the spring}} of 1905, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> sojourning in Elmira, New York. We {{contracted}} a deep friendship for a couple by the name of Mr. and Mrs. Doolittle—true saints of God. Mrs. Doolittle had been bedridden for nigh twenty years. Her husband was an incurable cripple who had to propel himself to and from his business in a wheel chair. Despite their afflictions, they lived happy Christian lives, bringing inspiration and comfort to all who knew them. One day while we were visiting with the Doolittles, my husband commented on their bright hopefulness and asked them for the secret of it. Mrs. Doolittle's reply was simple: [...] "His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me." [...] The beauty of this simple expression of boundless faith gripped the hearts and fired the imagination of Dr. Martin and me. The hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow" [...] was the outcome of that experience.|$|E

[...] Crediting Sinclair for helping her get through tough times, Colman has said that [...] "Sinclair was gorgeous, the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen," [...] suggesting that the feeling was not instantly mutual. She added, [...] "I stuck with him and made him realise he could only be happy with me. I still feel like I'm punching above my weight."
