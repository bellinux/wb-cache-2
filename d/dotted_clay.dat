50|$|As a {{concession}} to its more conservative audience, the Jazzmaster was the first Fender guitar carrying a rosewood fingerboard instead of maple. The fingerboard had <b>clay</b> <b>dot</b> position inlays and was glued onto a two-piece maple neck. The Jazzmaster initially came with a four-ply brown tortoise shell pickguard, although from 1958 to mid 1959 they came with a one-ply anodized (aluminum) gold pickguard.|$|R
50|$|The Stratocaster XII is {{designed}} in the United States and manufactured in Japan. The original 1985 version featured some slight differences compared to the re-issue model of 2005; it had a larger bridge and saddle system {{similar to that of}} an Electric XII and an altered headstock shape with raised machine heads. It also used a 22-fret neck with a rosewood fingerboard and pearloid dots. The current version features a modified hard-tail Strat bridge, a pao ferro fretboard with 21 frets and <b>clay</b> <b>dot</b> inlays.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common ways that Chesapeake pipes were {{decorated}} was through the pointillé effect, in which lines of indented dots would be pushed into the clay. This was produced in two ways, the first of which was rouletting, or using a rolling, toothed wheel to produce the desired effect. The other was by using a single, stationary hand-held tool to indent each of the <b>dots</b> into the <b>clay</b> one by one. Stewart suggested that such punctuations may have been made using shark's teeth. Another, albeit far rarer, form of decoration employed on certain Chesapeake pipes was cord wrapping, in which a piece of cord or string was wrapped tightly around the clay to leave a patterned indentation.|$|R

Traditionally, milk for churning is collected in a <b>clay</b> <b>Dot</b> for several days, soured naturally, and then churned by shaking the pot until butter granules form. This takes up to four hours of churning. The ILCA team developed a simple internal wooden paddle agitator to improve {{the efficiency of the}} simple clay pot churn. The temperature and acidity of the milk are not changed. Fifty-nine churnings were observed, of which the shortest was 50 minutes and the longest 65. This significant shortening of the process not only eases women's work load but also boosts the butter yield, thereby increasing income, because the amount of fat left in the buttermilk is reduced.

40|$|The {{invitation}} to curate {{an exhibition of}} the Drawing Research Interest Group (DRIG’s) work emerged in 2013, as a parallel but related part of the Mobility of the Line exhibition. The aim was to show an extended range of approaches to and understandings of drawing, through staff and research student work-in-progress and examples of research into applied drawing practices. The common interest in the line’s utility underpins DRIG. It is a notion debated and interpreted in a range ways by the group: as an arts practice, a research method and as having multiple and cross-disciplinary applications. The potency and utility of the line can result from ancient or contemporary technologies of mark-making. There is sometimes a sense in higher education that drawing has been overtaken; that it is lodged in pedagogical past where observational drawing formed a core part of an art school training. The Utility of the Line exhibitors {{could be seen as}} part a long tradition of drawing, but one that continues to evolve, investigate and inquire. The group showed how experiences and affordances of drawing continue to be crucial in exploring a wide range of issues. Each member of the Drawing Research Interest Group is concerned with significance, practice and potential of drawing, whether with lines, <b>dots,</b> in <b>clay</b> or textiles, on paper or through software programmes and performance. In and through drawing, questions have arisen for us about why this considered practice of mark-making is not only relevant now, but seems to us to hold so much promise of new forms of practice and new knowledge. Drawing can be a practice that holds our attention in contemplation and which, as a finished piece, continues to asks the viewer to dwell on issues of temporality and perception. It can provoke and enable questions about bodily and metaphysical disturbances to be expressed, relating for example to processes of memory or identity, issues of anatomical and surgical understanding, and the experiencing and conceptual mapping of pain states. A cluster of research carried out by DRIG members investigates the relationships between drawing practices in different professions or in collaborative, cross-disciplinary education. This cluster has grown through a collaborative research relationship with the Brighton and Sussex Medical School and with medics and surgeons elsewhere, two of whom were included in the show. This exhibition helped consolidate these collaborative relationships and disseminate the preliminary research to a much broader audience...|$|R
