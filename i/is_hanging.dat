5|$|There {{are three}} Scheduled Ancient Monuments in the city. The oldest is an Iron Age {{promontory}} fort occupied from 500BC–200AD. Also scheduled <b>is</b> <b>Hanging</b> Bridge {{on the border}} with Manchester, dating to the 14th century, and an underground section of the Bridgewater Canal in Swinton built in 1759.|$|E
5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior {{to the destruction of}} the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E
5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> {{out with}} his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E

5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to Lech Wałęsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw {{was seen as a}} symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum where it is now on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a kilim embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E

25|$|A plain {{rectangular}} {{shape is}} terminated at its Eastern side by a semicircular half-domed apse. The apse's vault is ornamented with paintings of angels/cherubims {{on a light}} blue background. The altar, made of white marble, is centred into the apse and pushed into its wall. The icon representing Saint Awtel <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> above the altar {{in the middle of}} the apse. The altar is separated by few steps from the chancel, which in turn is separated from the nave by other few steps and an iron parapet.|$|E

25|$|One running gag has Sergeant Snorkel hanging helplessly from a {{small tree}} branch after having fallen off a cliff (first time August 16, 1956). While he is never shown falling off, or even walking {{close to the edge}} of a cliff, he always seems to hold on to that same branch, yelling for help. This gag may have spawned the segment of the children's show Between the Lions {{featuring}} a person named Cliff Hanger, who, like Sergeant Snorkel, <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> from a cliff in each feature.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, {{while driving}} {{the men and}} women of Underworld to an up class hotel, Steve loses control of their minibus when he is distracted by {{reckless}} drivers, and ends up crashing. The vehicle <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> over the edge of a cliff, and leaving the passengers' lives hanging in the balance. Steve regains consciousness first and abandons the wreckage. While everyone emerges alive from the crash, young Sinead Tinker is left paralysed, potentially for life, and Steve's depression takes a turn for the worse. The episode where the bus crashes was broadcast on the same night actress Anne Kirkbride's death occurred and was announced.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire {{to kill his}} enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking up behind them and killing them with one hit, or by {{dropping}} down onto an enemy whilst Drake <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> from a ledge. The stealth mechanic has been simplified and improved. Some areas of the game will require the player to solve puzzles {{with the use of}} Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E

25|$|After {{the guards}} release Prithvi, Nandita is possessed again in her bathroom, with same lines {{appearing}} in the mirror. She goes to Prithvi for help, but he refuses her, showing her a new painting in which she <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> herself and the same lines seem to appear behind her. He also shows her some news clippings {{about the death of}} the priest and David Cooper, with the same lines written behind them. Nandita thanks him and leaves to attend a party with Yash. There she is possessed and attacked again, and starts bleeding. Meanwhile, Prithvi prepares himself to help Nandita by burning the ominous painting of Nandita, which symbolises that he will protect her. He spots Nandita running from the party, apparently bleeding, and follows her. He finally catches up to her in a slum, where he sees her writing the same lines as before with her blood. He tries to stop her, but realises that she is possessed. She then tries to commit suicide but he prevents her from doing so. Yash arrives to find Nandita in Prithvi's arms.|$|E
25|$|The summit {{area is a}} ridge running north–south {{with the}} final pyramid near the {{south-west}} corner and crags on three sides. The southern face is formed by Bowfell Links, an impressive wall of crag scarred by nine vertical gullies and with corresponding tongues of scree at its foot. A climb up these is neither pleasurable nor safe as they are extremely active loose rock channels. The eastern face carries a wealth of features including Flat Crag, Cambridge Crag and the Bowfell Buttress, the latter two providing good climbing. Flat Crag includes the Great Slab, a remarkable tilted sheet of rock which looks exactly as it sounds. Below these faces runs the Climber's Traverse, a narrow path providing an excellent high-level walking route to the summit from the highest point of The Band. This largely horizontal line contours around beneath many of Bowfell's most dramatic crags, finally reaching the summit via a rocky route known as the River of Boulders, running parallel to the Great Slab. Finally on the north- east corner of the summit ridge <b>is</b> <b>Hanging</b> Knotts, a complex series of faces and outcrops looking down upon Angle Tarn.|$|E
25|$|On her {{way down}} the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held by a Munchkin man named Boq. The next day, Dorothy frees the Scarecrow from the pole on which he <b>is</b> <b>hanging,</b> applies oil from a can to the rusted {{connections}} of the Tin Woodman, and meets the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages the three of them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the travelers enter the gates of the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. The Wizard appears to Dorothy as a giant head on a marble throne, the Scarecrow as a lovely lady in silk gauze, the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and the Cowardly Lion as a ball of fire. The Wizard agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Oz's Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.|$|E

25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking up behind them to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake <b>is</b> <b>hanging.</b> In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E

500|$|The band's main {{release of}} 1985 was the British single [...] "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg"; {{though it was}} {{available}} in the United States only as an import, it was played widely on American college radio. The song was written, primarily by Joey, in protest of Ronald Reagan's visit to a German military cemetery, which included graves of Waffen SS soldiers. Retitled [...] "My Brain <b>Is</b> <b>Hanging</b> Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)", the song appeared on the band's ninth studio album, Animal Boy (1986). Produced by Jean Beauvoir, formerly {{a member of the}} Plasmatics, the album was characterized by a Rolling Stone reviewer as [...] "nonstop primal fuzz pop". Making it his pick for [...] "album of the week", New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote that the Ramones [...] "speak up for outcasts and disturbed individuals".|$|E
500|$|He is {{best known}} for novels such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975), No One Writes to the Colonel (1962), and post-Boom work such as Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). He has {{achieved}} significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for introducing what has been labeled magical realism to the literary world. He experimented with more or less traditional approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she <b>is</b> <b>hanging</b> the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. García Márquez is now {{considered one of the most}} significant authors of the 20th century, as is attested by his winning the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature.
