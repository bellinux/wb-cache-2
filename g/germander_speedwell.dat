5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were <b>Germander</b> <b>Speedwell,</b> Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E

50|$|This ancient {{woodland}} has {{a variety}} of flora such as oxlips and early-purple orchids in the spring and water avens and <b>germander</b> <b>speedwells</b> in the summer. Muntjac and roe deer use the site and birds include goldcrests, great spotted woodpeckers and tawny owls.|$|R

6000|$|Love-in-a-mist, angels' eyes, forget-me-not, and heartsease, are {{familiar}} examples. Heartsease and pansy both strike us as peculiarly appropriate {{to one of}} our commonest and most universal garden flowers; yet we see something besides the sympathetic and restful expression which suggested these names in this flower--a certain suggestion of demureness, in fact, reminding those who have seen Guido's picture of the [...] "Adoration of the Virgin," [...] of one of his loveliest angels whose angelical eyes and face reveal some desire for admiration and love in the spectator. And that expression, too, of the pansy named Love-in-Idleness, has been described, coarsely or rudely it may be, in some of its country names: [...] "Kiss me behind the garden gate," [...] and, better (or worse) still, [...] "Meet-her-i'-th'-entry-kiss-her-i'-th'-buttery." [...] Of this order of names are None-so-pretty and Pretty maids, Pretty Betsy, Kiss-me-quick. Even such a name as Tears of the blood of Christ does not sound extravagantly fanciful or startling {{when we look at the}} glowing deep golden crimson of the wall flower; nor of a blue flower, the <b>germander</b> <b>speedwell,</b> such names as The more I see you the more I love you, and Angels' tears, and Tears of Christ, with many more.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{parts of}} the Forest play host to relic meadow flora such as meadow foxtail, short-stemmed meadow-grass, Yorkshire fog, red clover, white clover, oxeye daisy, <b>germander</b> <b>speedwell</b> and meadow saxifrage.|$|E

50|$|Both sexes visit green alkanet, devil's-bit scabious, and thistle flowers. The queen also {{flies to}} dandelion, red clover, <b>germander</b> <b>speedwell,</b> and ground ivy, while the male feeds on bramble and knapweed.|$|E
50|$|The {{watercolour}} shows a {{large piece}} of turf and little else. The various plants can be identified as cock's-foot, creeping bent, smooth meadow-grass, daisy, dandelion, <b>germander</b> <b>speedwell,</b> greater plantain, hound's-tongue and yarrow.|$|E
50|$|Flowers {{observed}} {{throughout the}} summer: cowslip, scabious, {{red and white}} campions, herb-Robert, red and white dead nettle, mallow, scarlet pimpernel, trefoil, yarrow, yellow rattle, bed straw, oxeye daisies, red and white clover, hare's-foot clover, grounsel, hawkweed, <b>germander</b> <b>speedwell,</b> a range of tall grasses.|$|E
50|$|Despite its busy urban setting, {{the churchyard}} {{maintains}} {{an atmosphere of}} calm and its grassland is a haven for wildlife. Over a hundred plant species are found here, including many traditionally found in churchyards, for example <b>Germander</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Angel’s eyes), Snowdrops (Eve’s tears) and Greater stitchwort (Easter bell).|$|E
50|$|Quarries, {{gravel and}} sand pits, roads and railways, field boundaries, walls, waste ground and rubbish tips contain such plant species as common ragwort, {{pineapple}} weed, hairy bindweed, creeping buttercup, common daisy, catsear, coltsfoot, fat hen, nettle, redshank, <b>germander</b> <b>speedwell,</b> ivy-leaved toadflax, rosebay willowherb, great willowherb and wall pennywort.|$|E
50|$|Resonance has {{broadcast}} {{a number of}} Hooting Yard special episodes. In December 2007 Key and the performance artist <b>Germander</b> <b>Speedwell</b> performed the whole of Jubilate Agno., an epic devotional poem by Christopher Smart This {{was the first and}} only time that this poem has been performed in its entirety on live radio. The entire performance was in excess of three hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Germander</b> <b>Speedwell</b> is a common, hardy turf weed when it invades turf and lawns. It creeps {{along the}} ground, {{spreading}} by sending down roots at the stem nodes. It is propagated both by seed and stem fragments. Leaves may defoliate {{in the summer}} and winter but the stems will grow again next season.Unlike at least five other common speedwell turf weeds such as corn speedwell (Veronica arvensis), the leaves are oppositeboth on the upper and lower parts of the plant. See the Veronica for special weed control considerations.|$|E
50|$|The {{second of}} seven children, Richard Buxton {{was born on}} 15 January 1786 at Sedgley Hall Farm in the parish of Prestwich, near Manchester, Lancashire. His parents were John and Anne Buxton (née Horton), both from Derbyshire. When he was two years old his family fell on hard times, left their farm and moved to Bond Street in Ancoats, Manchester. John Buxton worked as a {{labourer}} {{for the rest of}} his life.Richard was a sickly child and his parents' reduced circumstances meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In his early years he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were <b>Germander</b> <b>Speedwell,</b> Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed.

40|$|Studying herbal {{products}} {{derived from}} local and traditional knowledge and their value chains {{is one of}} the main challenges in ethnopharmacology. The majority of these products have a long history of use, but non-harmonized trade and differences in regulatory policies between countries impact their value chains and lead to concerns over product efficacy, safety and quality. Veronica officinalis L. (common speedwell), a member of Plantaginaceae family, has a long history of use in European traditional medicine, mainly in central eastern Europe and the Balkans. However, no specified control tests are available either to establish the quality of derived herbal products or for the discrimination of its most common substitute, V. chamaedrys L. (<b>germander</b> <b>speedwell).</b> In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to authenticate sixteen V. officinalis herbal products and compare the potential of the two approaches to detect substitution, adulteration and the use of unreported constituents. HPLC-MS showed high resolution in detecting phytochemical target compounds, but did not enable detection of specific plant species in the products. DNA metabarcoding detected V. officinalis in only 15 % of the products, whereas it detected V. chamaedrys in 62 % of the products. The results confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used to test for the presence of Veronica species, and detect substitution and/or admixture of other Veronica species, as well as simultaneously detect all other species present. Our results confirm that none of the herbal products contained exactly the species listed on the label, and all included substitutes, contaminants or fillers. This study highlights the need for authentication of raw herbals along the value chain of these products. An integrative methodology can assess both the quality of herbal products in terms of target compound concentrations and species composition, as well as admixture and substitution with other chemical compounds and plants...|$|E
