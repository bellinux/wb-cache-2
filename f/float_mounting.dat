5000|$|MIL-DTL-24308 (formerly MIL-C-24308 and MIL-PRF-24308) {{describes}} non-environmental, polarized shell, miniature, {{rack and}} panel connectors having pin and socket, crimp (removable), solder (non-removable), or insulation displacement (non-removable) contacts with rigid or <b>float</b> <b>mounting,</b> designed for -55 °C to +125 °C operating temperature range. Also called [...] D-subminiature or D-sub connectors, {{they are designed}} primarily for applications where space and weight are of major importance while accommodating {{a large number of}} circuits in proportion to their size which makes them well suited for aircraft, missiles and related ground support systems. Although MIL-DTL-24308 connectors are primarily designed for rack and panel applications, these connectors can also be adapted for other cabling requirements by addition of accessories and integral clamps. These connectors are intended for general military use as follows: (i) Classes G and N connectors are intended for use in applications where the operating temperature range of -55° to +125 °C is experienced; Class N connectors are used in applications where the presence of residual magnetism must be held to low levels; (iii) Class H receptacles are used where atmospheric pressures must be contained across the wall or panels on which the connectors are mounted; and (iv) Classes D, K, and M connectors are for high-reliability space applications. The insert arrangements are provided in the specification.|$|E

40|$|Wafer probing is {{a testing}} process to inspect {{semiconductor}} wafers before packaging for defects by checking the electrical conductivity via physical {{contact between the}} wafers and the probe card. During the contact process, {{the shape of the}} probe needle and the mounting configuration onto the probe card have large influences on the stresses and contact force that the probe needles experience. In this paper, static performance of a vertical-type probe needle integrated with <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> technology is analyzed with a nonlinear finite element analysis. The comparison between fixed <b>mount</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> technologies {{is a part of the}} analyses. The geometry of a vertical probe needle is optimized to minimize the stress that occurs during the overdrive process, while maintaining adequate force for proper contact with the wafer. Effects of major overall dimensions of probe needle on the maximum stress and contact force is analyzed first, and then curvature of the probe needle body is optimized by employing a constrained minimization function, fmincon, in MATLAB. The maximum stress in the vertical probe pin at 125 µm overdrive is effectively reduced from 1339 MPa to 972 MPa by applying <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> technology over the fixed mount, and further reduced to 666 MPa by applying the optimization scheme. The final optimized design induced the contact force of 5. 217 gf, which is in the range of the required contact force of 5 to 8 gf. Fatigue life increased from 19, 219 cycles to 108, 129 by applying <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> over fixed mount, and further increased to 830, 596 for the optimized design...|$|R

50|$|Only {{the cast}} iron hub of this wheel remains, {{on a wooden}} axle of some 18 in{{diameter}}. The wheel had eight wooden spokes per side.

25|$|The {{hull of the}} Type H was, {{like that}} of its predecessors, a single step design. A pair of flat {{bottomed}} <b>floats,</b> <b>mounted</b> below the outer interplane struts, stabilized the aircraft on the water. Two flight crew members were accommodated side-by-side and a front gunner sat separately in the nose.

2500|$|The Nimrod had a {{conventional}} undercarriage of cross axle type on trailing struts, with compression legs almost {{at right angles}} to the fuselage and an aft tailskid.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{powered by the}} Blackburn Cirrus II engine or similar engines in the 56 to 60 kilowatt (75 to 80 horsepower) range, driving a two-bladed tractor propeller.

5000|$|In {{a flying}} boat, {{the main source}} of {{buoyancy}} is the fuselage, which acts like a ship's hull in the water because the fuselage's underside has been hydrodynamically shaped to allow water to flow around it. Most flying boats have small <b>floats</b> <b>mounted</b> on their wings to keep them stable. Not all small seaplanes have been floatplanes, but most large seaplanes have been flying boats, with their great weight supported by their hulls.|$|R
25|$|The Sporting Type was {{designed}} to meet RAF specification number RAF XXXII. It was a four-seat, single-engined biplane with twin wooden <b>floats</b> <b>mounted</b> on wire-braced struts below the fuselage. It had two cockpits, the forward cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem, the other for two passengers sitting abreast; the rear cockpit could also function as cargo room, increasing the aircraft's operational flexibility. The fuselage was of semi-monocoque plywood construction with a fabric fairing.|$|R
5000|$|Designed to be amphibious, the SeaRey has a {{semi-monocoque}} hull {{similar to}} that of a boat.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedMeasurements of air temperature fluctuations {{as close as}} 2. 5 cm above {{the surface of a}} pond in the presence of wind generated waves were made. Fast response thermistors were used, one at constant absolute height and one mounted on a styrofoam float. Data were collected on an Ampex CP- 100 tape recorder using FM record amplifiers and a tape speed of 1 and 7 / 8 ips. The data were digitized by an SDS- 9300 hybrid computer and analyzed by an IBM 360 / 67 digital computer. Temperature fluctuations as large as 5 C in as little as 0. 2 seconds were observed with the <b>float</b> <b>mounted</b> thermistor. There was strong correlation between the fixed and floating thermistor readings, with the fluctuation amplitude of the floating thermistor being more than three times larger than the fluctuation amplitude for the fixed thermistor. This ratio decreased when the height of the <b>float</b> <b>mounted</b> thermistor was raised. The large fluctuations measured by the floating thermistor are believed to be caused by the vertical motion of the thermistor in a large vertical temperature gradient immediately above the sea surface. More detailed instrumentation is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Lieutenant Commander, United States NavyCommander, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|The LB 2 was {{designed}} as a shipboard fighter. It was a single bay sesquiplane, with outward leaning parallel pairs of interplane struts and wire cross bracing. The wings were strictly rectangular in plan, the lower plane smaller in both span and chord. The upper wing carried full span ailerons. Its flat sided fuselage was watertight and its belly deep; in emergency touchdowns at sea the undercarriage could be jettisoned with the aircraft stabilised with two small rectangular cross section, planing <b>floats</b> <b>mounted</b> on the lower wing underside below the interplane struts.|$|R

5000|$|A {{floatplane}} has slender pontoons, or <b>floats,</b> <b>mounted</b> {{under the}} fuselage. Two floats are common, but other configurations are possible. Only the floats of a floatplane normally {{come into contact}} with water. The fuselage remains above water. Some small land aircraft can be modified to become float planes, and in general, floatplanes are small aircraft. Floatplanes are limited by their inability to handle wave heights typically greater than 12 inches (0.31 m). These floats add to the empty weight of the airplane and to the drag coefficient, resulting in reduced payload capacity, slower rate of climb, and slower cruise speed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the SM.80 {{was flat}} sided, {{with a single}} stepped, double planked underside, copper riveted for corrosion resistance. It became slender aft.

On the water, lateral stability was provided by fixed, flat bottomed <b>floats</b> <b>mounted</b> on the wing at mid-span on pairs of parallel struts.
