5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform.</b> He appointed two <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, rising to 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill. Although Franken says he is in favor of the provision, he disagreed with it being used as a condition in preventing the 2013 federal government shutdown.|$|E

5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by Republican members on the committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on the positive aspects of PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> in Estonia {{started in}} 1991 with the {{introduction}} of a social health insurance system. While increasing the efficiency of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system was one of the targets of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms,</b> equity issues have received relatively less attention. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide an overview of social inequalities in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation in Estonia in 1999, after 8 years of large-scale reforms. Data were obtained from a nationally representative household interview survey including 3990 respondents aged 25 - 74 years. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation was measured by the telephone consultations, visits to the general practitioner, visits to the specialist, visits to the dentist, and hospitalisation. These utilisation measures were related to variables on ethnicity, place of residence, education, income and employment, by means of direct standardisation and logistic regression models. Three different regression models were applied in order to (a) describe social differences in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation, (b) to assess whether these differences can be explained by differences in health needs, and (c) to assess the independent effect of each social variable net of all other social variables. Substantial inequalities were observed for all types of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services and according to most social dimensions. Residents of rural areas were more likely to visit a general practitioner or to use telephone consultation, but less often used outpatient specialist care or dentist care. Ethnic differences were generally smaller, with no consistently higher use by either Russians or ethnic Estonians. Large differences were observed in relation to socio-economic status (education, income, or employment), with a more favourable socio-economic status being associated with higher probability to use <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services, especially after controlling for health needs. In case of hospitalisation, however, no notable social inequalities were found. These findings suggest that important geographic, financial and information barriers to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation exist after almost one decade of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> in Estonia. Further <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> should aim to lessen or even remove these barrier...|$|R

5|$|Romney {{stood to}} benefit from the Republican electorate's {{tendency}} to nominate candidates who had previously run for president, and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen. The early stages of the race found him as the apparent front-runner in a weak field, especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization. Perhaps his greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> law that he had shepherded five years earlier. As many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability decided not to run (including Mike Pence, John Thune, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Daniels), Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress.

Since <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> {{were introduced}} in 1999, this sector of the country's economy {{has been the subject}} of criticism, dissatisfaction, and social protest. One of the striking aspects of the transition to capitalist democracy after communism is the extent to which healthcare reforms have met with lack of success. An important strand in the literature on the health policy analysis underlines the inseparability of policy and political context. The question for the analysis then becomes to what extent and how have <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> (along with other contextual changes) been producing the particular social transformations that have been experienced in Poland, and how has the changing national and transnational social order in turn, produced specific health reforms and outcomes there...|$|R

5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform.</b> In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E

However, he achieved only a partial victory on his top priority– <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform.</b> While the legislature acceded to many of Jones' proposals, such as eliminating the practice of denying insurance coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, they did not approve his mandate for universal health care for all Kentuckians.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} amount of research into the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> across Europe and the impact that these reforms have had on the organisation and economic efficiency of <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> However, while there have been studies of specific medical ethical issues, as yet there seems to be little analysis of how the reforms are effecting the fundamental ethical relationships involved in the provision of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in more general terms (Taylor & Boor 1994; Ezzamel & Willmott 1991). This paper draws on two case studies: one in Sweden and one in Scotland, in order to investigate <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> from an ethical perspective. The paper describes how the problem of providing <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{has been a}}ddressed in both countries and whether and how recent <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> are affecting the ethical relationships involved in providing <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> We draw on the case studies to develop a relational model for analysing ethical/ accountability relationships and we use this model to identify and analyse the main ethical relationships involved in the provision of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the two countries we studied. The paper identifies three main relationships. Firstly, the general relationship between individual members of society: my relationship to any other member of the society I live within in regard to the provision of <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Secondly, the relationship between the doctor and the patient.
