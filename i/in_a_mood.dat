500|$|Smaller-scale {{works for}} {{accompanied}} voice include the five Canticles, composed between 1947 and 1974. They are written {{for a variety}} of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V). The first is a setting of Francis Quarles's 17th century poem [...] "A Divine Rapture", and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell's Divine Hymns. Matthews describes it as one of the composer's most serene works, which [...] "ends <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten's music". The second Canticle was written in 1952, between Billy Budd and Gloriana, on the theme of Abraham's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac. [...] from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell's wartime poem [...] "Still Falls the Rain", composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten's compositional technique. The fourth Canticle, premiered in 1971 is based on T. S. Eliot's poem [...] "Journey of the Magi". It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a [...] "companion piece" [...] to the earlier work. The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem [...] "Death of Saint Narcissus". Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about, the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text [...] "almost frighteningly apt... for a composer conscious of his own sickness". Matthews sees Narcissus as [...] "another figure from [...] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty".|$|E

On 13 November, in a portent of things to come, the Unionists won a Liberal seat in a by-election at Oldham.

40|$|This research’s {{objective}} is to investigate the relationships between mood, information processing and the decision quality of consumer’s choice regarding utilitarian products. This is performed by reviewing existing literature and a succeeding experiment. Literature states that mood and emotions are not identical. An emotion involves short duration, while <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> involves long duration; emotions are of high intensity, moods are low of intensity; the expression of an emotion is immediately visible, while <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> expresses progressively, and; rewards and threats of an emotion come out or go in our external environment, while <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> holds information about the internal state of affairs and it has resources available to meet environmental threats and challenges. Furthermore, literature defines two affect mechanisms. Affect Evaluation that infers that <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> gives information by personal feelings to create a perception of a concept, and; Affect Regulation that assumes that a person always tries to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desired <b>mood.</b> Affect Regulation overshadows Affect Evaluation, when <b>a</b> person is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>mood.</b> <b>A</b> person <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>mood</b> transfers positive feelings while <b>a</b> person <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>mood</b> tries to improve this mood into the desired mood.

40|$|In {{the first}} two studies, {{subjects}} were induced into a positive, negative or neutral mood using the Velten mood induction procedure, and then exposed to information about an attitude object they knew little about. According to Bower 2 ̆ 7 s mood-congruity hypothesis, subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>mood</b> should remember more of the positive information, whereas subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>mood</b> should remember more of the negative information. Because of this differential recall of material, subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>mood</b> should form <b>a</b> more favourable attitude than subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>mood.</b> The material that subjects remembered did not conform to these predictions. Still, mood influenced the attitudes subjects formed. In the first study, subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>mood</b> showed more positive attitude change than other subjects, while in the second study, subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>mood</b> reported <b>a</b> more negative attitude.

2500|$|Dasein is a German {{word and}} is {{sometimes}} translated as [...] "being-there" [...] or [...] "being-here" [...] (da combines in its meaning [...] "here" [...] and [...] "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction {{made by the}} English words; Sein is the infinitive, [...] "to be"). It is the German form of the existential expletive, which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after Nietzsche, used the word, but as a gerund synonym for [...] "human being" [...] or [...] "human entity." [...] A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, in a familiar world, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mood.</b> Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger {{does not want to}} get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as [...] "person," [...] "consciousness," [...] "soul," [...] or [...] "spirit," [...] so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of [...] "mineness," [...] or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand what things are and that they are e.g. [...] "My dog is brown" [...] or [...] "Today is Sunday." [...] Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities as entities, helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of [...] "Dasein." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{more general}} sense, because of the British {{championship}} of German [...] "theoretical equality" [...] at the World Disarmament Conference, London was in a weak moral position to oppose the German violations. The German response to British complaints about violations of Part V were that they were merely unilaterally exercising rights the British delegation at Geneva were prepared to concede to the Reich. In March 1934, a British Foreign Office memo stated [...] "Part V of the Treaty of Versailles...is, for practical purposes, dead, and it would become a putrefying corpse which, if left unburied, would soon poison the political atmosphere of Europe. Moreover, {{if there is to}} be a funeral, it is clearly better to arrange it while Hitler is still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> to pay the undertakers for their services". In December 1934, a secret Cabinet committee met to discuss the situation caused by German rearmament. The British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon stated at one of the committee's meeting that [...] "If the alternative to legalizing German rearmament was to prevent it, there would be everything to be said, for not legalizing it". But since London had already rejected the idea of a war to end German rearmament, the British government chose a diplomatic strategy that would exchange abolition of Part V in exchange for German return to both the League of Nations, and the World Disarmament Conference". At the same meeting, Simon stated [...] "Germany would prefer, it appears, to be ‘made an honest woman'; but if she is left too long to indulge in illegitimate practices and to find by experience that she does not suffer for it, this laudable ambition may wear off". In January 1935, Simon wrote to [...] George V that [...] "The practical choice is between a Germany which continues to rearm without any regulation or agreement and a Germany which, through getting a recognition of its rights and some modifications of the Peace Treaties enters into the comity of nations and contributes in this or other ways to European stability. As between these two courses, there can be no doubt which is the wiser". In February 1935, a summit in London between the French Premier Pierre Laval and the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald led to an Anglo-French communiqué issued in London that proposed talks with the Germans on arms limitation, an air pact, and security pacts for Eastern Europe and the nations along the Danube.|$|E
2500|$|Horace {{developed}} {{a number of}} inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself. His Epodes and Satires are forms of 'blame poetry' and both have a natural affinity with the moralising and diatribes of Cynicism. This often {{takes the form of}} allusions to the work and philosophy of Bion of Borysthenes [...] but it is as much a literary game as a philosophical alignment. By the time he composed his Epistles, he was a critic of Cynicism along with all impractical and [...] "high-falutin" [...] philosophy in general. The Satires also include a strong element of Epicureanism, with frequent allusions to the Epicurean poet Lucretius. So for example the Epicurean sentiment carpe diem is the inspiration behind Horace's repeated punning on his own name (Horatius ~ hora) in Satires 2.6. The Satires also feature some Stoic, Peripatetic and Platonic (Dialogues) elements. In short, the Satires present a medley of philosophical programs, dished up in no particular ordera style of argument typical of the genre. The Odes display a wide range of topics. Over time, he becomes more confident about his political voice. Although he is often thought of as an overly intellectual lover, he is ingenuous in representing passion. The [...] "Odes" [...] weave various philosophical strands together, with allusions and statements of doctrine present in {{about a third of the}} Odes Books 1-3, ranging from the flippant (1.22, 3.28) to the solemn (2.10, 3.2, 3.3). Epicureanism is the dominant influence, characterizing about twice as many of these odes as Stoicism. A group of odes combines these two influences in tense relationships, such as Odes 1.7, praising Stoic virility and devotion to public duty while also advocating private pleasures among friends. While generally favouring the Epicurean lifestyle, the lyric poet is as eclectic as the satiric poet, and in Odes 2.10 even proposes Aristotle's golden mean as a remedy for Rome's political troubles. Many of Horace's poems also contain much reflection on genre, the lyric tradition, and the function of poetry. Odes 4, thought to be composed at the emperor's request, takes the themes of the first three books of [...] "Odes" [...] to a new level. This book shows greater poetic confidence after the public performance of his [...] "Carmen saeculare" [...] or [...] "Century hymn" [...] at a public festival orchestrated by Augustus. In it, Horace addresses the emperor Augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises. It is the least philosophical collection of his verses, excepting the twelfth ode, addressed to the dead Virgil as if he were living. In that ode, the epic poet and the lyric poet are aligned with Stoicism and Epicureanism respectively, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> of bitter-sweet pathos. The first poem of the Epistles sets the philosophical tone for the rest of the collection: [...] "So now I put aside both verses and all those other games: What is true and what befits is my care, this my question, this my whole concern." [...] His poetic renunciation of poetry in favour of philosophy is intended to be ambiguous. Ambiguity is the hallmark of the Epistles. It is uncertain if those being addressed by the self-mocking poet-philosopher are being honoured or criticized. Though he emerges as an Epicurean, it is on the understanding that philosophical preferences, like political and social choices, are a matter of personal taste. Thus he depicts the ups and downs of the philosophical life more realistically than do most philosophers.|$|E
