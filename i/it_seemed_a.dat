5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> superficial wound.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, Chesney {{released}} the album Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair), supporting {{it with his}} Somewhere in the Sun Tour. Be as You Are is composed mostly of ballads. The album {{reached the top of}} the mainstream of popular music as well as country charts. Although it qualified for platinum status, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> lot less popular than his more traditional albums.|$|E

On raising his suspicion with the medic that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> sleight of hand to him, the medic {{told him he was}} a westerner and could only understand the surgery if he had a third eye. Palin assists another medic in a surgery and was told that no contamination happens in this procedure because of the use of garlic.|$|E

25|$|Facing {{an enemy}} drive that had {{penetrated}} within ten kilometers of his main base by the disastrous end of Operation Pigfat, {{as well as}} menacing his major air strip at Muang Soui, Hmong General Vang Pao and his CIA backers had fought back. An aerial campaign, Operation Raindance, had sapped enemy strength by its massive destruction of his pre-positioned supplies. However, after it and the following Operation Stranglehold ended, the Hmong guerrillas had swept through enemy ground back to their own territory. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> somewhat successful end to their dry season operations.|$|E
25|$|The WFM again {{tried to}} shut down the mines {{supplying}} ore to the struck mills in Colorado City. But this time, the leadership decided on a massive show of union force. Rather than strike just the mines supplying ore to the struck mills, as before, on 8 August, the WFM shut down the entire mining district, declaring strikes at about 50 mines, and idling 3,500 workers.p.205 Although the union had no issue with mine owners, the WFM hoped that a larger strike would put more pressure on mill owners to settle.p.76 The Cripple Creek district had been a union stronghold for the Western Federation of Miners since its success in the strike of 1894, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> safe base from which to expand union power into the ore processing mills.|$|E
25|$|The {{splitting}} {{of empire}} and {{the adoption of}} Christianity had many cultural consequences. Considerations of comfort aside, the toga was firmly associated with the old order and the old religion. The pallium was simple, practical, and easy to wear; {{it had always been}} considered the dress of philosophers. For those who professed allegiance to Christ and the new, Christian order, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> more fitting formal garment than the toga. While the beleaguered Western emperor Honorius tried to impose the toga on his subjects in defence of Roman values, the Theodosian Lex Vestiaria of 382 had already acknowledged the toga's obsolescence in the Eastern empire, which centred on Constantinople. Equites were now expected to wear the pallium, and senators the paenula, as their proper public dress. Byzantine art and portraiture show the highest functionaries of court, church and state in magnificently wrought, extravagantly exclusive court dress and priestly robes; the underlying construction of these pictured garments is difficult to fathom, but some at least are thought to be much-mutated versions of the Imperial toga. In the early European kingdoms that replaced Roman government in the West, kings and aristocrats alike dressed like the late Roman generals they sought to emulate, rather than the toga-clad senators of ancient tradition.|$|E

25|$|As {{the race}} was heading into the closing stages, Hamilton {{seemed to be on}} a charge to try to catch the leading Brawn but in reality it looked only a mistake would stop the Brazilian winning. As Button was lapping a second off the pace just making sure his car got to the end. Kubica was {{catching}} Button at a high rate of knots but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> long shot if Button was going to lose them two points. Barrichello took the chequered flag to win his first grand prix since the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in , and record the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One (including the victories of Emerson Fittipaldi, José Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Felipe Massa and Barrichello). Hamilton came second, while Finn Räikkönen came home in third. Kovalainen came fourth, while Nico Rosberg had a reasonably quiet race as he came home in fifth. Fernando Alonso came sixth in his home race, championship leader Jenson Button came seventh, while Robert Kubica came eighth, only his second points scoring finish so far this season. Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two points to his tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point this weekend.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} {{a painting by}} Polish surrealist artist Zdzisław Beksiński. The painting depicts a deformed, humanoid creature with many fingers, playing a trumpet. The band explained that it decided on this picture because [...] "Our music represents the more broken and monster-like feelings of our humanity, like the apparition in this picture. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> very fitting cover for our return {{after seven years of}} silence." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> {{place in}} which {{anything}} could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors {{from all parts of}} Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: [...] "What Manchester does today, {{the rest of the world}} does tomorrow."•• Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.|$|E

500|$|Produced a {{few years}} after the {{collapse}} of the Eastern Bloc, [...] "A Great Day for Freedom" [...] juxtaposes the general euphoria of, for instance, the fall of the Berlin Wall, with the subsequent wars and ethnic cleansing, particularly in Yugoslavia. Audio samples of Stephen Hawking, originally recorded for a BT television advertisement, were used in [...] "Keep Talking"; Gilmour was so moved by Hawking's sentiment in the advert that he contacted the advertising company for permission to use the recordings on the album. Mason said it felt [...] "politically incorrect to take ideas from advertising, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> very relevant piece." [...] At the end of the album Gilmour's stepson Charlie is heard hanging up the telephone receiver on Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke, who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Natalie Nichols of Los Angeles Times {{stated that the}} song {{is just one of}} many wailing ballads designed to demonstrate [...] "the soulful bleating of Beyonce, the centerpiece of R star trio Destiny's Child." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave a mixed review of the song, stating that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> bit dated and that it was [...] "a near-carbon copy of Survivor’s melodramatic 'Dangerously in Love' [...] is completely superfluous." [...] While covering the 2004 reunion of Destiny's Child, Jet Magazine considered the song a major hit of Beyoncé's debut album. In an article from Teen Ink, the song was noted as one of the top [...] "lush ballads" [...] of the album. [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] won in the category Best Female R Vocal Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> very flippant comment to make."

500|$|Michael Rosen, {{a novelist}} and poet, {{advocated}} {{the books were}} not suited for children, who {{would be unable to}} grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that [...] "J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer." [...] The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was negative – [...] "the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain", and he speaks of [...] "a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style". Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it {{to find out what the}} fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E
500|$|When Smallville first began, Lana was in {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with Whitney Fordman, the star quarterback of the football team. Kreuk believes that Lana truly {{was in love with}} Whitney when they first started dating, {{but by the time the}} audience first sees her in the pilot she is no longer in that same state of mind. Kreuk believes that by the time of the pilot Lana had grown “comfortable” with Whitney, and that was where their relationship ended. Though Lana had growing feelings for Clark, Kreuk feels that the producers rushed the coupling of Clark and Lana at the end of the second season. She believes that with everything that had happened throughout the season between the two characters, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> bit of a stretch for Lana to just quickly fall into Clark's arms. The next season began to develop more of the relationship between Lex and Lana. Kreuk believes that Lana cares for Lex as a friend, and that she recognizes the [...] "undertones" [...] that Lex may be placing on their relationship, but that Lana tends to ignore them. Kreuk recognizes that Lex is a big part of Lana's life, and that Lana tries to pay more attention to the good that Lex does and focus less on the darker aspects of his life.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
