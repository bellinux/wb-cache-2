50|$|The key to {{overexploitation}} in {{gulper sharks}} {{is that they}} require nearly {{as much time as}} humans to mature and reproduce. Their life strategy indicates that the frame of view for gulper <b>fishing</b> <b>plans</b> needs to be based on longer amounts of time, to allow for the consideration of the next generation of individuals. Gulper shark do not mature much faster than humans, so they need to be exploited based on a schedule that reflects this. However, being harvested by a species with similar growth patterns means that the gulper shark is unlikely to be considered in this way. It is highly susceptible to overexploitation leading to widespread population decline and its status and a species vulnerable to endangerment.|$|E

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} involves considering several biological, {{economic and}} political objectives. They are often contradictory. For this reason, {{it is almost impossible}} to reach them simultaneously. Andalusian regional government collaborates with the national government to establish <b>fishing</b> <b>plans</b> for local fisheries. The objectives of these plans verify the aforementioned statement. For instance, two contradictory objectives could be the employment preservation and the recovery of overexploited stocks. In this paper, various multi-objective programming (MOP) techniques have been applied to two fisheries: the striped venus (Chamellea gallina) fishery in the South-Atlantic Spanish region and the Strait of Gibraltar red bream (Pagellus bogaraveo) fishery of Spain. The obtained results show the usefulness of these methods for the design of fishery management policies and give evidence that each group with a vested interest in the fishery has its own hierarchy of objectives...|$|E
40|$|In-season {{methods that}} produce {{accurate}} and timely forecasts of returning salmon abundances allow fisheries managers to alter <b>fishing</b> <b>plans</b> {{in order to}} meet conservation and harvest objectives. In-season methods are challenged by variability in catch statistics due to factors external to abundance, specifically, fluctuations in the migration timing of target and co-migrating stocks. I apply genetic stock identification (GSI) data to develop catch indices for the five Fraser Chinook management units, and use these indices to forecast returns for each management unit according to four in-season model forms. I evaluate models using three performance measures to determine forecasting errors. Results show that forecasts for Spring 52 and Summer 52 Chinook can be produced with reasonable accuracy early in the fishing season. Forecasts of Spring 42, Summer 41, and Fall Chinook are less accurate. Results indicate that this technique shows promise for providing accurate and timely forecasts for the five Fraser Chinook management units, particularly as additional years of data are GSI-analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of investing in fresh-water ornamental <b>fish</b> <b>planned</b> by CV. Exotic Aquarium, Jakarta. The study includes the evaluation of the demand in exporting market and importing countries, technical and technological capability in fulfill the demand and the sources of capital in hiding the investment. SWOT analysis to ascertain the prospect of business and investment criteria : Payback Period, Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, Return on Equity and Return on Investment to evaluate the financial feasibility are applied in this study. In addition, the sensitivity of projected cash flows by the decreasing in selling price or increasing in operating cost and their impact in acceptance criteria are also discussed. The result showed that investing in fresh-water ornamental <b>fish</b> <b>planned</b> by CV. Exotic Aquarium is a promising project. This is proved by the fact that the export demand is still available in large number in each importing countries, technically and technologically CV. Exotic Aquarium is capable of fulfill the additional demand and financially, the proposed project will be a profitable one. In term of sensitivity, the projected cash flows will not severely influence by the decreasing in selling price or the increasing in operating cost, unless the selling price decrease more 50...|$|R
