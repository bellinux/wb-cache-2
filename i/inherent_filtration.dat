40|$|The {{availability}} of accurate and simple {{models for the}} estimation of x-ray spectra is of great importance for system simulation, optimization, or inclusion of photon energy information into data processing. There is a variety of publicly available tools for estimation of x-ray spectra in radiology and mammography. However, most of these models cannot be used directly for modeling microfocus x-ray sources {{due to differences in}} <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration,</b> energy range and/or anode material. For this reason the authors propose in this work a new model for the simulation of microfocus spectra based on existing models for mammography and radiology, modified to compensate for the effects of <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> and energy range. The research was supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under Grant Agreement No. 115337, which comprises financial contributions from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) and EFPIA companies’ in kind contribution.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of an x-ray beam from a conventional generator with an object containing {{more than one}} type of material is a very complicated process. The shape of the bremsstrahlung spectrum from the generator depends on the target material and orientation, {{as well as on}} the <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> and any additional filters through which the beam passes. Absorption of the beam in the part under study varies dramatically with energy and depends critically on the atomic number and density of the material. Thus, {{interaction of}} x-rays in an object can provide a great deal of information about the elemental composition of the part. However, this information is difficult to extract from data obtained using a bremsstrahlung spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{reconstruction}} algorithms {{for x-ray}} CT require an accurate spectral {{model of the}} system, including the spectrum of the photons emitted by the source and the spectral sensitivity of the detector. Although these components of the spectral model have been characterized in previous studies, there might be additional components that are unaccounted for, such as the <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> of the x-ray source and the detector. In this study, we present a technique for measuring the inaccuracies in the spectral model and accounting for them. This technique entails the acquisition of photon measurements with several materials placed between the source and the detector, and the solution of a linear system of equations. We test the accuracy of this technique in simulations, and demonstrate its potential to improve the results of spectral reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|A {{versatile}} EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) framework, initially {{designed to}} explicitly simulate X-ray tubes {{and record the}} output data into phase space data files, was modified towards dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) dosimetric applications by introducing equivalent sources. Half value layer (HVL) measurements were conducted to specify protocol-specific energy spectra. Air kerma measurements were carried out with an ionisation chamber positioned against the X-ray tube to obtain the total filtration attenuation characteristics. The framework is applicable to bowtie and non-bowtie <b>inherent</b> <b>filtrations,</b> and it accounts for the anode heel effect and the total filtration of the tube housing. The code was adjusted to the Promax 3 D Max (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) dental CBCT scanner. For each clinical protocol, calibration factors were produced to allow absolute MC dose calculations. The framework was validated by comparing MC calculated doses and measured doses in a cylindrical water phantom. Validation results demonstrate {{the reliability of the}} framework for dental CBCT dosimetry purposes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Two {{catalytic}} filters {{were prepared}} by deposition of a Cu-V-K-Cl catalyst {{on two different}} supports, namely, a ceramic foam and a sintered alumino-silicate filter. Their filtration performance was evaluated at a gas oil burner exhaust. The filtration performance was compared at different operating conditions. The ceramic foam was {{more effective than the}} sintered filter because of its <b>inherent</b> "deep bed" <b>filtration</b> mechanism. This mechanism led to an improved soot-catalyst contact, lower pressure drop through the filter, and a lower temperature attained during filter regeneration...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{new device}} for dry {{separation}} of fine particulate matter from bulk soil samples is presented here. It {{consists of a}} stainless steel tube along which a nitrogen flow is imposed, resulting in the displacement of particles. Taking into account particle transport, fluid mechanics, and soil sample composition, a tube 6 -m long, with a 0. 04 -m diameter, was found best adapted for PM 10 separation. The device rapidly produced several milligrams of particulate matter, on which chemical extractions with EDTA were subsequently performed to study the kinetic parameters of extractable metals. New Caledonian mining soils were chosen here, as a case-study. Although the easily extracted metal pool represents only 0. 5 – 6. 4 % of the total metal content for the elements studied (Ni, Co, Mn), the total concentrations are extremely high. This pool is therefore far from negligible, and can be troublesome in the environment. This dry technique for fine particle separation from bulk parent soil eliminates the metal-leaching risks <b>inherent</b> in wet <b>filtration</b> and should therefore ensure safe assessment of environmental quality in fine-textured, metal-contaminated soils...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the characteristics of a solid-state detector commonly available at hospitals for parallel use as a real-time personal radiation monitor following radiation emergency situations. A solid-state detector probe with an <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> (R 100, RTI Electronics AB, Mölndal, Sweden) was chosen for evaluation. The energy dependence and the linearity in signal response with kerma in air were examined, and the detector was exposed to both X-ray beams using a conventional X-ray unit with effective photon energies ranging between 28. 5 and 48. 9 keV and to gamma rays 1. 17 and 1. 33 MeV from (60) Co. The R 100 exhibited ∼ 1. 7 times over-response at the lowest X-ray energy relative to the (60) Co source. The detector demonstrated a linear response (R(2) = 1) when irradiated with (60) Co to air kerma values in the range of 20 - 200 mGy. The conclusion is that high-energy photons such as those from (60) Co can be detected by the R 100 with an energy response within a factor of < 2 over the energy range examined and that the detector can provide real-time dose measurements following nuclear or radiological events...|$|E
40|$|The method {{defined by}} the IEC 60522 for {{determining}} the <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> of an x-ray source device is applicable only for a limited range of tube voltage. Because the users cannot legally remove the x-ray movable diaphragm of the x-ray source device, total filtration, which {{is the sum of}} the additional filtration diaphragm movable for specific filtration and x-ray, cannot be measured. We develop a method for simply obtaining the total filtration for different tube voltage values. Total filtration can be estimated from a ratio R 2 ̆ 7 of the air kerma K_x+T^', which is measured with an Al plate with thickness T, and K_x^' measured without an Al plate. The conditions of the target material of the x-ray source device are then entered into the Report 78 Spectrum Processor to calculate the air kerma K x and K x+T for Al thicknesses x and (x[*][*]+[*][*]T), respectively, to obtain R. The minimum value of x, which is the difference between the R and R 2 ̆ 7, is the total filtration of the x-ray source device.

40|$|Analytical and {{numerical}} {{models for}} reconstructing clinical bremsstrahlung spectra with maximum photon energies {{in the range}} 4 to 30 MeV from indirect measurements such as transmission or depth-dose curves are investigated and compared. The iterative and Laplace transform models of Huang et al and Archer and Wagner are extended to the energy region of interest and a further two models based on thin and thick target bremsstrahlung theory developed. Calculated transmission curves {{for a set of}} 21 simulated and measured bremsstrahlung spectra covering a broad range of filtration conditions are used to assess each model's ability to represent photon spectra. A model based on the Schiff expression for forward-directed thin-target bremsstrahlung differential in photon energy with added <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> is shown to provide a promising method for reliably reconstructing megavoltage spectra in terms of 3 parameters. For this model, input data was reproduced to within 0. 1 percent, this being the same order of magnitude as the accuracy of its generation and within expected uncertainties for measured input data. Inclusion of a fourth parameter in the model is shown to allow the effective maximum photon energy present in the spectrum to be derived. The considerations involved in the practical use of reconstruction models to derive clinical photon spectra from measured transmission and depth-dose data and likely applications of these spectra are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the hierarchical clock networks and multiple phase-locked loops (PLLs) with advanced features in Stratix ® III devices. The {{large number of}} clocking resources, {{in combination with the}} clock synthesis precision provided by the PLLs, provide a complete clock management solution. The Altera ® Quartus ® II software compiler automatically turns off clock networks not used in the design, thereby reducing the overall power consumption of the device. Stratix III devices deliver abundant PLL resources with up to 12 PLLs per device and up to 10 outputs per PLL. You can independently program every output, creating a unique, customizable clock frequency. <b>Inherent</b> jitter <b>filtration</b> and fine granularity control over multiply, divide ratios, and dynamic phase shift reconfiguration provide the high performance precision required in today’s high-speed applications. Stratix III device PLLs are feature-rich, supporting advanced capabilities such as clock switchover, dynamic phase shifting, PLL reconfiguration, and reconfigurable bandwidth. Stratix III PLLs also support external feedback mode, spread-spectrum tracking, and post-scale counter cascading features. The Quartus II software enables the PLLs and their features without requiring any external devices. The following sections describe the Stratix III clock networks and PLLs in detail. Clock Networks in Stratix III Devices The global clock networks (GCLKs), regional clock networks (RCLKs), and periphery clock networks (PCLKs) available in Stratix III devices are organized into hierarchical clock structures that provide up to 220 unique clock domains (16 GCLKs + 88 RCLKs + 116 PCLKs) within the Stratix III device and allow up to 67 unique GCLK, RCLK, and PCLK clock sources (16 GCLKs + 22 RCLKs + 29 PCLKs) per device quadrant.

40|$|A plastic {{scintillation}} detector exhibiting minimum interference using two different optical fibre light guides have been designed, constructed and evaluated for dosimetry (potentially in-vivo) {{of the high}} energy beams used in radiotherapy practice. One detector system contains the radiation resistant SiO 2 optical fibre, while the other contains PMMA fibre, which has less resistance to radiation. Each fibre is connected to an independent photo diode. Also, each fibre is connected to a cylindrical water equivalent scintillator measuring 3 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length. The scintillator is coated with a thin, optically reflective coating. The light arising from the scintillator is transmitted by the fibre optic light guide and is detected at the photodiode. Each fibre has its own focusing and optical filtering techniques based on the fibre acceptance angle, so the photodiode for SiO 2 and PMMA are the same. The photodiodes are connected to an electronics box with a digital integrator and counting system. The interference radiation could be minimised using <b>inherent</b> optical <b>filtration</b> and digital integration consistent with pulses from the linear accelerator, thereby avoiding {{the use of a}} second optical fibre to compensate for background signals. The SiO 2 and PMMA fibre light guides have different properties especially with respect to flexibility. The dose distribution in water of each fibre light guide coupled scintillator is measured and shows good agreement with ionisation chamber results. Spatial resolution and water equivalence are the most important properties of miniature scintillator detectors. It is shown that these systems are not energy dependent, they do not disturb the main radiation beam, are independent of beam angle and have very good linearity with dose. The current study may stimulate the use of SiO 2 and PMMA fibre coupled plastic {{scintillation detector}}s in medical dosimetry applications. The results of the PMMA scintillation detector are good and it is a promising detector for in vivo measurements due to its flexibility and low cost...|$|R
40|$|The South African {{national}} {{calibration facility}} is currently not equipped for mammography, dose-measuring equipment. A therapy X-ray machine {{was used as}} a calibration unit at the national secondary standards dosimetry laboratory (SSDL) for medium and low energy X-ray, therapy calibrations. It is not necessarily intuitive that the latter calibrations are applicable to diagnostic X-ray beams generated by high frequency generators. The response of measuring equipment calibrated in a therapy X-ray beam, compared to its response in a diagnostic or clinical mammography unit, is unknown. The aim of the research was to investigate whether there was a measurable difference between the X-ray beam qualities available for low energy diagnostic radiology and radiation therapy, i. e. up to 100 kV. The beam qualities studied included both mammography and conventional diagnostic radiography, i. e. nominally 20 kV to 100 kV. The diagnostic and therapy X-ray tubes under investigation had different target-filter combinations, <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> and theoretically, different X-ray spectra. Practically, spectrometry of X-ray beams is not possible because of the sophistication of the instrumentation, comprehensive analyses being very time consuming and not practically applicable to the clinical environment (Kharatti and Zarrad, 2003). Furthermore, not all SSDL’s or Hospitals have access to spectral analysers. Clinical beam quality is instead specified in terms of both the tube peak voltage and the half-value layer (HVL), the thickness of material that will reduce the maximum output of the X-ray beam to 50...|$|E
40|$|Cone-beam breast Computed Tomography (bCT) is an X-ray imaging {{technique}} {{for breast cancer}} diagnosis, in principle capable of delivering a much more homogeneous dose spatial pattern to the breast volume than conventional mammography, at dose levels comparable to two-view mammography. We present {{an investigation of the}} three-dimensional dose distribution for a cone-beam CT system dedicated to breast imaging. We employed Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the dose deposited within a breast phantom having a hemiellipsoidal shape placed on a cylinder of 3. 5 cm thickness that simulates the chest wall. This phantom represents a pendulant breast in a bCT exam with the average diameter at chest wall, assumed to correspond to a 5 -cm-thick compressed breast in mammography. The phantom is irradiated in a circular orbit with an X-ray cone beam selected from four different techniques: 50, 60, 70, and 80 kVp from a tube with tungsten anode, 1. 8 mm Al <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> and additional filtration of 0. 2 mm Cu. Using the Monte Carlo code GEANT 4 we simulated a system similar to the experimental apparatus available in our lab. Simulations were performed at a constant free-in-air air kerma at the isocenter (1 microGy); the corresponding total number of photon histories per scan was 288 million at 80 kVp. We found that the more energetic beams provide a more uniform dose distribution than at low energy: the 50 kVp beam presents a frequency distribution of absorbed dose values with a coefficient of variation almost double than that for the 80 kVp beam. This is confirmed by the analysis of the relative dose profiles along the radial (i. e. parallel to the "chest wall") and longitudinal (i. e. from "chest wall" to "nipple") directions. Maximum radial deviations are on the order of 25...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Protective {{respiratory}} {{face masks}} protect {{the nose and}} mouth of the wearer from vapor drops carrying viruses or other infectious pathogens. However, incorrect use and disposal may actually {{increase the risk of}} pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. Copper oxide displays potent antiviral properties. A platform technology has been developed that permanently introduces copper oxide into polymeric materials, conferring them with potent biocidal properties. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that impregnation of copper oxide into respiratory protective face masks endows them with potent biocidal properties in addition to their <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration</b> properties. Both control and copper oxide impregnated masks filtered above 99. 85 % of aerosolized viruses when challenged with 5. 66 +/- 0. 51 and 6. 17 +/- 0. 37 log(10) TCID(50) of human influenza A virus (H 1 N 1) and avian influenza virus (H 9 N 2), respectively, under simulated breathing conditions (28. 3 L/min). Importantly, no infectious human influenza A viral titers were recovered from the copper oxide containing masks within 30 minutes (< or = 0. 88 log(10) TCID(50)), while 4. 67 +/- 1. 35 log(10) TCID(50) were recovered from the control masks. Similarly, the infectious avian influenza titers recovered from the copper oxide containing masks were < or = 0. 97 +/- 0. 01 log(10) TCID(50) and from the control masks 5. 03 +/- 0. 54 log(10) TCID(50). The copper oxide containing masks successfully passed Bacterial Filtration Efficacy, Differential Pressure, Latex Particle Challenge, and Resistance to Penetration by Synthetic Blood tests designed to test the filtration properties of face masks in accordance with the European EN 14683 : 2005 and NIOSH N 95 standards. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Impregnation of copper oxide into respiratory protective face masks endows them with potent anti-influenza biocidal properties without altering their physical barrier properties. The use of biocidal masks may significantly reduce the risk of hand or environmental contamination, and thereby subsequent infection, due to improper handling and disposal of the masks...|$|E
40|$|X-ray phase {{contrast}} imaging (PCI) has the potential, over certain energy ranges, to improve conventional x-ray diagnostic practice by utilizing the higher phase than absorption coefficient {{in the complex}} index of refraction for low atomic Z materials, thereby potentially enhancing the di®erences between healthy and cancerous tissue. Mammography is a particularly suitable application due to its high biopsy incidence. Of {{the different types of}} PCI, the in-line holographic method or propagation-based imaging (PBI) has the ability to utilize polychromatic x-ray sources. In clinical practice, polychromatic x-ray sources require filtering to remove the lower energy rays that have insufficient energy to penetrate the body and provide useful diagnostic information. However, the introduction of filters in PBI is known to cause {{phase contrast}} degradation, and this thesis examines both experimentally and theoretically, the various factors affecting phase contrast. Experimental factors using a Feinfocus micro-focus, tungsten x-ray source with 0. 5 mm beryllium <b>inherent</b> <b>filtration,</b> included: varying the tube voltage and source size, introducing extra filters of different materials and thicknesses including grain size and surface smoothness, and objects of different shapes and materials and at various positions in the beam. Image detection was via Fuji image plates and BAS- 5000 scanner. The most convenient filter material was aluminium, and the object showing the best phase contrast was a thin walled, cylindrical fibre (Cuprophan RC 55) normally used in dialysis. The x-ray spectrum of the tube was also measured using a SiLi detector system, with and without various filters. Theoretically, phase contrast was simulated via geometric ray optics, Fresnel and Fresnel-Kirchhoff wave diffraction methods. Inelastic scattering was also included in a simple model but was found to have only a very minor effect. Simulations showed good qualitative concurrence between the ray optics and Fresnel diffraction methods, with the Fresnel method providing greater detail in the line profile shape of the object, but essentially showing the same behaviour. Phase contrast reduction was found to be caused mainly by beam hardening, which narrows the phase peaks obtained from dispersion in the object, and together with source and detector considerations which then smooth the narrower filtered phase peaks more than the unfiltered case. There were some discrepancies with theoretical simulations producing absolute values approximately twice that of experimental ones, but the overall behaviour of phase contrast with the imaging parameters was consistent...|$|E
