5|$|Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo and the Making of the Animal Kingdom is a 2005 book by the {{molecular}} biologist Sean B. Carroll. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> {{summary of the}} emerging field of evolutionary developmental biology {{and the role of}} toolkit genes. It has won numerous awards for science communication.|$|E
5|$|Further east, off the Whitby Road, is the Monks' Pond, the canons' fish pond. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> {{dramatic}} vista {{in which}} the priory arch is reflected and has often been photographed and painted. In 1908, the pond {{was the scene of}} an elaborate water tableau organised by Lady Gisborough to raise funds for the restoration of St Nicholas' Church. The pond was home to a number of exceptionally large fish, but pollution in 2000 caused by a sewage leak led to the death of more than 5,000 fish.|$|E
5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian {{collectivism}} has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E

5|$|In 1950 Barenreiter {{published}} Hellmuth Christian Wolff's edition, {{prepared for}} the 1943 Halle revival and reflecting the casting of basses for Otto and Narcissus, even when they sing what would otherwise be the alto part in the last chorus. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> German adaptation of the recitatives and written out embellishments for the da capo arias as well as numerous cuts. The B flat fugue G 37 appears as an act II overture along with other instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|The Art of War is {{traditionally}} ascribed to Sun Tzu. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> philosophy of war for managing conflicts and winning battles.

5|$|Most of the {{refectory}} (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; <b>it</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its raised floor.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known sketch (№ 236) {{is made in}} graphite and {{is located}} in the Carl Larsson museum in Sundborn. It was dated by Karl Axel Arvidsson to a time shortly after the visit to Copenhagen in 1910. In July, Larsson started to paint a large version, which was finished in January 1911, but it is only preserved in a photograph. It is based on the early sketch but <b>it</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> richer set of figures in the foreground. The early version was put on display in Nationalmuseum without receiving any official comments. There was no formal order and no official contest had been declared, and the initiative was only Larsson's.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{crossover}} between {{many different}} Nintendo franchises, including Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Mother, F-Zero, Yoshi, Kirby, and Pokémon. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skill sets and even {{take advantage of the}} stage's offensive events to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately attempt to knock opponent characters off the stage. It received mostly positive reviews from the media and was commercially successful, selling over 5million copies worldwide by 2001, with 2.93million sold in the United States and 1.97million copies sold in Japan. As a result of this success, the game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console.|$|E

25|$|Rhaetian was {{spoken in}} central parts of present-day Switzerland, Tyrol in Austria, and the Alpine regions of northeastern Italy. It is {{documented}} by {{a limited number}} of short inscriptions (found through Northern Italy and Western Austria) in two variants of the Etruscan alphabet. Its linguistic categorization is not clearly established, and <b>it</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> confusing mixture of what appear to be Etruscan, Indo-European, and uncertain other elements. Howard Hayes Scullard argues that Rhaetian was also a Celtic language.|$|E

25|$|The {{disconnecting}} {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) {{was introduced in}} 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. <b>It</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate disconnectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} maritime {{community has}} phased out {{the use of}} organtin-based coatings. This phase-out of toxic biocides in marine coatings posed a severe problem for the shipping industry; <b>it</b> <b>presents</b> <b>a</b> major challenge for the producers of coatings to develop alternative technologies. Safer methods of biofouling control are actively researched. Copper compounds have successfully been used in paints, heat sinks inside of medical electronics, {{and continue to be}} used as metal sheeting (for example Muntz metal which was specifically made for this purpose), though there is still debate as to the safety of copper.|$|E
