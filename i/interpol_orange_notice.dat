5000|$|According to {{the album}} notes, shortly after {{beginning}} Timesteps Carlos also began reading A Clockwork <b>Orange,</b> and <b>noticed</b> that the opening themes reflected {{the feeling of}} the first chapters of the book. Thereafter the piece developed, in Carlos' own words, into [...] "an autonomous composition with an uncanny affinity for 'clockwork'", the last word being Carlos' way of referring to the book. When the film version was announced Carlos and producer Rachel Elkind made a demonstration recording for Kubrick, who became interested and invited them to meet him in London.|$|R

25|$|In {{a review}} of The Orange Box, IGN stated that {{although}} Half-Life 2 has already been released through other mediums, the game itself is still enjoyable on a console. They {{also noted that the}} physics of Half-Life 2 are very impressive despite being a console title. However, it was noted that the graphics on the Xbox 360 version of Half-Life 2 were not as impressive as when the title was released on the PC. GameSpot's review of The <b>Orange</b> Box <b>noticed</b> that the content of both the Xbox 360 releases, and PlayStation 3 releases were exactly alike, the only issue with the PlayStation 3 version was that it had noticeable frame-rate hiccups. GameSpot continued to say that the frame rates issues were only minor but some consider them to be a significant irritation.|$|R
