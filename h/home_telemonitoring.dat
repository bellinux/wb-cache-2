40|$|To reduce {{healthcare}} costs and to better serve {{an aging population}} suffering from chronic disease, advancements in telemedicine like <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> {{are being used to}} improve the effectiveness of outpatient and homecare services. The {{purpose of this study was}} to expand upon the telemonitoring qualitative literature to describe home care nurses’ lived experiences with a <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> program. Separate interviews with four homecare nurses currently employed by a visiting nurse service and working directly with <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> were conducted. The interviews were analyzed using a phenomenological framework to identify common themes. For these nurses the benefits of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> were the same as the ways through which <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> works. These included early detection of signs and symptoms of disease exacerbation especially for congestive heart failure patients, improved coordination of care, improved disease self-management, and early detection of educational and self-care deficits from frequent contact with the telehealth nurse. Barriers to the effectiveness of telemonitoring included patient anxiety, patient physical or cognitive deficits, and technical limitations of the system. These findings increase the understanding of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> from the perspective of nurses involved with its implementation and have implications for future research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Older {{adults with}} {{multiple}} chronic illnesses {{are at risk}} for worsening functional and medical status and hospitalization. <b>Home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> may help slow this decline. This protocol of a randomized controlled trial was designed to help determine the impact of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> on hospitalization. The specific aim of the study reads as follows: to determine the effectiveness of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> compared with usual care in reducing the combined outcomes of hospitalization and emergency department visits in an at-risk population 60 years of age or older. Methods/Design Two-hundred patients with the highest 10 % Mayo Clinic Elder Risk Assessment scores will be {{randomly assigned to one of}} two interventions. <b>Home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> involves the use of a computer device, the Intel Health Guide, which records biometric and symptom data from patients in their homes. This information is monitored by midlevel providers associated with a primary care medical practice. Under the usual care scenario, patients make appointments with their providers as problems arise and use ongoing support such as a 24 -hour nurse line. Patients will have initial evaluations of gait and quality of life using instruments such as the SF- 12 Health Survey, the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and the PHQ- 9 health questionnaire. Patients will be followed for 1 year for primary outcomes of hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Secondary analysis will include quality of life, compliance with the device, and attitudes about telemonitoring. Sample size is based on an 80 % power to detect a 36 % difference between the two groups. The primary analysis will involve Cox proportional time-to-event analysis. Secondary analysis will use t-test comparisons for continuous variables and the chi square test for proportional analysis. Discussion Patients randomized to <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> will have daily assessments of their health status using the device. Registered nurse monitoring will assess any change in status followed by videoconferencing by a mid-level provider. We obtained trial registration and Institutional Review Board approval.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES:There {{have been}} very few {{assessments}} of the economics of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring,</b> {{and the quality of}} evidence has often been weakened by methodological flaws. This has made it difficult to compare telehomecare with traditional home care for the chronic diseases studied. This economic analysis is an attempt to address this gap in the literature. METHODS:We have analyzed the consumption of healthcare services by 95 patients with various chronic diseases over a 21 -month period, that is, 12 months before, 4 months during <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> use, and over 5 months after withdraw of the technology. RESULTS:Our findings indicate significant benefits to the <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> program as evidenced by large reductions in number of hospitalizations, length of average hospital stay, and, to a lesser extent, number of emergency room visits. Contrary to expectations, however, the number of home visits by nurses increased both during and after the telemonitoring intervention. In terms of the financial analysis, the telehomecare program resulted in significant savings: the equivalent of over CAD 1, 557 per patient as calculated on an annualized basis. This represents a net gain of 41 percent as compared to traditional home care. CONCLUSIONS:While the present economic analysis led to positive results, additional assessments should be conducted to confirm the cost-effectiveness of this mode of care delivery...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring a patient’s hemodynamic status may be {{a revolutionary}} way to aid a ‘health maintenance’ {{strategy}} in which the physician strives to therapeutically keep the patient in an ideal hemodynamic range. Currently, <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> employs a ‘crisis-prevention’ approach. This strategy is still based on easily acquired measures such as heart rate, weight and blood pressure – measurements that are useful to help implement guideline-directed therapy but provide little information about impending decompensation or the risk of hospitalisation. Current systems provide limited information to personalize and adapt medication therapy for heart failure. Several innovative technologies that can remotely monitor estimates of cardiovascular hemodynamics, such as cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, augmentation index and added heart sounds may enable earlier detection of heart failure decompensation.

The self-testing was performed {{at home on}} a daily basis. The results were transmitted to the hospital information system immediately after completion of each test. Physician could review results using an Internet Web browser from any location. A constantly active decision support server monitored all data traffic and dispatched alerts when certain clinical conditions were met. Seventeen patients, out of 19 invited, {{agreed to participate in}} the study and have been monitored for three weeks. They have been surveyed then using standardized questionnaire. Most of the patients (82. 4 %) characterized self-testing procedures as "not complicated at all.

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} ranked {{as one of}} the leading causes of hospitalizations and {{mortality}} among adults of all racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Telemonitoring, as a homecare intervention for heart failure management, has been used across all groups although the benefit for Hispanics not established. The purpose of this retrospective, quantitative {{study was to determine the}} differences in hospital readmission between Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White patients with heart failure disease who either received or did not receive <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> services from a homecare agency in Connecticut. The research questions for this study examined the effect of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring,</b> race, age, gender, and insurance on heart failure hospitalization across the 3 groups. The chronic care model was used as the theoretical framework for this study because it offers a method for reforming healthcare to ensure optimization in chronic disease management. A purposive sample of 138 records of patients admitted between January 1, 2012 and June 30, 2017 with a diagnosis of heart failure provided the data for the study. Data were analyzed by conducting a simple and multiple logistic regression analysis. The key findings of the simple logistic analysis showed that only Hispanics who used telemonitoring were almost 4 times less likely to be readmitted to the hospital compared to Hispanics who did not use telemonitoring (p = 0. 04). The multiple logistic analysis revealed race, age, gender, and insurance were not significant predictors of readmissions (p 3 ̆e 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract—Lowering blood {{pressure}} reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is poorly controlled in diabetic patients. In {{a pilot study}} we demonstrated that a <b>home</b> {{blood pressure}} <b>telemonitoring</b> system, which provided self-care messages on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control. Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the system’s effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of 244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45 %) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n 55) or control (n 55) group, and 105 (95. 5 %) completed the 1 -year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9. 115. 6 mmHg (SD; P 0. 0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7. 12. 3 mmHg (SE; P 0. 005). Furthermore, 51 % of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of 130 / 80 mmHg compared with 31 % of control subjects (P 0. 05). These improvements were obtained {{without the use of}} more or different antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to physicians.

40|$|Introduction: Pulmonary {{rehabilitation}} (PR) is {{an integral}} part of the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, many patients do not access or complete PR, and long-term exercise maintenance has been difficult to achieve after PR. This study aimed to investigate feasibility, long-term exercise maintenance, clinical effects, quality of life and use of hospital resources of a telerehabilitation intervention. Methods: Ten patients with COPD were offered a two-year follow-up via telerehabilitation after attending PR. The interven- tion consisted of <b>home</b> exercise, <b>telemonitoring</b> and self-management via a webpage combined with weekly videoconferencing sessions. Equipment included a treadmill, a pulse oximeter and a tablet. Data collected at baseline, one year and two years were six-minute walking distance (6 MWD), COPD assessment test (CAT), EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ- 5 D), hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Results: No dropout occurred. Physical performance, lung capacity, health status and quality of life were all maintained at two years. At one year, 6 MWD improved by a mean of 40 metres from baseline, CAT decreased by four points and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) improved by 15. 6 points.

40|$|Background: Evidence that <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> for {{patients}} with chronic heart failure (CHF) offers clinical benefit over usual care is controversial as is evidence of a health economic advantage. Methods: Between January 2010 and June 2013, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF were enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 study groups comprising usual care with and without an interactive bi-directional remote monitoring system (Motiva^®). The primary endpoint in CardioBBEAT is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) established by the groups' difference in total cost and in the combined clinical endpoint "days alive and not in hospital nor inpatient care per potential days in study" within the follow-up of 12 months. Results: A total of 621 predominantly male patients were enrolled, whereof 302 patients {{were assigned to the}} intervention group and 319 to the control group. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure. Despite randomization, subjects of the control group were more often in NYHA functional class III-IV, and exhibited peripheral edema and renal dysfunction more often. Additionally, the control and intervention groups differed in heart rhythm disorders. No differences existed regarding risk factor profile, comorbidities, echocardiographic parameters, especially left ventricular and diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, as well as functional test results, medication and quality of life. While the observed baseline differences may well be a play of chance, they are of clinical relevance. Therefore, the statistical analysis plan was extended to include adjusted analyses with respect to the baseline imbalances. Conclusions: CardioBBEAT provides prospective outcome data on both, clinical and health economic impact of <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> in CHF. The study differs by the use of a high evidence level randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with actual cost data obtained from health insurance companies. Its results are conducive to informed political and economic decision-making with regard to <b>home</b> <b>telemonitoring</b> solutions as an option for health care.

ACMHT group participants transmitted blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight to a nurse practitioner using the Viterion 100 TeleHealth Monitor; the nurse practitioner adjusted medications for glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control based on established American Diabetes Association targets. Measures were obtained at baseline, 3 -month, and 6 -month visits. RESULTS — Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, with mean A 1 C of 9. 4 % (CC group) and 9. 6 % (ACMHT group). Compared with the CC group, the ACMHT grou...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a method to leverage existing <b>home</b> healthcare <b>telemonitoring</b> technology to deliver depression care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information on depression symptoms, antidepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research interviews on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English- and Spanish-only- speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression, the mean depression severity was in the 2 ̆ 2 markedly severe 2 ̆ 2 range at baseline and in the 2 ̆ 2 mild 2 ̆ 2 range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare 2 ̆ 7 s existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English- and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clinical outcomes suggest improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and service of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{medication}} adherence {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of illness and of treatment failure in the United States. The objective of this study was to conduct an initial evaluation of a context-aware reminder system, which generated reminders at an opportune time to take the medication. Ten participants aged 65 or older, living alone and managing their own medications, participated in the study. Participants took a low-dose vitamin C tablet twice daily at times that they specified. Participants were considered adherent if they took the vitamin within 90 minutes (before or after) of the prescribed time. Adherence and activity in the home was measured using a system of sensors, including an instrumented pillbox. There were three phases of the study: baseline, in which there was no prompting; time-based, in which there was prompting at the prescribed times for pill-taking; and context-aware, in which participants were only prompted if they forgot to take their pills and were likely able to take their pills. The context-based prompting resulted in significantly better adherence (92. 3 %) as compared to time-based (73. 5 %) or no prompting (68. 1 %) conditions (p < 0. 0002, χ 2 = 17. 0). In addition, subjects had better adherence in the morning than in the evening. We have shown in this study that a system that generates reminders at an opportune time to take the medication significantly improves adherence. This study indicates that context-aware prompting may provide improved adherence over standard time-based reminders.

40|$|Abstract Background Inadequate blood {{pressure}} control and poor adherence to treatment remain {{among the major}} limitations {{in the management of}} hypertensive patients, particularly of those at high risk of cardiovascular events. Preliminary evidence suggests that <b>home</b> {{blood pressure}} <b>telemonitoring</b> (HBPT) might help increasing the chance of achieving blood pressure targets and improve patient’s therapeutic adherence. However, all these potential advantages of HBPT have not yet been fully investigated. Methods/design The purpose of this open label, parallel group, randomized, controlled study is to assess whether, in patients with high cardiovascular risk (treated or untreated essential arterial hypertension - both in the office and in ambulatory conditions over 24 h - and metabolic syndrome), long-term (48 weeks) blood pressure control is more effective when based on HBPT and on the feedback to patients by their doctor between visits, or when based exclusively on blood pressure determination during quarterly office visits (conventional management (CM)). A total of 252 patients will be enrolled and randomized to usual care (n = 84) or HBPT (n = 168). The primary study endpoint will be the rate of subjects achieving normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure targets (Discussion The TELEBPMET Study will show whether HBPT is effective in improving blood pressure control and related medical and economic outcomes in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. It will also provide a comprehensive understanding of the psychological determinants of medication adherence and blood pressure control of these patients.
