Of the aqueous curvatures of this crest, {{we shall}} have more to say presently; {{meantime}} let us especially observe how the providential laws of beauty, acting with reversed data, arrive at similar results in the aiguilles and crests. In the aiguilles, which are of such hard rock that the fall of snow and trickling of streams do not affect them, the inner structure is so disposed as {{to bring out the}} curvatures by the mere fracture. In the crests and lower hills, which are of softer rock, and largely influenced by external violence, the inner structure is straight, and the necessary curvatures are produced by perspective, by <b>external</b> <b>modulation,</b> and by the balancing of adverse influences of cleavage. But, as the accuracy of an artist's eye is usually shown by his perceiving the inner anatomy which regulates growth and form, and as in the aiguilles, while we watch them, we are continually discovering new curves, so in the crests, while we watch them, we are continually discovering new straightnesses; and nothing more distinguishes good mountain-drawing, or mountain-seeing, from careless and inefficient mountain-drawing, than the observance of the marvellous parallelisms which exist among the beds of the crests.|$|E

This {{enables us to}} study the impact of qubit-bath coupling ranging from weak to strong regimes. Without <b>external</b> <b>modulations,</b> we observe maximal values of both steady state heat flux and noise power at moderate coupling regimes, below which we find those two transport quantities are enhanced by the finite qubit energy bias. With <b>external</b> <b>modulations,</b> the geometric-phase-induced heat flux shows monotonic decrease as increasing the qubit-bath coupling at zero qubit energy bias (without bias). While under finite qubit energy bias (with bias), the geometric-phase-induced heat flux exhibits an interesting reversal behavior in strong coupling regime. Our results unify the seemingly contradictory results in weak and strong qubit-bath coupling regimes, and provide detailed dissections for the quantum fluctuation of nonequilibrium heat transfer.

We focus on a passive system that operates without <b>external</b> <b>modulations</b> to enhance its performance. We demonstrate that the fidelity of the gate is limited by opposing requirements on the input pulse width for one- and two-photon scattering events. For one-photon scattering, the spectral pulse width must be narrow compared to the emitter linewidth, while two-photon scattering processes require the pulse width and emitter linewidth to be comparable. We find that these opposing requirements limit the maximum fidelity of the two-photon controlled-phase gate for Gaussian photon pulses to 84 %. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is a device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light. The beam may be carried over free space, or propagated through an optical waveguide (optical fibre). Depending on the parameter of a light beam which is manipulated, modulators may be categorized into amplitude modulators, phase modulators, polarization modulators etc. Often the easiest way to obtain modulation of intensity of a light beam, is to modulate the current driving the light source, e.g. a laser diode. This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the <b>external</b> <b>modulation</b> performed by a light modulator.

50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is an optical device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the <b>external</b> <b>modulation</b> performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, magneto-optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{introductory}} {{overview of the}} use of spin chains as quantum wires, which has recently developed into a topic of lively interest. The principal motivation is in connecting quantum registers without resorting to optics. A spin chain is a permanently coupled 1 D system of spins. When one places a quantum state on one end of it, the state will be dynamically transmitted to the other end with some efficiency if the spins are coupled by an exchange interaction. No <b>external</b> <b>modulations</b> or measurements on the body of the chain, except perhaps at the very ends, is required for this purpose. For the simplest (uniformly coupled) chain and the simplest encoding (single qubit encoding), however, dispersion reduces the quality of transfer.

We conclude with a brief discussion of the various directions in which the topic is developing. Comment: Material covered till Dec 200...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the transport properties of a graphene layer {{in the presence}} of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Quite generally, spin-orbit interactions induce spin splittings and modifications of the graphene band structure. We calculate within the scattering approach the linear electric and thermoelectric responses of a clean sample when the Rashba coupling is localized around a finite region. We find that the thermoelectric conductance, unlike its electric counterpart, is quite sensitive to <b>external</b> <b>modulations</b> of the Fermi energy. Therefore, our results suggest that thermocurrent measurements may serve as a useful tool to detect nonhomogeneous spin-orbit interactions present in a graphene-based device. Furthermore, we find that the junction thermopower is largely dominated by an intrinsic term independently of the spin-orbit potential scattering. We discuss the possibility of canceling the intrinsic thermopower by resolving the Seebeck coefficient in the subband space.

Here, we investigate the Fermi surface evolution of Cd 3 As 2 under high pressure through magnetotransport. A sudden change in Berry phase occurs at 1. 3 GPa along with the unanticipated shrinkage of the Fermi surface, which occurs well below the structure transition point (~ 2. 5 GPa). High pressure X-ray diffraction also reveals an anisotropic compression of the Cd 3 As 2 lattice around a similar pressure. Corroborated by the first-principles calculations we show that an axial compression will shift the Dirac nodes towards the Brillouin zone center and eventually introduces a finite energy gap. The ability to tune the node position, a vital parameter of Dirac semimetals, can have dramatic impacts on the corresponding topological properties such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly.

Here, we report a systematic study of quasi-particle dynamics and band evolution in Cd 3 As 2 thin films with controlled Chromium (Cr) doping by both magneto-infrared spectroscopy and electrical transport. For the first time, we observe square-root-B relation of inter-Landau-level resonance in undoped Cd 3 As 2 Dirac semimetal, an important signature of ultra-relativistic Dirac state inaccessible in previous optical experiments. A crossover from quantum to quasi-classical behavior makes it possible to directly probe the mass of Dirac fermions. Importantly, Cr doping allows for a Dirac mass acquisition and topological phase transition enabling a desired dynamic control of Dirac fermions. Corroborating with the density-functional theory calculations, we show that the mass generation is essentially driven by explicit C 4 rotation symmetry breaking and the resultant Dirac gap engineering through Cr substitution for Cd atoms.
