5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E

40|$|We use unique {{information}} on migration behaviour and reasons for migration {{to study the}} impact of tied migration on labour market outcomes among <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives.

Estimates from dynamic random-effects models indicate that <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives in couples that migrated for job-related reasons suffer lower job retention rates than non-migrants. Tied migration reduces the probability of subsequent employment for both <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives and in particular has a large negative impact on job retention rates among wives.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between acculturation and multiple dimensions of marital conflict among Mexican American <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives. Participants were 151 <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives who were recruited from a health maintenance organization in northern California and individually interviewed. More acculturated <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives engaged in less avoidance of conflict and were more expressive of their feelings in an argument. Husbands who were more acculturated reported more conflict concerning sex and consideration for the other. Bicultural <b>and</b> more acculturated <b>husbands</b> re-ported that their wives were more verbally and physically aggressive, compared with mono-Mexican husbands. The findings provide evidence that more acculturated hus-bands and wives are involved in more direct expressions of conflict in their marriages, compared with less acculturated <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives. • Mexican American • marital conflict • acculturation • bicultural Despite the growing literature on Mexican American families and an increase in re-search on family relationships, relatively fe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives—The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of theoretically important dimensions of stability and change in economic hardship during early middle years on decade-long health problems of <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives. Method—The study used prospective data collected from 360 middle-aged <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives during a 12 -year period. The variables included self-reported economic hardship (22 items), mental and physical health, and physical impairment. Results—The results supported the hypothesis that the dynamics of family economic hardship (in terms of stability and change) during the early middle years contribute to subsequent onset of health problems of middle-aged <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives. These health problems, in turn, progress as an interrelated process through intra-health-domain continuities, cross-health-domain proliferations and dyadic associations as they pass through midlife. Discussion—A better understanding these processes may aid in the formation and effective implementation of mental and physical health promotion programs for middle-aged <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives...|$|R
