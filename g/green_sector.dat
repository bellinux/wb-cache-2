40|$|International Labour Organization (ILO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{suggest that}} <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> should offer decent jobs {{respecting}} to unions and international labor rights and fulfill requirements of labor laws and collective bargaining system. Also, non-unionized working in <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> poses a significant challenge {{in terms of}} creation decent jobs. In this line, this article presents several evidences from British Labour Force Survey to find some socio-economic obstacles behind unionization in <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> by using logistic regression modeling method. The results suggest that union membership decision in <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> is affected by a range of demographic and work-related factors used in the study. For example, those who are 16 - 24 age band, women workers, those who are employed by small sized enterprises and takes charge in high-ranked occupations are higher likelihood of non-unionized working in <b>green</b> <b>sectors,</b> compared to rest of the sectors...|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{investigated}} {{a new type}} of rice leaf variegation mutant, zebra 3 (z 3), which has transverse dark-green/green stripes in the leaves with no yellow or white <b>sectors.</b> The dark <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> of the z 3 mutant leaves had significantly higher levels of photosynthetic pigments and proteins compared with wild-type leaves, and the <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> had levels similar to the wild type. Positional cloning revealed that the Z 3 gene encodes a protein predicted to be a CitMHS family citrate transporter, which have only been reported in bacteria thus far. Indeed, we found that the dark-green sectors accumulated more citrates than the <b>green</b> <b>sectors,</b> consistent with a putative role for Z 3 in citrate transport. We discuss the possible function of Z 3 as a candidate citrate transporter in eukaryotes.|$|R
40|$|The yellow {{variegated}} 2 (var 2) mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana {{has been}} studied as a typical leaf-variegated mutant whose defect results {{from the lack of}} FtsH 2 metalloprotease in chloroplasts. The var 2 <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> suffer from photo-oxidative stress and accumulate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) because of compromised Photosystem II repair. This study investigated and compared microarray-based expression profiles of <b>green</b> and white <b>sectors</b> of var 2 leaves. Results suggest that ROS that accumulate in chloroplasts of var 2 <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> do not cause much significant change in the transcriptional profile related to ROS signalling and scavenging. By contrast, transcriptome in the white sectors apparently differs from those in the <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> and wild type. Numerous genes related to photosynthesis and chloroplast functions were repressed in the white sectors. Furthermore, many genes related to oxidative stress were up-regulated. Among them, ROS scavenging genes were specifically examined, such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 2 (CSD 2), that were apparently up-regulated in white but not in the <b>green</b> <b>sectors.</b> Up-regulation of CSD 2 appears to be partly attributable to the lack of a microRNA (miR 398) in the white sectors. It was concluded that the white sectors exhibit a response to oxidative and other stresses, including CSD 2 up-regulation, which might be commonly found in tissues with abnormal chloroplast differentiation...|$|R

2500|$|Organizers of Operation Overlord {{decided that}} Ranger Company C would {{constitute}} Ranger “Task Force B.” [...] Unlike Ranger Task Force A (which scaled Pointe du Hoc, {{as depicted in}} [...] "The Longest Day") and Ranger Task Force C (which landed in Dog <b>Green</b> <b>sector</b> of Omaha Beach [...] as depicted {{at the outset of}} [...] "Saving Private Ryan"), the story of Task Force B on D-Day is lesser-known. [...] In the first minutes of the invasion’s amphibious landing, Task Force B disembarked in “Charlie” sector of Omaha Beach. [...] That sector was located at Omaha Beach’s far western end, where the beach abruptly terminates in a rocky promontory of 100-foot cliffs called Pointe de la Percee. [...] The Task Force’s mission included taking out the four German pillboxes {{at the top of the}} cliffs, as part of coordinated actions with Rangers’ efforts to take the Vierville draw (to the east) and Pointe du Hoc (to the west).|$|E
40|$|Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) immutans (im) has <b>green</b> {{and white}} <b>sectoring</b> {{due to the}} action of a nuclear {{recessive}} gene, IMMUTANS. The <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> contain normal-appearing chloroplasts, whereas the white sectors contain abnormal chloroplasts that lack colored carotenoids due to a defect in phytoene desaturase activity. Previous biochemical and molecular characterizations of the <b>green</b> leaf <b>sectors</b> revealed alterations suggestive of a source-sink relationship between the <b>green</b> and white <b>sectors</b> of im. In this study, we use an Affymetrix ATH 1 oligoarray to further explore the nature of sink metabolism in im white tissues. We show that lack of colored carotenoids in the im white tissues elicits a differential response from {{a large number of}} genes involved in various cellular processes and stress responses. Gene expression patterns correlate with the repression of photosynthesis and photosynthesis-related processes in im white tissues, with an induction of Suc catabolism and transport, and with mitochondrial electron transport and fermentation. These results suggest that energy is derived via aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of imported sugar in im white tissues for growth and development. We also show that oxidative stress responses are largely induced in im white tissues; however, im <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> develop additional energy-dissipating mechanisms that perhaps allow for the formation of <b>green</b> <b>sectors.</b> Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomes of im white and norflurazon-treated white leaf tissues reveals global as well as tissue-specific responses to photooxidation. We conclude that the differences in the mechanism of phytoene desaturase inhibition {{play an important role in}} differentiating these two white tissues...|$|R

30|$|Map-based cloning {{revealed}} that the Z 3 locus encodes a putative citrate transporter that belongs to the citrate-metal hydrogen symport (CitMHS) family. CitMHS family members have been extensively studied in bacteria and function as secondary transporters that can transport metal-citrate complexes, but whether CitMHS family transporters exist in eukaryotes remains unknown. To investigate whether Z 3 acts as a citrate transporter in rice, we measured citrate levels in wild-type leaves and in the dark-green and <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> of the leaves of z 3 mutants. The results showed that citrates accumulated to high levels in the dark-green sectors of z 3 mutant leaves, {{but not in the}} <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> as compared with the wild-type leaves.|$|R
2500|$|USS PC-552 was a Class 461 Patrol Craft ("PC") {{which was}} at the {{forefront}} of the naval efforts during the Normandy invasion. It served as convoy protection in the North Atlantic and, as one of about ten PC control vessels off [...] Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion. PC-552 was among the first ships to reach waters off Omaha Beach. PC-552, primary control vessel for Fox <b>Green</b> <b>sector</b> of the beach, was forced into rescue efforts and recovery of bodies at the departure line for Fox Green when the Duplex Drive tanks that survived the initial disastrous launch were swamped at the line with only two surviving. The PC was diverted into this effort for forty-five minutes and ultimately only five tanks, the two that survived the launch disaster and three that were aboard LCT-600 whose commander raised his ramp when the first off foundered and instead landed them on the beach, reached the beach.|$|E
2500|$|Only half of {{the members}} of Task Force B reached the {{relative}} safety {{at the foot of the}} cliff. [...] The Task Force’s preferred route to the high ground – through the Vierville draw in Dog <b>Green</b> <b>sector</b> – had quickly become a killing zone, forcing Task Force B to find a route directly up the face of the cliff. Without the London fire ladders that helped Task Force A to take Pointe du Hoc, and with most of their other climbing equipment at the bottom of the Channel, Task Force B’s surviving Rangers used bayonets thrust into the cliffs as footholds, and eventually reached the crest of Pointe de la Percee. [...] There, control of the trenches surrounding the pillboxes switched back and forth between German and American forces for hours, further depleting the Company’s ammunition and manpower. [...] By the end of the battle, Task Force B secured Charlie sector, but at great cost in lives. [...] For his heroism on D-Day, Second Lieutenant Heaney was awarded the Silver Star.|$|E

40|$|Co-ordination between {{plastids}} and mitochondria is so {{essential that}} there should be extensive inter-organellar crosstalk during development of plant cells. Indeed, chloroplast dysfunction in white leaves of plastid ribosome-deficient mutant barley, albostrians, is reportedly accompanied by increases in the levels of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial transcripts, suggesting that (i) developmental/physiological status of plastids (or heterotrophic growth condition of albino leaves) can affect the status of mitochondrial genome, and (ii) the function of the affected mitochondria may also be up-regulated accordingly. However, functional aspects of the mitochondria affected by chloroplast dysfunction have not yet been examined in detail. Here, we examined the effects of chloroplast dysfunction on mitochondrial DNA level and dark respiration rate, by comparing white and <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> within individual variegated leaves, using 12 ornamental plants as experimental materials. The pattern of leaf variegation differed from species to species, suggesting that different mechanisms were involved in the formation of white sectors in different species. Quantitative hybridization analysis revealed that mitochondrial DNA levels were generally higher in white <b>sectors</b> than in <b>green</b> <b>sectors.</b> In spite of the elevated mitochondrial DNA levels, however, dark respiration rates in white sectors were generally lower than those in <b>green</b> <b>sectors.</b> Several possible mechanisms for elevation of mitochondrial DNA level and suppression of dark respiration rates in white sectors are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{defective}} chloroplasts and leaves-mutable (dcl-m) mutation {{of tomato}} was identified in a Ds mutagenesis screen. This unstable mutation affects both chloroplast development and palisade cell morphogenesis in leaves. Mutant plants are clonally variegated {{as a result}} of somatic excision of Ds and have albino leaves with <b>green</b> <b>sectors.</b> Leaf midribs and stems are light <b>green</b> with <b>sectors</b> of dark <b>green</b> tissue but fruit and petals are wild-type in appearance. Within dark <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> of dcl-m leaves, palisade cells are normal, whereas in albino areas of dcl-m leaves, palisade cells do not expand to become their characteristic columnar shape. The development of chloroplasts from proplastids in albino areas is apparently blocked at an early stage. DCL was cloned using Ds as a tag and encodes a novel protein of - 25 kDa, containing a chloroplast transit peptide and an acidic a-helical region. DCL protein was imported into chloroplasts in vitro and processed to a mature form. Because of the ubiquitous expression of DCL and the proplastid-like appearance of dclaffected plastids, the DCL protein may regulate a basic and universal function of the plastid. The novel dcl-m phenotype suggests that chloroplast development is required for correct palisade cell morphogenesis during leaf development...|$|R

30|$|Leaf {{variegation}} mutants can {{be classified}} into two types depending on the genotypes of the <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> and yellow (or white) sectors. First, in some mutants, the green and the yellow (or white) sectors in the leaves have different genotypes. That is, the <b>green</b> <b>sectors</b> contain the wild-type alleles, while the yellow (or white) sectors contain only mutant alleles. In many cases, this type of leaf variegation results from transposable element activity. For example, dcl (defective chloroplasts and leaves) in tomato (Keddie et al. 1996), dag (differentiation and greening) in Antirrhinum (Chatterjee et al. 1996), and pyl-v (pale-yellow-leaf variegated) in rice (Tsugane et al. 2006) are well-studied mutable alleles of genes for chloroplast biogenesis. In {{the second type of}} leaf variegation, all cells in the mutant leaves have the same genotype. That is, both green and yellow (or white) sectors contain the same mutant alleles, but the phenotype is differentially expressed between subsets of the cells, leading to the generation of <b>green</b> and yellow/white <b>sectors.</b> Because the leaves of the z 3 mutant have a uniform mutant genotype (data not shown), the leaf variegation of the z 3 mutant belongs to the second type. However, the leaf variegation mechanism of this type remains poorly understood.|$|R
