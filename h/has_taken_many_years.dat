40|$|This paper {{describes}} ANSWER, {{the expert}} system responsible for monitoring AT&T's 4 ESS switches. These switches are extremely important, since they handle virtually all of AT&T's long distance traffic. ANSWER is implemented in R++, a rule-based extension to the C++ object-oriented programming language, and is innovative because it employs both rule-based and object-oriented programming paradigms. The use of object technology in ANSWER has provided a principled way of modeling the 4 ESS and of reasoning about failures within the 4 ESS. This has resulted in an expert system that is more clearly organized, easily understood and maintainable than its predecessor, which was implemented using the rule-based paradigm alone. ANSWER has been deployed {{for more than a}} year and handles all 140 of AT&T's 4 ESS switches and processes over 100, 000 4 ESS alarms per week.

There are mainly two techniques to plan and deploy wireless networks. One uses theoretical electromagnetic models to predict RF coverage. The theoretical model requires information for the survey area, such as the presence of trees, the location of buildings, the materials that comprise the buildings, and so on. Inputting the information into the prediction software and computing the coverage takes a lot of time. In addition, the varying environment increases the difficulty to accurately predict and maintain the coverage with the theoretical model. For example, tree foliage changes from winter to summer. The real signal in the environment is also unknown with prediction software. Another technology is to plan and deploy wireless networks based on real measurement data. A dedicated site survey is required to build stable wireless networks in a varying RF environment.

40|$|AbstractN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ligand-gated ion {{channels}} (‘ionotropic’ receptors) {{activated by}} the major excitatory neurotransmitter, l-glutamate. While the term ‘the NMDAR’ is often used it obscures {{the fact that this}} class of receptor contains within it members whose properties are as different as they are similar. This heterogeneity was evident from early electrophysiological, pharmacological and biochemical assessments of the functional properties of NMDARs and while the molecular basis of this heterogeneity <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> to elucidate, it indicated from the outset that the diversity of NMDAR phenotypes could allow this receptor family to subserve a variety of functions in the mammalian central nervous system. In this review we highlight some recent studies that have identified structural elements within GluN 2 subunits that contribute to the heterogeneous biophysical properties of NMDARs, consider why some recently described novel pharmacological tools may permit better identification of native NMDAR subtypes, examine the evidence that NMDAR subtypes differentially contribute to the induction of long-term potentiation and long-term depression and discuss how through the use of chimeric proteins additional insights have been obtained that account for NMDAR subtype-dependency of physiological and pathophysiological signalling.

While it <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> to elucidate the genetic variability and true multiplicity of the cytochrome P 450 “mixed function oxidase system ” many publications early on looked at the enzyme system as a single entity. Numerous articles indicated that barbiturates, anticonvulsants, and others could induce “P 450 ” and add to the toxicity of acetaminophen. It rapidly became apparent that just because “P 450 ” was induced when measured as a whole, not all other substrates would have changed metabolic activity. The role of diet and ethanol induction and inhibition on CYP 2 E 1, the enzyme of greatest interest for acetaminophen is multifaceted. The lack of enhancement of acetaminophen toxicity by phenytoin and in fact, the potential for reduction of toxicity with that agent {{is a good example of}} the evolution of our knowledge. Further complicating our understanding is the introduction of misleading terms such as “therapeutic misadventure ” and other expressions of molecular intent. A critical understanding of the literature makes it clear that therapeutic doses of acetaminophen either alone or in the presence of inducers do not produce toxicity.

Many users prefer to use VHDL for RTL design as the language continues to provide desired characteristics in design safety, flexibility and maintainability. While VHDL has provided significant value for digital designers since 1987, it has had only one significant language revision in 1993. It <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> for design state-of-practice to catch-up to and, in some cases, surpass the capabilities that have been available in VHDL for over 15 years. Last year, the VHDL Analysis and Standardization Group (VASG), which is responsible for the VHDL standard, received clear indication from the VHDL community that it was now time to look at enhancing VHDL. In response to the user community, VASG initiated the VHDL- 200 x project 2. VHDL- 200 x will result in at least two revisions of the VHDL standard. The first revision is planned to be completed next year (2004) and will include a C language interface (VHPI); a collection of high user value enhancements to improve designer productivity and modeling capability and potential inclusion of assertion-based verification and testbench modeling enhancements. A second revision is planned to follow about two years later. This paper summarizes VHDL- 200 X enhancements proposed for the first revision of VHDL.
