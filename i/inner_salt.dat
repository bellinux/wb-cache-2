These new dithiolate ligands were fully characterized and their coordination chemistry toward common Re(i) and Ru(ii) metal sources was thoroughly investigated. Neutral [ReBr(CO) 3 (S 2 C[middle dot]NHC) ] chelates featured three facially-arranged carbonyl groups on a distorted octahedron, whereas cationic [RuCl(p-cymene) (S 2 C[middle dot]NHC) ]PF 6 complexes displayed a piano-stool geometry. The molecular structures of the six new compounds revealed that the NHC[middle dot]CS 2 <b>inner</b> <b>salts</b> were highly flexible. Indeed, the torsion angle between their anionic and cationic moieties varied between ca. 63 [degree] in the free ligands and 3 [degree] in the ruthenium complexes. Concomitantly, the S-C-S bite angle underwent a contraction from 131 [degree] to 110 - 113 [degree] upon chelation. Computation of the %VBur parameter showed that the dithiocarboxylate unit of the NHC[middle dot]CS 2 betaines chiefly determined the steric requirements of the imidazolium moieties, irrespective of the metal center involved in the complexation. The replacement of the p-methyl substituents of IDip*Me with p-methoxy groups in IDip*OMe did not significantly affect the ligand bulkiness.

A remarkable shielding of the methine proton on the p-cymene isopropyl group was observed by (1) H NMR spectroscopy for complexes 3 - 6.

In all these reactions, the [RuCl(2) (p-cymene) (SOC.

40|$|Expression of {{salt and}} urea {{transporters}} in rat kidney during cisplatin-induced polyuria. BackgroundCisplatin (CP) induced polyuria in rats {{is associated with a}} reduction in medullary hypertonicity, normally generated by the thick ascending limb (TAL) salt transporters, and the collecting duct urea transporters (UT). To investigate the molecular basis of this abnormality, we determined the protein abundance of major salt and UT isoforms in rat kidney during CP-induced polyuria. MethodsMale Sprague-Dawley rats received either a single injection of CP (5 mg/kg, N = 6) or saline (N = 6) intraperitoneally five days before sacrifice. Urine, blood, and kidneys were collected and analyzed. ResultsCP-treated rats developed polyuric acute renal failure as assessed by increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine volume and decreased urine osmolality. Western analysis of kidney homogenates revealed a marked reduction in band density of the bumetanide-sensitive Na-K- 2 Cl cotransporter in cortex (60 % of control values, P < 0. 05), but not in outer medulla (OM) (106 % of control values). There were no differences in band densities for the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), the type III Na-H exchanger (NHE 3), the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase in the OM; or for UT-A 1, UT-A 2 or UT-A 4 in outer or inner medulla. However, the band pattern of UT-A 2 and UT-A 4 proteins in the OM of CP-treated rats was different from the control rats, suggesting a qualitative modification of these proteins.

Plant communities co-dominated by C. coronopifolia and S. marina were generally found in the sub-halophilous <b>inner</b> part of <b>salt</b> marshes.

30|$|The BMSCs (Cyagen Biosciences, USA) {{of passage}} four, 1.0 [*]×[*] 104 per well, were plated into 24 -well cell culture plates coated with {{different}} ECMs. The MTS CellTiter 96 ® AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, USA) {{was used to}} assay for living cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, the plates were read on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 490 nm. The absorbance at 490 nm (Abs 490 nm or OD 490 nm) {{was used as a}} measure of living cell population size; the quantity of MTS (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl)- 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl)- 2 - (4 -sulfophenyl)- 2 H-tetrazolium, <b>inner</b> <b>salt)</b> formazan product expressed as OD 490 nm is directly proportional to the number of live cells.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aim: To {{investigate}} the anticancer effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) {{in combination with}} sorafenib in wild-type and mutant von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) -expressing renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Materials and Methods: We exposed clear cell RCC cells to HDACIs (vorinostat or belinostat) or sorafenib. We performed 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium, <b>inner</b> <b>salt</b> (MTS) assays, western blotting, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to evaluate mechanisms of cell death, and used CalcuSyn to analyze the potential synergism. Results: HDACIs alone inhibited the growth of clear cell RCC cell lines, increased acetylation of histone 3 and of tubulin, activated caspases- 8,- 9, and- 3, and augmented the sub-G 1 population, independently of VHL and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) ...|$|E
40|$|The saline {{oscillator}} {{consists of}} an <b>inner</b> vessel containing <b>salt</b> water partially immersed in an outer vessel of fresh water, with a small orifice {{in the center of}} the bottom of the inner vessel. There is a cyclic alternation between salt water flowing downwards out of the inner vessel into the outer vessel through the orifice and fresh water flowing upwards into the inner vessel from the outer vessel through that same orifice. We develop a very stable _i. e., stationary_ version of this saline oscillator. We first investigate the response of the oscillator to periodic forcing with a train of stimuli _period=Tp_ of large amplitude. Each stimulus is the quick injection of a fixed volume of fresh water into the outer vessel followed immediately by withdrawal of that very same volume. For Tp sufficiently close to the intrinsic period of the oscillator _T 0 _, there is 1 : 1 synchronization or phase locking between the stimulus train and the oscillator. As Tp is decreased below T 0, one finds the succession of phase-locking rhythms: 1 : 1, 2 : 2, 2 : 1, 2 : 2, and 1 : 1. As Tp is increased beyond T 0, one encounters successively 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 4, 2 : 3, 2 : 4, and 1 : 2 phase-locking rhythms. We next investigate the phase-resetting response, in which injection of a single stimulus transiently changes the period of the oscillation. By systematically changing the phase of the cycle at which the stimulus is delivered _the old phase_, we construct the new-phase—old-phase curve _the phase transition curve_, from which we then develop a one-dimensional finite-difference equation _“map”_ that predicts the response to periodic stimulation. These predicted phaselocking rhythms are close to the experimental findings. In addition, iteration of the map predicts the existence of bistability between two different 1 : 1 rhythms, which was then searched for and found experimentally. Bistability between 1 : 1 and 2 : 2 rhythms is also encountered. Finally, with one exception, numerical modeling with a phenomenologically derived Rayleigh oscillator reproduces all of the experimental behavior...|$|R
40|$|Little {{progress}} has been made in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis over the past decades. L-carnitine has a major role in glycolysis-based energy supply of blood trypanosomes for it stimulates constant ATP production. To investigate whether administration of the isomer D-carnitine could exert a competitive inhibition on the metabolic pathway of the L-form, possibily resulting in parasite replication inhibition, several formulations of this compound were tested on Trypanosoma lewisi and T. brucei rhodesiense in rodent models. High oral dosages of D-carnitine <b>inner</b> <b>salt</b> and proprionyl-D-carnitine were not toxic to animals and induced about 50 % parasite growth inhibition in reversible, i. e. competitive, fashion. A putative mechanism could be an interference in pyruvate kinase activity and hence ATP production. Considering both, lack of toxicity and inhibitory activity, D-carnitine may have a role in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis, in association with available trypanocidal drugs...|$|E

XTT {{was added to the}} cell suspension at a concentration of 125  μM from a 7.5  mM stock solution in PBS. Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker for 12  h. Aliquots were then removed and spun in a microfuge, and the absorption of the supernatant was measured at 450  nm. The reduction of XTT in the absence of cells was determined as the control and subtracted from the values obtained in the presence of cells.|$|E
