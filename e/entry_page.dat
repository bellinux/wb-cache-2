5000|$|Greymatter creates static pages. Therefore, when {{an entry}} is edited, only the main <b>page</b> and the <b>entry's</b> <b>page</b> are rebuilt (but not the monthly or weekly archive file). While static pages are arguably quicker to load for the user, it is {{time-consuming}} {{for the author}} and resource intensive for the user to constantly rebuild files. Also, by using static pages, {{at least twice as}} much space is used on the server as is needed (the entry files, [...]cgi format, as well as individual <b>entry</b> <b>pages</b> in HTML and weekly or monthly archive logs in HTML). Besides this, sometimes rebuilding is impossible and leads to Greymatter timing out and showing a blank window (usually when there are massive numbers of entries being rebuilt, or when attempting to rebuild all files).|$|R

50|$|While site-wide bounce rate can be {{a useful}} metric for sites with {{well-defined}} conversion steps requiring multiple page views, it may be of questionable value for sites where visitors {{are likely to find}} what they are looking for on the <b>entry</b> <b>page.</b> This type of behavior is common on web portals and referential content sites. For example, a visitor looking for the definition of a particular word may enter an online dictionary site on that word's definition page. Similarly, a visitor who wants to read about a specific news story may enter a news site on an article written for that story. These example entry pages could have a bounce rate above 80% (thereby increasing the site-wide average), however they may still be considered successful.|$|E
