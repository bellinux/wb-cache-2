500|$|When {{the review}} of the role Coastal Command was to play in war was {{assessed}} in 1937, the then AOC Sir Frederick Bowhill was informed by his Senior Air Staff Officer Air Commodore Geoffrey Bromet that the other two commands (Bomber and Fighter) had clear mission objectives while Coastal Command had been given no clear mandate. It was assumed that Coastal Command was to keep sea communications open for merchant shipping and prevent seaborne raids on British coastlines and ports. No mention of U-boats was made by either man. Both apparently assumed aircraft and surface raiders presented the greater threat in British waters, thus following the then Admiralty line that U-boats were no longer a threat. When Admiral Sir Dudley Pound enquired about aerial assets in trade and commerce defence, Chief of the Air Staff Cyril Newall, 1st Baron Newall, replied that there was not enough [...] "jam" [...] to <b>go</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> stated it was more advisable to risk losses on trade routes than weaken the RAF's ability to protect Britain from air attack and bomb its enemies.|$|E
500|$|Flight tests {{proceeded}} fairly smoothly until 4May1978, when HB1001 {{was making}} its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched {{up just as}} it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact {{in the vicinity of}} the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: [...] "Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard... He [...] raised the gear on the <b>go</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected." ...|$|E

In 2003, Forbes ranked Pikachu as the [...] "eighth top-earning fictional character of the year" [...] with an income of $825 million.

In a 2008 Oricon poll, Pikachu was voted as the fourth most popular video game character in Japan, tying with Solid Snake. The character has been regarded as the Japanese answer to Mickey Mouse and as {{being part of a}} movement of [...] "cute capitalism". Pikachu was listed 8th in IGN's [...] "Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time". Nintendo Power listed Pikachu as their ninth favourite hero, stating that while {{it was one of the}} first Pokémon, it is still popular to this day. Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Pikachu the best Electric type Pokémon and the best Pokémon overall. They added that if a person were to <b>go</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> ask Pokémon players who their favourite Pokémon was, they would [...] "almost always" [...] choose Pikachu. They also called Pikachu [...] "brave and loyal". On a less positive note, Pikachu was ranked first in AskMen's top 10 of the most irritating 1990s cartoon characters. Similarly, in a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the 48th best Pokémon, with the staff commenting [...] "despite being the most recognized Pokémon in the world...

He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service." [...] "Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. For that I will always be indebted to him. Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days, and he was on oxygen much of the time. He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. Dad could name all the trees there, and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and see them all, it's such a big place. So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could <b>go</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> enjoy Neverland.

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I <b>go</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
2500|$|The look of {{the film}} was {{achieved}} through the work of cinematographer John F. Seitz. At the time, Seitz was the premiere director of photography on the Paramount lot; his work extended {{all the way back}} to the silent era. Wilder had worked with Seitz on his previous film, Five Graves to Cairo, in which Seitz was nominated for an Academy Award and Wilder praised Seitz's willingness to experiment and fail. Here Wilder taps into his 1920s Berlin roots, and he and Seitz give the film a look subtly reminiscent of German expressionism, with dramatic deployment of light and shadows. [...] "He was ready for anything," [...] Wilder said. [...] "Sometimes the rushes were so dark that you couldn't see anything. He went to the limits of what could be done." [...] They would contrast the bright sunny Southern California exteriors, shot on location, with dark, gloomy, rotten interiors shot on soundstages to give the audience a sense of what lurks just beneath the facade – and just who is capable of murder. The contrast was heightened, in Wilder's words, by [...] "dirtying up" [...] the sets. Once the set was ready for filming, Wilder would <b>go</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> overturn a few ashtrays to give the house an appropriately grubby look. [...] Wilder and Seitz also blew aluminum particles into the air so that, as they floated down, they looked just like dust.|$|E

2500|$|At , {{the engines}} {{were still at}} idle power. Power {{settings}} for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as [...] "N1" [...] and [...] "N2". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured {{as a percentage of}} maximum N1 or N2 rpm. Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions. The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2. This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to [...] "spool up" [...] in order to produce more thrust. At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to [...] "spool up" [...] to full power. On PLF 101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32%-33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51%-52% N1 for the given conditions. As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA). However, they did not <b>go</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.|$|E
