5|$|Mitzeee pleads {{guilty to}} {{stabbing}} Mercedes, as she doesn't {{remember what happened}} since Mercedes had knocked her unconscious. As a result, Riley and Mitzeee's relationship {{comes to an end}} and Riley and Mercedes get back together. Mitzeee is sentenced to seven years in prison for her actions, however when she notices Mercedes smiling at her as she is being sentenced, she realises her own innocence. Myra discovers that Mercedes had framed Mitzeee although doesn't tell anyone. Mitzeee goes insane in prison knowing that she is innocent and is transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mitzeee escapes from the psychiatric hospital where she confronts Mercedes and threatens her with a knife although leaves before Mercedes can call the police. Carl returns and attempts to persuade Riley not to marry Mercedes. Mercedes hears a conversation between Riley and Carl in which Riley admits that he does not love Mercedes and that he recently had sex with Mitzeee. Angered, Mercedes kidnaps Bobby in an attempt to punish Riley and lies to the police that Mitzeee has kidnapped him. Mercedes pays Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{to be part of the}} scam and look after Bobby in a secret flat. Mercedes sends a letter to Riley asking for Â£500,000 ransom money in exchange for Bobby. When dropping off the ransom money, Riley sees Mercedes and realises that she is behind the kidnap. Phoebe exposes Mercedes and tells Riley the truth. Mercedes takes Bobby to the rooftop of a building, threatening to throw herself and Bobby off. Mercedes eventually gives Bobby to Riley and she agrees to leave with the ransom money. They return to the McQueen household where Mercedes' involvement in the kidnap is revealed by Phoebe. Myra then exposes Mercedes for having stabbed herself and framed Mitzeee, and calls the police. Moments later, Riley is shot dead by Simon Walker (Neil Newbon). In prison, Mercedes shows further signs of mental illness, denying to herself that Riley has died. Mercedes is later taken to a psychiatric <b>hospital.</b> <b>Doctor</b> Browning pleads innocent in his trial. When Myra visits Mercedes, Mercedes appears distressed and asks Myra to help her. Myra contacts lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). At the trial, Jim suggests Riley was abusive towards Mercedes and stabbed her and forced her to frame Mitzeee. He also suggests that Lynsey knew of this so Riley killed her. Mercedes backs up the claims and tells the courtroom that Riley had threatened to kill her so she kidnapped Bobby to protect him from Riley. The jury give a not guilty verdict for both charges of perverting the course of justice and Mercedes is released. Myra tells Mercedes she can not come home as she needs to learn her lesson and instead tells her to move into Jacqui's old flat that has recently been flooded.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare and {{contrast}} the views of general practitioners (GPs), <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> and medical students to alternative medicine. A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 100 GPs and 100 <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> in the South West Thames Regional Health Authority (SWTRHA). A convenience sample of 237 pre-clinical medical students at St George's Hospital Medical School was also given a questionnaire. Eighty-seven GPs and 81 <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> replied. Five therapies were investigated: acupuncture; chiropractice; homeopathy; naturopathy; and osteopathy. All respondents were asked about their attitude towards and knowledge of these therapies. Doctors were asked how often they referred patients for such treatment and whether they practised it themselves. GPs and <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> had similar levels of knowledge of the therapies. Medical students were the least informed but the most enthusiastic respondents. Seventy per cent of <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> and 93 % of GPs had, on at least one occasion, suggested a referral for alternative treatment. GPs were making these referrals more frequently and earlier. Twelve per cent of <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> and 20 % of GPs were practising alternative medicine. The majority of the respondents felt that alternative medicine should be available on the National Health Service (NHS) and that medical students should receive some tuition about alternative therapies. A considerable proportion of those doctors referring patients to alternative practitioners were ignorant of their official qualifications...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} ability of a cohort of junior <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> to {{interpret}} ECGs which have immediate clinical relevance and influence subsequent management of patients. METHODS: 57 junior <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> were interviewed and asked to complete a standard questionnaire which included eight ECGs for interpretation and a supplementary question relating to the administration of thrombolytic treatment. Each doctor was assessed over a 48 h period while they performed their daily clinical duties. RESULTS: The major abnormality of anterior myocardial infarction was recognised by almost all doctors. There was difficulty in the interpretation of posterior myocardial infarction and second degree heart block. Most myocardial infarctions would have been given satisfactory thrombolysis, but there was a reluctance to use this treatment in patients with posterior myocardial infarction and left bundle brach block. A few patients without myocardial infarction would have received thrombolytic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is varying ability among junior <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors</b> in the interpretation of the emergency electrocardiogram. The results are of concern as poor interpretation of the ECG can result in inappropriate management. As a result of {{the findings of this study}} it is proposed to introduce more formal training in the interpretation of clinically relevant ECG abnormalities for junior <b>hospital</b> <b>doctors...</b>|$|R
