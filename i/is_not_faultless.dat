John Clute writes that the novel [...] "intensified the movement of [...] imagination to a local habitat, {{and for the first}} time introduced a protagonist of sufficient racial (and mental) complexity to carry a storyline immured in the particular and haunted by the exotic." [...] In this sophisticated twist on the traditional time-travel story, a modern-day African-American man is recruited by the military for his special ability to [...] "dream" [...] himself into the Pleistocene era where he becomes involved with a tribe of habilines. [...] Thomas Disch writes [...] "Bishop is determined to write about human goodness without resorting to the mock heroics of formula adventure stories. There are no villains in the book, even among the habilines. The central and absorbing drama of the book is the hero's growing love for the habiline, Helen. Looming behind this love story is a larger theme, the formation across the entire span of history of the Family of Man, a phrase that becomes, as the novel ripens to its conclusion, no mere liberal piety but a fully realized dramatic affirmation." [...] In one of the few mixed reviews, Tom Easton writes that [...] "Kampa [...] is the only character who does come alive. [...] All others are at least stiff. Some are outright caricatures.

They were married at the Savoy, and my grandfather dying very soon, Harry Barry, Esquire, took possession of his paternal property and supported our illustrious name with credit in London.

60|$|With {{this all}} else {{falls to the}} ground. It would be as unwise in us, {{as it was in}} Rousseau himself, to complicate the hypotheses. Men do not act without motives, and Hume could have no motive in {{entering}} into any plot against Rousseau, even if the rival philosophers in France might have motives. We know the character of our David Hume perfectly well, and though it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>faultless,</b> its fault certainly lay rather in an excessive desire to make the world comfortable for everybody, than in anything like purposeless malignity, of which he never had a trace. Moreover, all that befell Rousseau through Hume's agency was exceedingly to his advantage. Hume <b>was</b> <b>not</b> without vanity, and his letters show that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> displeased at the addition to his consequence which came of his patronage {{of a man who was}} much talked about and much stared at. But, however this was, he did all for Rousseau that generosity and thoughtfulness could do. He was at great pains in establishing him; he used his interest to procure for him the grant of a pension from the king; when Rousseau provisionally refused the pension rather than owe anything to Hume, the latter, still ignorant of the suspicion that was blackening in Rousseau's mind, supposed that the refusal came from the fact of the pension being kept private, and at once took measures with the minister to procure the removal of the condition of privacy. Besides undeniable acts like these, the state of Hume's mind towards his curious ward is abundantly shown in his letters to all his most intimate friends, just as Rousseau's gratitude to him is to be read in all his early letters both to Hume and other persons. In the presence of such facts on the one side, and in the absence of any particle of intelligible evidence to neutralise them on the other, to treat Rousseau's charges with gravity is irrational.|$|R

60|$|The {{principal}} {{chamber of}} Armine Place {{was a large}} irregular room, with a low but richly-carved oaken roof, studded with achievements. This apartment was lighted by the oriel window we have mentioned, the upper panes of which contained some ancient specimens of painted glass, and having been fitted up by Sir Ferdinand as a library, contained a collection of valuable books. From the library you entered through an arched door of glass into a small room, of which, it being much out of repair when the family arrived, Lady Armine had seized the opportunity of gratifying her taste in the adornment. She had hung it with some old-fashioned pea-green damask, that exhibited to a vantage several copies of Spanish paintings by herself, for she was a skilful artist. The third and remaining chamber was the dining-room, a somewhat gloomy chamber, being shadowed by a neighbouring chestnut. A portrait of Sir Ferdinand, when a youth, in a Venetian dress, was suspended over the old-fashioned fireplace; and opposite hung a fine hunting piece by Schneiders. Lady Armine was an amiable and accomplished woman. She had enjoyed {{the advantage of a}} foreign education under the inspection of a cautious parent: and a residence on the Continent, while it had afforded her many graces, had not, as unfortunately sometimes is the case, divested her of those more substantial though less showy qualities of which a husband knows the value. She was pious and dutiful: her manners were graceful, for she had visited courts and mixed in polished circles, but she had fortunately not learnt to affect insensibility as a system, or to believe that the essence of good breeding consists in showing your fellow-creatures that you despise them. Her cheerful temper solaced the constitutional gloom of Sir Ratcliffe, and indeed had originally won his heart, even more than her remarkable beauty: and {{while at the same time}} she loved a country life, she possessed in a lettered taste, in a beautiful and highly cultivated voice, and in a scientific knowledge of music and of painting, all those resources which prevent retirement from degenerating into loneliness. Her foibles, if we must confess that she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>faultless,</b> endeared her to her husband, for her temper reflected his own pride, and she possessed the taste for splendour which was also his native mood, although circumstances had compelled him to stifle its gratification.|$|R
6000|$|Such are {{the happy}} beginnings, {{accompanied}} by practical jokes, of this interesting model. Smollett's heroes, one conceives, {{were intended to}} <b>be</b> fine, though <b>not</b> <b>faultless</b> young fellows; men, not plaster images; brave, generous, free-living, but, as Roderick finds once, when examining his conscience, pure from serious stains on that important faculty. To us these heroes often appear no better than ruffians; Peregrine Pickle, for example, rather excels the infamy of Ferdinand, Count Fathom, in certain respects; though Ferdinand is professedly [...] "often the object of our detestation and abhorrence," [...] and is left in a very bad, but, as [...] "Humphrey Clinker" [...] shows, in {{by no means a}} hopeless way. Yet, throughout, Smollett regarded himself as a moralist, a writer of improving tendencies; one who [...] "lashed the vices of the age." [...] He was by no means wholly mistaken, but we should probably wrong the eighteenth century if we accepted all Smollett's censures as entirely deserved. The vices which he lashed are those which he detected, or fancied that he detected, in people who regarded a modest and meritorious Scottish orphan with base indifference. Unluckily the greater part of mankind was guilty of this crime, and consequently was capable of everything.|$|R

March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>faultless,</b> a little change <b>was</b> <b>not</b> unwelcome for its own sake.

Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.|$|R
40|$|Surveying the {{historical}} {{development and the}} present condition of utilitarian ethics, Geoffrey Scarre examines the major philosophers from Lao Tzu in the fifth century BC to Richard Hare in the twentieth. Utilitarianism traces the 'doctrine of utility' from the moralists of the ancient world, through the Enlightenment and Victorian utilitarianism up to the lively debate of the present day. Utilitarianism today faces challenges on several fronts: it cannot warrant the drawing of adequate protective boundaries around the essential interests of individuals, {{and it does not}} allow them the space to pursue the personal concerns which give meaning to their lives. Geoffrey Scarre considers these and other charges, and concludes that whilst utilitarianism may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a <b>faultless</b> moral doctrine, its positions are relevant, and significant today.

Generally equality is one of the basic values in society, but it is difficult and is failed to fulfill this principle. The main reason is that people follow prejudices and can't get over them. Formal equality of men and women before the law was reached, but factual inequalities persist. That is why a special effort is justifiable and essential to enforce equal treatment.

40|$|In The Stranger, a {{novel by}} Albert Camus, and in “Funes the Memorious,” a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, the homodiegetic narrators have a {{significant}} effect on the referential aspect of their personal experiences. Chronologically these remembered experiences are positioned before the moment when they are narrated. The act of remembering is thus a form of subsequent narration. In both texts, memory is a project rather than an object because it <b>is</b> recounted and <b>not</b> found. In the sense that it is told, memory is necessarily a creative act and thus <b>not</b> <b>faultless</b> because the story of an experience <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the experience itself. The memories in The Stranger and in “Funes the Memorious” <b>are</b> <b>not</b> reconstituted but narrated. The peculiarity of the two texts lies in the fact that the narrators take an external position when describing their own past, emphasizing the imperfect aspect of the narrators’ memory. With a narratological approach to the texts and a Sartrean interpretation of memory, I study the effects of focalization on the act of remembering. By explaining the relationship between focalization, memory and the narratee, I show that the act of remembering <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a repetition of past events or experiences but rather an inventive process that occurs always in the present. I argue that external focalization is a more authentic way to tell the story of a past experience because it emphasizes the fact that memory is always in the process of being made and therefore uncertain and incomplete even to the individual remembering...|$|R

The first part of the paper presents an empirical analysis of Poland's both real and technological convergence with the developed EU countries.

40|$|Frederick II ‘the Great’ of Prussia (1712 - 1786) is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest aristocratic dilettante musicians and composers of the 18 th century. This Master of Arts in Music (Performance) minor dissertation explores his flute music with particular reference to the compositional style of his flute sonatas and concertos. It commences with an overview of Frederick’s musical background, focusing on relevant biographical details that relate both to the formative influences on his musical training and tastes, and to the development of his compositional style. A historical examination of his abilities as a flautist (citing contemporaneous first-hand accounts) and the actual flutes upon which he played concludes that Frederick, while <b>not</b> <b>faultless,</b> <b>was</b> a skilled flautist judging from the technically difficult music that he and others composed for him to perform. The remaining chapters explore the musical structures and style that he employed in writing for the flute in his sonatas and concertos. Frederick’s flute music adheres to the ‘rules’ set out by Quantz in his Versuch einer Anweisung die Flöte traversière zu spielen (Berlin, 1752). By imitating the forms and style of Quantz’s own flute works precisely, posterity has perhaps judged Frederick’s dilettante compositions for the instrument unfairly in comparison with those of his far more experienced professional teacher. Notwithstanding the formulaic nature of these works, however, the concluding premise of the dissertation asserts that Frederick’s extant published flute sonatas and the four flute concertos have significant artistic merits, warranting a deserved place in the instrument’s repertoire...|$|R
5000|$|The {{protectorate}} {{of missions}} {{was open to}} some criticism both in theory and in practice. The following are the most plausible objections which have influenced even friends of the apostolate {{to the extent of}} making them sometimes doubtful of the usefulness of the institution, even for the missions. The protectorate, it is said, was unwillingly tolerated by the authorities of infidel countries; it embittered the antipathy and hatred excited by the Christians in those countries, and caused the missionaries relying on its support to be insufficiently mindful of the sensibilities of the natives and on their guard against excessive zeal. The modicum of truth contained in these objections showed that the exercise of the protectorate requires great wisdom and discretion. Naturally, the infidel powers chafe somewhat under it as a yoke and an uncomfortable and even humiliating servitude, but so long as they did not assure to the missionaries and their works the security and guarantees of justice which are found in Christian countries (and experience has shown how little this is the case in the Turkish and Chinese empires), the protectorate was the best means of providing them. But to obviate as much as possible the odium attached to the meddling of one foreign power in the affairs of another, this intervention is reduced to what is absolutely necessary. The solution of the delicate problem lay in the cordial union and prudent collaboration of the agents of the protectorate and the heads of the mission, which is possible to realize in practice. When it is learned that the superior of the mission of south-east Chi-li during the difficult period from 1862 to 1884 had recourse to the French legation only three times and arranged all other difficulties directly with the local Chinese authorities (Em. Becker, [...] "Le R. P. Joseph Gonnet", Ho-kien-fou, 1907, p. 275), it will be understood that the French Protectorate <b>was</b> <b>not</b> necessarily a heavy burden, either for those who exercise it or for those bound by it. The abuses which may arise were due to the men, not to the system; after all, the missionaries, though <b>not</b> <b>faultless,</b> <b>are</b> most anxious that it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> abused. Perhaps the abuse most to be feared was that the protectors should seek payment for their services by trammelling the spiritual direction of the mission or by demanding political services in exchange: a complete history of the protectorate could show such abuses and others to be insignificant when compared with the benefits conferred by this institution on religion and civilization.|$|R

The quality of decisions arrived at by promotion boards, selection boards, detailers, and placement officers will reflect, in part, the accuracy and thoroughness {{of the information}} available in fitness reports. Although "perfect" fitness reports will <b>not</b> guarantee <b>faultless</b> results, anything less than optimal performance evaluations will certainly degrade the quality of decisions accordingly. The purpose of this thesis is to provide reporting seniors and subordinate officers an insight into the Navy's fitness report system and propose relevant tools and techniques to officers preparing fitness reports {{to enable them to}} complete their task more objectively and in a manner fair to the officer being evaluated, yet providing the Navy with the information that it needs. The ph~losophy and importance of officer performance evaluations are reviewed, their many uses enumerated, and the present system is analyzed with problem areas identified and recommended solutions provided that could be initiated without revising the present fitness report directives or format. Finally, considerations for possible future use are suggested that are beyond the present report format or current implementing directives. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{general purpose}} {{this study has}} been to {{determine}} the perception of MBA students on quality lecturing. Business schools are concerned about how learners evaluate the lecturing experiences in order to monitor {{the quality of the}} lecturing. Student evaluations are assumed to mirror relative stable views which hold implications for how tertiary institutions act upon and reward the educational practices of lecturers. It is evident from prior research that broad reaching claims concerning student satisfaction cover large alternatives in terms of a construct being evaluated. Links between what is measured, and how this information should <b>be</b> utilised, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> always well-defined. Previous studies suggest that student satisfaction and perception is a multifaceted concept consisting of several complex dimensions. The true muscle of lecturing is crucial leadership ability. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just a lecture or a presentation. Lecturing is a set of skills. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just about a gift. It is a set of practices that should be rehearsed, mastered and delivered. A lecturer will certainly <b>not</b> deliver a <b>faultless</b> lecture, but might bring an influential and current lecture. The skill set of lecturing is both a skill and a discipline. A lecturer should learn and practices the discipline; then the skill will be conquered. Everyone can be a powerful and skillful presenter, but it will take time, rehearsal and vigor to overcome mediocrity. The management of business schools should comprehend the importance of quality lecturing. Without emphasis on lecturing, the perceived quality of a business school could be misconceived by students. Quality lecturing should always be a focus point and the emphasis on improved effectiveness by management. Master...|$|R
