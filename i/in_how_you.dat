Actually I’m a big fan of [...] Spielberg and the way he shoots action scenes. I think in a lot of modern action movies, it’s hard to see what’s going on. Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was to go a little retro <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> shoot action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|Originally, the singer's {{recording}} label, Capitol Records, {{was against}} {{the inclusion of the}} song as a track on Teenage Dream as they deemed [...] "Peacock" [...] too controversial. [...] "They were all a bit worried about the word 'cock' and it gave me déjà vu because they did the exact same thing with 'I Kissed a Girl,'" [...] Perry stated. Unhappy with the idea of making her music more family friendly, she insisted on including the songs the label objected to. [...] "They said, 'We don't see it as a single, we don't want it on the album.' And I was like, 'You guys are idiots'." [...] When asked about [...] "Peacock", Perry stated: [...] "I'm hoping it will be a gay-pride anthem, peacocks represent a lot of individuality..... It's not just like, 'I wanna see your bulge. And then she went on to clarify: [...] "It does have the word cock in it, but art is also in fart! It's all <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> look at it." [...] Prior to the release of Teenage Dream, the singer debuted [...] "Peacock" [...] in early August 2010 when she performed it at the MTV World Stage in Malaysia.|$|E

500|$|Tobin is {{best known}} for his use of audio {{manipulation}} techniques, where any given source material is transformed to produce a new sound. His use of this technique has changed over the course of his career. On his original singles under Ninebar and his first three albums, Tobin acquired all of the sound sources to produce music from his personal collection of vinyl records. He manipulates the sounds with a combination of audio hardware and software including Cubase, often leaving the original source unrecognizable in its new context. The majority of his early work focused on reordering the break beats from jazz and blues music into faster more complex patterns. Guido Farnell of InTheMix.com, wrote about his use of this technique, saying that Tobin has [...] "taken the art to new and dizzying heights." [...] His fifth album Out From Out Where, began the gradual shift away from prerecorded material by incorporating original guitar samples. His techniques began branching into technical sound design, taking break beats or single instruments, modifying specific frequencies, and producing new sounds. This trend continued through his video game score Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Soundtrack, and by his sixth album, Foley Room, all of the source material was recorded in the field by himself. Speaking about the creativity of sample-based music compared to traditional instruments, he says that [...] "creative input is not determined by your source material but <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> edit and manipulate the sounds." ...|$|E

6000|$|THE {{mountain}} {{held the}} town as in a shadow [...] I saw so much before I slept there once: [...] I noticed that I missed {{stars in the}} west, [...] Where its black body cut into the sky. [...] Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall [...] Behind which I was sheltered from a wind. [...] And yet between the town and it I found, [...] When I walked forth at dawn to see new things, [...] Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields. [...] The river {{at the time was}} fallen away, [...] And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones; [...] But the signs showed what it had done in spring; [...] Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass [...] Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark. [...] I crossed the river and swung round the mountain. [...] And there I met a man who moved so slow [...] With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart, [...] It seemed no hand to stop him altogether. [...] "What town is this?" [...] I asked. [...] "This? Lunenburg." [...] Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn, [...] Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain, [...] But only felt at night its shadowy presence. [...] "Where is your village? Very far from here?" [...] "There is no village--only scattered farms. [...] We were but sixty voters last election. [...] We can't in nature grow to many more: [...] That thing takes all the room!" [...] He moved his goad. [...] The mountain stood there to be pointed at. [...] Pasture ran up the side a little way, [...] And then there was a wall of trees with trunks: [...] After that only tops of trees, and cliffs [...] Imperfectly concealed among the leaves. [...] A dry ravine emerged from under boughs [...] Into the pasture. [...] "That looks like a path. [...] Is that the way to reach the top from here?-- [...] Not for this morning, but some other time: [...] I must be getting back to breakfast now." [...] "I don't advise your trying from this side. [...] There is no proper path, but those that have [...] Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's. [...] That's five miles back. You can't mistake the place: [...] They logged it there last winter some way up. [...] I'd take you, but I'm bound the other way." [...] "You've never climbed it?" [...] "I've been on the sides [...] Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There's a brook [...] That starts up on it somewhere--I've heard say [...] Right on the top, tip-top--a curious thing. [...] But what would interest you about the brook, [...] It's always cold in summer, warm in winter. [...] One of the great sights going is to see [...] It steam in winter like an ox's breath, [...] Until the bushes all along its banks [...] Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles-- [...] You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!" [...] "There ought to be a view around the world [...] From such a mountain--if it isn't wooded [...] Clear to the top." [...] I saw through leafy screens [...] Great granite terraces in sun and shadow, [...] Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up-- [...] With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet; [...] Or turn and sit on and look out and down, [...] With little ferns in crevices at his elbow. [...] "As to that I can't say. But there's the spring, [...] Right on the summit, almost like a fountain. [...] That ought to be worth seeing." [...] "If it's there. [...] You never saw it?" [...] "I guess there's no doubt [...] About its being there. I never saw it. [...] It may not be right on the very top: [...] It wouldn't have to be a long way down [...] To have some head of water from above, [...] And a good distance down might not be noticed [...] By anyone who'd come a long way up. [...] One time I asked a fellow climbing it [...] To look and tell me later how it was." [...] "What did he say?" [...] "He said there was a lake [...] Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top." [...] "But a lake's different. What about the spring?" [...] "He never got up high enough to see. [...] That's why I don't advise your trying this side. [...] He tried this side. I've always meant to go [...] And look myself, but you know how it is: [...] It doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain [...] You've worked around the foot of all your life. [...] What would I do? Go in my overalls, [...] With a big stick, the same as when the cows [...] Haven't come down to the bars at milking time? [...] Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear? [...] 'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it." [...] "I shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to-- [...] Not for the sake of climbing. What's its name?" [...] "We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right." [...] "Can one walk around it? Would it be too far?" [...] "You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg, [...] But it's as much as ever you can do, [...] The boundary lines keep in so close to it. [...] Hor is the township, and the township's Hor-- [...] And a few houses sprinkled round the foot, [...] Like boulders broken off the upper cliff, [...] Rolled out a little farther than the rest." [...] "Warm in December, cold in June, you say?" [...] "I don't suppose the water's changed at all. [...] You and I know enough to know it's warm [...] Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm. [...] But all the fun's <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> say a thing." [...] "You've lived here all your life?" [...] "Ever since Hor [...] Was no bigger than a----" [...] What, I did not hear. [...] He drew the oxen toward him with light touches [...] Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank, [...] Gave them their marching orders and was moving.|$|E
