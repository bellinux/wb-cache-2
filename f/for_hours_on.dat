5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|Brinkley spoke <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end {{each day}} on the radio, {{primarily}} promoting his goat gland treatments. He variously cajoled, shamed and appealed to men's (and women's) egos, and to their desire to be more sexually active. In between Brinkley's own advertisements, his new station featured a variety of entertainment including military bands, French lessons, astrological forecasts, storytelling and exotica such as native Hawaiian songs, and American roots music including old-time string band, gospel and early country.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, Zhou Yongkang was {{promoted}} to head the Geophysical Exploration Department of the Liaohe Petroleum Exploration Bureau, located in Panjin, Liaoning. Liaohe would eventually {{become one of the}} China National Petroleum Corporation's (CNPC) largest oil fields. Zhou was seen as a hard-working and emotionally mature presence to his colleagues; he did not drink or smoke, and would rarely speak based on script. He would reputedly talk unscripted <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end while keeping his colleagues engaged.|$|E
25|$|Poffo {{was born}} in Columbus, Ohio, the elder son of Judy and Angelo Poffo. His father was Italian American {{and his mother was}} Jewish; Poffo was raised Roman Catholic. Angelo was a {{well-known}} wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, who was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! for his ability to do sit-ups <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end. His younger brother is professional wrestler Lanny Poffo. He lived in Zanesville, Ohio, where he attended Grover Cleveland Middle School. He graduated from Downers Grove North High School in Downers Grove, Illinois. He later moved to Staten Island, New York, before moving to Lexington, Kentucky, where he lived for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of Conway's Game of Life was helped by its coming into being {{just in time}} {{for a new generation of}} inexpensive computer access which were being released into the market. The game could be run <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later {{popularity of}} computer-generated fractals. For many, Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatment}} for tuberculosis {{during this time}} was isolation (hence the sanatoria) and artificial pneumothorax or lung compression. In December 1944 Madonna Swan {{was taken to the}} Sioux Sanatorium in Rapid City, SD. During her many years at the San, as it was referred to, Madonna was treated for her TB by the placement of bean bags on her chest while lying flat on the back <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end. This was the way that pneumothorax or lung compression was accomplished. The thought being that the collapsing of the lung would kill the mycobacterium tuberculosis by eliminating the air which the bacterium needed to grow, an idea supported by observations by the Italian physician Carlo Forlanini. This treatment did not however provide a cure for Madonna Swan.|$|E
25|$|The empress {{developed}} extremely {{rigorous and}} disciplined exercise habits. Every castle {{she lived in}} was equipped with a gymnasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her bedchamber {{so that she could}} practise on them each morning, and the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up fencing in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end, becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to sciatica, she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.|$|E
25|$|Conditions in {{the factory}} were not agreeable, however. The main problem was that several foremen and {{departmental}} heads regarded workers as still being in the army – which they were, but only in theory, since most had been officially ‘discharged’ as unfit for active service at the front. These bosses ruled the workshops under the full might of military law. One of the main clauses of that military law insisted the men should wear military uniform at all times. ‘At all times’ meant everywhere except in the home – {{on the streets of}} the village, going out into Birtley itself (with appropriate military pass) and above all at work, even if that necessitated working <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end next to one of the furnaces operating at several hundred degrees.|$|E

25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely the Summer of Love, which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this Summer of Love, people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end. The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs because the police had employed a policy of looking the other way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E
25|$|On 26 October {{the band}} {{announced}} {{that they would be}} embarking on a huge UK stadium tour entitled Progress Live, starting in Sunderland on 27 May, and finishing with a record breaking 8 nights at London's Wembley Stadium in July 2011. It was also announced that Williams would perform hit singles from his solo career during the tour. The band then played at some of the biggest venues across Europe for the second leg of the tour. The phenomenal demand for tickets across the country led to the web sites of all the major UK ticket suppliers either crashing or considerably slowing <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end. The demand and sheer volume of fans also created problems for the UK telephone network. Take That's Progress Live also broke all records for ticket sales selling over 1.1million tickets in one day, smashing the previous box office record set by Take That's Circus tour in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Tendulkar {{played as}} a youngster with his brother, Ajit, for Sahitya Sahawas society’s cricket team at Bandra East. Ajit is {{credited}} by Sachin for playing {{a pivotal role in}} his life. Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School, a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East). He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would practice <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin {{on the top of the}} stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions. He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.|$|E

500|$|Holborn of ST/Amiga Format {{called the}} {{gameplay}} [...] "exceptional" [...] and [...] "addictive", stating that {{players will be}} [...] "hooked <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end". Ciaran Brennan of Computer and Video Games praised its replayability, writing that it has [...] "enough depth built in to make it last". Conversely, Zzap!64s Kati Hamza wrote that the gameplay is [...] "rather poor", disliking the pace and level design, and Maff Evans in the same review called it [...] "dull and unrewarding", pointing out the lack of excitement and reward. The Games Machine condemned the [...] "jerky scrolling" [...] of the PC version, while Rod Lawton of ACE called the gameplay of the Amiga version [...] "stubbornly 8-bit".|$|E
500|$|The turtle eats aquatic vegetation, algae, {{and small}} water creatures {{including}} insects, crustaceans, and fish. Although they are frequently consumed as eggs or hatchlings by rodents, canines, and snakes, the adult turtles' hard shells {{protect them from}} most predators. [...] Reliant on warmth from its surroundings, the painted turtle is active only during the day when it basks <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> logs or rocks. During winter, the turtle hibernates, usually in the mud {{at the bottom of}} water bodies. The turtles mate in spring and autumn. [...] Females dig nests on land and lay eggs between late spring and mid-summer. Hatched turtles grow until sexual maturity: 2–9years for males, 6–16 for females.|$|E
500|$|The first chess book Carlsen read was Find the Plan by Bent Larsen, and {{his first}} book on {{openings}} was Eduard Gufeld's The Complete Dragon. Carlsen developed his early chess skills by playing by himself <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end—moving the pieces around, searching for combinations, and replaying games and positions shown {{to him by his}} father. Simen Agdestein emphasises Carlsen's exceptional memory, stating {{that he was able to}} recall the areas, population numbers, flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by the age of five. Later, Carlsen had memorised the areas, population numbers, coat-of-arms and administrative centres of [...] "virtually all" [...] Norwegian municipalities. Carlsen participated in his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at the age of 8 years and 7 months, and scored 6½/11.|$|E

500|$|The Queen's health {{remained}} fair {{until the}} autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham, the niece of her cousin and close friend Lady Knollys, came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a [...] "settled and unremovable melancholy", and sat motionless on a cushion <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end. When Robert Cecil {{told her that she}} must go to bed, she snapped [...] "Must is not a word to use to princes, little man". She died on 24 March 1603 at Richmond Palace, between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James VI of Scotland as James I of England.|$|E
500|$|Garland {{always had}} a large base of fans in the gay community, which {{includes}} Wainwright, who identifies as gay and came out to his parents {{at the age of}} 14. A connection is frequently drawn between the timing of Garland's death and funeral, in June 1969, and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern Gay Liberation movement. Coincidental or not, the proximity of Garland's death to Stonewall has become a part of LGBT history and lore. Wainwright, having been called the [...] "first post-liberation era gay pop star", was obsessed with The Wizard of Oz (1939) as a child and would dress in his mother's gown, [...] "pretend to be either the Wicked Witch – melting <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end – or the Good Witch, depending on his mood". Wainwright also claims his mother (Canadian folk musician Kate McGarrigle) forced him to perform [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] for guests while growing up, a song he often included in his concert repertoire as an adult.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{while playing}} a gig at the Pypo Club in Seaside, Oregon, the band noticed Rockin' Robin Roberts's version of [...] "Louie Louie" [...] being {{played on the}} jukebox <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> end. The entire club would get up and dance. Ely {{convinced}} the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response. Unknown to him, he changed the beat from 1-2-3-4, 1–2, 1-2-3-4, 1–2 to 1-2-3, 1–2, 1-2-3, 1–2 because he based it on the intro only. Ken Chase, host of radio station KISN, formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes. Dubbed [...] "The Chase", the Kingsmen became the club's house band and Ken Chase became the band's manager. Ely was begging Chase to let the band record {{their own version of}} [...] "Louie Louie", and on April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day. The band had just played a 90-minute [...] "Louie Louie" [...] marathon.|$|E
