40|$|Copyright © 2009 American Chemical SocietyDarkening {{in yellow}} {{alkaline}} noodles (YAN) was measured over 24 h {{in a high}} polyphenol oxidase (PPO) bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Tasman) and a very low PPO durum wheat (Triticum durum cv. Kamilaroi). Over 24 h non-PPO <b>darkening</b> occurred {{across a range of}} pH 3. 5 - 10. 5, and in Tasman this was overlaid by <b>darkening</b> from PPO activity. The rate of <b>darkening</b> in YAN was separated into two main time periods, 0 - 4 and 4 - 24 h. The first 4 h of <b>darkening</b> was further divided into two stages using a composite first-order rate equation. Several specific inhibitors that partially inhibited non-PPO <b>darkening</b> were identified. These inhibitors, as well as the PPO inhibitors SHAM and tropolone, were used to analyze YAN <b>darkening.</b> The rate of the early stage of <b>darkening</b> was not altered by any inhibitors used; however, the magnitude of <b>darkening</b> was reduced by inhibitors specific for non-PPO <b>darkening.</b> Both the rate and extent of non-PPO <b>darkening</b> of the second stage of <b>darkening</b> were decreased in Tasman and Kamilaroi by inhibitors specific for non-PPO <b>darkening,</b> whereas both PPO inhibitors only decreased <b>darkening</b> in Tasman. The second and third stages of <b>darkening</b> showed similar characteristics. The third stage of <b>darkening</b> was examined in YAN made from Kamilaroi over a temperature range from - 4 to 65 degrees C. It followed an Arrhenius relationship indicating non-PPO <b>darkening</b> during this stage was nonenzymatic. The inhibitor data suggested that the reactive component(s) was/were present in a reasonably high concentration(s) and that the soluble protein fraction was involved in the non-PPO <b>darkening</b> process.

We investigate the consistency of solar limb <b>darkening</b> data, published for the UV wavelength region between 2000 and 3300 A, from the comparison of F=I 0 ratios based either on direct limb <b>darkening</b> observations or on absolute irradiance (F) and disk{center intensity (I 0) measurements.

40|$|The sun is not equally bright {{over the}} whole sphere, but rather is <b>darkened</b> toward the limb. This effect is {{well-known}} as limb <b>darkening.</b> The limb <b>darkening</b> coefficient {{is defined by the}} ratio of the center intensity to limb intensity. In this study, we calculate the limb <b>darkening</b> coefficient using the photospheric intensity estimated from solar images taken by solar and helispheric observatory (SOHO) and solar dynamics observatory (SDO). The photospheric intensity data cover almost two solar cycles from May 1996 to December 2016. The limb <b>darkening</b> coefficient for a size of 0. 9 diameter is about 0. 69 and this value is consistent with solar limb <b>darkening.</b> The limb <b>darkening</b> coefficient estimated from SOHO shows a temporal increase at solar maximum and a gradual increase since the solar minimum of 2008. The limb <b>darkening</b> coefficient estimated from SDO shows a constant value of about 0. 65 and a decreasing trend since 2014. The increase in the coefficient reflects the effect of weakened solar activity. However, the decrease since 2014 is caused by the aging effect...|$|R

40|$|We {{study how}} the {{precision}} of the exoplanet radius determination is affected by our present knowledge of limb <b>darkening</b> in two cases: when we fix the limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients and when we adjust them. We also investigate the effects of spots in one-colour photometry. We study the effect of limb <b>darkening</b> on the planetary radius determination both via analytical expressions and by numerical experiments. We also compare some of the existing limb <b>darkening</b> tables. When stellar spots affect the fit, we replace the limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients, calculated for the unspotted cases, with effective limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients to describe {{the effect of the}} spots. There are two important cases. (1) When one fixes the limb <b>darkening</b> values according to some theoretical predictions, the inconsistencies of the tables do not allow us to reach accuracy in the planetary radius of better than 1 - 10 % (depending on the impact parameter) if the host star's surface effective temperature is higher than 5000 K. Below 5000 K the radius ratio determination may contain even 20 % error. (2) When one allows adjustment of the limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients, the a/Rs ratio, the planet-to-stellar radius ratio, and the impact parameter can be determined with sufficient accuracy (< 1 %), if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, the presence of stellar spots and faculae can destroy the agreement between the limb <b>darkening</b> tables and the fitted limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients, but this does not affect {{the precision of}} the planet radius determination. We also find {{that it is necessary to}} fit the contamination factor, too. We conclude that the present inconsistencies of theoretical stellar limb <b>darkening</b> tables suggests one should not fix the limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients. When one allows them to be adjusted, then the planet radius, impact parameter, and the a/Rs can be obtained with the required precision.

40|$|<b>Darkening</b> {{in yellow}} {{alkaline}} noodles (YAN) was examined over a 24 h period in noodles made from 4 wheat varieties, including varieties with {{different levels of}} polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, selected to cover a range of protein levels. Noodles {{were made in the}} presence and absence of the PPO inhibitor, tropolone. The <b>darkening</b> was divided into two time periods: 0 - 4 h and 4 - 24 h. The first four hours was described by a composite rate equation, and this period was subdivided into two stages. The rate of <b>darkening</b> in the first stage was independent of both protein concentration and PPO activity. The amount of <b>darkening</b> (c), however, was highly dependent on protein concentration during this stage (-tropolone, r = 0. 902; +tropolone, r = 0. 905), but independent of PPO activity. The first stage <b>darkening</b> was a zero order reaction where additional protein does not increase the reaction rate, but when the protein supply has been depleted, the reaction stops. The rate of <b>darkening</b> during the first stage (k'(1) = 5. 6 +/- 1. 0) was similar to the rate of change in the protein structure (k'(1) = 6. 5 +/- 1. 3) as measured using the amide II band by infrared spectroscopy. This suggested that the first stage of <b>darkening</b> represents changes in light reflectance and absorbance caused by changes in hydrogen bonding rather than changes in covalent bonding. During the second stage of <b>darkening,</b> both the rate (k'(2)) and amount of <b>darkening</b> (DeltaL*(4 h-c)) were significantly correlated with protein concentration (-tropolone, r = 0. 465; +tropolone, r = 0. 813), {{and in the absence of}} tropolone the amount of <b>darkening</b> was increased by PPO activity. The amount of <b>darkening</b> (DeltaL*(24 h- 4 h)) during the second time period (4 - 24 h) (or third stage) was significantly correlated in the presence of tropolone (r = 0. 375) and in the absence of tropolone (r = 0. 428) with protein concentration. However, compared with earlier stages the response of non-PPO <b>darkening</b> during the third stage to change in protein concentration was smaller. Protein oxidation, or more specifically oxidation of tyrosine groups within the protein, appears to be the main mechanism involved in non-PPO <b>darkening</b> in YAN during the second and third stages with glutenin being the main reactant. Albumin and globulin are important substrates for PPO. No differences in <b>darkening</b> were detected in YAN made from the four varieties in the presence of tropolone; however, differences in YAN <b>darkening</b> were observed for the second and third stages due to site and year variation.

The light curves are modelled using jktebop, random errors are measured using Monte Carlo simulations, {{and the effects of}} correlated noise are included using a residual-permutation algorithm. The importance of stellar limb <b>darkening</b> on the light curve solutions and parameter uncertainties is investigated using five different limb <b>darkening</b> laws and including different numbers of coefficients as fitted parameters. The linear limb <b>darkening</b> law cannot adequately fit the HST photometry of HD 209458, but the other four laws give very similar results to each other for all transit light curves. In most cases fixing the limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients at theoretically predicted values does not bias the results, but does cause the error estimates to be too small. The available theoretical limb <b>darkening</b> coefficients clearly disagree with empirical values measured from the HST light curves of HD 209458; limb <b>darkening</b> must be included as fitted parameters when analysing high-quality light curves...|$|R

5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to <b>darken</b> them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits <b>darken</b> the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E

The pH, lipid oxidation (TBARS), heme proteins, and iron content were investigated in MAP samples of turkey males, females, and in oxygen-permeable filmpackaged males. Furthermore, the absorbance spectrum (400 to 700 nm) {{of the meat}} extracts was analyzed to better delineate the evolution and characteristics of the <b>darkening</b> process.

Furthermore, pH was higher in muscles taken as controls, with respect to muscles involved in the <b>darkening,</b> as well as in females. Finally, TBARS values were found to be higher in <b>darkened</b> regions than in not <b>darkened</b> ones, as well as in MAP samples with respect to oxygen-permeable filmpackaged samples.

Ninety, 16 -week-old hens (Ross Brown) were divided into 3 groups, 30 hens each. The first group was used as control.

Liveweight, feed intake, and egg production were higher (P < 0. 01) in the feed withdrawal and <b>darkening</b> groups, particularly in the <b>darkening</b> group, than in the control. Water intake was higher in the control group compared with the feed withdrawal and <b>darkening</b> groups (P < 0. 01).

The present study found that feed withdrawal and <b>darkening,</b> particularly <b>darkening,</b> at high temperatures during the summer months offer a good management practice to reduce heat stress related depression in feed intake and egg production in laying hens...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} the radiative driving force for winds around rapidly rotating oblate B stars, and we estimate the impact these forces should {{have on the}} production of a wind compressed disk. The effects of limb <b>darkening,</b> gravity <b>darkening,</b> oblateness, and an arbitrary wind velocity field are included in the computation of vector 'oblate finite disk' (OFD) factors, which depend on both radius and colatitude in the wind. The impact of limb <b>darkening</b> alone, with or without rotation, can increase the mass loss by as much as 10 % over values computed using the standard uniformly bright spherical finite disk factor. For rapidly rotating stars, limb <b>darkening</b> makes 'sub-stellar' gravity <b>darkening</b> the dominant effect in the radial and latitudinal OFD factors, and lessens the impact of gravity <b>darkening</b> at other visible latitudes (nearer to the oblate limb). Thus, the radial radiative driving is generally stronger over the poles and weaker over the equator, following the gravity <b>darkening</b> at these latitudes. The nonradial radiative driving is considerably smaller in magnitude than the radial component, but is directed both away from the equatorial plane and in a retrograde azimuthal direction, acting to decrease the effective stellar rotation velocity. These forces thus weaken the equatorward wind compression compared to wind models computed with nonrotating finite disk factors...|$|R
