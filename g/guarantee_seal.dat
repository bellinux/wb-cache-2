40|$|We {{present a}} {{surgical}} technique {{to treat the}} distal aortic arch in patients who previously underwent ascending aortic replacement using the frozen elephant trunk. After debranching of the epiaortic vessels using a custom-made four-branch graft and systemic cooling, the extracorporeal circulation is interrupted, maintaining antegrade cerebral perfusion through the four-branch prosthesis. Then the "old" Dacron prosthesis, previously implanted for the ascending aortic replacement, is partially incised at its distal end, leaving a margin of prosthesis anastomosed to the native distal aorta, and the E-vita stent-graft is deployed under direct vision. Then the two margins of the "old" Dacron and the new Dacron E-vita prosthesis (Jotec Inc., Hechingen, Germany) are sutured together with one suture line to <b>guarantee</b> <b>sealing</b> and reconstruction of the aorta.

Because adhesives have been evolving so rapidly for the last few years, the timing is right for evaluating the clinical status of present day adhesives. DATA SOURCES: Current literature with regard to the clinical performance of adhesives has been reviewed. An overview of currently available adhesive systems is provided and a categorization of these adhesives according to their clinical application procedure and their intended mechanism of adhesion is proposed. Parameters of direct relevance to the clinical effectiveness of adhesives are discussed in relation to the clinical effectiveness of today's adhesives. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical performance of present day adhesives has significantly improved, allowing adhesive restorations to be placed with a high predictable level of clinical success. Most modern adhesive systems are superior to their predecessors, especially in terms of retention that is no longer the main cause of premature clinical failure.

To <b>guarantee</b> proper <b>sealing</b> capacity of the grouting materials, the grout must also fulfill suitable hydraulic and mechanical properties. This paper evaluates the performance of various grouting materials, through thermal, hydraulic and mechanical laboratory characterizations. In particular, the addition of graphite powder to improve the thermal properties of grouting material is tested. In parallel, the characteristics of two different widely used commercial grouting materials (i. e. bentonite-based and silica sand-based materials) are also investigated. Afterwards, the specific heat exchange rate and the borehole resistance of borehole heat exchangers are assessed experimentally in a 1 × 1 × 1 m 3 sandbox under, successively, dry sand and fully water-saturated sand conditions. During the operations, the monitored temperatures in the sandbox are in good agreement with analytical predictions. This study demonstrates that the homemade admixture prepared with 5 % natural flake graphite can be considered as an appropriate grout for BHEs regarding to its rheological and thermo-physical properties. Thermally-enhanced grouting can be of significant interest in a high thermal conductivity ground (such as saturated sand) because it minimizes the thermal resistance of the BHE. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Frequently, these closed mines or sections of mines are connected through galleries to other mines still in operation. In these cases it is necessary to maintain the water extraction in the zones already abandoned in order to prevent the flooding of the areas in operation, with the consequent increase of operating costs. A possible solution to this problem is the construction of concrete plugs in order to seal the connection between active and abandoned zones. Nevertheless, due to the depth of the mining works, which frequently exceeds 400 m, the hydrostatic pressures that will support the plugs are much higher than the pressure held by the conventional dams so they will require an efficient design and anchorage.

Second, oil-displacement preflush is developed and it is well compatible with oil-based drilling fluids and cement slurry with the flushing efficiency on oil-based drilling fluids higher than 90 %.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} methods {{were carried out}} to investigate the disc flexibility effects on the PRV sealing performances. For the PRV subjected to inner pressure, the calculation {{results show that the}} location of maximum contact press on the sealing ring varies from the outer region to the inner region when the inner pressure increases from 1 to 7 MPa. The PRV with a more flexible disc exhibits a higher maximum contact press, thus resulting in a better sealing performance. For the PRV subjected to impact load in the case of re-closing process, the effects of disc flexibility on the PRV sealing performance was also studied. The finite calculation results indicate that the maximum plastic deformation is located in the outer region of the disc sealing ring and the sliding was occurred on the sealing ring, which is validated by experiments. The maximum plastic deformation and the displacement of sliding increase with a rise of disc flexibility. The plastic deformation and sliding has little effect on the sealing performance when the inner pressure close to setting pressure.

40|$|Sliding {{lip seals}} {{are used in}} {{pneumatic}} cylinders to prevent leakage past the piston and rod. Though they <b>guarantee</b> excellent <b>sealing,</b> the friction forces at contact between lip and counterpart can be relatively high. This results in energy losses and problems with wear on components in relative motion, as well as difficulties in controlling actuator positioning. Standards for compressed air cleanliness restrict the use of greases and lubricants, especially in applications such as the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. A number of studies are thus under way {{in order to find}} effective alternatives to the use of common lubricants. These studies address both seal configuration [1 - 4], and the use of innovative materials [5 - 7]. Other approaches employ systems permitting small amounts of air leakage that operate as lubricated supports, variable-profile pistons [8], or rings with special micromachined surfaces [9 - 10]. Such solutions are not always economical, both because they require precision tolerances and geometries, and because they use special seals, often produced ad hoc. This paper discusses the possibility of using commercial lip seals with a non-conventional mounting on the piston in order to obtain a simple controlled-leakage system that reduces friction forces in pneumatic cylinders economically and effectively. The non-conventional mounting consists of positioning the lip seal in the direction opposite to that used in a conventional installation, so that the contact pressure reduces as air pressure in the chamber rises. In this way, an air gap is created at the sliding interface which allows air in the pressurized chamber to escape past the seal lip, thus reducing the contact force on the barrel. The piston is provided with a hole which exhausts the leakage flow to the atmosphere. To evaluate the validity of this approach, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in [11] to measure flow rate on a type of spring-loaded lip seal consisting of graphite-filled PTFE for barrel diameters of 50 mm. In particular, the tests determined air leakage behavior for different mounting tolerances. This paper presents further tests conducted on the same samples examined in [11] and on another PTFE and graphite-filled PTFE configuration, measuring leakage flow rates and friction forces. Leakage flow rate measurements were carried out with single and double seal installations. The results obtained are discussed together with the advantages of the proposed solution compared to the conventional mountings in ordinary us...|$|R
40|$|Fast-scan {{cyclic voltammetry}} (FSCV) is a {{powerful}} technique for measuring sub-second changes in neurotransmitter levels. A great time-limiting factor {{in the use of}} FSCV is the production of high-quality recording electrodes; common recording electrodes consist of cylindrical carbon fiber encased in borosilicate glass. When the borosilicate is heated and pulled, the molten glass ideally forms a tight seal around the carbon fiber cylinder. It is often difficult, however, to <b>guarantee</b> a perfect <b>seal</b> between the glass and carbon. Indeed, much of the time spent creating electrodes is in an effort to find a good seal. Even though epoxy resins can be useful in this regard, they are irreversible (seals are permanent), wasteful (epoxy cannot be reused once hardener is added), hazardous (hardeners are often caustic), and require curing. Herein we characterize paraffin as an electrode sealant for FSCV microelectrodes. Paraffin boasts the advantages of near-immediate curing times, simplicity in use, long shelf-life and stable waterproof seals capable of withstanding extended cycling. Borosilicate electrode tips were left intact or broken and dipped in paraffin embedding wax. Excess wax was removed from the carbon surface with xyelenes or by repeated cycling at an extended waveform (- 0. 4 to 1. 4 V, 400 V/s, 60 Hz). Then, the waveform was switched to a standard waveform (- 0. 4 to 1. 3 V, 400 V/s, 10 Hz) and cycled until stable. Wax-sealing does not inhibit electrode sensitivity, as electrodes detected linear changes in dopamine before and after wax (then xylenes) exposure. Paraffin seals are intact after 11 days of implantation in the mouse, and still capable of measuring transient changes in in vivo dopamine. From this it is clear that paraffin wax is an effective sealant for FSCV electrodes that provides a convenient substitute to epoxy sealants...|$|R
30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to <b>guarantee</b> the <b>sealing</b> performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA coal mine, once closed, still "lives". Coal beds release methane, {{which is}} then trapped in the mine voids by water rising {{as a result of}} natural flooding. The {{consequence}} is a rise of pressure (a well‐known phenomenon in every coalfield) which may be dangerous, because gas can migrate directly to the surface. Controlling mine gas risk is essential for safety reasons, due to methane's highly flammable nature. A control methodology was developed by the original operator and starting on this basis, geological studies and probability calculations conducted by the BRGM in several French coalfields in the past, are today key to improve control. Methane is bonded on both the internal and external surfaces of each particle of coal, due to numerous cracks. Gas is released by desorption under specific pressure conditions, defined for each coal by isotherms curves. Desorption occurs naturally into the atmosphere above atmospheric pressure, but gas can also be released beneath by pumping. A whole mine can sometimes turn into a methane reservoir. The definition of risk is then based on two concepts. For ground gas migration, risk is theoretically defined as "a cross between the susceptibility of caprock to let methane pass and vulnerability at surface where it might meet sensitive elements such as habitats". In this context, everything depends on the ground natural ability to allow migration. BRGM therefore carries out a geological study to identify "exhaust minimum requirements" and determine where ground constitution, thickness or permeability is insufficient to contain the risk. BRGM then studied "the occurrence of the event" pertaining the mine shafts, i. e. the probability that the gas escapes through some works, and conducted preventative works. To this end, when mines were closed, a network of galleries was kept open to allow the gas to flow. In some cases, sealing works have been made, while in the others security structures were built before exploitation ended. Decompression boreholes are drilled above higher areas of the reservoir, allowing a "passive" and continuous decompression. Finally, BRGM makes twice‐yearly measurements of pressure, methane content and sealing. Meanwhile, GAZONOR, a company operating in the Nord‐Pas‐de‐Calais since 1980, is dedicated to the research, extraction, purification and sale of coal mine methane extracted from the former coalfield. The original mission of GAZONOR meets justified and general interest needs of mine gas extraction. Indeed, methane extraction allows limiting potential risk of leaks and spontaneous or accidental explosions, while reducing greenhouse effect by preventing its free movement to the atmosphere. BRGM and GAZONOR certainly {{do not have the same}} goals, one working for people's safety and the other for profit. However, both have the same study object and share a mutual interest to its understanding. In the end, whatever the vision of the reservoir, the purpose is to <b>guarantee</b> the <b>sealing</b> to control the risks while integrating economic and environmental issues...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES Transapical transcatheter valve {{procedures}} are performed through a left minithoracotomy and require apical sutures {{to seal the}} apical access site. The use of large-calibre devices compromises any attempt to fully perform the procedure with a thoracoscopic approach or percutaneously. We report our preliminary experience in animals with a new sutureless self-expandable apical occluder, engineered to perform transapical access site closure in a minimally invasive setting with large-size introducer sheaths. METHODS The apical occluder with extendable waist was implanted in six young pigs during an acute animal study. Under general anaesthesia, animals (mean weight: 62 ± 8 kg) received full heparinization (heparin: 100 UI/kg; activated clotting time above 250 s). Through a median sternotomy, a 21 -Fr Certitude™ introducer sheath (outer diameter: 25 Fr) was placed over the wire into the cardiac apex. The delivery catheter carrying the constrained apical plug was inserted into the sheath and deployed under fluoroscopic control, whereas the Certitude™ was retrieved. After protamine infusion, we observed and recorded the 1 -h bleeding with standard haemodynamic parameters. Animals were sacrificed, and hearts analysed. RESULTS Six apical closure devices were successfully introduced and deployed in six pig hearts through large-size apical sheaths at first attempt. In all animals, the plugs <b>guaranteed</b> immediate apical <b>sealing</b> and traces of blood were collected in the pericardium during the 1 -h observational period (mean of 16 ± 3. 4 ml of blood loss per animal). Haemodynamic parameters remained stable during the entire study period and no plug dislodgement was detected with normal systemic blood pressure (mean arterial mean blood pressure: 65 ± 7 mmHg). Post-mortem analysis confirmed the full deployment and good fixation of all plugs, without macroscopic damages to the surrounding myocardium. CONCLUSIONS This sutureless self-expandable apical occluder is a simple device capable of sealing large-size apical access sites (20 - 35 Fr) in an acute animal study. This approach is a step further towards less invasive transapical valve procedures in the clinical setting, and further animal tests will be performed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of this device...|$|R
40|$|Every {{stage of}} the endodontic {{treatment}} should be equally approached, giving each one the same importance: correct diagnosis, treatment orientation, meticulous cleaning and instrumentation and a sufficiently compacted obturation that would <b>guarantee</b> the impermeable <b>sealing</b> of the root-canal in its apical, lateral and coronal levels, coronal reconstruction and distance control. Having defined obturation as {{the replacement of the}} space achieved in the surgical preparation of the root-canal by an inert or antiseptic, stable, three-dimensional and permanent material, its priority objective is to operate as an impregnable barrier to liquids and bacteria and the material for obturation must be sufficiently compacted to be radiographically acceptable. Several {{studies have shown that the}} therapeutic successes and failures are closely related to the quality of the obturation and its transverse compaction. Traditionally, the assessment of the endodontic obturation quality has been done by radiographic observations of: the apical limit of obturation, the degree of compaction and the coronal obturation. (16). Yet this analogical view is limited, since it records a three- dimensional image on a plane. Even though every technique is valuable, none of them meets totally our expectations to estimate the quality of obturation. The digital images are those obtained both by direct methods through radiopvisiograhs or Digoras systems and indirect ones through scanned x-rays. The digital images provide a new tool that enables us to visualize from another viewpoint the slight differences of gray concentrations. The aims suggested for this work were as follows: digitalizing of periapical X-rays, applying some tools of a program of digital image treatment, and determining if they themselves favor the assessment of the endodontic obturation compaction [...] 15 periapical radiographic plates from patients of the undergraduates of the Chair of Endodontics of the School of Dentistry of Rosario were selected. These plates corresponded to teeth with sealed canals. Some were assessed as acceptably well condensed and others as poorly condensed. The radiographic plates were ";scanned"; using an Agfa Scanner, and transforming them into digital images. For the image processing the ";IMAGE TOOL";® program was chosen The images are treated through the different tools [...] The data was statistically processed and summarized in a table...|$|R
