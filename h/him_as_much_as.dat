Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{the loss of his}} food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} in Gajabahu’s court, the Parākramabāhu did two things of significance. The first was to enmesh the court of Gajabahu {{in a web of}} espionage and the other was to marry one of his sisters called Bhaddavati, to King Gajabahu. Through this marriage, Parākramabāhu managed matters that Gajabahu II {{completely}} trusted <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he did the royal family. Nevertheless, he retained the entirety of Bhaddavati’s dowry for himself, and entered into secret negotiations with Gajabahu’s general, Gokanna. Gajabahu eventually grew suspicious of Parākramabāhu’s activities, and Parākramabāhu departed Rajarata in secrecy by night and returned to Dakkhinadesa.|$|E

The King decides that he will give {{the best part of}} the kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot or will not stoop to false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> she should, and that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride.|$|E

He won and lost two fortunes on the track and at one stage required the assistance of the New South Wales Cricketers Fund to support him and his invalid mother.

500|$|Completing {{the main}} cast, Patrick Wymark stars as Jason Webb, {{director}} of EUROSEC. Having selected {{him on the}} basis of his performance as John Wilder in the television series The Plane Makers (1963–65) and The Power Game (1965–70), Anderson stated that Wymark's acting impressed <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Hendry's, but also that his similar drinking habits resulted in slurred lines on set. During the filming of one scene, Wymark [...] "had to list these explanations... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. We had to do it over and over again." [...] Archer and Hearn identify Wymark's portrayal of Webb, a character described as [...] "John Wilder (2069 model)" [...] in publicity material, as the dominant performance of the film. The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology, who is now romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby.|$|E

I thought, 'My baby's going to be beautiful.'"After Anna Mae gave birth to their son Craig in 1958, the couple's {{relationship}} became strained.

500|$|In March 2006, amidst {{reports that}} Jackson was having {{financial}} problems, {{the main house}} at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure. Jackson had been delinquent on his repayments of a $270 million loan secured against his music-publishing holdings, even though the holdings were reportedly making <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> [...] a year. Bank of America sold the debt to Fortress Investments. Sony reportedly proposed a restructuring deal which would give them a future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly-owned publishing company, leaving Jackson with a 25% stake.

In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain-based startup, Two Seas Records; nothing came of the deal, and Two Seas CEO Guy Holmes later stated that it had never been finalized.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richard was {{the star}} player for the Montreal Canadiens, and it was common for opponents to provoke him during games. Teams {{reportedly}} sent players onto the ice to purposefully annoy him by yelling ethnic slurs, hooking, slashing, and holding <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible. Throughout his career, Richard was fined and suspended several times for retaliatory assaults on players and officials, including a $250 fine for slapping a linesman in the face {{less than three months}} before the March 13, 1955 incident. Richard was considered the embodiment of French-Canadians and was a hero during a time when they were seen as second-class citizens. He was revered when he fought the [...] "damn English" [...] during games. In his book, The Rocket: A Cultural History of Maurice Richard, Benoît Melançon compares Richard to Major League Baseball's Jackie Robinson by stating that both players represented the possibility for their minority groups to succeed in North America.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Alissa Stickler {{describes}} Flagg as a [...] "contemporary medievalist interpretation on {{the themes}} of evil, magic and the (d)evil figure". She likens Flagg to Merlin, whispering in the ear of Arthur. Stickler notes that Flagg is politically powerful in The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon; he uses his power differently in each novel, challenging depictions of evil and witchcraft common in medieval times. She explains that there {{does not appear to}} be a higher power to which Flagg [...] "must appeal to his abilities" [...] as there is with traditional evil. Flagg is more of a [...] "humanesque evil", which works against <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it does for him. His supernatural knowledge is fallible, and the customary black-and-white depiction is replaced with an [...] "acceptance of a shadowy gray area". Stickler says that although Flagg appears [...] "terrifying and supernatural" [...] as depicted by King, there are no absolutes. She concludes that Flagg represents the medieval monster both past and future, which challenges and yet supports the literary Middle Ages.|$|E

500|$|Sleeper berth time is {{any amount}} of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA {{regulation}} §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth. The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the driving controls that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of [...] "rest" [...] within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: [...] "We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of adequate rest and sleep, in the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition." ...|$|E

The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he thinks they should."

500|$|Kill 'Em All, as {{the first}} thrash metal album {{released}} in the U.S., had substantial impact on the emerging scene and inspired numerous bands with its aggression and austere seriousness. Guitarist Kerry King acknowledged Slayer was still finding its sound while Metallica had already determined its image and musical identity. Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian {{was impressed by the}} album's heaviness and songwriting, and said it influenced <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the albums by Iron Maiden. Dream Theater's drummer Mike Portnoy observed that Kill 'Em All surpassed the NWOBHM bands in terms of sheer velocity and cited Burton's bass solo as the album's peak.
