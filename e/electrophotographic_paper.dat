When this conversion of (II) reaches 25 - 90 %, a crosslinking comonomer (III) is added in an amt. of 0. 1 - 3 mole. % based on (II). The prod. comprises (a) 10 - 100 wt. % {{of a highly}} branched polymer with a molecular wt. above 100, 000, comprising 97 - 99. 9 mole. % of units derived from (II) and 0. 1 - 3 mole. % of units derived from (III), and (b) 0 - 90 wt. % of a linear homopolymer of (II). Component (a) has 1 - 25 branch sites per 100 monomer units. (II) is esp. dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride, but may also be another dimethyl diallyl ammonium salt, a vinylpyridinium salt or a quat. ester or amide of (meth) acrylic acid. (III) is a 1 - 3 C alkyl triallyl ammonium salt, a tetraallyl ammonium salt, a tetraallyl alkylenediamine salt, a triallylamine salt or methylene bisacrylamide. Polymerisation is effected at 18 - 65 deg. C, using a 30 - 70 % aq. soln. of (II). USE/ADVANTAGE - (I) are useful as flocculating agents, demulsifiers for breaking o/w emulsions, and for prodn. of electrically conductive films, e. g. on <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>paper.</b> The process gives high-molecular-wt. highly branched prods. with a low content of short-chain components, without the risk of gel formation...|$|E
