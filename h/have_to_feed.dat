[...] Other rewards {{he is said to}} have {{received}} for this event include an order being issued that whichever regiment he presented himself at would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> him the rations of a serving soldier and that he was placed on the regimental books and was to receive the pay and rations of a soldier. [...] A further legend says that Moustache was presented to Napoleon himself and demonstrated to have performed a trick whereby he would cock his leg whenever France's enemies were mentioned.|$|E
500|$|In Scotland and Ireland, {{the first}} farmer {{to finish the}} grain harvest made a corn dolly, {{representing}} the Cailleach (also called [...] "the Carlin or Carline"), from the last sheaf of the crop. The figure would then be tossed into the field of a neighbor {{who had not yet}} finished bringing in their grain. The last farmer to finish had the responsibility to take in and care for the corn dolly for the next year, with the implication they'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> and house the hag all winter. Competition was fierce to avoid having to take in the Old Woman.|$|E

60|$|So far all was well. But a new {{administration}} in San Francisco, pledged to economy, had stopped all street work. This meant the shutting down of the Lawndale quarry, {{which was one of}} the sources of supply for paving blocks.

60|$|We {{took up a}} {{collection}} and sent a telegram to the authorities of that town.

In the latter event they'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> us anyway, and they decided wisely that one meal would be the cheaper way.|$|E

60|$|His first notion--acquired {{from the}} mere {{sight of her}} without converse--that of an idle and vulgar flirtation with a timber-merchant's pretty daughter, grated painfully upon him {{now that he had}} found what Grace {{intrinsically}} was. Personal intercourse with such as she could take no lower form than intellectual communion, and mutual explorations of the world of thought. Since he could not call at her father's, having no practical views, cursory encounters in the lane, in the wood, coming and going to and from church, or in passing her dwelling, were what the acquaintance would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> on.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} three years she would be more or less {{dependent}} on her parents again. Her training was free.

Her father would earn only two hundred a year, and a good deal of her mother's capital was spent in buying the house. Still, there was enough to get along with.|$|E

60|$|Travelling with {{incredible}} slowness, {{in due time}} {{we came to a}} county called Orangeburg, where all were Dutchmen like Hans, and very few spoke English. And they all thought like Hans, and loved peace, and hated the Congress. On Sundays, as we lay over at the taverns, these would be filled with a rollicking crowd of fiddlers and dancers, quaintly dressed, the women bringing their children and babies. At such times Hans would be drunk, and I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> the tired horses and mount watch over the cargo. I had many adventures, but none worth the telling here. And at length we came to Hans's farm, in a prettily rolling country on the Broad River. Hans's wife spoke no English at all, nor did the brood of children running about the house. I had small fancy for staying in such a place, and so Hans paid me two crowns for my three weeks' service; I think, with real regret, for labor was scarce in those parts, and though I was young, I knew how to work. And I could at least have guided his plough in the furrow and cared for his cattle.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ruskin's {{view as to}} {{the duty}} of basing all upon the Father's love is {{essentially}} sound and orthodox; and he is also right in bidding all men lead self-denying lives,--in this sense, that they should give up time and labour to the endeavour to help their brethren; but he fails utterly, hopelessly, to realize the Incarnation and its glorious consequences, how all human life and love,--how art, science, knowledge, enjoyment, are sanctified by God's becoming man; sharing this human life of ours,--not to trample upon it as an unholy thing, but to consecrate it to God's service. Such is our call. We must enjoy the beautiful to vindicate enjoyment. We do not please God by casting all His choicest gifts away. To give all we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> the poor {{is the way to}} make men poor, and is false charity. Use rather the mammon of this world to God's honour and glory, and when ye fail, the good works that you have done shall plead for your entrance into everlasting habitations; for the way to clothe the naked and feed the hungry, permanently, is to teach men and women to help themselves, and to find employment and reward for the exercise of their powers and energies.|$|E
