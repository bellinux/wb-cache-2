50|$|Commedia dell'Arte {{has been}} {{depicted}} as actors in masks performing on temporary stages in market squares in woodcuts, paintings, engravings, and drawings by {{artists such as}} Callot, Scarron, and Dujardin. The stages in these depictions often appear to be elevated by six foot tall scaffolding with audience members standing on three sides of the stage. Simple curtains often are depicted hanging behind the actors sometimes painted with an urban background, similar to a backdrop. Sometimes actors were depicted peeking through behind them, and sometimes there would be slits in the curtain indicating doors and windows.These depictions can {{give us an idea}} of the kinds of stages that might have been used at the time, but written reports tell us that the most successful troupes preferred to perform on indoor stages. If members of a successful Commedia dell'Arte company were seen in a market square it could have been because they were trying to raise extra funds to pay for a trip to perform in another city or because they were showing a preview to a ticket performance in a private venue to try to convince audience members to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Disney executives had hoped that Mann's film would have the same commercial and critical success as All the President's Men, a film in the same vein. However, The Insider had limited appeal to younger moviegoers (studio executives reportedly said the prime audience was over the age of 40) and the subject matter was [...] "not notably dramatic," [...] according to marketing executives.

Subhash K. Jha also gave a 4/5 and said, [...] "Hrishida won't recognise this as his [...] "Khubsoorat". But he won't disapprove of what has been done to his work".

Andy Webster of the New York Times also wrote positively, saying [...] "Bollywood films have appropriated Hollywood genres and imagery for years, but Mr. Ghosh, using a pleasing pastel palette, deftly achieves a particularly Disney-like polish. And he avoids making-of-a-royal pitfalls: Ms. Kapoor’s character never abandons her humor for refinement. Twice, Mili says that she was raised to speak up for herself. Not a bad characteristic for a future Rajput princess".However, a critic at Bollywood Hungama disagreed and gave the film 2.5/5, and said, [...] "overall, Khoobsurat is likeable in parts with good performances and stunning visuals; however the weak script is an 'ugly' hurdle this film will face at the box-office".
