He was sentenced to 21 years of imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{under the influence of}} amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. He {{apparently}} lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E

5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out {{the terms of the}} treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire {{at the end of}} June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{able to control the}} interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, {{he worked as a}} custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|Michálek {{was born}} in Náchod in 1968. He {{graduated}} from high school in Přerov in 1987, and from Palacký University of Olomouc in 1992. He later studied in Masaryk University's management program, and received his MPA from Nottingham Trent University's executive program in 2010. After college, he worked as a UNIX programmer, business school teacher, and portfolio manager at an investment company. Michálek was a broker at the National Property Fund from 1994 to 1996, when he was fired after exposing a tunneling embezzlement scheme. The resulting court case <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> improperly dismissed. He was later involved in compensating victims of financial crime. Michálek served as a capital market supervisor at the Czech Ministry of Finance from 1997 to 1998, a director at the Czech Securities Commission from 1998 to 2006, a director at the Czech National Bank from 2006 to 2007, a senior consultant at the World Bank in 2007, and the chief financial market inspector at the Czech National Bank from 2008 to 2010.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, a mid-air {{collision}} occurred over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot of the upper Anson <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{able to control the}} interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E
50|$|The {{reports of}} Adiahénot's {{resignation}} produced {{a brief period}} of confusion, as Adiahénot did not confirm <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leaving the party. He then announced on 27 March, at celebrations marking the 42nd anniversary of the PDG's <b>founding,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> remaining a member of the PDG. Nevertheless, his future within the party was considered unclear, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer a member of the Political Bureau.|$|R

5|$|After {{a period}} of {{convalescence}} in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York. As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of Discovery. With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the Terra Nova for the second Discovery relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentinean corvette Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Nordenskiöld. In search of more permanent employment, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy, via the back-door route of the Supplementary List, but despite the sponsorship of Markham and {{of the president of}} the Royal Society, he was not successful. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the Royal Magazine, but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904. On 9 April 1904 he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward.|$|E

He spent ten months travelling through the colonies and acquainting himself with patriots.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first loss}} came {{when they had}} {{achieved}} an aggregate of fifty victories. On June 26th, the All-Blacks found themselves engaged with Richthofen's Jagdstaffel 11. Gerry Nash <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fighting two German pilots single-handed. One of the Germans was Lieutenant Karl Allmenröder, victor in some 30 air battles, and second only to Richthofen among the German pilots then in action. Nash's other opponent was Richthofen himself.|$|E

Under his leadership the school developed its art, theatre and music programmes, and he resisted higher student fees.|$|E
25|$|Having {{temporarily}} {{disposed of}} Hiller, Napoleon turned north with his main army against Archduke Charles. On 22 and 23 April, the Franco-Germans defeated Charles' army and forced it to withdraw {{to the north}} bank of the Danube.

Not knowing that Charles had been defeated, Hiller turned back upon his pursuer, defeating Bessières near Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. Once he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> alone on the south bank facing Napoleon's main army, Hiller retreated rapidly to the east {{in the direction of}} Vienna.|$|E
