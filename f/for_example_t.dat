5|$|Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab {{built their}} {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements {{as the air}} brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>T.</b> Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have also}} been moves to reduce the {{depiction}} of protagonists smoking in television shows, especially those aimed at children. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>Ted</b> Turner took steps to remove or edit scenes that depict characters [...] in cartoons such as Tom and Jerry, The Flintstones and Scooby-Doo, which are shown on his Cartoon Network and Boomerang television channels.|$|R
50|$|A vision can be political, religious, environmental, social, or {{technological}} in nature. By extension, {{a visionary}} {{can also be}} a person with a clear, distinctive, and specific (in some details) vision of the future, usually connected with advances in technology or social/political arrangements. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>Ted</b> Nelson is referred to as a visionary in connection with the Internet.|$|R
2500|$|Lawrence Summers, then {{president}} of Harvard University, also stated that [...] "erious and thoughtful people are advocating and taking actions that are anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent. <b>For</b> <b>example</b> ... <b>t</b> the same rallies where protesters, many of them university students, condemn the IMF and global capitalism and raise questions about globalization, {{it is becoming increasingly}} common to also lash out at Israel. Indeed, at the anti-IMF rallies last spring, chants were heard equating Hitler and Sharon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta {{has been}} {{arbitrarily}} indicated synonymous with typical yew, T. brevifolia (var. brevifolia); {{there are no}} studies to support this view. [...] Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different geographically ranges. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>T.</b> mairei var. speciosa, which occurs with the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected because “there is no geographic reason” for recognizing it even though it appears genetically distinct.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{change in}} the {{publishing}} industry from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century was the enormous growth of mass-produced books and magazines. Increasing commercial pressure to reduce the costs, complexity, and lead-time of printing deeply affected the industry, leading to a widening gap between commercial printing and fine printing. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>T.</b> S. Eliot's The Waste Land was originally published by a high-volume commercial printer according to its house rules {{and it was not}} until its third publication that Eliot was satisfied with its typesetting.

25|$|ASL, {{like other}} mature signed languages, makes {{extensive}} use of morphology. Many of ASL's affixes are combined simultaneously rather than sequentially. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>Ted</b> Supalla's seminal work on ASL verbs of motion revealed that these signs consist of many different affixes, articulated simultaneously according to complex grammatical constraints. This differs from the concatenative morphology of many spoken languages, which except for suprasegmental features such as tone are tightly constrained by the sequential nature of voice sounds.|$|R

2500|$|Other commentators, however, {{condemned}} Shvarts's {{project as}} a [...] "gruesome and pornographic idea" [...] that had been (mistakenly) confused with art. This included both pro-life and pro-choice organizations. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>Ted</b> Miller, {{a spokesperson for the}} abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America called the project [...] "offensive and insensitive to the women who have suffered the heartbreak of miscarriage," [...] and Wanda Franz, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, called the project [...] "depraved" [...] and described Shvarts as [...] "a serial killer." ...|$|R

Many of his works involve improvisation (<b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>t</b> a n E K (2013) with improvisational parts by Kommissar Hjuler and Mama Baer). Additionally, Hespos' music must often be performed without a conductor, putting even greater demands on the performers.|$|E
