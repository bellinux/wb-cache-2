25|$|As {{the premier}} cover {{illustrator}} for the enormously popular Saturday Evening Post {{for much of}} the first half of the 20th century, Leyendecker's work both reflected and helped mold many of the visual aspects of the era's culture in America. The mainstream image of Santa Claus as a jolly fat man in a red fur-trimmed coat was popularized by Leyendecker, as was the image of the New Year Baby. The tradition of giving flowers as a gift on Mother's Day was started by Leyendecker's May 30, 1914 Saturday Evening Post cover depicting a young bellhop carrying <b>hyacinths.</b> It was created as a commemoration of President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of Mother's Day as an official holiday that year.|$|E

500|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{aspect of}} more {{people coming to}} Florida {{proved to be an}} overwhelming problem. A woman living in a winter home near Palatka introduced water <b>hyacinths</b> (Eichhornia crassipes) to the St. Johns in an attempt to beautify her backyard. Ten years later, the purple-flowered <b>hyacinths</b> had grown to reside in [...] of the river and its arteries, becoming a serious invasive species. <b>Hyacinths</b> grow so densely that they prevent the navigation of watercraft, fishing, and sunlight from reaching the depths of the river, affecting both plant and animal life. The government of Florida found the plants to be so vexing that it spent almost $600,000 between 1890 and 1930 in an unsuccessful bid to rid the creeks and rivers of north Florida of them.|$|E

The objectives {{of this study were}} (I) to inve stigate whether the combined use of the two control agents produced a better effect in suppressing water <b>hyacinth</b> growth, (ii) to evaluate whether there is a change in oviposition and feeding habit of the chevroned water <b>hyacinth</b> weevil if the water <b>hyacinth</b> is seriously infected by A. eichhorniae, and (iii) to evaluate the progress of weevil establishment in the field. The following results were obtained: (1) The concentration of Tween 80 which did not interfere with spore germination was 3 %. (2) There was no difference between distilled water and 1 % Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) as a medium for fungal spores production. (3) The combined use of chevroned water <b>hyacinth</b> weevil and the water <b>hyacinth</b> blight produces a better suppressing on water <b>hyacinth</b> growth. (4) There was no significant effect of heavy infection by the water <b>hyacinth</b> blight on oviposition habit of chevroned water <b>hyacinth</b> weevil.

500|$|Garber {{compared}} the available price data on tulips to hyacinth {{prices at the}} beginning of the 19th century—when the hyacinth replaced the tulip as the fashionable flower—and found a similar pattern. When <b>hyacinths</b> were introduced florists strove with one another to grow beautiful hyacinth flowers, as demand was strong. However, as people became more accustomed to <b>hyacinths</b> the prices began to fall. The most expensive bulbs fell to 1 to 2percent of their peak value within 30years. Garber also notes that, [...] "a small quantity of prototype lily bulbs recently was sold for 1million guilders ($US480,000 at 1987 exchange rates)", demonstrating that even in the modern world, flowers can command extremely high prices. Because the rise in prices occurred after bulbs were planted for the year, growers would not have had an opportunity to increase production in response to price.|$|E

500|$|... "A Song for Simeon" [...] is not {{considered}} by scholars and critics {{to be one of}} Eliot's significant poems. It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period—"The Hollow Men" [...] (1925), written before his conversion; and [...] "The Journey of the Magi" [...] (1927), [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] (1930), and the later, more substantial Four Quartets (1943), written after his conversion. However, in [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith. Scofield states that the imagery of [...] "A Song for Simeon"—including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman <b>hyacinths</b> and the winter sun—conveys [...] "a sense of wonder and fragile new life". Robin Griffith-Jones draws a connection between Eliot's image of the feather to a statement by Hildegard of Bingen comparing herself [...] "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot's speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away".|$|E

500|$|Scholar Judith Farr {{notes that}} Dickinson, during her lifetime, [...] "was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, {{than as a}} poet". Dickinson studied botany {{from the age of}} nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead. During her lifetime, she {{assembled}} a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound herbarium. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the Linnaean system. The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun. Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered [...] "carpets of lily-of-the-valley and pansies, platoons of sweetpeas, <b>hyacinths,</b> enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of peony hedges and drifts of daffodils in season, marigolds to distraction—a butterfly utopia". In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she [...] "could inhabit the Spice Isles merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but [...] "they valued the posy more than the poetry".|$|E
