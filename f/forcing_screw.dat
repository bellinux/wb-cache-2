5000|$|Large {{frictional}} <b>forces</b> cause most <b>screws</b> {{in practical}} use to be [...] "self-locking", also called [...] "non-reciprocal" [...] or [...] "non-overhauling". This means that applying a torque to the shaft will {{cause it to}} turn, but no amount of axial load force against the shaft will cause it {{to turn back the}} other way, even if the applied torque is zero. This is in contrast to some other simple machines which are [...] "reciprocal" [...] or [...] "non locking" [...] which means if the load force is great enough they will move backwards or [...] "overhaul". Thus, the machine can be used in either direction. For example, in a lever, if the force on the load end is too large it will move backwards, doing work on the applied <b>force.</b> Most <b>screws</b> are designed to be self-locking, {{and in the absence of}} torque on the shaft will stay at whatever position they are left.

40|$|AbstractWe derive closed-form {{solutions}} to the mixed boundary value problem of a partially debonded rigid line inclusion penetrating a circular elastic inhomogeneity under antiplane shear deformation. The two tips of the rigid line inclusion are just mutual mirror images {{with respect to the}} inhomogeneity/matrix interface, and {{the upper part of the}} rigid line inclusion is debonded from the surrounding materials. By using conformal mapping and the method of image, closed-form solutions are derived for three loading cases: (i) the matrix is subjected to remote uniform stresses; (ii) the matrix is subjected to a line <b>force</b> and a <b>screw</b> dislocation; and (iii) the inhomogeneity is subjected to a line <b>force</b> and a <b>screw</b> dislocation. In the mapped ξ-plane, the solutions for all the three loading cases are interpreted in terms of image singularities. For the remote loading case, explicit full-field expressions of all the field variables such as displacement, stress function and stresses are obtained. Also derived is the near tip asymptotic elastic field governed by two generalized stress intensity factors. The generalized stress intensity factors for all the three loading cases are derived...|$|R
30|$|Abutment {{selection}} {{according to}} collar length index {{is a critical}} mechanical factor; selection of longer abutments leads to an increased vertical cantilever which acts as a force magnifier [8]. Vertical cantilever designs increase <b>forces</b> on <b>screws</b> due to the lever effect and, therefore, should be avoided [17, 18]. Although increased restorative vertical space with longer collar length could {{play a role in}} screw loosening, there is no certain evidence that increase in abutment collar length can affect screw loosening. However, considering the abutment height from implant platform to the top of abutment (including abutment collar), an increase in the collar length might result in an increase in the vertical cantilever. To reduce the possibility of screw loosening, reducing the cantilever length has been recommended [9].|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of this study, %RTL {{increased}} significantly with increasing collar length and the percentage of removal torque gaining after load with 0 ° abutments with collar height 4  mm was less than that of 2  mm. This finding matches what was found by Siadat et al. [9] who evaluated the effect of collar length on screw loosening and concluded that an increase in the abutment collar length significantly increase the torque loss of abutment–implant screw after cyclic loading. The abutment collar length acts as vertical cantilever, so increasing abutment collar would lead to an increased vertical cantilever which acts as a force magnifier [8]. Cantilever designs increase bending <b>forces</b> on <b>screws</b> due to the lever effect [17, 18].|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of jackscrews over some {{other types of}} jack {{is that they are}} self-locking, which means when the rotational <b>force</b> on the <b>screw</b> is removed, it will remain motionless where it was left and will not rotate backwards, regardless of how much load it is supporting. This makes them inherently safer than hydraulic jacks, for example, which will move backwards under load if the force on the hydraulic actuator is accidentally released.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{is devoted to}} the study of anisotropic bimaterials with Kelvin-type viscoelastic interface under antiplane deformations. First we derive the Green’s function for a bimaterial with a Kelvin-type viscoelastic interface subjected to an antiplane <b>force</b> and a <b>screw</b> dislocation by means of the complex variable method. Explicit expressions are derived for the time-dependent stress field induced by the antiplane <b>force</b> and <b>screw</b> dislocation. Also presented is the time-dependent image force acting on the screw dislocation due to its interaction with the Kelvin-type viscoelastic interface. Second we investigate a rectangular inclusion with uniform antiplane eigenstrains embedded in one of the two bonded anisotropic half-planes by virtue of the derived Green’s function for a line force. The explicit expressions for the time-dependent stress field induced by the rectangular inclusion are obtained in terms of the simple logarithmic and exponential integral functions. It is observed that in general the stresses exhibit the logarithmic singularity at the four corners of the rectangular inclusion. Our results also show that when one side of the rectangular inclusion lies on the viscoelastic interface, the interfacial tractions are still regular at the two corners of the inclusion which are located on the interface. Last we address a finite Griffith crack normal to the viscoelastic interface by means of the obtained Green’s function for a screw dislocation. The crack problem is formulated in terms of a resulting singular integral equation which is solved numerically. The time-dependent stress intensity factors at the two crack tips are obtained and some interesting features are discussed...|$|R
