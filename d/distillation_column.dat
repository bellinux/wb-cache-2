5|$|Changing the reflux (in {{combination}} {{with changes in}} feed and product withdrawal) {{can also be used}} to improve the separation properties of a continuous <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> while in operation (in contrast to adding plates or trays, or changing the packing, which would, at a minimum, require quite significant downtime).|$|E
5|$|Design and {{operation}} of a <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well. Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E
25|$|Membranes {{can also}} be used to {{separate}} ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.|$|E

25|$|Industrial towers use reflux {{to achieve}} a more {{complete}} separation of products. Reflux refers to {{the portion of the}} condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. Chemical engineers must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
500|$|This is {{what happens}} in a {{continuous}} <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b> A mixture is heated up, and routed into the <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b> [...] On entering the column, the feed starts flowing down but part of it, the component(s) with lower boiling point(s), vaporizes and rises. However, as it rises, it cools and while part of it continues up as vapor, some of it (enriched in the less volatile component) begins to descend again.|$|E
500|$|When a {{continuous}} <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is in operation, {{it has to}} be closely monitored for changes in feed composition, operating temperature and product composition. [...] Many of these tasks are performed using advanced computer control equipment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{theoretical}} plates in designing distillation processes {{has been discussed}} in many reference texts. Any physical device that provides good contact between the vapor and liquid phases present in industrial-scale <b>distillation</b> <b>columns</b> or laboratory-scale glassware <b>distillation</b> <b>columns</b> constitutes a [...] "plate" [...] or [...] "tray". Since an actual, physical plate can never be a 100% efficient equilibrium stage, the number of actual plates {{is more than the}} required theoretical plates.|$|R

500|$|The column can be fed in {{different}} ways. [...] If the feed {{is from a}} source at a pressure higher than the <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> pressure, it is simply piped into the column. Otherwise, the feed is pumped or compressed into the column. The feed may be a superheated vapor, a saturated vapor, a partially vaporized liquid-vapor mixture, a saturated liquid (i.e., liquid at its boiling point at the column's pressure), or a sub-cooled liquid. If the feed is a liquid {{at a much higher}} pressure than the column pressure and flows through a pressure let-down valve just ahead of the column, it will immediately expand and undergo a partial flash vaporization resulting in a liquid-vapor mixture as it enters the <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
500|$|If each {{physical}} tray or plate were 100% efficient, {{then the}} number of physical trays needed for a given separation would equal {{the number of}} equilibrium stages or theoretical plates. [...] However, that is very seldom the case. [...] Hence, a <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> needs more plates than the required number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages.|$|E
500|$|Another way of {{improving}} the separation in a <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> {{is to use a}} packing material instead of trays. [...] These offer the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), beneficial when operating under vacuum. [...] If a distillation tower uses packing instead of trays, the number of necessary theoretical equilibrium stages is first determined and then the packing height equivalent to a theoretical equilibrium stage, known as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP), is also determined. [...] The total packing height required is the number of theoretical stages multiplied by the HETP.|$|E
50|$|For high {{flow-rate}} applications, typically >15 MMSCFD, cryogenic processing is the norm. This is a {{distillation process}} which utilizes the different volatilities of methane (boiling point of −161.6 °C) and nitrogen (boiling point of −195.69 °C) to achieve separation. In this process, {{a system of}} compression and <b>distillation</b> <b>columns</b> drastically reduces {{the temperature of the}} gas mixture to a point where methane is liquified and the nitrogen is not. For smaller applications, a series of heat exchangers may be used as an alternative to <b>distillation</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|R

50|$|The term reflux is very {{widely used}} in {{industries}} that utilize large-scale <b>distillation</b> <b>columns</b> and fractionators such as petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, and natural gas processing plants.|$|R
500|$|An {{alternative}} to continuous distillation is batch distillation, where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column.|$|E

Fouling occurs on the crude side of these exchangers due to asphaltene insolubility. The nature of asphaltene solubility in crude oil was successfully modeled by Wiehe and Kennedy. The precipitation of insoluble asphaltenes in crude preheat trains has been successfully modeled as a first order reaction by Ebert and Panchal who expanded {{on the work of}} Kern and Seaton.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{popularized by}} von Liebig thus {{consisted}} of an inner, straight tube {{surrounded by an}} outer straight tube, with the outer tube having ports for fluid inflow and outflow, and with the two tubes sealed in some fashion at the ends (eventually, by a blown glass ring seal). Its simplicity made it convenient to construct and inexpensive to manufacture, the higher heat capacity of the circulating water (vs. air) allowed for maintaining near to constant temperature in the condenser, and so the Liebig type {{proved to be the}} more efficient condenser—capable of condensing liquid from a much greater flow of incoming vapor—and therefore replaced retorts and air condensers. An added benefit of the simplicity of the straight inner tube design of this condenser type is that it can be [...] "packed" [...] with materials that increase the surface area (and so the number of theoretical plates of the <b>distillation</b> <b>column,</b> see section below), e.g., plastic, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc. [...] See Fractional Distillation.|$|E

30|$|Vapor {{recompression}} {{and bottom}} flashing {{are among the}} developed technologies for enhancing energy efficiency of distillation processes. In this paper, a novel configuration of bottom flashing system is proposed for enhancing energy efficiency of dual columns such as direct distillation sequences. The system is designed to operate between two <b>distillation</b> <b>columns.</b> The proposed system engages two separate <b>distillation</b> <b>columns,</b> both {{of which can be}} wide boiling systems. The system incorporates two interacting bottom flashing systems that engage the two <b>distillation</b> <b>columns</b> through heat transfer from the top product of the second column to the bottom product of the first column which in turn results in elimination/reduction of utility requirements of condenser of the second column along with reboiler of the first column. Based on the results of this study, compared to conventional direct sequence distillation, 40.3 % reduction in energy requirements and 20.7 % reduction total annual costs of the process can be obtained through application of the proposed system.|$|R
2500|$|In 1868 Bloede {{secured a}} {{position}} at Chemical Works, a small chemical company in Brooklyn, New York, along the Gowanus creek canal. There he began to study chemical manufacturing and pharmaceutical preparations. [...] In 1873 Bloede moved to Pomeroy, Ohio, the center of salt manufacturing along the Ohio River. [...] He joined the Oakes & Rathbone Company in Parkersburg, West Virginia, [...] which produced sulfuric acid for the bromine distillers in the region. The plant was located {{on the south side}} of the Little Kanawha River a tributary of the Ohio River. Oakes left the firm in 1875 and Bloede acquired his interests, the company became known as Bloede & Rathbone. [...] The product line was extended to iron sulfate, iron nitrate, tin salts, mordants and other chemicals used mainly by the textile industry. Bloede's familiarity with the textile industry led to the idea of manufacturing aniline dyes to increase profits. [...] At the time most dyes were imported from Germany. [...] There were only two companies producing dyes in the U.S. Bloede was determined to manufacture aniline by nitrating benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction. One problem he faced was to purify benzene from the light tar oils, which was supplied in barrels by coal tar distilleries and gas plants. Lacking a <b>distillation</b> <b>column,</b> he used an old boiler shell connected with a condensing coil but the benzene quality was poor.|$|E
