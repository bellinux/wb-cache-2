This study was conducted in the musk deer farm of Xinglongshan National Nature Reserve, Gansu province of China from June 2004 to January 2005. The focal sampling and all occurrence recording was used to observe the behaviors of 38 female alpine musk deer (Moschus sifanicus) in which 5 were barren <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> and 33 females were bred <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b> The durations of 12 behaviors such as environment-sniffing, etc. were recorded and the behavioral patterns were compared to explore the differences. The results showed that compared to females barren <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> the females bred <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> was more active, pugnacious and explorative in mating season and expressed less self-directed behavior during non-mating season. The data from the present study should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} behavioral differences between females with different reproduction success...|$|R

The basic methods research used was explanatory. The analysis tool used is multiple linear regression on function of supply with directly approach to the volume of production. F test result showed that all of variables which had been researched had have real impact together on supply of gogo paddy in Karanganyar regency T test individual result showed that variable {{of the price of}} rice <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> the production of gogo paddy <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> the price of corn <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> the price of soybean <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> the price of urea fertilizer by the cultivation year, and the price of KCl fertilizer by the cultivation year individually had have real impact on supply of gogo paddy in Karanganyar regency. The elasticity of supply of gogo paddy in Karanganyar regency is inelastic for variable of price of paddy <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> the production of gogo paddy <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> and the price of soybean in previoud year.
