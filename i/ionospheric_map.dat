The map was validated and demonstrated for practical application, since a significant aim of the project was to make the map as applicable as possible. It is hoped that the map will find immense application in HF radio communication industries, research industries, aviation industries, and other industries that make use of Earth-Space systems.

An <b>ionospheric</b> <b>map</b> is a computer program that is able to display spatial and temporal representations of ionospheric parameters such as, electron density and critical plasma frequencies, for every geographical location on the map. The purpose of this development was to make the most optimum use of all available data sources, namely ionosondes, satellites and models, and to implement error minimisation techniques in order to obtain the best result at any given location on the African continent. The focus was placed on the accurate estimation of three upper atmosphere parameters which are important for radio communications: critical frequency of the F 2 layer (foF 2), Total Electron Content (TEC) and the maximum usable frequency over a distance of 3000 km (M 3000 F 2). The results show that AIM provided a more accurate estimation of the three parameters than the internationally recognised and recommended ionosphere model (IRI- 2012) when used on its own. Therefore, the AIM is a more accurate solution than single independent data sources for applications requiring ionospheric mapping over the African continent...|$|E

30|$|In this contribution, an {{adaptive}} autoregressive model is proposed and developed to predict global ionospheric vertical {{total electron content}} maps (VTEC). Specifically, the spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients are predicted based on the autoregressive model, and {{the order of the}} autoregressive model is determined adaptively using the F-test method. To test our method, final CODE and IGS global <b>ionospheric</b> <b>map</b> (GIM) products, as well as altimeter TEC data during low and mid-to-high solar activity period collected by JASON, are used to evaluate the precision of our forecasting products. Results indicate that the predicted products derived from the model proposed in this paper have good consistency with the final GIMs in low solar activity, where the annual mean of the root-mean-square value is approximately 1.5 TECU. However, the performance of predicted vertical TEC in periods of mid-to-high solar activity has less accuracy than that during low solar activity periods, especially in the equatorial ionization anomaly region and the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, in comparison with forecasting products, the final IGS GIMs have the best consistency with altimeter TEC data. Future work is needed to investigate the performance of forecasting products using the proposed method in an operational environment, rather than using the SH coefficients from the final CODE products, to understand the real-time applicability of the method.|$|E
30|$|A major error {{component}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) is the ionospheric delay. Ionopspheric error {{can be reduced}} by a dual frequency receiver using a linear combination technique {{that can not be}} applied with a single frequecy receiver. However, an accurate ionospheric error modeling for single-frequency receiver is required. Due to the nonlinearity of the ionospheric error, a highly nonlinear wavelet network (WN) method is proposed in this paper. The main objective of the paper is to develop a short-term prediction model based on a short dataset. Therefore, five GPS stations with five days of ionospheric datasets along with time and location were employed to develop the proposed WN-based ionospheric model. Four days of datasets were employed to develop the model and one day of dataset was employed to test the prediction accuracy. To validate the WN-based ionospheric model, a comparison was made between the developed WN-based ionospheric model and the CODE, JPL and IGS Global <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Map</b> (GIM) models. It is shown that the Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) errors of the developed WN-based ionospheric model are 2.51 TECU, 2.75 TECU and 2.50 TECU (Total Electronic Content Unit) with percentage errors of about 3.4 %, 3.8 % and 3.4 % when compared with the CODE, JPL and IGS GIM models.|$|E

These measurements are obtained from more than 60 world-wide GPS stations which continuously receive dual-frequency signals. Based on the delays of the signals, we have generated high resolution global <b>ionospheric</b> <b>maps</b> (GIM) of TEC at 15 minute intervals. Using a differential method comparing storm time maps with quiet time maps, we find that significant TEC increases (the positive effect) are the major feature in the winter hemisphere during this storm (the maximum percent change relative to quiet times is about 150 percent) ...|$|R
