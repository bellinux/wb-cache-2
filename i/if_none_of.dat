5|$|<b>If</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> {{the contestants}} in a quarter-final or semi-final game {{end with a}} {{positive}} score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead. This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E

No, no, Friedel, strike by my side, and I will strike with thee; pray by my side, and I will pray with thee; but <b>if</b> thou takest <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the strokes, then will I <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the prayers!" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> {{these options}} is available, jen {{may be used}} as a placeholder: amas becomes jenas am’. The choice of where the tense suffix ends up is largely a stylistic choice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Muruzi House {{acquired}} {{the reputation of}} being one of the Russian capital's new cultural centers. Guests recognized and admired the hostess's authority and her talent for leadership, even <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them found her particularly warm or affectionate.|$|E
25|$|Bigamy is the act {{of marrying}} one person while already being married to another, and is legally {{prohibited}} in most countries in which monogamy is the cultural norm. Some bigamy statutes are broad enough to potentially encompass polyamorous relationships involving cohabitation, even <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the participants claim marriage {{to more than one}} partner.|$|E
5000|$|If {{more than}} one player has a brélan, the best is one that matches the rank of the turn up (a brelan carré, or [...] "squared-up brelan"). <b>If</b> <b>none</b> matches, that <b>of</b> highest rank wins. Any player with a brelan {{receives}} a side-payment of one chip, two {{if it is a}} carré, from each opponent.|$|R
50|$|People occupationally {{exposed to}} endrin may {{experience}} abnormal EEG readings even <b>if</b> they exhibit <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the clinical symptoms, possibly due to {{injury to the}} brain stem. These readings show bilateral synchronous theta waves with synchronous spike-and-wave complexes. EEG readings {{can take up to}} one month to return to normal.|$|R
50|$|Each tile can {{be placed}} so that it touches any tile that is down {{or one of the}} special colour start cells. A player may change his rack <b>if</b> he has <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the colours of which he has the fewest points in, {{otherwise}} a player's rack is replenished {{at the end of his}} turn.|$|R
25|$|Scoring. Score {{each element}} {{from left to}} right, top to bottom in the matrix, {{considering}} the outcomes of substitutions (diagonal scores) or adding gaps (horizontal and vertical scores). <b>If</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the scores are positive, this element gets a 0. Otherwise the highest score is used {{and the source of}} that score is recorded.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} of {{a linear}} system are independent <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the equations {{can be derived}} algebraically from the others. When the equations are independent, each equation contains new information about the variables, and removing any of the equations increases {{the size of the}} solution set. For linear equations, logical independence is the same as linear independence.|$|E
25|$|The first font {{specified}} is {{the preferred}} font. If this font is not available, the Web browser attempts to use the next font in the list. <b>If</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the fonts specified are found, the browser displays its default font. This same process also happens on a per-character basis if the browser tries to display a character not present in the specified font.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Cushing voiced {{the opinion}} of the company when she said: [...] "When a person has no heirs, {{relatives}} ought to be considered first, but <b>if</b> there are <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these, or <b>if</b> they aren't suitable, then friends should come in. Of course, I mean the oldest and best friends of the party without heirs." ...|$|R
60|$|Men {{without their}} wives are escorted {{to a large}} chamber, the floor of which is usually of white marble or heavy glass, kept {{scrupulously}} clean.

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the two numbers has a hundreds-digit then {{if there}} is no carry digit then the {{addition}} algorithm has finished. If there is a carry digit (carried over from the tens-column) then write it in the hundreds-column under the line, and the algorithm is finished. When the algorithm finishes, the number under the line is the sum of the two numbers.|$|E
25|$|Prefixes are {{mutually}} exclusive and are {{selected based on}} the following rule: {{if one of the}} participants is second person, the second person prefix is used; if not, if one of the participants is the first person, then the first person prefix is used; <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these applies, other forms, if they take a prefix, take the third person prefix. This is the well-known Algonquian 2-1-3 precedence rule.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Education (DepEd) is in {{constant}} coordination with CHED and DOLE {{on the actual}} number of affected faculty from private higher education institutions (HEIs). The worst-case scenario is that 39,000 HEI faculty will lose their jobs over 5 years. This will only happen <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the HEIs will put up their own Senior High Schools; however, DepEd is currently processing over 1,000 Senior High School applications from private institutions.|$|E
30|$|The {{border between}} {{uncertain}} knowledge and knowledge gaps {{seemed to be}} fluent. In some reviews, one aspect was found under the term ‘knowledge gap’; in others it is stated that {{there are at least}} a few data. A topic was categorized as a knowledge gap <b>if</b> in <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the reviews any studies with concrete results concerning this issue were mentioned, and 67 % (six studies) of the authors discussed such knowledge gaps in contrast to <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the authors in the research papers. As knowledge gaps, the form, route, and mass of released nanoparticles, the fate of embedded nanoparticles, and their behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations and in environmentally relevant forms were mentioned.|$|R

50|$|The TV format was a panel-style program, where five Finnish celebrities {{appeared}} in sound-proof booths {{and try to}} guess a word based on a clue from one contestant. The clue giver and the correct guessers are awarded points. The awarded points-sum decreases the more correct guesses there are. <b>If</b> all or <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the contestants guess the word, the clue giver receives minus points.|$|R
25|$|Internet Explorer was {{the first}} browser to support web fonts through the @font-face rule, but only {{supported}} the Embedded OpenType (EOT) format, and lacked support for parts of the CSS3 fonts module. Internet Explorer 9 completed support for the CSS3 fonts module and added WOFF support. It is {{the first version of}} Internet Explorer to support TTF fonts, but will only use them <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> their embedding permission bits are set.|$|E
25|$|Representing {{the input}} {{in the context}} of {{previous}} inputs: If one or more cells in the active column are in the predictive state (see below), they will be the only cells to become active in the current time step. <b>If</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the cells in the active column are in the predictive state (during the initial time step or when the activation of this column was not expected), all cells are made active.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in both {{alternative}} concepts, {{the system}} will not survive due to the internal competition among its constituents. Even <b>if</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the constituents of such a system is selectively favoured, which potentially allows coexistence {{of all of the}} coupled molecules, they are not able to coevolve and optimize their properties. In consequence, the system loses its internal stability and cannot live on. The reason for inability to survive is the lack of mutual control of constituent abundances.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, Hercules, Inc., {{also made}} solid-fuel rocket motors for {{hundreds}} of the U.S. Army's Honest John missile, a mobile tactical missile for carrying tactical nuclear weapons for U.S. Army divisions. The Honest John missile was mostly deployed with the U.S. Seventh Army in West Germany {{as part of the}} American commitment to NATO to defend Western Europe against aggression from the Warsaw Pact, using nuclear weapons on Eastern Europe, <b>if</b> necessary. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> the Honest John, Minuteman, Polaris, or Poseidon has ever been used in combat, and the threat of nuclear war has been sufficient to deter aggression and make it unnecessary to use nuclear weapons for defense.|$|R
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{following}} rigidity results. Coarse equivalences between metrically complete Euclidean buildings preserve thick spherical buildings at infinity. If all irreducible factors have rank at least two, then coarsely equivalent Euclidean buildings are isometric (up to scaling factors); <b>if</b> in addition <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the irreducible factors is a Euclidean cone, then the isometry {{is unique and}} has finite distance from the coarse equivalence.
