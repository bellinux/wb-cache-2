40|$|Fat globule {{membranes}} {{have been}} isolated from bovine colostrum and bovine milk by the dispersion {{of the fat}} in sucrose solutions at 4 ~ and fractionation by centrifugation through discontinuous sucrose gradients. The morphology and enzymic characteristics of the separated fractions were examined. Fractions comprising {{a large proportion of}} the total extracted membrane were thus obtained having high levels of the Golgi marker enzymes UDP-galactose N-acetylglucosamine fl- 4 -galactosyltransferase and thiamine pyrophosphatase. A membrane-derived form of the galactosyltransferase has been solubilized from fat and purified to homogeneity. This enzyme is larger in molecular weight than previously studied soluble galactosyltransferases, but resembles in size the galactosyltransferase of lactating mammary Golgi membranes. In contrast, when fat globule membranes were prepared by traditional procedures, which involved washing the fat at higher temperatures, before extraction, galactosyltransferase was not present in the membranes, having been <b>released</b> <b>int...</b>|$|R

Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement or recommendation for use. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive inventory and overview of sources and environmental releases of dioxin-like compounds in the United States. The major identified sources of environmental releases of dioxin-like compounds are grouped into six broad categories: combustion sources, metals smelting, refining and process sources, chemical manufacturing sources, natural sources, and environmental reservoirs. Estimates of annual releases to land, air, and water are presented for each source category and summarized for reference years 1987, 1995, and 2000. The quantitative results are {{expressed in terms of}} the toxicity equivalence (TEQ) of the mixture of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (CDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (CDF) compounds present in environmental releases using a procedure sanctioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998.

40|$|This Technical Paper is {{the first}} in a series being {{developed}} by WWF-Guianas Regional Program Office as an information sharing service to increase awareness of key conservation issues in the Guianas and foster the general public interest in taking corrective actions. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the natural ecosystems of the Guianas continues to play their role to sustain the region’s biological diversity, cultural enrichment and socio-economic development. Goldmining plays a significant economic role in the Guianas, yet the rudimentary nature of small to medium scale gold mining activities often generates a legacy of extensive degradation and deplorable social-conditions, both during and after activities have ceased. This form of mining usually involves the extraction of secondary gold from placer deposits (alluvial, colluvial or elluvial), which can be liberated and treated using gravity methods. In the Guianas, the most popular form of small-scale gold mining is referred to as “land dredging”, a combination of hydraulicking and suction dredging. This method requires application of large volumes of water for both mining and mineral processing; in most cases, there are no containment structures for the waste tailings generated. Mercury, a dangerous pollutant, is the preferred method employed by small-scale miners for gold recovery. Gold extraction using mercury is comprised of the following four stages: 1) amalgamation, 2) separation of amalgamation, 3) removal of excess mercury, and 4) burning of the remaining amalgam to produce a gold sponge.

We measured (1) steroid-induced altera-tions in endogenous gonad otropin-rel easing hormone (GnRH) from sequential 10 -mm samples of hypothalamic perfusates, (2) simultaneous changes in peripheral plasma luteinizing hormone (LII) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and (3) the modification 0 /pituitary responsiveness, i. e., increments in plasma LH (LH) and plasma FSH (L FSH), after 50 ng, 250 ng, and 1 jig of exogenous GnRH in individual does of 6 treatment groups. The groups were: INT does, OVEX does, OVEX does receiving either one (1 E 2) or two (2 E 2) E 2 -filled Silastic capsules, OVEX does receiving a 2 OctOH-filled capsule (2 OaOH), and OVEX does receiving both capsules of E 2 and 2 OaOH (1 E 2 + 2 OaOH). Ovariectomy enhanced the pulsatile release 0 /hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary LH and FSH, and increased the LH response (t LH) to exogenous GnRH (0 VEX vs. INT, p< 0. O 5). Replacement of E 2 {{at the time of}} ovariectomy prevented the increased GnRH and gonadotropin secretion as well as the enhanced t LH that were observed in untreated OVEX does.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{ischemia}} and reperfusion (I/R) {{injury in}} a hemihepatectomy model in pigs after prolonged {{continuous or intermittent}} vascular inflow occlusion in the liver. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Massive intraoperative blood loss during liver resections can be prevented by temporary vascular inflow occlusion, consequently leading to ischemia and reperfusion injury in the remnant liver. Previously, in a pig liver resection model in which only limited I/R injury was induced during brief (90 min) vascular inflow occlusion, the authors demonstrated reduced I/R injury after continuous (CNT) occlusion, compared to intermittent (INT). This liver resection study on pigs was undertaken to assess I/R injury after prolonged (120 min) CNT or INT occlusion. METHODS: In pigs (37. 0 +/- 1. 5 kg), liver ischemia during 2 hours was CNT (n = 6) or INT (n = 6) (eight subsequent periods of 12 min ischemia and 3 min recirculation), followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. A left hemihepatectomy (45. 5 % +/- 1. 4 %) was performed within the first 12 minutes of ischemia. No hepatic pedicle clamping or liver resection was performed in control experiments (n = 6). Microvascular damage was assessed by hyaluronic acid (HA) uptake capacity of the liver (parameter of early sinusoidal endothelial cell damage) and restoration of intrahepatic tissue pO 2 during reperfusion. Hepatocellular damage was tested by plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). RESULTS: Hyaluronic acid uptake after 6 hours of reperfusion, compared to preischemic uptake, was unaltered in the control group, but was significantly reduced in both resection groups. However, more HA was taken up after INT occlusion, compared to CNT (60. 4 % +/- 5. 6 % and 39. 5 % +/- 3. 7 %, respectively; ANOVA: p = 0. 001). Intrahepatic tissue pO 2 distribution after 6 hours of reperfusion more closely returned to preischemic configuration in the INT group than in the CNT group, indicating reduced microcirculatory disturbances after <b>INT</b> occlusion. <b>Release</b> of AST and LDH after 6 hours of reperfusion was significantly increased in both CNT and INT groups. Lower AST levels, however, were found after INT occlusion than after CNT occlusion (267. 0 +/- 74. 7 U/l and 603. 3 +/- 132. 4 U/l, respectively; p = 0. 06). CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent hepatic vascular inflow occlusion during prolonged liver ischemia in pigs resulted in less microcirculatory and hepatocellular injury, compared to continuous occlusion. Intermittent clamping is preferable when prolonged periods of vascular inflow occlusion are applied during liver resection...|$|R
40|$|Single rat neurointermediate lobes (n. i. l. s) {{were fixed}} by their stalks to a {{platinum}} wire clip electrode and incubated in oxygenated Krebs-HEPES medium. Vasopressin <b>release</b> <b>int</b> the medium {{was determined by}} radioimmunoassay. Vasopressin secretion was increased by different stimuli {{and the effects of}} gadolinium (Gd 3 +) were tested. Electrical stimulation (15 Hz, three times 1 min with 1 min intervals) increased vasopressin release in a calcium-dependent manner. Gd 3 + (10 microM to 3 mM) inhibited the evoked release of vasopressin in a concentration-dependent fashion; at 3 mM the inhibition was 98 %. The inhibitory effect of Gd 3 + up to 300 microM was antagonized by increasing the calcium concentration in the medium up to 6 mM. The effects of 1 and 3 mM-Gd 3 + were unaffected by increasing the calcium concentration. Exposure of n. i. l. s to depolarizing concentrations of potassium (high K+, 60 mM, 30 min) increased the vasopressin release more than 33 -fold. The elevated vasopressin release remained constant during six consecutive 5 min periods. In the initial 5 min period 300 microM-Gd 3 + reduced the evoked vasopressin release by 80 % but during the last 5 min period only by 30 %. At 3 mM-Gd 3 + vasopressin release was completely blocked during the whole time of incubation with high K+. Vasopressin release induced by exposure of n. i. l. s to cold (4 degrees C, 20 min) was completely inhibited by 3 mM-Gd 3 +, but reduced by only 25 % in the presence of 300 microM-Gd 3 +. Vasopressin release induced by incubation of n. i. l. s with the ionophore X- 537 A (lasalocid) (10 microM, 30 min) was reduced by 90 % in the presence of 300 microM-Gd 3 + and completely prevented by 3 mM-Gd 3 +. 300 microM-Gd 3 +, added to the incubation medium, had no significant effect on the vasopressin release from crude synaptosomal preparations evoked by high K+. However, when 300 microM-Gd 3 + was already present during the tissue homogenization, the evoked vasopressin release from the synaptosomes was completely blocked. It is concluded that Gd 3 + inhibits exocytotic vasopressin release at two different sites. First, Gd 3 + may block voltage-regulated calcium channels. Secondly, Gd 3 + may inhibit the exocytotic release mechanism by an intracellular site of action. It is speculated that contractile proteins may be the intracellular target for Gd 3 +...|$|R
40|$|In {{selective}} laser sintering (SLS) and {{selective laser}} melting (SLM) a laser beam is used to partially (SLS) or completely (SLM) melt particles in a layer of powders [1]. With subsequent increments of powder layers {{it is possible to}} create three dimensional structures. This technique can be used in prototyping applications able to produce customized objects of predetermined shape. With SLS it is possible to process not only plastics but also ceramics and metals, therefore it appears to be particularly suited to build three dimensional scaffolds made of biocompatible materials, such as titanium oxide and hydroxyapatite to be used in biomedical applications [2, 3]. In SLS techniques increasing the energy transferred by laser increases the strength of the structure obtained, but it also produces a volume contraction of the sintered material which reduces the precision of the final object [4]. Since the energy required for sintering depends on the particle size. The use of smaller particles allows the use of smaller sintering energies and therefore the production of complex and more precise structures due to reduced melting [5] In this paper mixtures of powders with different particle size distributions of biocompatible materials has been obtained by mixing a coarser grained powder, with particles in the range between 10 and 100 microns, and a finer grained powder, with particles in the submicron range. By optimal combination of the powder laying procedure and of the powder mixtures granular distribution it has been possible to obtain scaffold specimens with the two materials. The equipment used is a home-made three dimensional laser sintering equipment using a 40 W CO 2 laser beam. The density and the mechanical resistance of the specimens are studied {{as a function of the}} fines content and of the amount of energy released by the laser beam on the unit surface of the lighted area. A simple model approach is used to estimate the strength of the single sintered contact. References [1] Tang, Y., Fuh, J. Y. H., Loh, H. T., Wong, Y.
