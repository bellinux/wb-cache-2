Compulsory school attendance is usually justified by reference to the argument that minors are incapable of making sufficiently reasoned choices. However, the 16-18 age group falls into a <b>grey</b> <b>area,</b> being regarded as effectively adult {{in a number of}} contexts. Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Scotland), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.|$|E

25|$|The {{underside}} {{is black}} with {{and on the}} base of the cell in the forewing is an elongate spot of dark red; the postdiscal transverse series of streaks as on the upperside but grey tinged with ochraceous and extended right up to the costa; in some specimens similar but narrow streaks also in the cell. Hindwing with five irregular small patches of red at base, the outer three-fourths of the wing grey touched with ochraceous, but generally narrower than the blue on the upperside; the inner margin of the <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> crosses the wing beyond the cell; the postdiscal and subterminal black spots as on the upperside. In some specimens this <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> is greatly restricted, its inner margin crossing the wing well beyond the apex of the cell; the subterminal spots merged completely with the terminal spots and form a comparatively broad terminal black band. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen blackish brown.|$|E
25|$|Speakers' judgements of the well-formedness of {{sentences}} form a continuous spectrum. While many grammaticality judgements are categorical, with a given sentence judged as either 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', {{there are many}} sentences that fall in a <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> of partial acceptability. According to Jon Sprouse (2007), the difference between grammaticality and acceptability is that grammatical knowledge is categorical, but acceptability is a gradient scale.|$|E

25|$|Currently, such depictions {{are in a}} legal <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> due {{to parts}} of the PROTECT Act being ruled unconstitutional on a federal level; however, laws {{regulating}} lolicon and shotacon differ between states; several states have laws that explicitly prohibit cartoon pornography and similar depictions (such as video games {{in the state of}} New Jersey), while others usually have only vague laws on such content; in some states, such as California, such depictions specifically do not fall under state child pornography laws, while the state of Utah explicitly bans it.|$|E

25|$|Before 2010, {{the usage}} of PGD was in a legal <b>grey</b> <b>area.</b> In 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that PGD {{can be used in}} {{exceptional}} cases. On 7 July 2011, the Bundestag passed a law that allows PGD in certain cases. The procedure may only be used when there is a strong likelihood that parents will pass on a genetic disease, or when there is a high genetic chance of a stillbirth or miscarriage. On 1 February 2013, the Bundesrat approved a rule regulating how PGD can be used in practice.|$|E
25|$|This {{effect of}} {{descending}} inhibition {{can be shown}} by electrically stimulating the periaqueductal <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> of the midbrain. The periaqueductal grey in turn projects to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the nucleus raphes magnus which also receives similar afferents from the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NPG). In turn the nucleus raphe magnus projects to the substantia gelatinosa region of the dorsal horn and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. The periaqueductal grey also contains opioid receptors which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as morphine and diacetylmorphine exhibit an analgesic effect.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} contribution made by Swaminatha Iyer {{is in the}} realm of Tamil music.

During the previous four centuries, Telugu and Sanskrit dominated the music scene in Tamil Nadu {{in the absence of any}} valuable information on Tamil music. Swaminatha Iyer's publications threw light on the presence of Tamil music in the earlier centuries and paved the way for serious research on the subject. As the son of a famous musician of his time, Swaminatha Iyer learnt music from Gopalakrishna Bharathi, a musical exponent and the author of Nandan Sarithiram.|$|E

25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale until you reach production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing a dozen or more workers.|$|E

Each power car has a large Acela Sea Turtle Fin logo near the rear, and a smaller one near the cab. The cars do not have the blue roof line, however each car has a series of Sea Turtle Fins, or Splotches, which vary in shape, color, and positioning depending on the class of car it is (Business Class, Cafe Bistro, and First Class).|$|E
25|$|While the {{enforcement}} in theory {{could lead to}} a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of Look to Windward relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent's mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU <b>Grey</b> <b>Area).</b> At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (Look To Windward).|$|E

25|$|The exact {{impact of}} the treaty on the {{functioning}} of the EU left many questions open (uncertainties which have led to calls for another new treaty in response to the economic crisis in the late 2000s). When its impact is assessed, the biggest winners from Lisbon have been Parliament, with its increase in power, and the European Council. The first months under Lisbon have arguably seen a shift in power and leadership from the Commission, the traditional motor of integration, to the European Council with its new full-time and longer-term President. The split between the Commission and European Council presidents involved overlap, potential rivalry and unwieldy compromises, such as both presidents attending international summits, in theory each with their own responsibilities, but inevitably with a considerable <b>grey</b> <b>area.</b> There was some expectation that the posts may be merged, as allowed under new treaty, in 2014 when their two mandates expired.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} given to Top FM, Rama Valayden noted several <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> in this case; only {{the idea of}} strangulation was taken into consideration {{and there is a}} possibility that the police took the wrong path, the moment that the crime took place, that is when the door was open by the magnetic card, the suspect Sandeep Moonea was on a phone conversation with his sister according the Mauritius Telecom, a belt which was later found in the room was not analyse by police, the suitcase of the victim was found outside the room, the bathtub was displace before being analysed, several clues and accessed to the room was not protected. Rama also made a profile of John McAreavey whom he claim is very intelligent, John said that he was on his phone while waiting for the victim but his phone was not even analyse by the police, there was 117 contradictions in statements given by John including the times, John is not favorable to a second autopsy which could be crucial, the footage of the CCTV cameras was deleted.|$|E
25|$|As {{the time}} for voting on the budget approached, Livingstone {{discovered}} that instead of the outright illegality involved in resolving {{not to make a}} rate, the other councils were planning to exploit the legal <b>grey</b> <b>area</b> of refusing to make a rate for the time being. This strategy would put them in a different position to the GLC and ILEA who would be illegal immediately. Budget papers prepared by the Director-General Maurice Stonefrost then revealed that the capping limit still allowed the council to increase spending substantially; the papers were circulated to all members of the GLC on 1 March. A long and acrimonious debate at a Labour group meeting on 4 March agreed by 24 votes to 18 to support the legal budget with its £25m in growth. The GLC Labour group split into three factions, with one group of 10 under John McDonnell insistent on not setting a rate, another of 8 under Ken Livingstone willing to defy the law but also to accept a budget at the cap if that stance failed, and a third group unwilling to support any illegal budgeting.|$|E
