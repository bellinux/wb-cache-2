5|$|With few teams, but a long history, it is {{inevitable}} that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football. Far and away the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E
5|$|The Meridian Council for the Arts (MCA) {{was founded}} as Meridian's and Lauderdale County's {{official}} arts agency in 1978. MCA operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual Threefoot Festival, several workshops, {{and other special}} events each year.

Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South's oldest subscription-based community theatres, was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over 22,000 guests each season, making it Mississippi's most-attended community theatre. The Meridian Symphony Orchestra (MSO) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963. In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist, Elena Nikolaidi, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> orchestra since 1991. The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman.|$|E

25|$|The 1972 {{series was}} as good and tough an Ashes series as there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{possible}} exception of 2005). The seasoned pros of England in Boycott, Edrich, D'Oliveira, Illingworth himself, Underwood and Snow faced the upcoming young Australians (Ian and Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Doug Walters) who would dominate for the middle part of the decade. The series was drawn 2–2 but included tight games at Headingley and particularly the Oval, where the match lasted almost six days with Australia chasing 242 with only 4 wickets in hand.|$|E

The ECHL team brought a major change of the entire costume, most notably the skin, which turned a bright yellow compared to a shade of brown in previous years. Furthermore, rather than continuing the more lifelike version of previous years, the ECHL's version chose to make a more cartoonish version of Rocky. The 2007–08 ECHL Season coincided with Rocky's 40th year of service, which was by far the oldest mascot in the history of any pro sports team in Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Much of CNBC's on-air talent <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{network for}} some time: Sue Herera and Scott Cohn joined CNBC at its inception, and {{remain on the}} air co-hosting Power Lunch and as senior {{correspondent}} respectively. Some personalities who joined CNBC from FNN in 1991, such as Bill Griffeth and Joe Kernen, are also still with the channel. The network has of late sought to increase the profile of its on-air team with the launch of rival business channel Fox Business Network – although CNBC's best known personality, Closing Bell host Maria Bartiromo, made regular appearances on other NBC News broadcasts such as The Today Show and anchored the syndicated Wall Street Journal Report before she left for Fox Business Channel. Other CNBC hosts such as Jim Cramer have also been used increasingly across NBC's output.|$|E
