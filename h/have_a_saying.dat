2500|$|Simeulue was not {{the tragedy}} many {{government}} officials feared despite its proximity to the quake epicenter. Only five of the 70,000 villagers on Simeulue were killed, {{all of them in}} the earthquake that struck at 7.55am last Sunday. Although 90% of the buildings along its coast have been destroyed, nobody perished in the five-meter-high walls of water that followed. Local traditions seem to have saved them. Mayor Darmili said villagers on the island were used to earthquakes and tsunamis. A big earthquake last struck in 2002. [...] "Thousands of our people were killed by a tsunami in 1907 and we have many earthquakes here," [...] he said.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a small-scale, {{qualitative}} study on children 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives about their participation in decision-making processes regarding supervised contact. The paper begins with {{an overview of the}} study and a summary of findings in relation to four key research questions framed around the idea of children <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say,</b> that is, children 2 ̆ 7 s views and perspectives of their participation in family law decision-making processes. These key questions include: What are children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say?</b> What are children 2 ̆ 7 s understandings of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say?</b> Did children want <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the decision for them to have supervised contact? How did having (or not <b>having)</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> feel? Discussion focuses on what importance children place on <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in family law matters, a finding that is contrasted with children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of marginalisation and exclusion from decision-making processes and of ambivalence and reluctance sometimes expressed around <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say.</b> Children 2 ̆ 7 s idea of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>say</b> as taking place in and through particular forms of dialogue and conversation, thus enabling the recognition of children and respect for what they have to say, are also explored. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of the study for professionals working in family la...|$|R
