40|$|Localization {{of insulin}} {{receptor}}-related receptor in the rat <b>kidney.</b> <b>Insulin</b> receptor-related receptor (IRR), {{a member of}} the insulin receptor family, is most abundantly expressed in the kidney. However, its endogenous ligand and physiological roles are still unknown. To elucidate the physiological role of IRR, an orphan receptor, in the kidney, we examined the localization of IRR mRNA and its immunoreactivity in the rat kidney by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. IRR mRNA was found to be exclusively localized in the cortical collecting duct. The localization of IRR immunoreactivity was consistent with that of IRR mRNA. Furthermore, IRR immunoreactivity was found to be localized on the basolateral plasma membrane of the epithelial cells that were a minor cell subpopulation (20 to 30 %) of the duct.

Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the mammalian organ with the highest level of IRR mRNA is the kidney. By in situ hybridization, kidney expression of IRR transcript is only in the distal nephron and the collecting ducts; however, the specific cellular distribution of IRR is unknown. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine IRR protein expression in the adult mouse kidney using immunohistochemical techniques. IRR was specifically present in a subset of cells in the connecting tubule, the initial collecting tubule, and the cortical collecting duct. IRR protein is detected in cells that express vacuolar H+-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase 2, but not in cells that express band 3 (anion exchanger 1). In the cortical collecting duct, the IRR positive cells are likely B intercalated cells. In the connecting tubule and the initial collecting tubule, the cells are B cells and/or non-A non-B cells. Thus, IRR is a specific marker for non-A intercalated cells in the kidney...|$|E

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} the inability of insulin to suppress glucose production in the liver and <b>kidney.</b> <b>Insulin</b> inhibits glucose production by indirect and direct mechanisms. The latter result in transcriptional suppression of key gluconeogenetic and glycogenolytic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 p). The transcription factors required for this effect are incompletely characterized. We report that in glucogenetic kidney epithelial cells, Pepck and G 6 p expression are induced by dexamethasone (dex) and cAMP, but fail to be inhibited by insulin. The inability to respond to insulin is associated with reduced expression of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo 1, a substrate of the Akt kinase that is inhibited by insulin through phosphorylation. Transduction of kidney cells with recombinant adenovirus encoding Foxo 1 results in insulin inhibition of dex/cAMP–induced G 6 p expression. Moreover, expression of dominant negative Foxo 1 mutant results in partial inhibition of dex/cAMP–induced G 6 p and Pepck expression in primary cultures of mouse hepatocyes and kidney LLC-PK 1 -FBPase+ cells. These findings are consistent with the possibility that Foxo 1 is involved in insulin regulation of glucose production by mediating the ability of insulin to decrease the glucocorticoid/cAMP response of G 6 p...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, hypomagnesemia (serum Mg(2 +) < 0. 7 mmol/L) has been {{strongly}} associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Patients with hypomagnesemia show a more rapid disease progression and have an increased risk for diabetes complications. Clinical studies demonstrate that T 2 DM patients with hypomagnesemia have reduced pancreatic beta-cell activity and are more insulin resistant. Moreover, dietary Mg(2 +) supplementation for patients with T 2 DM improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Intracellular Mg(2 +) regulates glucokinase, KATP channels, and L-type Ca(2 +) channels in pancreatic beta-cells, preceding insulin secretion. Moreover, insulin receptor autophosphorylation is dependent on intracellular Mg(2 +) concentrations, making Mg(2 +) a direct factor {{in the development of}} insulin resistance. Conversely, insulin is an important regulator of Mg(2 +) homeostasis. In the <b>kidney,</b> <b>insulin</b> activates the renal Mg(2 +) channel transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 that determines the final urinary Mg(2 +) excretion. Consequently, patients with T 2 DM and hypomagnesemia enter a vicious circle in which hypomagnesemia causes insulin resistance and insulin resistance reduces serum Mg(2 +) concentrations. This Perspective provides a systematic overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Mg(2 +) on insulin secretion and insulin signaling. In addition to providing a review of current knowledge, we provide novel directions for future research and identify previously neglected contributors to hypomagnesemia in T 2 DM...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of insulin}} on rat renal microvessels: Studies in the {{isolated}} perfused hydronephrotic kidney. Although insulin is demonstrated to decrease vascular tone, {{the role of}} insulin in renal microcirculation has not been fully determined. In the present study, the effect of insulin on renal microvascular tone was assessed using the isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat <b>kidney.</b> <b>Insulin</b> (300 µU/ml) {{had no effect on}} the basal renal microvessel diameter. In addition, insulin did not alter myogenic (that is, pressure-induced) constriction of preglomerular microvessels, with similar magnitude of constriction observed in response to elevated renal perfusion pressure from 80 to 180 mm Hg (interlobular artery, - 23 ± 3 % vs. - 19 ± 4 %; afferent arteriole, - 22 ± 3 % vs. - 21 ± 4 %, for control and insulin, respectively). In striking contrast, insulin dose-dependently reversed the norepinephrine (NE) -induced tone of interlobular arteries, afferent arterioles, and efferent arterioles, with 94 ± 9 %, 104 ± 6 %, and 86 ± 10 % reversal at 300 µU/ml, respectively. These vasodilator actions were markedly inhibited by N-Arg; in the presence of N-Arg, insulin (300 µU/ml) exerted only a modest dilator action on interlobular arteries (24 ± 9 % reversal), afferent arterioles (23 ± 10 % reversal), and efferent arterioles (14 ± 9 % reversal). A similar renal microvascular responsiveness to insulin was also observed during angiotensin II (Ang II) -induced constriction. In conclusion, the ability of insulin to dilate the renal microvasculature differs, with marked inhibitory action during NE/Ang II-induced constriction and almost no inhibition during myogenic constriction. Furthermore, the present study suggests that the insulin-induced renal vasodilation is mediated by nitric oxide...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of end stage renal failure. An increased susceptibility to renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -injury was found in DM rats. Unilateral renal ischemia for as short as 20 minutes led to an irreversible progressive injury in DM kidneys, whereas the injury in non-DM kidneys was almost reversible. The renal I/R injury was characterized by anuria, infiltration of inflammatory cells, tubular atrophy, dilation of the remaining tubuli and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Necrotic areas were found in the inner parts of the outer medulla and in the papilla. The renal medulla was the most vulnerable part of the kidney. This was seen both by the extent of fibrosis four and eight weeks after I/R and by the presence of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells 6 h after ischemia. Increased accumulation of HA and enhanced CD 44 expression was seen after I/R in DM kidneys. Treatment with long acting insulin 7 - 14 days before I/R, decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the renal medulla and protected renal function and morphology after the insult, while insulin treatment after the injury did not have any protective effect. Short acting insulin given 2 - 6 hours before I/R partially protected renal function but did not improve the morphological picture. Treatment with the angiotensin II receptor type 1 blocker candesartan, the PAF-antagonist UR- 12670, the immunosuppressive agents tacrolimus and cyclosporin A, or prednisolone did not improve the outcome of the renal I/R injury in DM. Injection of cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) intraperitoneally in order to induce an over-expression of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) resulted in a trend towards a better function in DM kidneys after I/R. However, the induction of HO- 1 by intraperitoneal CoPP injection was not achieved in all rats, when examined by western blot. In conclusion, unilateral renal I/R leads to a severe progressive injury in DM <b>kidneys.</b> <b>Insulin</b> treatment before ischemia, but not after, reduces the renal injury in DM rats. Studies using a more reliable administration of CoPP are required to decide if induction of HO- 1 protects against renal I/R injury in DM...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has greatly expanded {{the domain of}} insulin action. The classical action of insulin is the control of glucose metabolism through the dual feedback loop linking plasma insulin with plasma glucose concentrations. This canon has been revised to incorporate the impact of insulin resistance or insulin deficiency, both of which alter glucose homeostasis through maladaptive responses (namely, chronic hyperinsulinaemia and glucose toxicity). A large body of knowledge {{is available on the}} physiology, cellular biology and molecular genetics of insulin action on glucose production and uptake. More recently, a number of newer actions of insulin have been delineated from in vitro and in vivo studies. In sensitive individuals, insulin inhibits lipolysis and platelet aggregation. In the presence of insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, hyper-aggregation and anti-fibrinolysis may create a pro-thrombotic milieu. Preliminary evidence indicates that hyperinsulinaemia per se may be pro-oxidant both in vitro and in vivo. Insulin plays a role in mediating diet-induced thermogenesis, and insulin resistance may therefore be implicated in the defective thermogenesis of diabetes. In the <b>kidney,</b> <b>insulin</b> spares sodium and uric acid from excretion; in chronic hyperinsulinaemic states, these effects may contribute to high blood pressure and hyperuricaemia. Insulin hyperpolarises the plasma membranes of both excitable and non-excitable tissues, with consequences ranging from baroreceptor desensitisation to cardiac refractoriness (prolongation of QT interval). Under some circumstances insulin is vasodilatory - the mechanism involving both the sodium-potassium pump and intracellular calcium transients. Finally, by crossing the blood-brain barrier insulin exerts a host a central effects (sympatho-excitation, vagal withdrawal, stimulation of corticotropin releasing factor), collectively resembling a stress reaction. Description and understanding of these new roles, their interactions, the interplay between insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, and their implications for cardiovascular disease have only begun...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a simple, {{efficient}} system for the high-level expression of human insulin receptors in eukaryotic cells, a full-length human <b>kidney</b> <b>insulin</b> receptor cDNA was inserted into a bovine papilloma virus vector {{under the control of}} the mouse metallothionein promoter. After transfection of mouse NIH 3 T 3 cells with this construct, seven cell lines expressing insulin receptors were isolated; two cell lines had more than 10 (6) receptors per cell. The cell line with the highest insulin binding (NIH 3 T 3 HIR 3. 5) had 6 X 10 (6) receptors with a Kd of 10 (- 9) M. This level was not dependent on exposure to metals but could be increased further to 2 X 10 (7) receptors per cell by addition of sodium butyrate to the culture medium. The alpha and beta subunits had apparent molecular weights of 147, 000 and 105, 000, respectively (compared to 135, 000 and 95, 000 in IM- 9 human lymphocytes), values identical to those of the alpha and beta subunits of the insulin receptors of nontransformed NIH 3 T 3 cells. This size difference was due to altered carbohydrate composition, as N-glycanase digestion reduced the apparent receptor subunit size of the transfected cells and IM- 9 lymphocytes to identical values. The alteration in N-linked oligosaccharide composition could not be ascribed to differences in the kinetics of posttranslational processing of the insulin receptors, which was comparable to that of other cells studied. The basal rate of glycogen synthesis in the cells overexpressing insulin receptors was increased 4 - to 5 -fold compared with controls. Low levels of added insulin (0. 1 nM) caused a 50 % increase in the rate of glycogen synthesis...|$|E

Because the kidney {{plays a major role in}} the regulation of blood pressure, we studied the regulation of insulin receptor expression in the kidney during states of insulin resistance. Using two rat models of insulin resistance, Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the expression of insulin receptor subunits in the kidney compared to lean control rats. Treatment of insulin resistance in Zucker rats with the insulin-sensitizing drug rosiglitazone partially restored renal insulin receptor levels. Conversely, treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1) antagonist candesartan increased renal insulin receptor expression compared to untreated rats.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a common}} disease in older people, with almost 50 % of Type 2 diabetic patients being over 60 years of age; despite this, half of older people with frank diabetes are not diagnosed. While insulin resistance is common in older people, large numbers also have impaired insulin secretion. Age, body habitus and physical activity all {{play a role in}} the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia associated with diabetes mellitus. Leptin levels relate to insulin resistance in older people and amylin secretion is associated with delayed return of glucose levels to baseline. Depression, impaired cognitive function, and lack of recognition of thirst and subsequent dehydration are important factors to be taken into account in the management of older diabetic patients, who may also have impaired physical function, an increased rate of injurious falls, and increased prevalence of pressure ulcers, amputations and tuberculosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Insulin {{receptor}} (InsR) and insulin signaling proteins {{are widely}} {{distributed throughout the}} <b>kidney</b> cortex. <b>Insulin</b> signaling can act in the kidney in multiple ways, {{some of which may}} be totally independent of its primary role of the maintenance of whole-body glucose homeostasis. However, descriptions of the insulin signaling in renal glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) are quite limited and the roles of insulin signaling in MC functions have not been sufficiently elucidated. Results InsR silencing induced a unique phenotype of reduced fibronectin (FN) accumulation in renal glomerular MCs. Transcription level of FN was not significantly changed in the InsR silenced cells, suggesting the phenotype switching was caused by post-transcriptional modification. The decreased expression of InsR was associated with enhanced activity of insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R) /PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway which contributed in part to the attenuation of cellular FN accumulation. Formation of IGF- 1 R homodimer was increased in the InsR silenced cells. The InsR silenced cells also showed increased sensitivity to exogenous IGF- 1, and increased PI 3 K activity was reversed significantly by incubating cells with IGF- 1 R specific antagonist, AG 538. PI 3 K/Akt dependent activation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) - 1 induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 and suppressing MMP activity by doxycycline partially reversed FN accumulation in the InsR silenced cells.

40|$|Insulin is an {{important}} regulator of renal salt and water excretion, and hyperinsulinemia has been implicated {{to play a role}} in hypertension. One of the target proteins of insulin action in the kidney is Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE 3), a principal Na(+) transporter responsible for salt absorption in the mammalian proximal tubule. The molecular mechanisms involved in activation of NHE 3 by insulin have not been studied so far. In opossum <b>kidney</b> (OK) cells, <b>insulin</b> increased Na(+) /H(+) exchange activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This effect is due to activation of NHE 3 as it persisted after pharmacological inhibition of NHE 1 and NHE 2. In the early phase of stimulation (2 - 12 h), NHE 3 activity was increased without changes in NHE 3 protein and mRNA. At 24 h, enhanced NHE 3 activity was accompanied by an increase in total and cell surface NHE 3 protein and NHE 3 mRNA abundance. All the effects of insulin on NHE 3 activity, protein, and mRNA were amplified in the presence of hydrocortisone. These results suggest that insulin stimulates renal tubular NHE 3 activity via a biphasic mechanism involving posttranslational factors and an increase in NHE 3 gene expression and the effects are dependent on the permissive action of hydrocortisone...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that (i) the insulin-induced {{activation}} of heart 6 -phosphofructo- 2 -kinase (PFK- 2) is wortmannin-sensitive, but is insensitive to rapamycin, suggesting the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase; and (ii) protein kinase B (PKB) activates PFK- 2 in vitro by phosphorylating Ser- 466 and Ser- 483. In this work, we have studied the effects of phosphorylation of these residues on PFK- 2 activity by replacing each or both residues with glutamate. Mutation of Ser- 466 increased the V(max) of PFK- 2, whereas mutation of Ser- 483 decreased citrate inhibition. Mutation of both residues was required to decrease the K(m) for fructose 6 -phosphate. We also studied the insulin-induced activation of heart PFK- 2 in transfection experiments performed in human embryonic <b>kidney</b> 293 cells. <b>Insulin</b> activated transfected PFK- 2 by phosphorylating Ser- 466 and Ser- 483. Kinase-dead (KD) PKB and KD 3 -phosphoinositide-dependent kinase- 1 (PDK- 1) cotransfectants acted as dominant negatives because both prevented the insulin-induced activation of PKB as well as the inactivation of glycogen-synthase kinase- 3, an established substrate of PKB. However, the insulin-induced activation of PFK- 2 was prevented only by KD PDK- 1, but not by KD PKB. These results indicate that the insulin-induced activation of heart PFK- 2 is mediated by a PDK- 1 -activated protein kinase other than PKB...|$|R
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and/or reduced response of target tissues to insulin. Good glycemic control delays the development and slows the progression of micro- and macrovascular complications. Although there are numerous glucose-lowering agents in clinical use, only approximately half of type 2 diabetic patients achieve glycemic control, and undesirable side-effects often hamper treatment in those treated with the medications. There {{is a need for}} novel treatment options that can help overcome these difficulties. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors have recently been developed as a novel potential therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs lower the plasma glucose concentration through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the <b>kidney,</b> independent of <b>insulin</b> secretion and insulin action, with a consequent lower risk of hypoglycemia. The data of clinical trials with monotherapy as well as combination therapy show that SGLT 2 inhibitors have a blood glucose-lowering effect and also reduce bodyweight. A follow-up study shows long-term efficacy and the durability of these effects. SGLT 2 inhibitors have the potential to reverse glucose toxicity, and to improve insulin resistance, blood pressure and lipid profile. The available data suggest a good tolerability profile. However, clinicians should carefully prescribe these drugs in light of already reported and/or unexpected side-effects. Further studies in larger numbers and longer-term clinical use data are required to place these agents in standard treatment of type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} hepatic steatosis and to assess the performance of biochemical, anthropometric and body composition indicators for hepatic steatosis in obese teenagers. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 79 adolecents aged from ten to 18 years old. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in case of moderate or intense hepatorenal contrast and/or {{a difference in the}} histogram &# 8805; 7 on the right <b>kidney</b> cortex. The <b>insulin</b> resistance was determined by the Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index for values > 3. 16. Anthropometric and body composition indicators consisted of body mass index, body fat percentage, abdominal circumference and subcutaneous fat. Fasting glycemia and insulin, lipid profile and hepatic enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were also evaluated. In order to assess the performance of these indicators in the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in teenagers, a ROC curve analysis was applied. RESULTS: Hepatic steatosis was found in 20 % of the patients and insulin resistance, in 29 %. Gamma-glutamyltransferase and HOMA-IR were good indicators for predicting hepatic steatosis, with a cutoff of 1. 06 times above the reference value for gamma-glutamyltransferase and 3. 28 times for the HOMA-IR. The anthropometric indicators, the body fat percentage, the lipid profile, the glycemia and the aspartate aminotransferase did not present significant associations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high gamma-glutamyltransferase level and/or HOMA-IR should be submitted to abdominal ultrasound examination due to the increased chance of having hepatic steatosis...|$|R
40|$|Insulin-dependent {{diabetic}} {{recipients of}} successful pancreas allografts achieve self-regulatory insulin secretion and discontinue exogenous insulin therapy; however, chronic hyperinsulinemia and impaired insulin sensitivity generally develop. To determine whether insulin resistance {{is accompanied by}} altered signal transduction, skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from pancreas-kidney transplant recipients (n = 3 D 4), nondiabetic kidney transplant recipients (receiving the same immunosuppressive drugs; n = 3 D 5), and healthy subjects (n = 3 D 6) before and during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Basal insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1 Ser (312) and Ser (616) phosphorylation, IRS- 19 ̆ 6 associated phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase activity, and extracellular signal 9 ̆ 6 regulated kinase (ERK) - 1 / 2 phosphorylation were elevated in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients, coincident with fasting hyperinsulinemia. Basal IRS- 1 Ser (312) and Ser (616) phosphorylation was also increased in nondiabetic <b>kidney</b> transplant recipients. <b>Insulin</b> increased phosphorylation of IRS- 1 at Ser (312) but not Ser (616) in healthy subjects, with impairments noted in nondiabetic kidney and pancreas-kidney transplant recipients. Insulin action on ERK- 1 / 2 and Akt phosphorylation was impaired in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients and was preserved in nondiabetic kidney transplant recipients. Importantly, insulin stimulation of the Akt substrate AS 160 was impaired in nondiabetic kidney and pancreas-kidney transplant recipients. In conclusion, peripheral insulin resistance in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients may arise from a negative feedback regulation of the canonical insulin-signaling cascade from excessive serine phosphorylation of IRS- 1, possibly {{as a consequence of}} immunosuppressive therapy and hyperinsulinemia...|$|R

40|$|Increased insulinemic {{response}} to an oral glucose load has been demonstrated in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats. To determine whether this abnormality is mediated {{at the level of}} the insulin receptor, we compared insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in tissues of Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS) and in their normotensive controls, Dahl salt-resistant rats (DR). To evaluate possible influences of dietary sodium intake, rats were fed either low (0. 07 % NaCl) or high salt (7. 5 % NaCl) chow until the DS became hypertensive, and then were killed by decapitation. Fasting plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels did not differ between DR and DS rats and were not affected by salt intake. In {{response to}} an oral glucose load, plasma glucose had a similar increase in DR and DS rats, but the increase in plasma insulin was significantly greater in DS rats. Scatchard analysis of binding was obtained from in situ autoradiographic studies performed in frozen skeletal muscle and <b>kidney</b> sections, and <b>insulin</b> receptor mRNA levels were measured by slot-blot hybridization. Number and affinity of insulin receptors were comparable in skeletal muscle and kidney of DR and DS rats and, in both groups, binding parameters were not affected by dietary sodium chloride. Hepatic and renal insulin receptor mRNA levels were also comparable in DR and DS rats fed either low or high salt chow. Thus, increased plasma insulin response to oral glucose load is associated with normal insulin receptor binding and gene expression in peripheral tissues in rats with Dahl hypertension. A postreceptor defect is likely responsible for the decreased sensitivity to insulin in this model of geneti...|$|R
