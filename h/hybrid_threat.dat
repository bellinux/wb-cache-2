50|$|Hybrid warfare is a {{military}} strategy that blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyberwarfare. By combining kinetic operations with subversive efforts, the aggressor intends to avoid attribution or retribution. Hybrid warfare {{can be used to}} describe the flexible and complex dynamics of the battlespace requiring a highly adaptable and resilient response. There are a variety of terms used to refer to the hybrid war concept: hybrid war, hybrid warfare, <b>hybrid</b> <b>threat,</b> or hybrid adversary (as well as non-linear war, non-traditional war or special war). US military bodies tend to speak in terms of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>threat,</b> while academic literature speaks of a hybrid warfare.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedNATOs enduring global preeminence owes to {{its ability to}} adapt to emerging security threats, but this capacity now may be limited. Today, NATO faces hybrid threats that combine conventional and unconventional means. On the one hand, hybrid threats may not constitute armed attacks under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. On the other hand, NATO nations are both enriched and endangered by cyberspace, mass media, and the growing global interdependency of easily accessible technologies that once were possessed only by nation-states but now can serve as weapons in hands of the rogue state and non-state actors. This thesis examines NATOs ability to defend against hybrid threats. First it analyzes {{the historical development of}} internal issues that make NATO vulnerable to outside threats. Then, through two case studies, it examines the external threats projected by <b>hybrid</b> <b>threat</b> actors. Finally, it turns to NATOs strategic capabilities against <b>hybrid</b> <b>threat</b> actors. The thesis concludes that NATOs well-established habits of burden-sharing and burden-shifting exacerbate the lag in developing the policy framework to deal with hybrid threats. Still, NATO can turn to its New Strategic Concept and the Smart Defense initiative to counter and deter hybrid threats, thus managing threats that cannot be fully prevented.

40|$|The Russian National Security Strategy of 2015 aims at {{achieving}} autarky from Western {{influences on}} global security, {{the rule of}} law and global trade. Russia aims at attaining this by applying a holistic mix of military, political and economic means to weaken the West and to strengthen its own role as a global player. The Russian approach builds on a strategy of reflexive control which as such is an old method, but the outcome of the application of this approach results in hybrid warfare which as such is a new emerging concept of warfighting. This short article looks at one particular aspect of this Russian strategy, namely using Hybrid, or non-linear, Warfare against its Western direct neighbours in particular and the West in general. We will discuss the underlying cultural logic in Russia’s actions and will reflect on the impact of Russia’s utilization of the existing cultural asymmetry as a form of warfare in regard to the West. The examples used in this text are taken from the context of the conflicts of Ukraine and Syria, but have to be seen as constituting a part of an on-going global conflict aimed at NATO and the EU.
