60|$|The lady folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> {{and looked}} at me steadily.|$|E
60|$|Rose sat rigidly {{still in}} her chair, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> holding the letter.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} in a rocking chair, and {{clasping}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> rocked slowly back and forth.|$|E
60|$|Jo {{immediately}} sat up, put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pockets, {{and began}} to whistle.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, {{took out}} the key, and hesitated at the last moment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shall I mend your frock!' was Wilmet's first greeting, {{as she put}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, and {{produced}} a little housewife.|$|R
60|$|She got {{a little}} back of the others, and sat looking wistfully out over the bay, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Squire attentively, while Ida folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and sat still {{with her eyes}} fixed upon the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{like to tell}} you," [...] said Chrissie, folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> [...] "I know you’ll be cross. You’re so unreasonable." ...|$|E
60|$|Grace {{groaned and}} clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> greater anxiety now, all lesser fears were forgotten. She turned and threw herself before the Commander.|$|R
60|$|She was brought, {{and stood}} with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sister's. Louisa had {{observed}} {{her with her}} arm round Sissy's neck, and she felt the difference of this approach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Amy, [...] "I'll {{enable you}} to lose that £20 immediately;" [...] and so she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket and pulls out her purse.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lapham {{sat down}} with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> {{and stared at the}} smile on her husband's face, where he sat facing her.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank back}} to her chair, folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and fell into meditation. The faintest of flushes crept into her wax-like cheeks.|$|E
60|$|She began {{mechanically}} {{to rearrange}} her hat and veil; and after that, sitting upright, {{to watch the}} cross streets with feverish anticipation, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>her</b> {{most common}} form she holds an axe, drigug (cleaver) or khatvanga (tantric staff) and a skull cup <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> chignon {{is a picture of}} Akshobhya.|$|R
60|$|Before Elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance, a {{young woman}} with gold glasses on her bony nose and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside.|$|R
60|$|He gripped <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{opened the}} door, {{and watched her}} sail down towards the lift, {{whistling}} to herself, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> coat pockets. Then he turned {{back into the room}} and locked himself in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Five years," [...] {{said the}} old woman, shaking her head and folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> [...] "How long do you say you’ve been looking for Captain Jackson?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was Mr. May as a pug dog begging, too lifelike and too impossible. The {{audience}} shouted. Alvina {{sat with}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> The Pug {{was a great}} success.|$|E
60|$|She {{searched in}} the pocket of her gown, drew out a pair of black lace mittens, put them on with the stoniest and steadiest composure, and then quietly crossed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} her. She {{was dressed in}} a wool jacket and boots, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pockets. A cloud of steam came from her mouth and nostrils. Her breast was rising and falling.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dozens, I dare say. Shipping seas {{every five}} minutes. All the {{passengers}} ill but me, and every {{prospect of a}} north-easter all the way over,' continued the lively Amanda, lurching briskly about the passage with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pockets.|$|R
60|$|She {{gathered}} {{herself together}} {{and sat with}} prim, pure face, white and pink and cold as a Christmas rose, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> silk gloves folded on her lap, her dark eyes all vague, abstracted {{in a sort of}} dream, oblivious of everything.|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the many}} virtues of this admirable woman was invincible courage. She did not faint; {{she did not}} cry out; she sat quietly down again, folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and said calmly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} resumed her seat, and, folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> gazed in a troubled fashion across the river, until {{the figure of}} another woman coming along the walk {{brought her back to}} every-day affairs.|$|E
6000|$|Here Mrs. Lecks {{leaned back}} in her chair, folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and ejaculated, [...] "Well, well!" [...] and then allowed her face to assume a rigid {{intention}} of having nothing more to say at the present moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so. That is glorious!" [...] Her {{blue eyes}} were dancing with mischief, and she clapped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> delight. [...] "What else? She thinks that {{whatever}} a man can do a woman {{should be allowed to}} do also--does she not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whom can he mean? The {{letter is}} to you, my dear. I protest {{he is making}} love to your mother before my face!" [...] cries papa to Hetty, who only gives a little sigh, puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>hand,</b> and then withdraws it.|$|R
60|$|But Mademoiselle {{would not}} smile; and, folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> cloak, {{appeared}} to slumber. Whereat the gray-headed infant groaned pathetically, cast his eyes heavenward, and drank more ale, muttering to himself, and {{shaking his head}} as if his emotions could not be entirely suppressed.|$|R
6000|$|Without looking around, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> an absent {{look in her}} eyes, {{the girl}} began in a husky contralto voice: [...] "Bounded on the north--" [...] {{and went through the}} whole {{rigmarole}} in the same way, careless, but certain.|$|E
6000|$|... "He couldn't seem to {{understand}} why I didn't say Yes the first time, if I meant it." [...] She looked down dreamily at <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and then she said, with a blush and a start, [...] "They're very queer, don't you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|The girl's {{eyes had}} wandered {{again to the}} pages of her book. Perhaps she was already {{familiar}} with the text of her father's monologue. But recognizing an additional querulousness in his voice, she laid the book aside and patiently folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} in a {{listless}} attitude, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap; she seemed to be tired. She was dressed simply, as if for walking and escaping observation. When he had greeted her he glanced back at her companion, and recognized the faithful Assunta.|$|R
60|$|Alice had no {{idea what}} to do, and <b>in</b> despair she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.|$|R
50|$|However, {{things may}} be looking up. Koganemaru, {{the son of an}} intergalactic billionaire has been kidnapped. This may be the chance that Maris needed to become financially independent, as she figures that he'll be so indebted to her that he might ask for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> marriage.|$|R
