These instruments have been performed for livestock including dairy cattle and milk {{for many years in}} Turkey. Until the year 1950, agricultural support system was organized according to genetically improvement, animal illnesses and veterinary services. Nowadays, agricultural support composition has changed. Milk <b>incentive</b> <b>premium</b> is one of the supports given to producers to achieve high quality level for milk. The idea behind this premium was to provide well organized milk distribution channel from producers to modern enterprises. In this study, producers who receive milk <b>incentive</b> <b>premium</b> were chosen for face to face survey in Antalya province. It was examined from the study if premium system is accomplished through the idea.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that a bank’s subordinated debt yield spread is not, by itself, a sufficient measure of default risk. We use a model in which sub-ordinated debt is held by investors with superior knowledge (”informed investor hypothesis”). First, we show that in theory the yield spread on subordinated debt must compensate investors for expected loss plus give them an incentive not to prefer senior debt. Second we present strong empirical evidence {{in favor of the}} informed investor hypothesis and of the existence of the <b>incentive</b> <b>premium</b> predicted by the model. Using data on the timing and pricing of public debt issues made by large U. S. banking organizations during the 1985 - 2002 period, we find that banks issue rela-tively more subordinated debt in good times, i. e. when informed investors have good news. Spreads at issuance (corrected for sample selection bias) react to (superior) private and to public information, in line with the comparative statics of the postulated <b>incentive</b> <b>premium.</b> Interestingly, as the model predicts, the influence of sophisticated investors ’ information on the subordinated yield spread became weaker after the introduction of prompt corrective action and depositor preference reforms, while the influ-ence of public risk perception grew stronger. Finally, our model explains anomalies from the empirical literature on subordinated debt spreads and from market interviews (e. g. limited sensitivity to bank-specific risk and the ”ballooning ” of spreads in bad times). We conclude that a bank’s subordinated yield spread conveys important information if interpreted together with its senior spread and with other banks ’ subordinated yield spreads...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between a microfinance institution (MFI) and its loan officers when officers discriminate against a particular group of micro-entrepreneurs. Using survey data from Uganda, we provide evidence that loan officers are more biased than other employees against disabled micro-entrepreneurs. In line with the evidence, we build an agency model of a non-profit MFI and a biased loan officer in charge of granting loans. Since incentive schemes are costly and the MFI's budget is limited, the MFI faces a trade-off between combating discrimination and granting loans. We show that the optimal <b>incentive</b> <b>premium</b> is a non-decreasing function of the MFI's budget. Moreover, even a non-discriminatory welfare-maximizing MFI may let its loan officer discriminate, because eradicating discrimination would come at the cost of too many loans. Observing an MFI's loan allocation biased against a minority group therefore does not imply that the institution is biased against this group. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Belgian-Flemish {{system for}} career break (time credit) {{consists}} of two different kinds of leaves. Firstly {{there is a possibility}} for an employee to reduce his or her working time without a specific reason. This “ordinary career break ” is aimed to prevent workers from burn out and early retirement by giving them a possibility for recreation and/or education. Secondly there is a Flemish <b>incentive</b> <b>premium</b> system in order to encourage workers to take a thematic career break for care tasks or education. There are three different kinds of thematic leaves: parental leave, palliative care leave and leave to care for {{a member of the family}} suffering from a serious illness. The motive for career break may differ, but the systems have an overall purpose in common: to improve the balance between work, family and personal life. 1. Institutional background in Sweden To assess the Belgian-Flemish career break system from a Swedish perspective it is necessary to distinguish between the different kinds of leaves. The major reason for career break in Sweden is parental leave, a system which corresponds to one of the Belgian thematic leaves and to the ordinary Belgian maternity leave. There is also a possibility to get allowance to take care of a member of the family suffering from serious illness...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{examination of the}} effect of piece rates and other forms of incentive compensation on individual employee earnings. The study examines the impact of incentives on the earnings of over 100, 000 employees in 500 firms within the footwear and men's and boys' clothing industries. Two distinct incentive effects are observed. First, incentive workers' earnings are more disperse than identical time workers' earnings within both firms and occupations. This greater variance is maintained with the addition of controls for heterogeneity of individual characteristics between the two sectors. Second, incentive workers receive an earnings premium, in part to compensate for the greater variation in their income, and partially {{as a result of an}} incentive- effort effect. The <b>incentive</b> earnings <b>premium</b> averages 14 %, controlling for individual characteristics, occupational classification, and individual firms. Subsequent decomposition of the incentive-earnings premium reveals that the compensating differential for variation in earnings accounts for a minority of the <b>incentive</b> earnings <b>premium.</b> This supports the view that increased effort by incentive employees leads to relatively greater earnings. ...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that the yield spread on banks ’ subordinated debt {{is not a good}} measure of bank risk. First, we use a model with heterogeneous investors in which subordinated debt is primarily held by investors with su-perior knowledge (i. e., the“informed investor hypothesis”). Subordinated debt, by definition, coexists with non-subordinated, or “senior, ” debt. The yield spread on subordinated debt thus must not only compensate investors for expected risk (i. e., to satisfy their participation constraint), but also offer an “incentive premium ” above a “fair ” return to induce informed in-vestors to prefer it to senior debt (i. e., to satisfy an incentive constraint). Second, we test the model using data we collected on the timing and pric-ing of public debt issues made by large U. S. banking organizations in the 1986 - 1999 period. Findings with respect to issuance decisions lend strong support for the informed investor hypothesis. But rival explanations for the use of subordinated debt, such as differences in investor risk aversion or such as the signaling of earnings prospects by the bank, are rejected. A sample selection model on observed issuance spreads provides evidence for the existence of the postulated subordinated <b>incentive</b> <b>premium.</b> In line with predictions from the model, the influence of sophisticated investors’ information on the subordinated yield spread became weaker after the in-troduction of prompt corrective actions and depositor preference regulatory reforms, while the influence of public risk perception grew stronger. Fi-nally, our model explains some results from the empirical literature on subordinated debt spreads and from market interviews — such as limited spread sensitivity to bank specific-risk or of the “ballooning ” of spreads in bad times...|$|E

A legal operation was carried out against Turkish football on July 3, 2011. A lot of administrators, footballers, coaches and managers were arrested with the claim of involving match-fixing and <b>incentive</b> <b>premiums</b> in various football competitions. The news on match-fixing event mostly focused particularly on Fenerbahçe FC and its’ president on the media. At {{the beginning of the}} operation, certain parts of the media reported the operation with the title “Clean Football”. Clean football was also a necessity for the expression “New Turkey” which has been uttered within many subjects. In the same year, Fenerbahçe FC was disqualified from joining the UEFA Champions League. The incident was brought to UEFA, the CAS, and the Swiss Federal Courts and became an event which was to be solved at an international level. The operation caused losses in the broadcasting incomes of the encrypted channel bearing the broadcast rights and caused damage on the football clubs, particularly on Fenerbahçe FC. Play Off application was put into practice in order to prevent more losses on football capitalism including the clubs, broadcasting channel and the sponsors. Another important outcome of the incidence was the protests of Fenerbahçe fans after the operation held by the police forces and during the trial process. These protests indicated in a peculiar way to Turkey that football is one of the recent rising social identities. The remission in the upper and lower limits of the penalties relating match fixing in sports after July 3 caused some disagreements among the members of the party in power. One of the consequences of the event was that the relationship between football and parallel state structure (FETO) came to the public. Within this context, the Period restarted with a new case.

The PRS more and more became a residual market characterized by little professional letting and inhabited by tenants with a weakening socio-economic profile. After discussing the role, size and composition of the PRS due to historic measures, the paper elaborates on current and future housing policies, thereby focusing on two key developments. First, there is a growing level of understanding that the private rental market needs supportive policies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive comparative-static results for short and long-run {{determinants}} of one component of the natural rate of unemployment.

If firms are fundamentally similar, however, all will reach roughly the same decision about premiums, and they will reach it simultaneously. Although all will then be frustrated to discover they have not succeeded in outbidding their competitors, the resulting rise in average wage rates will increase unemployment, making the labor market less tight.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the role of}} private insurance in financing long-term care, tax incentives for long-term care insurance have been implemented at both {{the federal and state}} levels.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigate}} the magnitude, determinants, {{and consequences of}} equity grants to target firm CEOs prior to acquisitions. The board can use equity grants to compensate the CEO for selling the firm and increase his incentive to negotiate a better price with the acquirer, resulting in a higher premium. An opportunistic CEO can obtain equity grants to increase his share of takeover gains, and when the costs of opportunism exceed the benefits of <b>incentive</b> alignment, takeover <b>premiums</b> will be lower. I find that unexplained grants do not increase prior to an acquisition.

In general, board independence is negatively associated with equity grants in target but non non-target firms. Further, I find that abnormal equity grants predicted by governance factors are positively associated with total takeover premiums.

Therefore, firms should take active measures to enhance the contributions of such benefits. For personal integrative benefits, firms can devise effective <b>incentives,</b> such as <b>premium</b> status for active participants to encourage more contributions and sense of self-efficacy that increase the perceptions of personal integrative benefits. Next, for learning benefits, the involvement of employees in VCEs can increase the breadth and width of product related knowledge interchanged, thereby providing opportunities for capturing more learning benefits. For social integrative benefits, the event marketing mentioned-above combined with offline gathering of VCE member can help establish good relationships to facilitate psychological attachment to the VCE, and then increase sense of belonging as social integrative benefits. Finally, hedonic benefits of VCEs may originate from pleasant experiences in conversing with one another about common interested focal issues [34], or the problem solving ability {{may also be a}} source of mental stimulation that forms another type of hedonic benefits [6]. Hence, different customer perceived benefits can complement each other. Nevertheless, firms can improve the interface and usability of VCEs to strengthen customers’ aesthetic and pleasurable experiences.|$|R
