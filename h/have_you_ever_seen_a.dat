Following her appeal, Israeli president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: [...] "Listen maideleh, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> man knitting socks? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots." [...] The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF. Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense [...] and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that [...] "The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men." [...] The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was [...] "suitable" [...] was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

[...] "Victory or death" [...] was undoubtedly the motto of each. Of course man prevailed because of superior power,--not obstinacy.|$|E

60|$|At least, that's what I thought. But {{there was}} another way which hadn't {{occurred}} to me. Marriage, I mean. Marriage, the dynamite of the soul; that was what hit Bobbie.

But he still doesn't know what's {{at the end of}} it till he gets there. It was like that with Bobbie. He fell in love, got married--with a sort of whoop, as if it were the greatest fun in the world--and then began to find out things.|$|E

It's no joke, I can tell you, readin' a great big book, in double columns, by a night-light, and the light that comes through a chink in the door. Then there were the moths--tiger moths, yellow moths, and horrid cockchafers. Louisa, my sister, would have the window open. I wanted it shut.
