5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on the floor. When <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> over her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E

500|$|As with van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, {{the panel}} creates an {{intimate}} setting between the donor and Virgin. This is emphasised by the donor's physical {{proximity to the}} Virgin which, according to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, [...] "mentally and pictorially [...] the barriers between heaven and earth" [...] and implies the [...] "patrons are visually immortalized as meriting the Virgin and Child's personal attention." [...] The intimacy is further enhanced by small details such as the overlap between the donor and Saint George, who casts a shadow on van der Paele and seems to have accidentally stepped on his surplice as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> forward to introduce the canon to the Virgin.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Prince Gerhardt spots Jenna and sends his messenger, Tomas (Will Forte), over to invite her to dine with him. Eager {{to become a}} modern-day Grace Kelly, she talks herself into doing it, despite his problems. Later, Bianca tells Liz that she dislikes the idea that Liz can [...] make Jack truly happy. Liz tells Jack that Bianca is still not over him and to prove it, she goes to her and tells her the two are engaged. At hearing this, Bianca reacts violently and attacks Liz. Later, Prince Gerhardt decides he can now die happy, after he and Jenna {{discussed}} their relationship, and drinks some champagne, which he cannot digest. He dies because [...] "he cannot metabolize the grapes." [...] As a result, the party comes to a conclusion. Jack walks Liz up to her apartment. Before he leaves, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> in {{to take off the}} necklace he lent her, which she mistakes for an attempted kiss. Jack acts semi-repulsed by the idea, and tells Liz to give it up.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} Ciara and Timberlake face to face, caressing seductively. The camera cuts to Ciara who appears almost {{impervious}} to gravity. Dressed in lingerie, she maneuvers around a horizontal dance pole; background dancers are veiled in vibrant color schemes and alternating strobe lights. The video then cuts to Ciara in a leotard, posing in abstract and flexible poses. Ciara is then seen {{dressed in a}} tiger-striped catsuit performing solo dance moves on a stage. Timberlake performs his verse seated onstage while Ciara performs intricate tricks, such as snaking under his legs. Then the two begin to lightly move to the track before Ciara forms her body as an armrest as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> on her. Ciara and the dancers perform choreography and cabaret-style moves on the pole. The bridge of the song puts Timberlake {{on the ground and}} Ciara, standing over him, turns and performs her signature [...] "Matrix" [...] over him as he guides her body toward his with his right hand. The two perform and as Ciara gets up, Timberlake smacks her side as she pops to the beat. The video then cuts to a scene with Ciara in the catsuit portraying a tiger in a cage. In the final scene, Ciara and the dancers perform, dressed in 1970s-inspired tuxedos and colored afros. The video ends with clips of Ciara's multiple performance scenes from throughout the video.|$|E
2500|$|She {{asks him}} for a kiss to [...] "comfort me" [...] and when <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> down to kiss her she pulls him from the saddle and drowns him. She swims to the shore and thanks God that [...] "The dangers she o'ercame".|$|E

2500|$|The {{left-hand}} wing shows Mary {{dressed in}} a violet-white robe, looking at the infant Christ as he returns her gaze. Beside them a seated Saint Joseph is dressed in red with a long head-dress, dozing as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> on a staff. The hem of Mary's robe is inscribed in golden script containing text from the [...] "Canticle of Mary" [...] of Luke 1:46–48.; My soul doth magnify the Lord.... This panel was long {{assumed to be a}} Nativity until described by art historian Erwin Panofsky as a simple representation of the Holy Family. The accompanying reliefs show moments of the Life of Christ; key events from his infancy to the Presentation at the Temple.|$|E
2500|$|... 4. Finally, the {{claimant}} complains {{of the system}} of processing disability claims. He suggests, and is joined in this by the briefs of amici, that the Administrative Procedure Act, rather than the Social Security Act, governs the processing of claims and specifically provides for cross-examination. The claimant goes on to assert that in any event the hearing procedure is invalid on due process grounds. He says that the hearing examiner has the responsibility for gathering the evidence and [...] "to make the [...] Government's case as strong as possible"; that naturally <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> toward a decision in favor of the evidence he has gathered; that justice must satisfy the appearance of justice, citing Offutt v. United States [...] and In re Murchison: [...] and that an [...] "independent hearing examiner such as in the" [...] Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act should be provided.|$|E
2500|$|Most simply, {{he may be}} {{a subtle}} aside on the artist's status in society—he carries the palette that Hogarth made his trademark, which appears in several of his self-portraits. However he is {{painting}} a sign advertising gin, so his ragged appearance could equally reflect the rejection of the spirit by the people of Beer Street. He may be also be a resident of Gin Lane, and Hogarth includes him as a connection to the other scene, and as a suggestion that the government's initial policy of encouraging the distillation of gin may be the cause of both Gin Lane's ruin and Beer Street's prosperity. He is ignored by the inhabitants of Beer Street as they ignore the misery of Gin Lane itself. Paulson suggests that he is the lone [...] "beautiful" [...] figure in the scene. The corpulent types that populate Beer Street later featured as representations of ugliness in Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty, while the painter, as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> back to admire his work, forms the serpentine shape that Hogarth identified as the Line of Beauty.|$|E

2500|$|Flutes (Captivity): The stage {{returns to}} the Archer's Den, where the Twin Brother is imprisoned in a small cage. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches from a distance, holding the flutes that the twins played before their lives were changed forever. All seems lost for the Twin Brother until he finds {{a friend in the}} kind-natured Chief Archer's Daughter, who dares to {{approach}} him. She passes the flutes to the Twin Brother, he begins to play and when she leans towards the cage for a closer look at him, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> forward to steal a brief kiss. Although the Chief Archer's Daughter is taken aback, as she turns away from the Twin Brother it is obvious that she has also become smitten by him. After their tender moment and after great hesitation, the Chief Archer's Daughter sets the Twin Brother free from his cage, begging him to flee. Before he does, the Twin Brother makes a decision [...] he returns to her his flutes, the precious ceremonial gifts that were treasured by their kingdom. The Twin Brother then escapes, leaving the Chief Archer's Daughter in hope they will meet again. She cannot hide her joy [...] she expresses her love through a touching performance of dance using the twins' flutes. All of this is secretly witnessed by the Counselor's Son, who has desired the Chief Archer's Daughter for years. Engulfed by rage and jelousy of his unrequited love, he prepares for war.|$|E
2500|$|Dom Sinacola of Slant Magazine said, [...] "More than that, it furthers {{the general}} {{message of the}} whole album, which is that for all his posturing and charm, Glover may not have it in him to {{participate}} in the kind of bacchanalia required of his position as a young, burgeoning, multi-talented rap star. Halfway between throwaway wordplay and trenchant comment about fame, the lyric says a lot about where Glover's head is at: As a former sketch comedian, writer on 30 Rock, and star of the sitcom Community, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> on his wit as his most formidable weapon." [...] Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "Yes, the dedication that Glover has seemingly displayed in the project is admirable. But he just doesn't seem to get music on this album. Maybe it's because of his taste, or because he is trying too hard to stand out, or because of his hubris, or because he has lost touch with reality, or maybe it is because of the internet." [...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin said, [...] "The only reaction that Because the Internet elicits is the uncontrollable urge to skip to the next song, in hopes that things couldn't possibly get any sloppier. But they do, beginning with the cod-wailing that blights [...] "Crawl" [...] and volleying with the psychedelic muzak of [...] "The Worst Guys" [...] (co-starring Chance the Rapper) and [...] "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)," [...] which sounds like Glover has inadvertently locked himself in his practice space and is attempting to muster up a loud enough mess so that some kindly passerby will hear his cries for help. As the album collapses into itself with the closing cut, [...] "Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)," [...] we're resigned to existence as a gloopy mess of random thoughts. [...] "Where's the line between Donny G and Gambino?" [...] the rapper muses, but it's unclear whether this is meant as a genuine identity crisis or an all-knowing middle finger to critics. Maybe the entire album is a meme itself, a grand existential joke critiquing the all-conquering rise of Internet culture by parodying its overwhelming randomness. Whatever it is, though, it's a bad rap record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Évelyne Brochu as Dr. Delphine Cormier, Cosima's monitor, girlfriend, {{and fellow}} scientist. She is torn between {{her job at}} Dyad and her love for Cosima. After finding out about Cosima's illness she works {{with her in the}} Dyad {{to try to find a}} cure. She is {{promoted}} to the public leader of Dyad after Leekie's death and unintentionally helps Rachel kidnap Kira. Rachel then bans her from working with clones and tries to send her away to Frankfurt. However, Marion promotes Delphine to take over Rachel's position and Delphine enacts her revenge on Rachel. Delphine returns to Dyad, supposedly after learning that Sarah was kidnapped and has been missing for five days, but it is later revealed that her jealousy has led her to spy on Cosima and Shay's relationship, photographing and videotaping the two on their various dates. Delphine interrogates Shay, believing her to be the Castor mole. She is about to begin cutting Shay when Cosima calls to inform her that Gracie admitted to being the Castor mole. Delphine finds out that Dr. Nealon replaced Rachel with an induced Krystal and sent her to Vienna. She confronts him in an enclosed room, and he reveals that Rachel now belongs to Neolution, the group that he has been working for all along, attempting to procure the Leda and Castor original genomes for scientific advancement. Delphine calls for the guards to take Nealon away, but she receives no responses, and Dr. Nealon suddenly attacks her as he bleeds from the mouth. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> over her, spilling blood onto her face, as a regurgitated worm spills from his mouth. Delphine shoots Nealon before the worm can reach her. As he dies, he proclaims that Delphine will be dead before morning. Delphine confronts Shay to apologize and tells her that she is giving Cosima permission to reveal everything to Shay, stating that the two are right for each other. She then visits Cosima at Bubbles, discreetly saying goodbye to Cosima and the other Leda clones. Delphine parks her car in a parking garage and is followed by unseen pursuer. Delphine asks [...] "what will happen to ?" [...] and receives no response; instead, the pursuer shoots Delphine, whose death is implied but not seen. Krystal confirms in season 4 that Delphine was picked up, alive, by after being shot. She has been on the Island in the north this whole time after being spared by PT Westmoreland, she reunites with a hypothermic Cosima. (recurring seasons 1 & 4–5; regular seasons 2–3) ...|$|E
