40|$|The {{organization}} {{concept of}} <b>Decentralized</b> <b>Equipment</b> and Process Responsibility (DEPR), {{developed at the}} Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) in Stuttgart, Germany, enables the integration of indirect company areas into the value creation process. The emerging decentralized production areas demand higher requirements on qualification, organization and responsibility from the employees involved in the value creation process. Only through a decentralized provision of information and company-specific knowledge {{is it possible for}} the employee to solve problems which arise on location without turning to central service areas...|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the {{power supply systems}} of {{independent}} and <b>decentralized</b> using <b>equipment,</b> which employ the plants of energy sources to be restored. The systems of hydraulic accumulation of thermal, mechanical, electric and radiant energy of sources to be restored have been classidied; the structural schemes of energy sets with the like sources {{on the basis of}} multilevel criteria have been presented. The procedure of ecology-economic substantiation of systems of independent power supply with regard to the regional aspects has been developed. The practical recommendations have been prepared and have been introduced. Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|This report reviews a {{range of}} solar energy systems {{designed}} to produce thermal and electrical energy directly from sunlight with units small enough to be located {{on or near the}} buildings they are designed to serve. It examines the state-of-the-art of the technology, identifies the circumstances under which such systems could be economicalIy attractive, and discusses the problems encountered in integrating these devices into existing energy generation and delivery systems. The study also assesses the impact that widespread use of <b>decentralized</b> solar energy <b>equipment</b> could have on the United States â€” its energy supplies, its ability to achieve foreign policy objectives, its physical environment, its levels and patterns of employment, and the functioning of society as a whole. It is apparent from the study that development of a large market for such equipment would have a profound impact on the way an industrial society evolves...|$|R
