50|$|By default, the {{computer}} is supposed to play first in the central square. The human player has then as a starter eight different types of DNA strands assigned to each of eight boxes that may be played. To indicate that box nr. i is being ticked, the human player pours into all bins the strands corresponding to input #i. These strands bind to certain DNA enzymes present in the bins, resulting {{in one of these}} two bins in the deformation of the DNA enzymes which binds to the substrate and cuts it. The corresponding bin becomes fluorescent, indicating which box is being played by the <b>DNA</b> <b>computer.</b> The various DNA enzymes are divided into various bins in such a way to ensure the victory of the <b>DNA</b> <b>computer</b> against the human player.|$|E

40|$|Both <b>DNA</b> and quantum <b>computers</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to exceed the power of conventional digital computers, though substantial technical difficulties first must be overcome. Through coherent superposition of states, quantum computers are more powerful than classical Turing machines. <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> are evolvable through biotechnology techniques.

50|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> {{have also}} been {{constructed}} using the concept of toehold exchange. In this system, an input DNA strand binds to a sticky end, or toehold, on another DNA molecule, which allows it to displace another strand segment from the molecule. This allows the creation of modular logic components such as AND, OR, and NOT gates and signal amplifiers, which can be linked into arbitrarily large computers. This class of <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> does not require enzymes or any chemical capability of the DNA.|$|R
50|$|DNA {{computing}} {{is a form}} {{of parallel}} computing in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once. For certain specialized problems, DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far. Furthermore, particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a <b>DNA</b> <b>computer.</b> As an example, DNA molecules have been utilized to tackle the assignment problem.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of solving the Hamiltonian path and cycle problems on conventional computers, they have also been studied in unconventional models of computing. For instance,Leonard Adleman showed that the Hamiltonian path problem may be solved using a <b>DNA</b> <b>computer.</b> Exploiting the parallelism inherent in chemical reactions, the problem may be solved using a number of chemical reaction steps linear in the number of vertices of the graph; however, it requires a factorial number of DNA molecules to participate in the reaction.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, J. Macdonald, D. Stefanovic and Mr. Stojanovic {{created a}} <b>DNA</b> <b>computer</b> {{able to play}} tic-tac-toe against a human player. The {{calculator}} consists of nine bins corresponding to the nine squares of the game. Each bin contains a substrate and various combinations of DNA enzymes. The substrate itself is composed of a DNA strand onto which was grafted a fluorescent chemical group at one end, and the other end, a repressor group. Fluorescence is only active if the molecules of the substrate are halved. The DNA enzyme simulate logical functions. For example, such a DNA will unfold if two specific types of DNA strand are introduced to reproducing the logic function AND.|$|E

40|$|Molecular <b>computers</b> (also called <b>DNA</b> <b>computers),</b> as an {{alternative}} to traditional electronic computers, are smaller in size but more energy efficient, and have massive parallel processing capacity.

This makes it attractive for silicon implementation. Inspired by the information processing method on the stickers computer, we propose a novel parallel computing model called DEM (DNA Electronic Computing Model) on System-on-a-Programmable-Chip (SOPC) architecture. Except for the significant difference in the computing medium—transistor chips rather than bio-molecules—the DEM works similarly to <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> in immense parallel information processing. Additionally, a plasma display panel (PDP) is used to show the change of solutions, and helps us directly see the distribution of assignments. The feasibility of the DEM is tested by applying it to compute a maximum clique problem (MCP) with eight vertices. Owing to the limited computing sources on SOPC architecture, the DEM could solve moderate-size problems in polynomial time...|$|R

His book advocated recycling of all waste, greater control of corporations to prevent pollution and waste, government support of environment-based technology development. His view was a positive vision of future industrial, military, agricultural and commercial technological developments. While the basis of his book was a single idea, he reflected that idea throughout history, cultural philosophy, technological change and invention as he [...] "charted the shift from machines to biology bolstered by computers: a type of 'new biology' in which human systems and machines meld to form new possibilities".|$|E
5000|$|Enzyme based DNA {{computers}} are usually {{of the form}} of a simple Turing machine; there is analogous hardware, in {{the form of a}}n enzyme, and software, in the form of DNA. Benenson, Shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a <b>DNA</b> <b>computer</b> using the FokI enzyme and expanded on their work by going on to show automata that diagnose and react to prostate cancer: under expression of the genes PPAP2B and GSTP1 and an over expression of PIM1 and HPN. Their automata evaluated the expression of each gene, one gene at a time, and on positive diagnosis then released a single strand DNA molecule (ssDNA) that is an antisense for MDM2. MDM2 is a repressor of protein 53, which itself is a tumor suppressor. On negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application in vivo, at least for use in [...] "cells of higher organisms". It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} address the {{incipient}} paradigm of using the biochemical molecule of DNA to solve computational problems. <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> use strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) to perform computing operations. The computer consists of two types of strands- the instruction strands and the input data strands. The instruction strands splice together the input data strands to generate the desired output data strand. Since the instruction strands are generic nucleotide codes for the various operations, <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> meet the accepted standard for being classed as true computers according to the Turing machine concept. A strong point in favor of DNA computing outlined by the experts is the potential storage capacity of DNA, which far exceeds that of the most advanced silicon storage devices. A major challenge that DNA circuit engineers face is the difficulty of predicting circuit performance at the design stage, with the consequence that actual construction requires significant experimental effort, even for very simple circuits.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} DNA {{computers}} are especially useful for running algorithms {{which are based on}} dynamic programming. This class of algorithms takes advantage of the large memory capacity of a <b>DNA</b> <b>computer.</b> We present algorithms for solving certain instances of the knapsack problem using a dynamic programming approach. Unlike other algorithms[1, 12] for DNA computers, which are brute force, dynamic programming is the same algorithm one would use to solve (smaller) problems on a conventional computer. 1 Introduction In a recent seminal paper [1], Adleman introduced the idea of computing using DNA molecules. Adleman's techniques were then generalized by Lipton [12] who showed that formula-SAT can be solved on a <b>DNA</b> <b>computer.</b> These algorithms essentially use a brute force approach to solve hard combinatorial problems.

40|$|Biomolecular computers, {{along with}} quantum computers, {{may be a}} future {{alternative}} for traditional, silicon-based computers. Main advantages of biomolecular computers are massive parallel processing of data, expanded capacity of storing information and compatibility with living organisms (first attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of improper genetic information are described in Benenson et al. (2004). However, biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory implementations of theoretically designed <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> (like the Turing machine and pushdown automaton), {{but there are many}} implementations of <b>DNA</b> <b>computers</b> for particular problems. The first practical laboratory implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton established by Benenson et al. (2001). In the present work, we propose a new attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works. This creates an opportunity to implement in laboratories of more complex finite automata and other theoretical models of computers: pushdown automata, Turing machines.
