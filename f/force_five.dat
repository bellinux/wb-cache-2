500|$|On 8 August, Montenegrin gun {{batteries}} on Mount Lovćen began shelling the Austro-Hungarian at Cattaro. At the time, Kaiser Karl VI was {{the only}} large warship in the harbor, and so she assisted the local army artillery in attempting to suppress the hostile guns. The Austro-Hungarian gunners were aided by navy seaplanes that could spot the fall of their shots. On 13 September, the three s arrived to strengthen the Austro-Hungarian <b>force.</b> <b>Five</b> days later, a French artillery battery was landed in Montenegro to reinforce the guns on Lovćen {{with the aim of}} eventually capturing the port, which prompted the Austro-Hungarians to send the pre-dreadnought battleship [...] with its [...] guns. By 27 October, the French and Montenegrin gun batteries had been silenced, and the French abandoned its attempt to seize Cattaro.|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{began the}} regular season on November 8 with a 69–42 victory against UMass Lowell. Several {{returning}} players set (or tied) career highs, and six freshman saw their first action. The game followed a ceremony in which the team raised a banner to the rafters to celebrate its 2013 NCAA tournament regional championship and national runner-up finish. On November 12, against South Carolina State, Michigan opened a 59–23 lead at halftime by making 12 of 19 three-point attempts and won 93–59. Stauskas and LeVert set career highs in points, combining to make 11 of 13 from the three-point line, and Horford added a career-high 15 rebounds. After missing the preseason and first two regular season games, Mitch McGary returned to play against Iowa State on November 17 (posting nine points, six rebounds and four steals) as Michigan lost its {{first game of the}} season 77–70. The Wolverines defeated Long Beach State {{in the first round of}} the 2013 Puerto Rico Tip-Off on November 21, as Michigan set a tournament record by making 14 three-point shots. The next day (against Florida State in the semifinals), Michigan was behind by 10 points at halftime, 16 points with 17:16 remaining and 63–54 with a few minutes left before winning 82–80 in overtime. In the final four minutes, Michigan used a 1-3-1 zone to <b>force</b> <b>five</b> turnovers during a 13–5 spurt to make up a 64–56 deficit. On November 24, the team lost the championship game to Charlotte on a last second tip-in; although Stauskas was the tournament's MVP, the team fell to 0–2 all-time against Charlotte. During the game, [...] "Caris LeVert missed most of the first half in foul trouble. Glenn Robinson III missed the final 30 minutes with a back injury after taking a tough first-half fall, and Nik Stauskas...played the final 9½ minutes with a twisted ankle." [...] Leading scorer Stauskas sat out the November 29 game against Coppin State, but with 24 points from freshman Zak Irvin Michigan won 87–45; McGary and Morgan made their first starts of the season. Irvin's performance was recognized on December 2, when he was the Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} as deputy commissioner, Woods became well educated on gang related {{violence}} and was a supporter of Inspector Joseph Petrosino and the [...] "Italian Squad", a special detectives unit which combated organized crime in Italian-American neighborhoods.

"Uds daggers and scabbard, madam," [...] said Bucklaw, {{whom this}} {{observation}} brought at once upon his own ground, [...] "there is no difficulty or merit in that matter at all, {{so that a}} fellow is not too much afraid of having a pair of antlers in his guts. I have hunted at <b>force</b> <b>five</b> hundred times, madam; and I never yet saw the stag at bay, by land or water, but I durst have gone roundly in on him. It is all use and wont, madam; and I'll tell you, madam, for all that, {{it must be done}} with good heed and caution; and you will do well, madam, to have your hunting-sword right sharp and double-edged, that you may strike either fore-handed or back-handed, as you see reason, for a hurt with a buck's horn is a perilous ad somewhat venomous matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A worthy {{ambition}} indeed, and one that, {{so far as}} {{my experience}} goes, very few knights entertain. I see yearly scores of young knights depart, no small proportion of whom never place foot on Rhodes again, although doubtless {{many of them will}} hasten back again as soon as the danger of an assault from the Turks becomes imminent. You see, we who dwell here under the protection of the Order naturally talk over these things among ourselves; and although, in the matter of fortifications, all will admit that enormous efforts have been made to render the town secure, it is clear that in the matter of knights to defend them there is very much left to be desired. It is all very well to say that the knights from all parts of Europe would flock hither to defend it; but the journey would be a long one, and would occupy much time, and they would probably not receive news that the Turks had sailed until the place was already invested. Then it would be difficult, if not altogether impossible, for ships with reinforcements to make their way through the Turkish fleet, and to enter the port. To man the walls properly would need a <b>force</b> <b>five</b> times as numerous as that which is now here. I recognise the valour of your knights; they have accomplished wonders. But even they cannot accomplish impossibilities. For a time they could hold the walls; but as their number became reduced by the fire of the Turkish cannon and the battles at the breaches, they would at last be too weak any longer to repel the onslaughts of foes with an almost unlimited supply of soldiers." ...|$|E

6000|$|Advices met {{him on the}} way, {{that the}} {{combined}} fleets, having captured the Diamond Rock, were then at Martinique on the fourth, and were expected to sail that night for the attack of Granada. On the 9th Nelson arrived off that island; and there learned that they had passed to leeward of Antigua the preceding day, and had taken a homeward-bound convoy. Had {{it not been for}} false information, upon which Nelson had acted reluctantly, and in opposition to his own judgment, he would have been off Port Royal just as they were leaving; it, and the battle would have been fought on the spot where Rodney defeated De Grasse. This he remembered in his vexation; but he had saved the colonies, and above 200 ships laden for Europe, which would else have fallen into the enemy's hands; and he had the satisfaction of knowing that the mere terror of his name had effected this, and had put to flight the allied enemies, whose force nearly doubled that before which they fled. That they were flying back to Europe he believed, and for Europe he steered in pursuit on the 13th, having disembarked the troops at Antigua, and taking with him the SPARTIATE, seventy-four; the only addition to the squadron with which he was pursuing so superior a <b>force.</b> <b>Five</b> days afterwards the AMAZON brought intelligence that she had spoke a schooner who had seen them on the evening of the 15th, steering to the north; and by computation, eighty-seven leagues off. Nelson's diary at this time denotes his great anxiety and his perpetual and all-observing vigilance. [...] "June 21. Midnight, nearly calm, saw three planks, which I think came from the French fleet. Very miserable, which is very foolish." [...] On the 17th of July he came in sight of Cape St. Vincent, and steered for Gibraltar. [...] "June 18th," [...] his diary says, [...] "Cape Spartel in sight, but no French fleet, nor any information about them. How sorrowful this makes me! but I cannot help myself." [...] The next day he anchored at Gibraltar; and on the 20th, says he, [...] "I went on shore {{for the first time since}} June 16, 1803; and from having my foot out of the VICTORY two years, wanting ten days." ...|$|E
