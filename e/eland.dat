5|$|Common elands are {{resistant}} to trypanosomiasis, a protozoan infection that has the tsetse fly as a vector, {{but not to the}} Rhipicephalus-transmitted disease theileriosis. The disease-causing bacteria Theileria taurotragi has caused many <b>eland</b> deaths. Clostridium chauvoei, another bacterium, can be harmful as well. <b>Eland</b> are also hosts to several kinds of ticks. In one study an <b>eland</b> was found to be host to the Amblyomma species A. gemma and A. variegatum, and Rhipicephalus species R. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus, R. evertsi, R. pulchellus and R. pravus. Elands produce antibodies for Brucella bacteria, but none for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>eland</b> is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to <b>eland.</b> Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>eland</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1766 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas. It {{belongs to the}} order Artiodactyla, family Bovidae and subfamily Bovinae. Common elands are sometimes {{considered part of the}} genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but are usually categorized as Taurotragus, along with the giant <b>eland</b> (T. derbianus).|$|E

5|$|Mainly a herbivore, its diet is {{primarily}} grasses and leaves. Common elands form herds {{of up to}} 500 animals, but are not territorial. The common <b>eland</b> prefers habitats {{with a wide variety}} of flowering plants such as savannah, woodlands, and open and montane grasslands; it avoids dense forests. It uses loud barks, visual and postural movements and the flehmen response to communicate and warn others of danger. The common <b>eland</b> is used by humans for leather, meat, and rich, nutritious milk, and has been domesticated in many areas.|$|E
500|$|<b>Elands</b> {{prefer to}} live in {{semi-arid}} areas that contain many shrub-like bushes, and often inhabit grasslands, woodlands, sub-desert, bush, and mountaintops with altitudes of about [...] <b>Elands</b> do, however, avoid forests, swamps and deserts. The places inhabited by <b>elands</b> generally contain Acacia, Combretum, Commiphora, Diospyros, Grewia, Rhus and Ziziphus trees and shrubs; some of these also serve as their food.|$|R
50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the <b>eland's</b> diet. A study of giant <b>elands</b> in the Bandia Natural reserve in Senegal revealed {{that the most important}} and most preferred plants were various species of Acacia, Terminalia and Combretum, along with Azadirachta indica, Danielia olliveri, Lonchocarpus laxiflorus, Maytenus senegalensis, Prosopis africana, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Saba senegalensis and pods of Piliostigma thonningii. Another study in Sudan showed that western giant <b>elands</b> preferred Cassia tora, which was the most abundant legume in the region.|$|R
50|$|South Africa {{formally}} retired its Eland-90 fleet in 1994. The last SANDF exercise involving <b>Elands</b> of any description {{was held}} in 1996. Of the 1,268 still accounted for in 1991, only 235 remained by 1998. A statistic released by the Department of Defence in 1997 confirmed that <b>Elands</b> valued in excess of 41.3 million rand had been scrapped. In October 2005, all the SANDF's remaining <b>Elands</b> were offered for sale. Tenders for Eland-90s were still available in 2009.|$|R
5|$|T. o. livingstonii (Sclater, 1864; Livingstone's eland): {{also called}} kaufmanni, niediecki, selousi and triangularis. It {{is found in}} the Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands. Livingstone's <b>eland</b> has a brown pelt with up to twelve stripes.|$|E
5|$|T. o. pattersonianus (Lydekker, 1906; East African <b>eland</b> or Patterson's eland): {{also called}} billingae. It {{is found in}} east Africa, hence its common name. Its coat can have up to 12 stripes.|$|E
5|$|The Bovidae family {{ancestors}} of the common <b>eland</b> evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear 6 million years in the past during the late Miocene. An extinct ancestor of the common <b>eland</b> (Taurotragus arkelli) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria.|$|E
50|$|Renowned {{archaeologist}} John Parkington excavated <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave in the 1970s providing vast {{information of}} the cave's inhabitants. Parkington frequently used methods of comparing various characteristics in his findings {{in order to}} highlight phases of transformations at <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave. Other archaeologists and specialists have analyzed the findings from Parkington. Parkington, Cartwright, Cowling, Baxter, and Meadows (2000), analyzed wood charcoal and pollen data from <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave to explain the environmental change. Klein, in 2001 studied fossil remains and faunal data to indicate hunter-gatherer behavioral and cultural adaptations. In 1999, Cowling, Cartwright, Parkington, & Allsopp researched wood charcoal in order to explain environmental changes. Woodborne, Hart, & Parkington (1995) researched seal bones to construct the timing and the duration of hunter-gatherer coastal journeys. Orton (2006) examined raw materials to produce a lithic sequence for the Later Stone Age in <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave. Lastly, Matthews (1999) used taphonomy and previous research by Peter Andrews to understand the formation and interpretation of micromammals at <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave.|$|R

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common <b>eland</b> is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common <b>eland</b> and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing {{during the rainy}} season when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The <b>eland</b> can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the <b>eland</b> eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of an east African common <b>eland</b> (T. o. pattersonianus) with an east African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the <b>eland</b> and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coastline}} of <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave {{has changed}} dramatically {{since the end of}} the Ice Age. [...] A coastal plain once extended some 20 km west of <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave into the sea. [...] Heavier rainfall and different ocean levels allowed <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave to be a lush environment in the past. Testing of faunal remains, bones, and wood charcoals provided evidence of wetter conditions in the terminal Pleistocene. During that time, the environment consisted of colder weather with heavier rain fall which created vegetation that was different than it is today. Now, it has become a drier environment with different species residing there. Rainfall from 9,600 to 13,600 years ago produced 400 mm comparable to today’s 300 mm. More recent environmental conditions near <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave are characteristic of mild weather with an approximated 200-250 mm per year of rainfall occurring every winter. [...] <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave is in close proximity (approximately 3 kilometers) to a rich intertidal environment supporting numerous shellfish species, sea birds, kelp beds, and marine mammals.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Heritage Western Cape {{declared}} the <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave {{and most of}} Baboon Point (Cape Deseada), on which it is located, as a provincial heritage site. <b>Eland's</b> Bay along with much of this coastline is an [...] "important" [...] bird habitat.

5|$|A 1992 phylogenetic {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequences showed a strong {{possibility of a}} clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera Bubalus, Bos, Pseudoryx (saola), Syncerus (African Buffalo), Bison and the extinct Pelorovis. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (<b>eland)</b> and Tragelaphus. A closer relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by a similar study in 1999.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eland</b> herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States Endangered Species Act, and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common <b>eland</b> to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E

5|$|An avid {{conservationist}} and hunter, Burnham {{supported the}} early conservation programs {{of his friends}} Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa {{with the goal of}} finding large animals such as Giant <b>Eland,</b> hippopotamus, zebra, and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture to ask for help in importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.|$|E
5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If <b>eland</b> bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{states that}} about half of the {{estimated}} total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common <b>eland</b> now live on private land, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, as well as in Russia and Ukraine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a selection of}} Later Stone Age lithic assemblages from eight <b>Elands</b> Bay sites, including a large sample from <b>Elands</b> Bay Cave. The use of broader, more inclusive terms for Later Stone Age lithic industries in southern Africa is suggested, and subsequently supported by the <b>Elands</b> Bay assemblages which are shown to be atypical when compared to similarly dated assemblages from elsewhere. The <b>Elands</b> Bay assemblages are grouped according to their age and features, and the primary characteristics of each period are outlined. In this way the full lithic sequence for the area is described, with emphasis being placed on the transitional assemblages and the sequence of changes in raw materials, flaking techniques and formal tools that occur through time. Gross industrial change is gradual and boundaries between industries cannot readily be identified. A relatively more distinct change just after 1000 b. p. supports the assertion that herders may have populated the Cape only from about that time onwards.
