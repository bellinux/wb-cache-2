5|$|Severus Alexander {{held him}} in high esteem {{and made him}} his consul again. His Roman History spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. As a {{contemporary}} of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the Augustan History, although by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission</b> Dio spent {{the greater part of}} the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand information.|$|E
5|$|At Wimbledon, Del Potro won against Albert Ramos, Jesse Levine, and Grega Žemlja before {{advancing}} {{past the}} fourth round {{for the first}} time in his career, thanks to a win over Andreas Seppi. He then played David Ferrer and, despite slipping badly during the fifth point of the match and aggravating a pre-existing leg injury, requiring over five minutes of treatment and by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission</b> being close to forfeiting the match, he recovered to defeat Ferrer in straight sets to advance to his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 2009 US Open without dropping a set. On 5 July, Djokovic defeated him in five sets in 4 hours and 43 minutes, making it the longest semifinal in the history of Wimbledon men's singles.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
50|$|In one of Drayton's poems, an elegy or epistle to Mr Henry Reynolds, he {{has left}} some {{valuable}} criticisms on English poets from Chaucer's time to <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> including Shakespeare.

"And don't you think," [...] the {{observer}} said, with a Socratic subtlety that betrayed itself in his gleaming eye, in the joyous hope of seeing his victim {{fall into the}} pit that <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admissions</b> had digged for him, [...] "and don't {{you think that it}} would also bring to you the unpleasant consciousness of having stiffened in your tastes?" ...|$|R
5|$|At Arsenal, Fàbregas {{also often}} assumed {{responsibility}} for set pieces, taking corners, free kicks and penalties. By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> scoring was a weaker {{part of his}} game in his first few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring. There were also concerns raised over {{the large number of}} games Fàbregas was playing for club and country at such a young age, but while he initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|On 14 January 1892, {{six weeks}} after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia, leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just {{recovered}} from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with typhoid fever, the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert. Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning. A year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George was, on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission)</b> mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E

By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admissions</b> in an interview from 2009, Smith claimed he [...] "ran out of things to say" [...] and called for the audience to offer words, names and places, with which he improvised a comic rap. According to Smith, the venue managers were impressed and invited him to perform a short set at a late-night variety show named Spank! ...|$|R
60|$|Let us compare these assertions {{with the}} facts. That {{there may be}} perfect fairness, let us make no choice, but take as the field for our comparison, the {{succeeding}} section treating of the first science--Mathematics; and let us use none but M.

Comte says, that the parts of each science must be arranged {{in the order of}} their decreasing generality; and that this order of decreasing generality agrees with the order of historical development. Our inquiry must be, then, whether the history of mathematics confirms this statement.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is nothing}} to be said in mitigation. For Göring was often, indeed almost always, the moving force, second only to his leader. He was the leading war aggressor, both as {{political}} and as military leader; he was the director of the slave labour programme and the creator of the oppressive programme against the Jews and other races, at home and abroad. All of these crimes he has frankly admitted. On some specific cases there may be conflict of testimony, {{but in terms of the}} broad outline, <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admissions</b> are more than sufficiently wide to be conclusive of his guilt. His guilt is unique in its enormity. The record discloses no excuses for this man.|$|R
5|$|Jovanović {{began working}} on the {{painting}} in 1900. In keeping with his usual approach, he spent {{a significant amount of}} time researching Dušan's life. He read medieval accounts of the proclamation, consulted experts on that historical period, and examined medieval paintings and illuminated manuscripts for insight into the architecture and weaponry of 14th-century Serbia. Jovanović also visited the monasteries of Gračanica and Lesnovo, the Field of Kosovo, and the cities of Prizren and Skopje. Since the church where the proclamation took place had long since been destroyed, he was forced to find an alternative, ultimately deciding to model it after the Visoki Dečani monastery given the similarities in their design. By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> the hardest task Jovanović faced was achieving authenticity with regard to clothing, weaponry and medieval heraldry. He found the medieval clothing particularly difficult to reproduce because Serbs did not have their own national costume at the time. Instead, medieval Serbs, especially royalty and the nobility, wore clothing that was greatly influenced by neighbouring cultures, particularly the Byzantines. Jovanović styled the clothes seen in the painting on frescoes from the medieval monasteries he visited, sketched them, and then requested that the head costume designer of the Vienna State Opera recreate them based on those sketches. Upon receiving the costumes, Jovanović placed them in his studio and used them as models for the painting. Dušan's German mercenaries, who are shown lining the church doors church as he exits, wear Venetian body armour. Jovanović based this detail on a medieval correspondence that Novaković had discovered in the Venetian archives where Dušan is recorded having ordered 300 units of plate armour from Venice. Knights' swords and other weaponry were based on depictions from medieval frescoes. The heraldry depicted on the shields and the insignia of the various figures is based on examples from a medieval book titled Armaila Illyricorum. Jovanović had found the book in a Viennese library. It had been removed from Herzegovina's Žitomislić monastery several decades prior and brought to the Austro-Hungarian capital. The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex was painted outdoors, en plein air.|$|E

I charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception, {{for the sole purpose}} of nationalizing slavery.|$|R

50|$|In 1920 Enzo {{joined the}} racing {{department}} of Alfa Romeo as a driver. In 1924 Ferrari won the Coppa Acerbo at Pescara, a success that encouraged Alfa Romeo {{to offer him}} a chance to race in much more prestigious competitions. Deeply shocked by the death of Antonio Ascari in 1925, Ferrari, by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admissions,</b> continued to race light-heartly. Following the birth of his son Dino in 1932, Ferrari decided to retire and to focus instead on the management and development of the factory Alfa cars, eventually building up a raceteam of over forty drivers, including Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari. This team was called Scuderia Ferrari (founded by Enzo in 1929) and acted as a racing division for Alfa Romeo. The team had many successes, for example with the Alfa Romeo P3. Their talented drivers, like Nuvolari, also contributed to this succes.|$|R
2500|$|By 1975, Gacy's {{business}} was expanding rapidly; by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> later <b>admission,</b> {{he began working}} 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon {{an increasing number of}} contracts. Gacy also freely admitted that 1975 was also the year in which he began to increase the frequency of his excursions for sex with young males.

50|$|After being {{discharged}} {{at the end}} of {{his tour}} of duty on May 8, 1970, he found himself unable to find a good job and a year later reenlisted in order to further his education. He again affirmed his sexual orientation and was re-admitted. At times he dressed in drag and performed as a female impersonator under the name Simone, first in civilian life and then while stationed in West Germany where he performed at shows sponsored by the Army. His success led to engagements at enlisted men's clubs on other U.S. bases in Europe. At one point in 1972 military investigators considered removing him from the service on account of his sexual orientation but ended their investigation with the conclusion that <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admissions</b> were insufficient and closed their investigation when Watkins would not provide the names of any others. Other assignments took him to Korea and then to Italy. He reenlisted for a six-year term in 1974.|$|R
25|$|Entering {{upon the}} scene late and inebriated, he {{pays tribute to}} Socrates. Like Agathon and Aristophanes, Alcibiades is a {{historical}} person from ancient Athens.

By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> he is very handsome.|$|E
25|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career at Kent {{before moving to}} Warwickshire in 2005.

25|$|The stereotypical {{views about}} blacks {{imparted}} to s Mike Mizanin by his uncle offended Coral Smith and Nicole Mitsch when he related them, {{and they tried}} to educate him on African American culture. They were also offended by the fact that biracial roommate Malik Cooper wore a T-shirt with the image of Marcus Garvey, who was against miscegenation, despite the fact that Cooper was of mixed heritage and by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission</b> had never dated a black woman.|$|E
50|$|When Billy was 13, his {{grandparents}} asked William S. Burroughs to take Billy back. He agreed, and Billy was sent alone by air to Tangiers, Morocco, {{to live with}} his father. In Tangiers, Billy was introduced to marijuana, and he experienced several episodes of grown men attempting to rape him. By <b>his</b> father's <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> the visit was a failed attempt to rehabilitate their relationship. After Burroughs' lover, Ian Sommerville, convinced William that his son was irrevocably homesick, Billy returned to Palm Beach.|$|R
50|$|A very diligent student, Barwick was {{admitted}} to legal practice soon after finishing university, although (on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> later <b>admission)</b> he suffered severely in financial terms during the Great Depression. He was guarantor for a bank loan to his younger brother to operate a service station in Ashfield, {{but was unable to}} repay the bank when the loan was forfeited, and was made bankrupt after he sued the oil companies for defamation. This was held against him by many throughout his career.|$|R
50|$|By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{explicit}} <b>admission,</b> <b>his</b> {{first impulse}} to write {{came from his}} contact with the archives firstly of Nonantola and then of Ravenna. In Ravenna he came to know, as he himself recounts, the Chronicon, {{that is to say}} the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius of Caesarea, in the Chronicon (Chronicle) of Saint Jerome, and in all probability also the so-called Ravenna Cosmography; at Nonantola he certainly had access to the sequel to Jerome’s work, written this time by Saint Prosper of Aquitaine.|$|R
25|$|King {{assembled}} his own band; the B.B. King Review, {{under the}} leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone), George Coleman (tenor saxophone), Floyd Newman (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), George Joyner (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). Onzie Horne was a trained musician elicited as an arranger to assist King with his compositions.

25|$|Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, {{leader of}} the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, helped found the American Labor Party (ALP) in 1936. At the time Dubinsky and Hillman were both nominal members of the Socialist Party, {{although}} Dubinsky had, by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> allowed his membership to lapse during the factional fighting of the 1920s. The Labor Party served as a halfway house for socialists and other leftists {{who were willing to}} vote for liberal Democratic politicians such as Roosevelt or Governor Herbert Lehman of New York, but who were not prepared to join the Democratic Party itself.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{officers}} of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable {{interest in the}} American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, {{he decided to take}} a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>admission,</b> his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface: On 2 March 1863, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the mail steamer, Atrato.|$|E
50|$|Upon learning, by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> daughter's <b>admission</b> to him, that Julieta {{had fallen}} in love with Romulo, Mr. Rossini forgives Romulo and {{actually}} begins to like him.
