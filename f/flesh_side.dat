This medieval practice of collating parchment leaves of manuscripts so that the hair sides faced {{each other and the}} <b>flesh</b> <b>sides</b> faced each other was named for the first person credited with noting the practice, Caspar Rene Gregory (1846 – 1917) [8]. In this manuscript, it was not always possible to ascertain the hair and <b>flesh</b> <b>sides</b> because the parchment was so finely prepared, very thin (approximately 3 – 3.5 mils, 75 – 90 microns), generally quite white, and often without much evidence of hair follicles. Despite this drawback, the collation diagrams have provided insights and are useful in reconstructing possible locations of missing leaves.|$|R

50|$|The Salish used {{mountain}} goat wool, or SAH-ay, as {{the main}} source of fiber for weaving. Blankets made from goat hair were the most valuable. Originally, the Salish obtained wool high in the mountains where the mountain goats spent their summers and shed their old wool. Wool might be found caught or tangled in low bushes. During this season, they would also save wool acquired from goats killed for food. They would roll up the skin with <b>flesh</b> <b>sides</b> together and after several days, the wool would shed naturally. Then it was plucked off to be made into yarn. Before the raw fiber was spun into workable threads, it was mixed with a white chalk-like clay, absorbing the grease allowing the wool fibers to cling together. Domestic sheep wool has now fully replaced mountain goat wool, which is rare and difficult to obtain.|$|R

50|$|From the Carolingian {{period and}} {{all the way up to}} the Middle Ages, {{different}} styles of folding the quire came about.

The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the “spine” of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Leather tanning with vegetative materials {{is one of the}} artisanal preoccupations of some craftsmen in the Upper East Region of Ghana. The leathers produced are however, limited to only three colours; brown, white and black. Their usage in multi-coloured applications by leather crafters in the region is therefore very much restricted. Some of the artisans therefore import leathers from other leather producing communities outside Ghana to supplement the local ones. This stifles the growth of the industry and robs the region and the country of the much needed foreign exchange. This experimental research therefore explored the use of basic dyes, which are cheap and readily available in the area, to extend the colour range of the vegetable tanned leathers manufactured in the region. The research showed that even though the dyed leathers were quite fugitive when exposed to extreme sunlight; and were not dyed-through thoroughly, the affinity of the dyes to the grain and <b>flesh</b> <b>sides</b> of the leathers were admirable. The leathers also exhibited excellent colour brilliance, softness and flexibility. It was found out that the dyed leathers could be suitably used in crafting utilitarian articles such as hand bags...|$|R

50|$|Certainly {{to obtain}} the best price for the fish caught during the fishing season {{the quality of the}} fish was of prime {{importance}} and care was taken to ensure a profitable catch. When the fish was taken from the saltbulk it was then washed of excess salt and film that had formed during the curing process. The salted cod was then transported to the fish flakes by two men carrying a barrow. The fish was then spread out in a very neat and tidy order by placing them alternately heads and tails. These were first laid face-up, which is <b>flesh</b> <b>side</b> exposed to the sun. As the fish dried it was then flipped over to dry {{the back side of the}} salted cod. Before nightfall when the air became damp the fish was gathered up and placed in neat piles called faggots to minimize the exposed area of the fish. As the fish became dry enough for marketability it was then stored in the fish store until most if not all of the seasons harvest was dried in this fashion. The drying of fish may have taken up to week to completely dry. The whole process of drying the complete season catch may have taken a month or two as space and manpower permitted.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subsequent}} European {{method of}} manufacture was described in 1906 as follows: In the preparation of enamelled leather, a foundation coat of lampblack mixed with linseed oil has been laid on the <b>flesh</b> <b>side,</b> since the infancy of the industry in Europe. Successive coats of this mixture are applied, the skin being allowed to dry and the surface ground down with pumice-stone" [...] after each coat. Then the skins are blackened again with a fluid black mixed with turpentine, and hung up to dry again. After the skins {{have been allowed to}} settle, being laid in a pile for about a month's time, or longer if possible, the leather is tacked onto a frame and receives a brush coat of varnish. A baking follows in an oven of moderate heat. The temperature is gradually raised and the baking continued three days. Exposure to the sun for ten hours completes the process. Recently American manufacturers have been making patent leather from chrome-tanned skins. The product is quite different, as is also the process employed. The leather is softer, more flexible, and takes a less brilliant polish than that made from bark-tanned leather, but it is much less likely to crack and is more suitable for shoes than the brittle and inflexible leather made by the older process.|$|E

A few would be kept for the family's own use with others reared and sold on. There would normally be two kills on the farm per year, one in April and one in October.To begin the home slaughter of pigs, a tub of brine was prepared and covered. The pigs would be killed on site by the man of the house, with blood drained into an enamel dish for his wife to make blood pudding (she would also take the intestine, which was rinsed out to hold the pudding). Entrails were removed and the liver and kidneys would be saved. The head would be removed and boiled for hours to salvage whatever was possible.Salt was fundamental to the curing of pork, not only to preserve the meat but to eliminate pathogens. Split down the middle, the sides of the pig would be set on a bench and handfuls of salt rubbed in, first on the <b>flesh</b> <b>side</b> and then the skin side. Often, two people would be involved, and hours would be spent ensuring the sides were thoroughly salted - around 4lbs of salt for each flank. Laid then on the floor, skin-side down, often on a bed of straw, sacking or jute would then be thrown over and, after a few days, the salt would be further trampled in by men standing on the jute. Hung up on hooks with sacking over, portions were cut off as required. Pork/bacon could also be smoked in the chimney. Hanging sides of pork would be wrapped in muslin to keep off flies.When the pig was stunned and the throat slit, an enamel basin or bucket was used to catch the blood drained from the pig. Salt was added to prevent coagulation. Intestines were washed in running water. Oatmeal was mixed in, along with some herbs and spices, salt and pepper. Sometimes using a funnel, the mixture was then fed into the intestine, cut and tied at lengths of a foot, put on a tray and steamed over hot water for several hours. The lengths of pudding were then left out into the 'dairy' or outhouse and sliced off for frying at suppertime as required. The taste of home-made pudding was said by all respondents to be incomparable to the manufactured alternative.

40|$|The Australian mango {{industry}} has developed significantly in recent years, based {{mainly on the}} cultivar Kensington Pride. Although there is increasing demand for fresh mangoes (Mangifera indica L.), postharvest disease anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, causes major losses. Researchers are interested in finding alternatives to chemical fungicides for the control of anthracnose in mango, so the aims {{of this study were}} to characterise natural defence mechanisms in Kensington Pride mango fruit against the anthracnose-causing fungus C. gloeosporioides. The five specific objectives addressed in this research were: 1. To identify and quantify preformed resorcinol compounds that may provide resistance to anthracnose in Kensington Pride mango fruit. 2. To determine the effect of chemical resistance activators (e. g. Bion® and Kasil®), biological activators (C. gloeosporioides and C. musae), and physical activators (e. g. UV-C radiation) on anthracnose progression. 3. To determine the effect of chemical activators on the concentrations of preformed resorcinols. 4. To determine the effect of plant activators on activities of pathogenesis-related proteins. 5. To determine the effect of resistance activators on fruit ripening (e. g. colour and firmness changes). Two main preformed alk(en) ylresorcinols, 5 -heptadecenylresorcinol and 5 - pentadecylresorcinol were extracted from Kensington Pride mango fruit. Of the two, the levels of 5 -heptadecenylresorcinol were much higher than those of 5 - pentadecylresorcinol. However, in vitro antifungal activity of 5 -heptadecenylresorcinol against C. gloeosporioides was significantly lower than that of 5 -pentadecylresorcinol. The levels of these preformed resorcinols were very high in the immature fruit and decreased during fruit development, but they remained stable during ripening. The concentration of resorcinols also varied within the fruit. Fruit peel contained larger quantities of alk(en) ylresorcinols than the <b>flesh,</b> and <b>sides</b> of fruit that were exposed to natural ultraviolet radiation during fruit development contained higher concentrations of alk(en) ylresorcinols than those not exposed. A series of experiments was conducted to determine the efficacy of preharvest and postharvest treatments with plant resistance activators in inducing fruit resistance. Preharvest dips of Bion® did not consistently induce fruit resistance. Significant variation was noted in this study between different fruit seasons and production areas, but application of the activator to well maintained mango trees resulted in better induction than in poorly managed trees. Activation of fruit resistance by C. gloeosporioides or C. musae pre-inoculations was not successful in this study, and different types of biological activators may need to be tested on mango. The effectiveness of plant activators was influenced by the method of application. Bion® and Kasil®, when applied as soil drenches, significantly reduced disease progression, but dipping produced variable results. As this experiment was only performed once, more research needs to be carried out to confirm these results. All temperature treatments, including dry hot air (38 °C, 48 h), hot water dip (55 °C, 2 or 5 min) and low temperature (10 °C, 1 week) decreased disease severity upon subsequent challenge-inoculation with C. gloeosporioides. Adding Bion® to hot water did not further reduce severity. Postharvest exposure of mango fruit to UV-C radiation significantly reduced disease progression. The effectiveness of the UV-C radiation in inducing mango resistance was influenced by time of application. Exposing mango fruit to UV-C radiation before inoculation with C. gloeosporioides provided better induction of fruit resistance than in those fruit that were exposed after inoculation. UV-C radiation was more effective when applied to fruit directly after harvest, whereas delayed treatment with UV-C radiation after harvest did not consistently increase fruit resistance. The mechanism of fruit resistance is very complex, and may be associated with induction of preformed antifungal compounds or induction of enzymes associated with induced resistance, such as β- 1, 3 -glucanase and chitinase. However, none of the activators significantly increased the level of preformed alk(en) ylresorcinols or the activities of β- 1, 3 -glucanase and chitinase. Different mechanisms may be involved in the resistance of mango to anthracnose. In conclusion, induction of fruit resistance by applying activators may be an effective and environmentally friendly method to use as a tool in an integrated crop management system for the control of anthracnose disease in Kensington Pride mango. However, more research still needs to be carried out to determine the role of preformed alk(en) ylresorcinols and other resistance components, and the means to maximise production of these compounds in the fruit...|$|R

That suet which lies next to it is the suet of the small intestines, which is prohibited according to the Geonim, of blessed memory. They take precaution, likewise, over that side which clings somewhat unto the ileum (Heb. Senei Dhebei = [...] "hatred of wolves"), surgically removing all of it thoroughly. They also take precaution to remove all of the suet that is found upon the abomasum (Heb. Kevah) externally, which is known as the ḥūmṣā, until nothing remains of it. Moreover, they take away the suet which is inside the abomasum, from within, which distinctively adheres itself to the abomasum. Yet, that which is not spread out like a blanket is that which is permitted, it being that which is ritually clean, and it is called bar ḥūmṣā. Now that which is spread over the omasum (Heb. Messos) the reticulum like a blanket is forbidden, which is an even layer of fat covered with a membrane and easily peeled, and which happens to be included among the [...] "suet which lies upon the innards." [...] Now they scrape away suet from the intestine which comes out of the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach) for the space of about a cubit (ca. 54 cm.), it also being the suet of the small intestines which is prohibited according to Maimonides, (Nachmanides) and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, seeing that it is a close neighbour to the suet which lies upon the innards. Afterwards, they take out all of the entrails (intestines), and the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), as well as the liver, aside from the mesentery (Heb. Ḥalūḥelet), for he still needs to clean it from the suet which is upon it. Afterwards, they peel away all of that lining membrane which is upon the flanks, which is forbidden on account of suet. They are scrupulous about its removal that nothing remains of it. The beginning of its place is from where there is the white tissue which is in the centre of the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs, extending downwards unto the thighs the hind legs and running width-wise along all the flanks, unto the spinal column (vertebrae). They remove it (i.e. the lining membrane) with the suet that lies upon it which is situate at the end of the thighs and which lies upon that flesh which is beneath the loins, which is called [...] "lonbel" [...] in the foreign, French language and mutemaziqah in Arabic. Now this suet is categorically included among the suet which lies upon the flanks. Afterwards, they pull out the five [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are upon the flanks, these being three on the right side and two on the left. The three on the right side, each one branches off into two separate veins, while the two [...] "threads" [...] on the left side, each one of them branches off into three separate veins, while one of its heads is attached to the spinal column, and they are called the [...] "threads (nerves) that are in the hip," [...] the [...] "threads of the walls the chest," [...] and the [...] "threads that are upon the flanks," [...] their prohibition being on account of suet. Now if they are pulled off while they are still warm, they can be pulled off altogether. However, if they have become cold, they can no longer be pulled off, and one must then poke around after them. Afterwards, they rend with a knife the thin membrane that is conspicuously located upon the two sides of the spinal column, beneath the loins and extending as far as the ribs. It is the place that appears to the eyesight as a whitish colour by the light of the sun or by the light of a candle from the hind side of the animal, and which can be seen on its inside, and where there is no flesh that lies upon it. After the membrane has been rent, they remove the forbidden fat (suet) that is beneath it, extending down as far as the edible fat that lies beneath that same suet, it being that which divides between the hide of the animal and the said suet, and it is permitted. Now he removes this suet from two sides of the spinal column, its length extending from beneath the loins all the way up to the ribs; while its breadth extending outwards until it becomes covered over in flesh, and once it has been covered over in flesh, is permitted. They scrape away the suet that is upon the spinal column from within, where lies the flesh of the loins which is called Arabic mutemaziqah, and they excise fatty tissue from the mutemaziqah, removing all of the forbidden fat (suet) that lies upon it externally. Then they dislodge the fat of the kidneys from the place of its attachment on the spine, above the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs, towards the side of the animal's loins, surgically removing all suet beneath it, or else they remove the central bone of the spinal column entirely. Afterwards, he opens up the pelvic bone that joins together the two thighs, the two thighs, taking out all fat that is within it which lies over the fat of the kidneys, it being the forbidden [...] "fat that is upon the flanks," [...] or what is also called Aramaic Tarba de-Aqlivusta. They surgically remove it up to the place where the tail begins in large domesticated animals, but in sheep they continue to scrape away the outer part of the fatty tail (rump) towards its inner side which knocks upon the thighs, with the fat of the kidneys and the flanks, all that which is high up at the top of the fatty tail (rump), at the place where it excretes excrement, extending as far as the bones of the fatty tail (rump). Now beneath it there is a marked difference in the thin membrane between the said suet and the suet in the fatty tail, as well as between the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which draw nourishment from the fat of the kidneys and the flanks. Now they scrape away all the fat (suet) which is between the sinews (Heb. Peqoqeloth) the loins, which in Arabic is as al-falakh (Coccyx), along with the [...] "threads (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that enter inside the perforations in the bones which join together the loins of the animal above, wherein ends the spinal cord. He then dismembers the thighs, each one individually, and opens up each one from its <b>flesh</b> on that <b>side</b> where the hide is attached, until the displaced tendon (Heb. Gid Hanasheh) can be seen which is on the hollow of the thigh, removing it and digging up after it in all the flesh of the thighs. Now on part of the of the thigh which is called Arabic mukheh, requires removing the tendon from without and from within, and on the calf leg which is called Arabic sā‘ed, requires removing the tendon from without and from within, and on the flesh which is upon it, which grows from the bunch of converging sinews the calf (Heb. Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm), called Arabic suqleh, with all of the fat of the tendon, in every place where it is to be found. Now there are found on the two sides of the of the thigh which is called Arabic mukheh and in its socket are known as stems (Heb. Qenuqenoth), as well as the fat (Heb. Shoman) of the displaced tendon, both being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away. Now there are in the calf, underneath its flesh, three small tendons, they being of the displaced tendon. Therefore, let him open up the flesh and remove them. And as for the spleen, let him peel away the membrane which is upon it, and pull away the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are inside of it which are three, their prohibition being on account of suet, and one is required to dig-up after them. The inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), the omasum (Heb. Messos) and the reticulum (Heb. Beith Hakossoth), (as well as the rump of sheep), require being cleaned of all suet that clings to them. The membrane which is upon the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs, alongside the liver, is forbidden on account of suet, and that which is alongside the lung is customarily removed lest he who sees it becomes skeptical, although it is permitted. They also remove the lower membrane which is upon the kidneys, it being forbidden on account of suet, also the tunic membrane. As for the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. veins and arteries) that are forbidden on account of blood, they do not have it as a practice in these countries to remove them, seeing that they cut up the animal in several pieces. Now may God deliver us from errors, and instruct his servants in the way of truth. Amen, may it even be His will. Original: ...|$|R
