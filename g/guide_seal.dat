30|$|In {{this last}} experiment, local motion events were {{additionally}} reduced. These might have <b>guided</b> the <b>seal’s</b> {{decision in the}} first two experiments due to the type of noise and the long dot lifetimes chosen in these two experiments. Therefore, we used a display of the random position type in this experiment (Figure  1, Table  1) requiring the seal to respond to no other cue than the global motion of the display. Again the seal had to indicate the direction of the coherent motion signal as in the previous experiment. Using this type of visual noise, the duration and the spatial extent of local motion events is drastically reduced. The seal’s 75 % threshold was determined at 22.5 % coherence (Figure  3 e, Table  1).|$|R

30|$|Flickering as a {{secondary}} cue was eliminated {{in the last}} two experiments, in which the seal was asked to assess the direction of coherent motion, because the flicker was present at both sides of the stimulus and thus should not have provided any information about the motion direction of the signal dots. The seal could directly transfer its experience from coherent motion detection to a discrimination of coherent motion direction within one session. This contradicts the hypothesis that differential flickering had been crucial for decision. However, the resulting threshold is worse than the final thresholds of the coherent motion detection experiment, which could be explained by the absence of flickering, if it had <b>guided</b> the <b>seal’s</b> responses to some extent in the previous experiments. Alternatively, the threshold might be worse in the coherent motion direction discrimination experiment using random direction noise as compared to the best thresholds in the coherent motion detection experiment as the seal had to cope with a totally new experimental situation including a different experimental procedure and direction of stimulus movement. There is evidence from other studies (Britten et al. 1992) that threshold performance does not necessarily transfer to new experimental conditions.|$|R
30|$|After the {{acquisition}} of the basic discrimination, we assessed coherence thresholds with various stimulus configurations that served to analyze how dot lifetime and dot density affect the seal’s performance within a phase of the coherent motion detection experiment. Dot lifetime was decreased to values below 1000  ms, the dot lifetime that had been programmed during initial threshold determination in the coherent motion detection experiment, thereby reducing local motion events that could <b>guide</b> the <b>seal’s</b> decisions especially with long dot lifetimes. When the lifetime of the dots was set to 125  ms, the seal {{was still able to}} detect the coherent motion with a threshold of 28.3 % coherence. Instead of relying on long-lived dot streaks, the seal must have integrated motion over a larger area to solve the task. The fact that the performance of seal Henry was affected by variations in dot lifetime indicates that the seal indeed possesses an efficient local motion integration system. However, still the influence of local motion events cannot be denied as the seal’s performance improves the longer the dot lifetime comparable to e. g. humans and pigeons (Bischof et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} order to eliminate a possible secondary cue that might have <b>guided</b> the <b>seal’s</b> performance in the first experiment, the differential flicker of the positive stimulus. The experimental procedure was changed {{in a way that}} now the seal had to discriminate the direction of coherent motion. The seal was viewing one display with either leftward or rightward stimulus motion and had to indicate stimulus motion by moving its head to the left or right respectively. Thus flicker at both sides of the stimulus display area was the same irrespective of stimulus movement. Testing the seal initially with a dot density of 500 dots/stimulus area, a dot lifetime of 1000  ms, and a coherence of 80 %, {{it turned out that the}} seal was able to adapt to the new experimental condition within one session reaching 86.2 % correct choices (χ 2 [*]=[*] 15.2, p[*]<[*] 0.001). In all eight sessions thereafter, the seal’s performance always exceeded 86 % correct choices (average performance 90 % correct choices, χ 2 [*]=[*] 153.6, p[*]<[*] 0.001). The psychometric function obtained during data collection in this experiment is shown in Figure  3 d. Threshold performance was achieved at 21 % coherence (Figure  3 d, Table  1).|$|R
40|$|Automating {{the process}} of {{automotive}} weather strip assembly has been a challenge to production engineers for years. In fact, a recent publication concluded that this process is too difficult to automate. At the IPA a robot tool for flexible automation of the weather strip assembly process has been developed. In close cooperation with Opel AG, weather strip supplier Mesnel S. A. in France, assembly system manufacturers Kuka, and Thyssen Nothelfer, a prototype assembly cell {{has been set up}} at IPA. The assembly system consists of a pick-up station supplying the weather strip seals, a sophisticated insertion tool, and an industrial robot (Fanuc S- 420 F). The basic function of the robot tool is very similar to the manual operation. The tool combines gripping, guiding and hammering functions. It uses open guides with pneumatic fingers to pickup and <b>guide</b> the <b>seal,</b> and a pneumatic hammer to drive the seal onto the flange. Based on a thorough analysis of significant process parameters, the cycle time of the seal assembly could be halved compared with manual operation. Extensive tests have proven a process reliability of close to 99 %.

40|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of sulphate, chloride, and nickel {{were discovered in}} water samples taken from the Töllinperä aquifer in western Finland. The area is located adjacent to the tailings area of the Hitura nickel mine. Earlier studies revealed that the groundwater contamination resulted from tailings-derived mine waters leaking from a tailings impoundment area. The tailings area directly overlies the Weichselian esker system, part {{of which is the}} Töllinperä classified groundwater area. The observed groundwater and surface water contamination resulted in a need to characterize the subsurface geology in the whole area of the contaminated esker aquifer. The primary sedimentary units were introduced into a three-dimensional (3 -D) geologic model of the aquifer made with EarthVision geologic modeling software. The information obtained from the 3 -D geological model was then introduced into a numerical groundwater flow model made with MODFLOW code, which was calibrated with MODFLOWP code. The results of this study were used to <b>guide</b> the <b>sealing</b> of the tailings impoundment in order to prevent the further contamination of the Töllinperä aquifer. The groundwater flow model was used to interpret and simulate the flow system, and to provide a plan to safely continue water supply to local inhabitants from the unpolluted parts of the aquifer...|$|R

40|$|A {{prominent}} chocolate-coloured horizon {{at the top}} of the Kerkom Sand (Oligocene, Tongeren Group) near Pellenberg in the Leuven area (Belgium), {{has traditionally}} been interpreted as the illuvial zone of a podsol type soil. Observed features however are equally compatible with an origin as an oil-saturated reservoir sand. In fact, organic geochemical analyses indicate strongly that a fossil oil seepage is the most likely interpretation. The time of oil impregnation may be related to an important tectonic re-arrangement, which started at the very end of the Eocene, and probably triggered the leakage and migration of oil from traps in the southwest of the Netherlands. The oil migrated through porous sands up the gentle northern flank of the Brabant Massif, <b>guided</b> by clayey <b>seals</b> till it reached the surface. The presence of a fossil oil seepage in the Leuven area, means that possible traps, downdip of the Pellenberg outcrop, may contain accumulations of oil. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|More modern pumping {{stations}} do {{not require}} a dry well or pump house and usually consist only of a wet well.

For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the duckfoot and up the two guide rails to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the guide rails and lowered onto the duckfoot where {{the weight of the}} pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems.|$|R
30|$|To {{drastically}} reduce local motion {{events that}} might have <b>guided</b> the <b>seal’s</b> behavior due to the noise type and due to the long dot lifetimes mostly programmed in the coherent motion detection experiment {{as well as the}} coherent motion direction discrimination experiment using random direction noise, visual noise was additionally programmed as random position noise (Scase et al. 1996) for the final coherent motion direction discrimination experiment. In the random position display (Figure  1), only the signal dots were displaced and reappeared in the next frame. The noise dots were plotted afresh in each frame at random positions creating local motion signals of varying direction and speed by random pairings of dots in consecutive frames. Since the assignment of a dot as signal dot or noise dot changed from frame to frame, the probability that a signal dot survived N consecutive frames was pN[*]−[*] 1, where p is the coherence or correlation of the display (Britten et al. 1992). This way, the average lifetime of the signal dots decreased when the coherence of the display is decreased thereby reducing the spatiotemporal persistence of the local motion event. To create such a random position display, the frame rate of our software was coupled to the vertical refresh rate of our projector (60  Hz) and we calculated the position of the signal and noise dots every second according to the rules described above. Thus, each dot was visible for 1 / 30  s at a certain position and was then displaced by a fixed distance referring to a signal dot or plotted afresh at a new random position referring to a noise dot.|$|R

40|$|This study covers {{pavement}} surface maintenance {{on three}} surface types: rigid, flexible and composite (asphalt overlay on rigid pavement). It addresses 3 main issues as follows: 1) Do routine maintenance activities {{make a difference}} in terms of pavement serviceability? If yes, how much? 2) Are chip and sand seal coating cost-effective? What is their optimal timing? 3) What management criteria should be used as a <b>guide</b> to make <b>seal</b> coating decisions on specific roadways? In resolving Issue # 1, a stratified 2 -stage sample of observational data was used in a statistical before/after comparison. SAS-General Linear Model was used due to its flexibility in treating continuous and class variables. Most activities showed significant effect (either alone or in combination with others) on Pavement Serviceability Ratings or Roughness Numbers. In resolving Issue Hi, Life Cycle Cost Analysis was applied using agency and user costs. Results showed that optimal timing for seal coating is in the PSI range of 3. 0 to 2. 7, dependent on AADT. In resolving Issue # 3, a literature search, telephone interviews and expert opinion survey were used to augment the findings on Issue # 2 in generating a decision tree. The developed tree uses the available data at INDOT, although surface distress related criteria would be superior. The tree helps analyze the likely cause of distress, the preferred solution and a priority ranking in the case of funding shortages.

40|$|Abstract. The steam {{generators}} at Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) nuclear power {{stations in the}} UK are potentially life-limiting components. Enhancing the capability to monitor the {{steam generators}} {{has been identified as}} having the potential to provide key evidence in justifying the extension of the generating lifetime of the stations. It has been proposed to install new temperature measuring instrumentation to monitor reactor gas temperature and to provide additional data regarding steam generator operating conditions. The modification will be to introduce thermocouples to the bore of an intact steam generator tube to facilitate temperature measurement at or near to the locations of interest. The modified steam generator tube will be sealed at the feed header upstand. Between the upper surface of the superheater header tubeplate and the wall of the superheater header, the thermocouple bundle and sheath will be contained within a rigid stainless steel guide tube. The guide tube will be attached at both ends by welds, each forming a pressure boundary. At the tubeplate a weld will separate the bore of the <b>sealed</b> <b>guide</b> tube from the steam space within the superheater header; a weld between the guide tube and the superheater header will separate the steam space within the superheater header from atmosphere outside the header. In order to obtain a better design, three 3 -dimentional finite element models have been created using ABAQUS. A series of cyclic pressure, and start-up and shutdown thermal transient stress analyses have been carried out to provide stress values for structural integrity assessments to be conducted using ASME III, Subsection NH and R 5. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Metsu <b>guided</b> Senegal to <b>seal</b> {{a spot in}} the 2002 World Cup finals for {{the first}} time in its history. They were {{expected}} to finish at the bottom of Group A also containing Denmark, the defending champions France and Uruguay. When the 2002 World Cup finals started, 21 of the 23 players in the Senegal national squad were playing with French clubs. Some members of the French team, as well as high-profile players of other teams, publicly dismissed the Senegalese. In a passionate speech to his team before the opening match of the tournament (France versus Senegal), Metsu used the disparaging comments to stir his players. Metsu's psychological approach to the game led him to encourage Senegal's players to focus on France's weaknesses rather than their strengths; he used videos to show the Senegalese players all the weaknesses of the French players. Senegal pulled off a major surprise by beating the reigning world and European champions 1-0, with Pape Bouba Diop scoring the only goal. [...] "By concentrating five players in midfield, my friend Metsu concocted a nice plan. Individually and collectively we could not find a solution. Senegal were better than us," [...] conceded the France team manager Roger Lemerre, who was magnanimous in defeat. [...] "When I read them Pelé's remarks that Senegal was the weakest team of the group, I immediately noticed a revolt in their eyes. I knew they were going to fight like lions,” Metsu told the Nigerian newspaper Vanguard later that year.|$|R
40|$|Many {{components}} {{utilized in}} offshore industry are complex tribological systems, for instance Direct Riser Tensioner (DRT) cylinders {{which include the}} use of <b>seals,</b> <b>guide</b> bands, hydraulic fluids/lubricants and materials in relative movement. However, those components are often load bearing elements and thus fail due to the combined effect of multi-degradation processes (wear, corrosion and mechanical stresses). Moreover, the requirements for material selection and pre-qualification testing do not consider the synergy of the degradation phenomena, which leads to inaccurate evaluations and results in much shorter component lifetime than expected. It is therefore of a great importance to explain what happens in a material during multi-degradation exposure and how particular factors influence such a system, with emphasis on bending conditions, to be able estimate lifetime of components more precisely, thus diminish cost of maintenance and increase safe operation. During experimental work two materials were tested: AISI 316 L austenitic stainless steel (UNS S 31603) and 25 % Cr super duplex stainless steel (UNS S 32750). Test were carried out at the multi-degradation test rig (LSMD) developed by NOV in cooperation with the Tribology research group at NTNU. Both environment related (normal and applied sustained/cyclic load, exposure time) and samples related (different materials and thus microstructure, grain size etc.) variables were changed and the effects were studied. Experiments were performed at OCP (with reference to Ag/AgCl reference electrode) in 3. 4 wt% NaCl solution during reciprocating ball-on-plate sliding contact (4. 76 mm alumina ball). Simultaneously either static or cyclic 4 -point bending was applied and results compared to tribocorrosion exposure (also performed during tests). The tests showed that tensile stresses from 4 -point bending applied to a tribocorrosion system affect its volume loss and subsurface microstructure transformations. The effect on subsurface microstructure: tensile stresses release some fraction of compressive stresses induced by sliding contact, enlarge energy dissipation zone, and thus provide less subsurface deformations. Volume loss is affected as well - tensile stresses influence oxide kinetics growth on metal surface. The thickness of such surface film determines the size of debris particles generated during rubbing, and thus the volume loss...|$|R
