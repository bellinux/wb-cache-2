5|$|A {{number of}} {{arthropod}} parasites {{have been recorded}} on this duck, including chewing mites of the families Philopteridae and Menoponidae, feather mites and skin mites. Internal <b>helminth</b> parasites include roundworms, tapeworms and flukes. In a survey in Florida, all 30 ducks tested carried at least two <b>helminth</b> species, although none had blood parasites. Only one duck had no mites or lice.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} hosts more than 12 species of <b>helminth,</b> with Cathaemasia hians and Dicheilonema ciconiae {{reported}} {{to be the most}} dominant. The juvenile black stork, although having a less diverse <b>helminth</b> population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A new species of Corynebacterium—C. ciconiae—has been isolated from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought {{to be part of the}} natural flora of the species. A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites—particularly the genera Dendrolaelaps and Macrocheles—have been recovered from black stork nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and <b>helminth</b> parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} are {{ubiquitous in}} {{soil and water}} - concurrently so are free-living <b>helminths</b> that feed on bacteria. These <b>helminths</b> fall into two categories; the non-parasitic and the parasitic. The former have {{been the focus of}} previous work, finding that bacterial pathogens inside <b>helminths</b> are conferred survival advantages over and above bacteria alone in the environment, and that accidental ingestion of non-parasitic <b>helminths</b> can cause systemic infection in vertebrate hosts. Here, we determine the potential for bacteria to be associated with parasitic <b>helminths.</b> After culturing <b>helminths</b> from fecal samples obtained from livestock the external bacteria were removed. Two-hundred parasitic <b>helminths</b> from three different species were homogenised and the bacteria that were internal to the <b>helminths</b> were isolated and cultured. Eleven different bacterial isolates were found; of which eight were indentified. The bacteria identified included known human and cattle pathogens. We concluded that bacteria of livestock can be isolated in parasitic <b>helminths</b> and that this suggests a mechanism by which bacteria, pathogenic or otherwise, can be transmitted between individuals. The potential for <b>helminths</b> to play a role as pathogen vectors poses a potential livestock and human health risk. Further work is required to assess the epidemiological impact of this finding...|$|R
40|$|Parasitic infections, {{caused by}} {{intestinal}} <b>helminths</b> and protozoan parasites, {{are among the}} most preva-lent infections in humans in developing coun-tries. In developed countries, protozoan parasites more commonly cause gastrointestinal infections compared to <b>helminths.</b> Intestinal parasites cause a significant morbidity and mortality in endemic countries. <b>Helminths</b> are worms with many cells.

40|$|A {{neurotropism}} of <b>helminths</b> can {{be observed}} in their intermediate, paratenic and definitive hosts. Neurotropic <b>helminths</b> migrate through the nervous tissue, where maturation and reproduction can take place. The neurotropic <b>helminths</b> {{can be found in the}} family of trematodes (Diplostomum baeri, D. phoxini, Ornithodiplostomum ptychocheilus, Trichobilharzia regenti), cestodes (Taenia multiceps, T. solium) and nematodes (Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Elaphostrongylus cervi, Parelaphostronglus tenuis, Baylisascaris procyonis). Presence of these <b>helminths</b> in the nervous tissue can (usually with contribution of the immune system) lead to neurological or other pathological changes: the infected hosts can even die.

5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably {{an attempt by the}} birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and <b>helminth</b> parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
5|$|Up to 60 <b>helminth</b> {{species are}} known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common {{nematode}} species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect their lungs. Capillaria plica infect the fox's bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T.pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E.multilocularis. Eleven trematode species infect red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but <b>helminth</b> hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E

25|$|Inactivation of <b>helminth</b> ova can be {{achieved}} in sewage sludge treatment where the temperature is increased over 40°C or moisture is reduced to less than 5%. Best results can be obtained when both of these conditions are combined {{for an extended period}} of time. Details about the contact time under these conditions and other related environmental factors are generally not well-defined for every type of <b>helminth</b> egg species. <b>Helminth</b> eggs are considered highly resistant biological structures.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{pathogen}} destruction {{rates are}} usually low, particularly <b>helminth</b> eggs, such as Ascaris eggs.

Compost from human excreta processed under only mesophilic conditions or taken directly from the compost chamber is not safe for food production. High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill <b>helminth</b> eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens. <b>Helminth</b> infections are common in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|When {{analysing}} environmental samples, {{various types}} of indicator organisms are used to check for fecal pollution of the sample. Commonly used indicators for bacteriological water analysis include the bacterium Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) and non-specific fecal coliforms. With regards to samples of soil, sewage sludge, biosolids or fecal matter from dry toilets, <b>helminth</b> eggs are a commonly used indicator. With <b>helminth</b> egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs.

25|$|Pathogens {{contained}} in feces {{can lead to}} groundwater pollution when they are {{given the opportunity to}} reach the groundwater, making it unsafe for drinking. Of the four pathogen types that are present in feces (bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths or <b>helminth</b> eggs), the first three can be commonly found in polluted groundwater, whereas the relatively large <b>helminth</b> eggs are usually filtered out by the soil matrix.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{physically}} remove (but not inactivate) <b>helminth</b> eggs from wastewater, processes that remove particles, such as sedimentation, filtration or coagulation-flocculation are employed. Therefore, waste stabilization ponds (lagoons), storage bassins, constructed wetlands, rapid filtration or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors can be used.

The most difficult pathogens to eliminate from the drying feces in the feces vaults are the <b>helminth</b> eggs which can cause <b>helminth</b> infections.|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} in the component community structure of intestinal <b>helminths</b> in the lizard Chalcides ocellatus (Forskal, 1775) was studied {{in relation to the}} seasonal variation and host weight and sex. 120 lizards were collected seasonally during year 2004, from Al Firdan, Ismailia governorate, Egypt. The <b>helminths</b> community consisted of six species (five nematodes and one cestode). The various <b>helminths</b> differed according to host sex. The prevalence of total <b>helminths</b> infection was 67. 6 % while the prevalences of Thelandros schusteri, Pharyngodon mamillatus, Parapharyngodon bulbosus, Cosmocerca vrcibradici, Spauligodon petersi and Oochoristica maccoyi were 43. 4 %, 3. 9 %, 13. 2 %, 5. 3 %, 6. 6 %, and 14. 3 %, respectively. The results showed that the season was the main factor affecting infracommunity species richness and parasite abundance. Moreover, there was interaction between season and host sex on abundance of P. bulbosus. The prevalence of intestinal <b>helminths</b> varied significantly in relation to host weight classes and sex in some species. <b>Helminths</b> abundance and intensity were independent from host sex. In addition, correlations were found between total <b>helminths</b> abundance and host weight. In conclusion, the <b>helminths</b> community of C. ocellatus was depauperate and the influence of the studied factors varied from species to another one. We cannot say if the low species richness and infection rates observed in the present study are typical of the host species or if they are due to characteristics of the study area, since no available data on parasite assemblages exist for other C. ocellatus populations...|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{caused by}} {{parasitic}} <b>helminths</b> cause considerable production and economic losses in livestock worldwide.
