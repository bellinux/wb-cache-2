30|$|Abdominal wall {{disruption}} following blunt {{trauma is}} a rare but challenging injury in both the acute and chronic phases. Traumatic abdominal wall hernia {{is defined as the}} ‘herniation through disrupted musculature and fascia associated with adequate trauma, without skin penetration, and no evidence of a prior hernia defect at the site of injury’ [1]. The reported prevalence of traumatic abdominal hernia among trauma patients, even at dedicated trauma centers with the best facilities, is less than 1 % [3]. Spencer Netto et al. retrospectively reviewed 34 patients presenting acutely with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia at a regional trauma center from January 2000 to December 2004 [3]. Their average age was 39 [*]±[*] 12  years (56 % male). Although no age disparity was demonstrated, the ratio of males, Injury Severity Scores, and other site injuries such as pelvic and lumbar fractures were higher compared with all blunt trauma patients. Reported mechanisms of injury have included falls, motor vehicle crashes, crush injuries, impalements, and seatbelt injuries. An analysis of recent cases indicated that most reported traumatic abdominal wall hernias resulted from seatbelt or handlebar injuries [4]. The risk of disruption of the abdominal wall is related {{to the size of the}} object, the force of impact, and the resulting <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pressure</b> <b>load.</b> As the skin is more elastic than the other layers of the abdominal wall, it remains intact, even though the underlying musculature and fascia are disrupted, giving rise to traumatic abdominal hernia.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic fuzzy {{reliability}} {{models of}} mechanical components are proposed {{in this paper}} {{in the case of}} small samples <b>of</b> <b>load.</b> The proposed models are established based on the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> obtained from a load history, which reflects the relationship among the occurrence frequency <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> with different magnitude in a given time period, rather than the distribution at each load application. To deal with the uncertainty <b>of</b> the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> from a load history due to the randomness of the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>load</b> at each load application, the statistical parameters involved in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> are modeled as fuzzy variables.

30|$|Sequences of {{experiments}} were done {{to study the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> on rock damage as shown in Table  6. A round piston was placed {{at the top of}} the PPGs inside the round tube and the PPGs were compacted by the piston with 300 psi as a <b>load</b> <b>pressure.</b> After the gel was compressed, the permeability of each core was determined at the flow rates of 0.5, 0.75, and 1  mL/min. These lower flow rates were used because the stabilized pressure around the sandstone core increased so much after the gel was compressed and the core was damaged further. To confirm the level to which the injection pressure influenced the damage to various cores, the <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> tests were needed. Table  6 displays the DQ gel effect on the core damage as well as the core permeability reduction. The core permeability was determined before and after the PPGs were compressed.
