40|$|Traditionally, {{polymers}} and macromolecular components used in {{the foam}} industry are mostly derived from petroleum. The current transition to a bio-economy creates demand {{for the use of}} more renewable feedstocks. Soybean oil is a vegetable oil, composed mainly of triglycerides, that is suitable material for foam production. In this study, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil and variable amounts of cellulose fibres were {{used in the}} production of bio-based foam. The developed macroporous bio-based architectures were characterised by several techniques, including porosity measurements, nanoindentation testing, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that the introduction of cellulose fibres during the foaming process was necessary to create the three-dimensional polymer foams. Using cellulose fibres has potential as a <b>foam</b> <b>stabiliser</b> because it obstructs the drainage of liquid from the film region in these gas-oil interfaces while simultaneously acting as a reinforcing agent in the polymer foam. The resulting foams possessed a porosity of approximately 56 %, and the incorporation of cellulose fibres did not affect thermal behaviour. Scanning electron micrographs showed randomly oriented pores with irregular shapes and non-uniform pore size throughout the samples...|$|E

These new findings will be discussed in terms of recent improved understanding of the surface rheological behaviour and thin film behaviour of proteins. These insights may lead to an improved use of the special properties that proteins have as emulsion stabilisers compared to other stabilisers, such as low-molecular-weight surfactants or polyelectrolytes...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{nanoparticles}} as <b>foam</b> <b>stabilisers</b> {{has gained}} increasing attention in recent years, for applications {{in a number of}} process industries, such as food colloids, metal and ceramics production and mineral flotation. Here we consider the foaming behaviour of 270 nm silica particle suspensions, hydrophobised to varying extents via esterification with butanol, octanol and dodecanol. The foaming behaviour was related to the compressed two-dimensional monolayer behaviour from Langmuir–Blodgett trough and SEM studies. The octanol esterified species performed best as both dynamic and static foaming agents, indicating particles of moderate hydrophobicity may work best as <b>stabilisers.</b> Dynamic <b>foam</b> stability results were linked to the balancing of interfilm drainage and steric stabilisation mechanisms. No firm conclusions could be drawn on the total effect of hydrophobicity on static foams, as particles esterified in dodecanol shear-flocculated under the stresses of foam production. Foam stability correlated well to compressed monolayer behaviour, with two-dimensional stability being influenced by the competing effects of a more disordered network structure and higher interfacial strength, as particle hydrophobicity was increased. It is noted that even with the best performing particles, less than 10 % of a given dispersion interacted under shaking to form bulk foam...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{attachment}} and orientation of anisotropic and porous microparticles at liquid surfaces by using the gel trapping technique (GTT). This technique involves spreading of the microparticles of interest at the liquid interface, subsequent setting of the aqueous phase to a hydrogel thus “arresting” the particle positions at the liquid surface, and further replication of the hydrogel surface with curable polydymethilsiloxane (PDMS). The advantage of the GTT comes from the possibility {{to look at the}} PDMS replica with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM), which allows even sub-micrometer particles to be studied at the air–water and the oil–water interface. Here we report our results on the adsorption of non-spherical anisotropic particles at liquid surfaces using the GTT. Although the GTT was originally designed to measure three-phase contact angles of spherical colloid particles, here we used this technique to reveal the orientation of a variety of shape-anisotropic and porous microparticles of practical interest at both the air–water and decane–water interfaces. We show results on typical attachment and orientation of needle-like (aragonite), rhombohedra-like (calcite) microcrystals, ethyl cellulose micro-rods, as well as highly porous hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica microparticles at these liquid interfaces. The results are important for understanding the adsorption behaviour of shape-anisotropic particles as well as porous microparticles which are used in industrial formulations as fillers, <b>foam</b> <b>stabilisers</b> and emulsifiers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{development}} of minimally invasive techniques {{for the treatment}} of varicose veins is driven by the aim of achieving results equivalent or superior to surgery whilst minimising complications. Foam sclerotherapy is associated with inferior short-term occlusion rates in comparison to other treatments, suggesting irreversible vein wall injury has not occurred. Further knowledge of the mechanism of action of foam sclerotherapy may facilitate its modification in order to improve clinical efficacy. Methods This study assessed the cellular response to the application of sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD) foam by analysis of intracellular protein release from cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells. An ex vivo model using proximal great saphenous vein was developed to quantify the tissue response to the application of foam STD with, and without, initial balloon denudation of vein wall endothelium. Percentage endothelial cell loss (ECL), tunica media injury and collagen structure were assessed. Stability of foam STD was established and modified by surfactant additives. The tissue effects of the modified foam were evaluated. Results All concentrations of foam STD produced equivalent cellular injury. Intra-luminal application of STD foam to great saphenous vein segments was associated with incomplete endothelial destruction and superficial tunica media injury. There was little evidence of collagen disruption. Viscosity enhancing agents were the most effective <b>foam</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Initial mechanical balloon denudation of endothelium and prolongation of foam stability with surfactants, increased ECL but did not enhance tunica media injury. Conclusions The superficial injury and lack of collagen disruption sustained by veins following exposure to foam STD is likely to explain the capacity for recanalisation following treatment. The increased ECL observed following balloon endothelial denudation and application of modified STD foam may be beneficial in the clinical setting.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} mixed protein-starch {{systems as}} effective <b>foaming</b> agents and <b>stabilisers.</b> The starch size and hydrophobicity play a dominant {{role in determining}} the levels of synergy observed. Egg White Protein (EWP) and Pea Protein Isolate (PPI) were selected at two concentrations (0. 5, 1  wt. %) along with three starch species of concentrations between 0. 5, 1, 3 & 5 wt. %. Two commercial OSA-modified starches are compared to a native granule and its heat-treated counter part. The system's effectiveness to incorporate air (overrun) as well as its capacity to hold structure (half life) is evaluated. starch's physical properties (contact angle and size) and their effect {{on the nature of the}} Air/Water (A/W) interface (interfacial dilatation rheology, surface tension) are also explored. The effect of protein species as well as starch size and hydrophobicity on foam stability is determined and discussed. The study demonstrates that addition of OSA modified starch (0 – 5 wt%) to (EWP) foams can enhance foam stability by up to 1200 % without compromising the foaming capacity, mainly due to a hypothesised exclusion volume effect. Where as the larger heat-treated starch granule is found to increase stability of wet foams by 800 %, through a combination of mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{involving}} solids-stabilised foams {{have been}} limited and few {{have focused on the}} benefits of complex systems such as those involving mixtures of more than one surfactant. Little is known about the effectiveness of using mixed surfactant systems as <b>foam</b> <b>stabilisers</b> at the bulk level. The purpose of this project was to gain further understanding and insight into foam stability, on a bulk scale, in the absence, and in the presence, of solid colloidal particles, and for systems involving single or mixed surfactants. Foams were produced using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), dodecanoic acid (DA), or a mixture of both surfactants at varying molar ratios. The surface tension at a given concentration, the limiting surface tension (at high concentrations), the critical micelle concentration, foamability and foam stability were all significantly affected by the molar ratio of SDS to DA. The initial pH of mixed surfactant solutions {{played a role in the}} shift of surface tension and CMC. The higher pH values, the lower surface activity, therefore resulted in higher surface tension. At a given pH, however, the mixed surfactant solutions with higher molar ratio of SDS to DA appeared to have lower CMC. The foam stabilising ability of colloidal dispersions of four hydrous metal oxides, namely hydrous iron oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Fe(III) solutions and referred to as HFO), hydrous zinc oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Zn(II) solutions and referred to as HZO), hydrous chromium oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Cr(III) solutions and referred to as HCO), and hydrous nickel oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Ni(II) solutions and referred to as HNO) were studied at varying concentrations. Generally foam stability increased as the solid concentration increased. Foams stabilised by HNO were found to be the most stable. Foams stabilised by HFO were found to be unstable regardless of the solid concentration. It is believed that the instability of such foams is primarily due to the large aggregated size of HFO flocs. The aggregate size of hydrous metal oxides was influenced by the concentration of NaOH used to hydrolyse the metal ion solution, and by sonication treatment immediately following solid formation. However, the final pH of the colloidal dispersions did not significantly change the aggregate size. Solids stabilised foams are believed to be highly dependent on the state of hydrophobicity of the solids used, and this is in turn controlled by adjustment of the pH dependent surface charge and potential. Electrophoretic mobility is a commonly used tool to probe the potential near the surface and was used in this thesis to determine the affect of surfactant adsorption (particularly from solutions containing mixtures of SDS and DA) on surface properties of the solids. The electrophoretic mobility of all hydrous metal oxide aggregates decreased as the concentration of SDS/DA increased. Specific adsorption was evident in all cases and resulted in charge reversal for most cases. Electrophoretic mobility data for surfactant adsorption, as a function of total surfactant concentration, was consistent with a three-stage model of surfactant adsorption involving (1) electrostatic adsorption, (2) cooperative adsorption and (3) surface saturation. The influence of surfactant adsorption on electrophoretic mobility was found to be consistent with models requiring the stabilising solids to be in a controlled state of flocculation, where the zeta potential (as probed by electrophoretic mobility) must be sufficiently high to prevent total flocculation of the solid and thus collapse of the foam, but sufficiently low that the solids have some degree of hydrophobicity such that they prefer to be only partially wetted (and thus reside at the air/water interface). The total percentage adsorption of SDS/DA surfactant mixtures on both hydrous iron oxide and hydrous nickel oxide was found to be independent of time. However, the proportion of adsorption due to SDS and DA was dependent on time. Moreover, the initial and final ratio of SDS to DA adsorption did not reflect their ratio in solution. SDS adsorbed, initially, to a greater extent that would be predicted from its solution concentration, but this trend was reversed after a period of time...|$|R
