25|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas. Early pastoralists used felling and <b>girdling,</b> {{the removal of}} a ring of bark and sapwood, {{as a means of}} clearing land. In the 1950s arboricides suitable for stem injection were developed. War-surplus heavy machinery was made available, and these were used for either pushing timber, or for pulling using a chain and ball strung between two machines. These two new methods of timber control, along with the introduction and widespread adoption of several new pasture grasses and legumes promoted a resurgence in tree clearing. The 1980s also saw the release of soil-applied arboricides, notably tebuthiuron, that could be utilised without cutting and injecting each individual tree.|$|E

Other major goods that are transported from the nation's heartlands to Yangon for export are other foodstuffs, petroleum, cotton, and local commodities.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath {{and went up to}} the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that the summit of the mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud <b>girdling</b> the middle of the mountain.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the appropriate elasticity of the textile material used for making women's <b>girdle.</b> Background: The elastic textiles have been used for making <b>girdle.</b> The hard type <b>girdle</b> gave high pressure on the body to make slim look. However, excessively high garment pressure caused negative effect to human bodies. This study studied the material giving proper garment pressure in <b>girdle.</b> Method: In this study five experimental <b>girdles</b> were made fabrics with various elasticities. The change of garment pressures and body girths were measured after subjects wearing the experimental <b>girdles.</b> The garment pressure was measured at 10 points. Body girths measured at abdomen, hip, and thigh. Results: The garment pressure of the commercial <b>girdle</b> was high at side of waistband, side femur and back gluteal fold. The experimental <b>girdles</b> made with high elasticity material definitely lowered garment pressure at those points. After wearing experimental <b>girdle</b> their abdomen and hip girths measurements were decreased. But, thigh girth was not reduced.

500|$|Amanita ceciliae, {{commonly}} called snakeskin grisette and strangulated amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus in the genus Amanita. First described in 1854 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome, {{it was given}} its current name by Cornelis Bas in 1984.

2500|$|Because phloem {{tubes are}} located outside the xylem in most plants, {{a tree or}} other plant can be killed by {{stripping}} away the bark in a ring on the trunk or stem. [...] With the phloem destroyed, nutrients cannot reach the roots, and the tree/plant will die. [...] Trees located in areas with animals such as beavers are vulnerable since beavers chew off the bark at a fairly precise height. [...] This process is known as <b>girdling,</b> {{and can be used}} for agricultural purposes. [...] For example, enormous fruits and vegetables seen at fairs and carnivals are produced via <b>girdling.</b> [...] A farmer would place a girdle {{at the base of a}} large branch, and remove all but one fruit/vegetable from that branch. [...] Thus, all the sugars manufactured by leaves on that branch have no sinks to go to but the one fruit/vegetable, which thus expands to many times normal size.|$|E

50|$|In literature, <b>girdles</b> {{are often}} portrayed as magical, giving power and {{strength}} if worn by men, and protection if worn by women.

Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, {{it seems to me}} we have not yet fully {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] that it was one of the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light <b>girdling</b> darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{pectoral}} and pelvic <b>girdles</b> support paired fins and limbs, {{and have}} transformed {{significantly in the}} diversification of gnathostomes or jawed vertebrates (including osteichthyans, chondrichthyans, acanthodians and placoderms). For instance, changes in the pectoral and pelvic <b>girdles</b> accompanied the transition of fins to limbs as some osteichthyans (a clade that contains {{the vast majority of}} vertebrates - bony fishes and tetrapods) ventured from aquatic to terrestrial environments. The fossil record shows that the pectoral <b>girdles</b> of early osteichthyans (e. g., Lophosteus, Andreolepis, Psarolepis and Guiyu) retained part of the primitive gnathostome pectoral <b>girdle</b> condition with spines and/or other dermal components. However, very {{little is known about the}} condition of the pelvic <b>girdle</b> in the earliest osteichthyans. Living osteichthyans, like chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes), have exclusively endoskeletal pelvic <b>girdles,</b> while dermal pelvic <b>girdle</b> components (plates and/or spines) have so far been found only in some extinct placoderms and acanthodians. Consequently, whether the pectoral and pelvic <b>girdles</b> are primitively similar in osteichthyans cannot be adequately evaluated, and phylogeny-based inferences regarding the primitive pelvic <b>girdle</b> condition in osteichthyans cannot be tested against available fossil evidence. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report the first discovery of spine-bearing dermal pelvic <b>girdles</b> in early osteichthyans, based on a new articulated specimen of Guiyu oneiros from the Late Ludlow (Silurian) Kuanti Formation, Yunnan, as well as a re-examination of the previously described holotype. We also describe disarticulated pelvic <b>girdles</b> of Psarolepis romeri from the Lochkovian (Early Devonian) Xitun Formation, Yunnan, which resemble the previously reported pectoral <b>girdles</b> in having integrated dermal and endoskeletal components with polybasal fin articulation. Conclusions/Significance: The new findings reveal hitherto unknown similarity in pectoral and pelvic <b>girdles</b> among early osteichthyans, and provide critical information for studying the evolution of pelvic <b>girdles</b> in osteichthyans and other gnathostomes.
