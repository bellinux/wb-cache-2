5|$|After {{the release}} of <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|Copies of <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! were {{purchased}} by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. The VHS tapes circulated widely {{in schools and}} rape crisis centers in Australia; although showings began to decrease as VHS became less popular, the film was a significant teaching tool. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the {{youngest}} {{was seven years}} old. The prosecutors found <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! on YouTube and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! was {{released}} in the United Kingdom in October 1985 on VHS with notes for teachers and two relevant books, and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company. Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were {{on the market in}} the UK including several also released that year, <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was about the age of the children in <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Scare, {{filmed in}} a North London school, {{consists}} of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers {{to listen to}} the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote child protection projects in schools. Although Harris appears in Beyond the Scare, his role is less prominent than in <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
