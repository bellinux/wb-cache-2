I’m different now, {{a man with a}} pocketful of unconnected but terribly vivid memories. I was looking to dredge up what I’d long forgotten. Most of all, I am wishing for something to fasten all these gems, maybe something to hold them in a continuity that I can comprehend” (98). His time in Saigon shifted more and more into a time of self-realization. He felt his memories of the more innocent Saigon in his childhood be torn away by the needy Saigon he faced upon return. “The bitter bile of finding a world I don’t remember colors my disconsolate reconciliation between my Saigon of Old and their muddy-grubby Saigon of Now” (102). He recounts one extremely emotional afternoon after giving money to a beggar child with a familiar face: “I stood rotten with doubts, more lost than I had ever been in my life. Why do I care for this persimmon-faced child? Is it simply because she bares a likeness to someone I once knew? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> takes to remind me that I am Vietnamese? That I am human, capable of feeling the misery of another? If so, I am a worse bigot than those I despise, those who have hounded me in America” (108).|$|E

This is something that has puzzled people always. I think I've figured out what it is.Expansion and development are two different things. Development is differentiation of what already existed. Practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing, from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes. Expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity. That is a different thing.I've gone at it two different ways. Way back when I wrote The Economy of Cities, I wrote about import replacing and how that expands, not just the economy of the place where it occurs, but economic life altogether. As a city replaces imports, it shifts its imports. It doesn't import less. And yet it has everything it had before.Reason: It's not a zero-sum game. It's a bigger, growing pie.Jacobs: That's the actual mechanism of it. The theory of it is what I explain in The Nature of Economies. I equate it to what happens with biomass, the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area. The energy, the material that's involved in this, doesn't just escape the community as an export. It continues being used in a community, just as in a rainforest the waste from certain organisms and various plants and animals gets used by other ones in the place. Jane Jacobs ...|$|E
30|$|Prof. Sharifian: First of all, I don’t {{see these}} {{arguments}} {{in black and}} white terms. I think the reality is much more complicated. What is clear is that the number of what we call World Englishes is on the rise, and so is the number of native speakers of these new varieties. I think what is happening <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be a “native speaker” is changing, and it is spreading from those who speak English as their first and only language, to those who may speak it as their second or third language. Today, as you have native speakers of British English, so you have native speakers of Malaysian or Singaporean English. The situation is now that if speakers of British English feel that they own British English, speakers of Malaysian English may equally feel that they own Malaysian English. Some people also argue that the language belongs to whoever uses it.|$|E
40|$|In {{defending}} {{the principle of}} neutrality, liberals have often appealed to a more general moral principle that forbids coercing persons {{in the name of}} reasons those persons themselves cannot reasonably be expected to share. Yet liberals have struggled to articulate a non-arbitrary, non- dogmatic distinction between the reasons that persons can reasonably be expected to share and those they cannot. The reason for this, I argue, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to “share a reason” is itself obscure. In this paper I articulate two different conceptions of what it is to share a reason; I call these conceptions “foundationalist” and “constructivist. ” On the foundationalist view, two people “share” a reason just {{in the sense that the}} same reason applies to each of them independently. On this view, I argue, debates about the reasons we share collapse into debates about the reasons we have, moving us no closer to an adequate defense of neutrality. On the constructivist view, by contrast, “sharing reasons” is understood as a kind of activity, and the reasons we must share are just those reasons that make this activity possible. I argue that the constructivist conception of sharing reasons yields a better defense of the principle of neutrality...|$|E

40|$|The essay {{develops}} {{a conception of}} practical authorities that ties their legitimacy to the particular nature of the social practice or institution in which practical authorities invariably operate, and {{the terms of the}} subjects’ participation in that practice. The main argument of the paper draws on the distinction between what it takes to have practical authority and what would make it legitimate. The general idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> takes to have practical authority is always determined by a social or institutional practice, and thus the legitimacy of any given authority crucially depends {{on the nature of the}} practice and the terms of participation in it. One result of this argument is that there is no single general principle that determines the conditions of the legitimacy of authorities. In some cases, legitimacy depends on consent, in other cases, it does not; either way, it is the nature of the practice or institution in which a practical authority operates that crucially determines the authority’s legitimacy. The main argument of this essay is preceded by a clarification of the nature of authoritative directives and the obligatory nature of the reasons to comply with a legitimate directive. I argue that the obligation to comply is not directional (viz., owed to the authority), and that it does not involve the kind of moral accountability that we normally associate with directional obligations...|$|E
40|$|Beliefs {{have what}} I will call 'propositional content'. A belief {{is always a}} belief that so-and-so: a belief that grass is green, or a belief that snow is white, or whatever. Other things have propositional content too, such as sentences, {{judgments}} and assertions. The Standard View amongst philosophers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{is to have a}} propositional is to stand in an appropriate relation to a proposition. Moreover, on this view, propositions are objects, i. e. {{the kind of thing you}} can refer to with singular terms. For example, on the Standard View, we should parse the sentence 'Simon believes that Sharon is funny' as: [Simon] believes [that Sharon is funny]; 'Simon' is a term referring to a thinking subject, 'that Sharon is funny' is a term referring to a proposition, and 'x believes y' is a dyadic predicate expressing the believing relation. In this paper, I argue against the Standard View. This is how I think we should parse 'Simon believes that Sharon is funny': [Simon] believes that [Sharon is funny]; here we have a singular term, 'Simon', a sentence 'Sharon is funny', and a prenective joining them together, 'x believes that p'. On this Prenective View, we do not get at the propositional content of someone's belief by referring to a reified proposition with a singular term; we simply use the sentence 'Sharon is funny' to express that content for ourselves. I argue for the Prenective View in large part by showing that an initially attractive version of the Standard View is actually vulnerable to the same objection that Wittgenstein used against Russell's multiple-relation theory of judgment...|$|E
40|$|Reality and {{objectivity}} {{are often}} characterized {{in terms of}} independence from the mind: the first-pass idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> takes for any particular subject matter to be real and objective is for facts about it to obtain independently of beliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on. But if we take seriously the possibility that significant realms of reality, including social kinds, judgment-dependent properties, and mental phenomena themselves, stand in various dependence relations to the mental, then this first-pass characterization needs to be significantly revised. In this set of papers, I consider the special questions that metaphysically mind-dependent entities raise for issues of objectivity and realism. In Part 1, 1 substantiate the notion of metaphysical mind-dependence with a taxonomy of the various ways in which entities can stand in metaphysical relations of dependence to mental phenomena. In Part II, I {{address the question of}} realism and mind-dependence: I argue that while certain entities stand in relations of significant, direct, and essential dependence on mental activity, they are nevertheless fully real. In making the argument, I elaborate a distinction between enactive and essential dependence on mental phenomena, arguing that both kinds of dependence may obtain without impinging on an entity's reality. In Part III, I address the question of objectivity and mind-dependence: I argue that certain kinds of mind-dependence, in particular, dependence on judgments, have the effect of undermining the objectivity of the relevant domain. One consequence of the view I develop is that the objectivity of a subject matter can come apart from the reality of its associated entities; another is that objectivity is a feature that is relative, rather than absolute, and depends crucially on which perspectives are brought to bear for the purposes of evaluation. by Ekaterina Botchkina.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a micro-history of the {{formation}} of the various identities that shaped the Revolutionary War experiences of one eighteenth-century Vermonter (Thomas Johnson) whose life is documented in a manuscript collection at the Vermont Historical Society. I break down Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s identities into three levels: social class, state, and national. My argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant to be a provincial gentleman, to be a Vermonter, and to be an American were still being constructed {{at the time of the}} Revolution and were therefore in a state of flux. The fluid nature of these identities shows us how America 2 ̆ 7 s founding fathers 2 ̆ 7 generation was full of ambiguity and a multiplicity choices. The first section of my thesis analyzes how Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s identity as a gentleman officer influenced his experience as a prisoner-of-war. I argue that Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s identity as an American patriot and his role as a double-agent can only be understood in relation to his conflicted identity as a provincial gentleman. The second section, on the identity of Vermont in the context of a new American nation, starts with historical background on the formation of Vermont first as part of New Hampshire, then as part of New York, and, finally, in negotiations with the British in Canada to rejoin the British empire, with which Johnson participated. In this section I argue that the shifting identities of colonial and revolutionary Vermont provided a backdrop of fluidity and change, as well as animosities between eastern and western residents, which influenced the identities of individual Vermonters during the war, including Thomas Johnson. For the national level, I look at how European Americans had divided loyalties during the war, with an emphasis on the Revolution as a civil war. My thesis departs from most historiography on the Revolution as a civil war, though, by examining it as a war with gray area - not just black and white, or Patriots versus Loyalists. I use this analysis to examine how Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s community was divided and why Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s neighbors reacted so diversely to the possibility that he was working with the British. In a last and brief section of my thesis, I look at how Johnson has been memorialized in his town 2 ̆ 7 s history, and how doubts of his American loyalty have all but disappeared over time, regardless of the intense debates they provoked during his lifetime. I aim to show that despite the consensus view that has shaped much of the historical memory of the American Revolution, the actual process of revolution was full of disorientation and turbulence...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation isn’t everyone’s {{bottle of}} coke, and it’s an {{especially}} dirty word {{when applied to}} culture. The nightmare of global cultural homogeneity is even more disturbing than the stifling economic embrace of transnational corporations. Yet {{we are about to}} witness a cultural festival that simply revels in the claim to being global. This is the soccer World Cup Finals 2002 — or, rather, La Coupe du Monde to register its French provinence. Soccer’s claim to be the ‘world game’ is unashamed. Sixty-four games will be played physically in South Korea and Japan from late May to late June, and relayed in varying forms at at different times and speeds to billions of viewers, listeners and readers. The Sydney 2000 Games, so seemingly all-consuming at the time, will be put in perspective as much the lesser sports spectacle. So why isn’t the World Cup, with its massive broadcast rights fees and its major corporate partners, commonly condemned {{as one of the most}} powerful contemporary instances of globalisation? The answer, perhaps, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> simultaneously reveals is the power of and the limits to globalisation itself. What limits, you might ask? Well, to kick off, so to speak, my having to use the word ‘soccer’ to describe the tournament to this radio audience is a dead giveaway that globalisation is not a completed process. The word almost sticks in the throat of an association football fan. ‘Soccer’ is a description of the sport used only in those idiosyncratic countries, like Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand and the United States, where there is some serious challenge to the dominant code of football. Just to call it soccer rather than football to distinguish it from league, union, rules or gridiron is to recognise that the world game’s global hegemony is still some way distant. Then let us consider the hosts. The absurd compromise of staging the World Cup Finals in two countries whose relations are characterised by bitter antagonism was produced out of national and regional machinations within FIFA, the French-based world governing body. FIFA members felt bound to stage the Games in the expanding and lucrative Asian region. But internal politicking turned the Jules Rimet trophy into a poison chalice out of which Korea and Japan are supposed happily to sup. Giving the World Cup Finals to these nations, and cutting out North Korea — the Axis of Evil country that, it was originally suggested, could get a slice of the reconciliatory football action — highlights the clunkiness of the machinery of globalisation when confronted by deep, historical enmity. And what can we expect to see on our TV screens? A universal love fest proclaiming the death of the nation and the coming of global society? Hardly — the expressions of nationalist fervour and the fierce assertions of spatially-based identity will indelibly mark proceedings. Of course, it could be claimed the World Cup marks another significant staging post on the royal road to globalisation, as the world secular religion of football fuses with the brand name-fixated capitalist consumption of Nike, Adidas, McDonald’s, Budweiser, Philips and Fujifilm. The football teams of nations might come to resemble just so many niches in a global market. Mega media sports events do seem to be classic cases of cultural globalisation in the strongest sense. The different playing strips worn by players and adapted by fans cannot disguise the uniform regulations that all are expected to obey. But the World Cup continues to draw its strength from a remarkably portable and polyvalent game that expresses itself vibrantly through the colourful, dramatic expression of national difference. The sights and sounds generated from the terraces are often unpredictable and off-the-wall — the kind of popular cultural creativity that corporate capital can only try to harness while never quite having under control. The theatre of football might be underwritten by big business, but the visible and unseen hands of the market cannot comprehensively orchestrate proceedings. The passions that animate football are atavistic — chauvinistic, sometimes, and even violent. Its deeply territorial nature is incompletely accommodated to the disciplined consumption demanded of a truly global consumer system. For example, some English fans in attendance will wave the highly marketable flag of Saint George or the heavily promoted merchandise of Manchester United progressively colonising Asian sport and clothes stores. But the television cameras will also pick out the obscure banners of very uncorporate local teams like Brighton and Hove Albion or Plymouth Argyle. Any Scots in attendance will be supporting whichever team is playing the Old Enemy, and the national cultural politics of Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas will be played out, symbolically, in the form of penalties, fouls and goals. That’s the paradox of the world game for you — a global repudiation of the possibility of global culture. • This is a slightly extended version of a talk on ABC Radio National’s Perspective program, broadcast on Tuesday 7 May, 2002.
