5000|$|Excision endo{{nuclease}}, {{also known}} as <b>excinuclease</b> or UV-Specific Endonuclease, is a nuclease (enzyme) which excises a fragment of nucleotides during DNA repair. The <b>excinuclease</b> cuts out a fragment by hydrolyzing two phosphodiester bonds, one {{on either side of}} the lesion in the DNA. This process is part of [...] "nucleotide excision repair", a mechanism that can fix specific types of damage to the DNA in the G1 phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Such damage may include thymine dimers created by UV rays as well as the bulky distortions in DNA caused by oxidized benzopyrenes from sources such as cigarette smoke.|$|E
50|$|A {{deficiency}} of <b>excinuclease</b> {{occurs in a}} rare autosomal recessive disease called xeroderma pigmentosum. Diagnosis of this disease is done by measuring the enzyme's level in white blood cells in a blood sample.

50|$|UvrABC {{endonuclease}} is a multienzyme {{complex in}} Escherichia coli involved in DNA repair by nucleotide excision repair, and it is, therefore, sometimes called an <b>excinuclease.</b> This UvrABC repair process, {{sometimes called the}} short-patch process, involves the removal of twelve nucleotides where a genetic mutation has occurred followed by a DNA polymerase, replacing these aberrant nucleotides with the correct nucleotides and completing the DNA repair. The subunits for this enzyme are encoded in the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC genes. This enzyme complex is able to repair {{many different types of}} damage, including cyclobutyl dimer formation.|$|E
50|$|All umu strains {{carry the}} plasmid pSK1002 which bears an umuD gene and an umuC gene fused with lacZ, the {{structural}} gene for beta-galactosidase. The induction of mutator gene umuC by DNA-damaging agents is detected by measuring intracellular beta-galactosidase levels. Like other tests, the strains have been genetically modified further. A {{reduction of the}} lipopolysaccharide structure of the cell wall (rfa) facilitates an increased permeability, epsecailly for hydrophobic chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons. A further sensitivity enhancing alteration compared with wild type strains is the deficiency in a general pathway for the excision of damaged bases from the DNA: the nucleotide-excision repair. Incision near conformational distortions of the DNA, caused {{by a variety of}} bulky adducts, occurs via the formation of multiprotein complex, consisting of 3 proteins, collectively called UvrABC <b>excinuclease.</b> The deletion of this region results in a loss of repair efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Molecular Signatures in {{the form}} of conserved {{signature}} indels (CSIs) and proteins (CSPs) have been found that are uniquely shared by all members belonging to the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum. These CSIs and CSPs are distinguishing characteristics that delineate the unique phylum from all other bacterial organisms, and their exclusive distribution is parallel with the observed differences in physiology. CSIs and CSPs have also been found that support order and family-level taxonomic rankings within the phylum. Some of the CSIs found to support order level distinctions are thought {{to play a role in}} the respective extremophilic characteristics. The CSIs found in DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta and DNA topoisomerase I in Thermales species may be involved in thermophilicity, while those found in <b>Excinuclease</b> ABC, DNA gyrase, and DNA repair protein RadA in Deinococcales species may be associated with radioresistance. Two CSPs that were found uniquely for all members belonging to the Deinococcus genus are well characterized and are thought to play a role in their characteristic radioresistant phenotype. These CSPs include the DNA damage repair protein PprA the single-stranded DNA-binding protein DdrB.|$|E
40|$|ABC <b>excinuclease</b> of Escherichia coli removes 6 - 4 photoproducts and {{pyrimidine}} dimers from DNA {{by making}} two single strand incisions, one 8 phosphodiester bonds 5 ' and another 4 or 5 phosphodiester bonds 3 ' to the lesion. We describe in this communication a method, which utilizes DNA photolyase from E. coli, pyrimidine dimer endonucleases from M. luteus and bacteriophage T 4, and alkali hydrolysis, for analyzing the ABC <b>excinuclease</b> incision pattern corresponding {{to each of}} these photoproducts in a DNA fragment. On occasion, ABC <b>excinuclease</b> does not incise DNA exclusively 8 phosphodiester bonds 5 ' or 4 or 5 phosphodiester bonds 3 ' to the photoproduct. Both the nature of the adduct (6 - 4 photoproduct or pyrimidine dimer) and the sequence of neighboring nucleotides influence the incision pattern of ABC <b>excinuclease.</b> We show directly that photolyase stimulates the removal of pyrimidine dimers (but not 6 - 4 photoproducts) by the <b>excinuclease.</b> Also, photolyase does not repair CC pyrimidine dimers efficiently while it does repair TT or TC pyrimidine dimers...|$|E

Under conditions where the T 4 enzyme {{was able to}} induce repair synthesis in both XP complementation groups in agreement with earlier observations (de Jonge et al., 1985), no effect of the UvrABCD <b>excinuclease</b> could be observed either when the enzymatic complex was injected into the cytoplasm, or when it was delivered directly into the nucleus. In addition, no effect of the E. coli <b>excinuclease</b> {{was found on the}} repair ability of normal repair-proficient human fibroblasts.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{has several}} {{overlapping}} DNA repair pathways which act in concert {{to eliminate the}} DNA damage caused by a diverse array of physical and chemical agents. The ABC <b>excinuclease</b> which is encoded by the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC genes mediates both the incision and excision steps of nucleotide excision repair. Traditionally, this repair pathway has been assumed to be active against DNA adducts that cause major helical distortions. To determine the level of helical deformity required for recognition and repair by ABC <b>excinuclease,</b> we have evaluated the substrate specificity of this enzyme by using DNA damaged by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. ABC <b>excinuclease</b> incised methylated DNA in vitro in a dose-dependent manner in a reaction that was ATP dependent and specific for the fully reconstituted enzyme.

40|$|Caffeine potentiates the {{mutagenic}} and lethal {{effects of}} genotoxic agents. It {{is thought that}} this is due, {{at least in some}} organisms, to inhibition of DNA repair. However, direct evidence for inhibition of repair enzymes has been lacking. Using purified Escherichia coli DNA photolyase and (A) BC <b>excinuclease,</b> we show that the drug inhibits photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair by two different mechanisms. Caffeine inhibits photoreactivation by interfering with the specific binding of photolyase to damaged DNA, and it inhibits nucleotide excision repair by promoting nonspecific binding of the damage-recognition subunit, UvrA, of (A) BC <b>excinuclease.</b> A number of other intercalators, including acriflavin and ethidium bromide, appear to inhibit the <b>excinuclease</b> by a similar mechanism [...] that is, by trapping the UvrA subunit in nonproductive complexes on undamaged DNA...|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide-excision repair is {{the repair}} system for {{removing}} bulky lesions from DNA. Humans deficient in this repair pathway suffer from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a disease characterized by photodermatoses, including skin cancers. At the cellular level, XP patients fail to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine(6 - 4) pyrimidone photoproducts induced by UV light, {{as well as}} other bulky DNA lesions caused by various genotoxic agents. XP cells are not particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation or to alkylating agents that cause mostly nonbulky DNA lesions. Therefore, it has generally been assumed that the human nucleotide-excision repair enzyme (<b>excinuclease)</b> is specific for bulky adducts. To determine the substrate range of human <b>excinuclease</b> we used the highly sensitive excision assay and tested bulky adducts, synthetic apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, N 6 -methyladenine, O 6 -methylguanine, and mismatches as potential substrates.

40|$|Previous work to {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} crosslink repair by (A) BC <b>excinuclease</b> has shown that a psoralen-crosslinked duplex is selectively incised in the furan-side strand, while a three-stranded structure is incised in the pyrone-side strand of the crosslink. These observations support a sequential incision and recombination model for the complete error-free repair of a psoralen crosslink. The work presented here extends these findings by demonstrating that {{in the presence of}} RecA protein and a homologous DNA oligonucleotide, (A) BC <b>excinuclease</b> is induced to incise the pyrone-side strand of a crosslinked double-stranded plasmid molecule. This finding adds further support to the current model for error-free crosslink repair...|$|E
40|$|The size {{of repair}} patch made by E. coli DNA {{polymerase}} I (Poll) following {{the removal of}} a thymine-psoralen monoadduct by E. coli (A) BC <b>excinuclease</b> was determined by using an M 13 mp 19 DNA with a single psoralen monoadduct at the polylinker region. Incubation of this substrate with (A) BC <b>excinuclease,</b> Poll and a combination of 3 dnTP plus 1 dNTP(alpha S) for each nucleotide, and DNA ligase resulted in a repair patch with phosphorothioate linkages. The preferential hydrolysis of phosphorothioate bonds by heating in iodoethanol revealed a patch size [...] with minimal nick translation [...] equal in length to the 12 nucleotide gap generated by this excision nuclease...|$|E
40|$|The UvrC {{protein is}} one of three {{subunits}} of the Escherichia coli repair enzyme (A) BC <b>excinuclease.</b> This subunit is thought to have {{at least one of the}} active sites for nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bonds of damaged DNA. To localize the active site, mutant UvrC proteins were constructed by linker-scanning and deletion mutagenesis. In vivo studies revealed that the C-terminal 314 amino acids of the 610 -amino acid UvrC protein were sufficient to confer UV resistance to cells lacking the uvrC gene. The portion of the uvrC gene encoding the C-terminal half of the protein was fused to the 3 ' end of the E. coli malE gene (which encodes maltose binding protein), and the fusion protein MBP-C 314 C was purified and characterized. The fusion protein, in combination with UvrA and UvrB subunits, reconstituted the <b>excinuclease</b> activity that incised the eighth phosphodiester bond 5 ' and the fourth phosphodiester bond 3 ' to a psoralen-thymine adduct. These results suggest that the C-terminal 314 amino acids of UvrC constitute a functional domain capable of interacting with the UvrB-damaged DNA complex and of inducing the two phosphodiester bond incisions characteristic of (A) BC <b>excinuclease...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair in Escherichia coli is initiated by (A) BC <b>excinuclease,</b> an enzyme which incises DNA {{on both sides}} of bulky adducts and removes the damaged nucleotide as a 12 - 13 base long oligomer. The incision pattern of the enzyme was examined using DNA modified by 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO) and UV light. Similar to the cleavage pattern of UV photoproducts and other bulky adducts, the enzyme incises the 8 th phosphodiester bond 5 ' and 5 th phosphodiester bond 3 ' to the 4 NQO-modifed base, primarily guanine. The extent of DNA damage by these agents was determined using techniques which quantitatively cleave the DNA or stop {{at the site of the}} adduct. By comparison of the intensity of gel bands created by (A) BC <b>excinuclease</b> and the specific cleavage at the damaged site, the efficiency of (A) BC <b>excinuclease</b> incision at 13 different 4 NQO-induced adducts and 13 different photoproducts was determined by densitometric scanning. In general, incisions made at 4 NQO-induced adducts are proportional to the extent of damage, though the efficiency of cutting throughout the sequence tested varies from 25 to 75 %. Incisions made at pyrimidine dimers are less efficient than at 4 NQO-adducts, ranging from 13 to 65 % incision relative to modification, though most are around 50 %. The two (6 - 4) photoproducts within the region tested are incised more efficiently than any pyrimidine dimer...|$|E
40|$|A general {{method has}} been {{developed}} to measure the formation and removal of DNA adducts in defined sequences of mammalian genomes. Adducted genomic DNA is digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme, treated with Escherichia coli UvrABC excision nuclease (ABC <b>excinuclease),</b> subjected to alkaline gel electrophoresis, and probed for specific sequences by Southern hybridization. The ABC <b>excinuclease</b> incises DNA containing bulky adducts and thus reduces {{the intensity of the}} full-length fragments in Southern hybridization in proportion to the number of adducts present in the probed sequence. This method is similar to that developed by Bohr et al. [Bohr, V. A., Smith, C. A., Okumoto, D. S. & Hanawalt, P. C. (1985) Cell 40, 359 - 369] for quantifying pyrimidine dimers by using T 4 endonuclease V.

All His and the majority of Asp mutants behaved like wild-type protein in vivo and in vitro. However, three mu-tants, D 337 A, D 478 A, and D 510 A, either completely or partially abolished UvrB activity. All three mutant proteins associate with UvrA normally but D 337 A and D 510 A were unable to bind to DNA specifically. The UvrB-D 478 A mutant bound to DNA specifically but failed to denature and kink the DNA. However, UvrB-D 478 A was efficiently loaded onto DNA preincised at the 3 ‘ site and promoted near-normal incision by UvrC at the 5 ’ site. We propose that D 478 is involved in bending DNA and catalysis of the 3 ‘ incision and that the 3 ’ incision precedes the 5 ’ incision. UvrB ’ which is missing the carboxyl-terminal 43 amino acids binds to, and kinks DNA but is unable to make the 3 ’ incision suggesting that it is missing a residue involved in ca-talysis.

As current leptospirosis vaccination is relatively unsuccessful, development ofefficacious vaccines through novel means became utmost priority for prevention of frequent outbreaks of thedisease. Herein, MHC class II restricted peptide epitopes were identified from pathogenic Leptospiralmembrane proteins to suggest T-cell epitope driven leptospirosis vaccines through reverse vaccinology. Theproteome of Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai was screened to select 137 membrane proteins. JembossAntigenic server was employed to find antigenic peptides, followed by ProPred analysis to predict 30 shortpeptides having strong binding affinity with HLA DRB 1 * 0101, DRB 1 * 0401 and DRB 1 * 1501 alleles. Predictions were revised to pick antigenic peptides with same core region binding with the selected HLADRB 1 alleles and ten such peptides were found from seven proteins. Further, to confirm the interaction atstructure level, Leptospira <b>excinuclease</b> ABC subunit B protein having short T-cell antigenic peptide (133 -REDVVIVSSVSCIYGLG- 149) was modeled using Modeller 9 v 7. The model reliability was evaluated throughProcheck, ProSA and ProQ. Docking calculations for selected HLA DRB 1 alleles (receptor) and modeledLeptospira <b>excinuclease</b> ABC subunit B protein (ligand) were carried out using Hex 5. 1. The protein -proteininteraction revealed that the core region (136 -VVIVSSVSC- 144) of the antigenic peptide (133 -REDVVIVSSVSCIYGLG- 149) was well interacting with the receptors.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between UvrABC <b>excinuclease</b> from Escherichia coli and ultraviolet light-(UV) damaged DNA was studied by flow linear dichroism. The dichroism signal from DNA was drastically decreased in intensity upon incubation with UvrA and UvrB or whole enzyme {{in the presence}} off effector ATP. The change was specific for UV-damaged DNA, and a concluded suppressed DNA orientation suggests the wrapping of DNA around the protein. The incubation with the UvrC subunit alone also somewhat reduces the signal, however, {{in this case the}} change was smaller and not specific for UV-damaged DNA.

The strains used were PQ 37, which possesses a uvrA mutation and is deficient in UvrA <b>excinuclease</b> activity, and PQ 35, which is uvr and UvrABC <b>excinuclease</b> conpetent. These strains {{were exposed to the}} compounds being investigated under both oxic and hypoxic conditions. The results showed that RSU 1069 and some of its analogues were more active than misonidazole under both oxic and hypoxic conditions. This increase was due to their aziridine side-chains. With the exception of RSU 1137 and RSU 1170 all of the compounds showed altered SOS induction activities between oxic and hypoxic conditions. This alteration was shown to correlate with increased reduction of their nitro-groups under hypoxia. There was a difference in the hypoxic activities of RSU 1 (J 69 and some of its analogues between the uvrA-strain and the uvr -strain. With the uvrA-strain RSU 1069 showed decrease activity under hypoxia compared to oxia, whereas, the converse applied with the uvr -strain. This was interpreted to mean that RSU 1069 caused some damage that required an active UvrABC <b>excinuclease</b> to produce an SOS response. It has been proposed that this damage takes the form of DNA crosslinks. RSU 1137 showed insignificant SOS induction and this was demonstrated to be due to its nitro-group not being reduced. It was suggested that the ring opened aziridine side chain of RSU 1137 in some way inhibited its bioreduction. The order of activity of the drugs for SOS induction activities did not correlate with that for their toxicities. This indicated that DNA lesions other than, or in addition to, those responsible for cytotoxicity induced the SOS response. The DNA damaging activity and mutagenicity of RSU 1069 was also investigated using Ml 3 phage rfDNA. Radiation reduced RSU 1069 was shown to produce some relatively long lived product that was more active towards DNA than unreduced RSU 1069, as judged by phage survival. Unreduced RSU 1069 was shown to be non-mutagenic, producing mutation rates under 1. 5 times background level. The effect of strict hypoxic conditions upon the SOS response was investigated using the SOS-Chromotest with the uvrA tester strain. The results showed that the SOS response was induced under strictly anaerobic conditions in E. coli but that the response was altered compared to that obtained aerobically. The nature of the alteration was not determined as six different compounds, with five different modes of action, were used as SOS-inducers and all showed different types of response under hypoxic conditions...|$|E

In addition, it could be shown to exert a protective effect against oxidizing and nitrosating agents. Interestingly, inactivation of uvrB and uvrD 1 significantly increased marker integration frequencies in gene conversion assays.

Based on the lack of a DNase-I-hypersensitive site in the footprint of the mutant, it was proposed that the lack of incision was due to the inability of the mutant UvrB to kink the DNA.

Since these changes might include a denaturation of DNA at the lesion site and, consequently, a bubble structure might be present in a pre-incision complex, we studied incision activity of UvrABC <b>excinuclease</b> on substrates with 1 - 4 unpaired bases next to an AAF adduct. Opening more than one base on either or both sides of the lesion caused a significant decrease in the incision activity of UvrABC, but did not change the position of the incision sites.

In this work, the mutagenicity induced by 1 O 2 in a defined sequence of DNA was investigated after replication in Escherichia coli mutants deficient for nucleotide and base excision DNA repair pathways. For this purpose a plasmid containing a 1 O 2 -damaged 14 base oligonucleotide was introduced into E. coli by transfection and mutations were screened by hybridization with an oligonucleotide with the original sequence. Mutagenesis was observed in all strains tested, but it was especially high in the BH 20 (fpg), AYM 57 (fpg mutY) and AYM 84 (fpg mutY uvrC) strains.

Additionally, most of the mutations were G→T and G→C transversions, but this was dependent on the position of the guanine in the sequence and on repair deficiency in the host bacteria.

The protein sequence was determined from the DNA sequence of the uvrB gene and was confirmed by sequencing the NH 2 -terminus of the UvrB protein and analyzing its overall amino acid composition. The coding region of uvrB is 2019 basepairs, specifying a protein of 672 amino acids and Mr of 76, 118. The sequence of the UvrB protein shows a moderate level of homology to that of the UvrC protein and to the ATP binding site of the UvrA protein. During purification of UvrB protein a proteolytic product, UvrB, is produced in high quantities.

Mutations affecting either Orf 5 or orf 6 resulted in strains with decreased resistance to UV-irradiation in the stationary phase, indicating that these proteins {{play a role in the}} development of a nonspecific stationary-phase resistance to UV-irradiation. Moreover, these results suggest an involvement of both proteins in transformation and presumably in DNA repair...|$|E
40|$|Single-strand binding {{proteins}} (SSB) {{are small}} molecules that bind to single stranded DNA {{to maintain its}} primary structure. Their C-terminal ends interact also with other proteins to activate them. These proteins assist in processes replication, recombination and repair of DNA. The C-terminal end is highly conserved. The most repeated combinations of last four amino acids are DIPF, DLPF, EIPF, ELPF. Further analysis of the last ten residues {{of this part of}} molecule, revealed that it is dominated by negatively charged and hydrophobic amino acids. Not only C-terminal end is very specific for them but also their surrounding genes. In 2003, the research group from the Netherlands presented that genes encoding SSB proteins occur very often in the neighbourhood of the genes of the ribosomal protein S 6, ribosomal protein S 18 and <b>excinuclease</b> ABC subunit A. Since 2003, the number of sequenced Bacteria increased from 69 to more than 1600 organisms. Our new study revealed that in addition to these three mentioned above genes, also the ribosomal protein L 9 and major facilitator superfamily transporter occur very often. A lot of bacteria have more than one gene encoding SSB protein. In most cases, these additional ssb genes have completely different composition of the C-terminal ends and also different surrounding genes. The evidence confirming their SSB function, is the existence of distinctive oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain, also known as OB fold, which bind to DNA to protect it against forming of the secondary structures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{nucleotide}} excision repair, the additional deficiency of the DNA alkyltransferase (ATase) encoded by the constitutive ogt gene of Escherichia coli caused a marked increase in mutation induction by iV-butyl-iV-nitrosourea (BNU). Irrespective of {{the presence or absence}} of the Ogt ATase, little mutagenic response was detected in Uvr+ bacteria in the concentration range 0 - 8 mM BNU, indicating that most premutagenic DNA lesions induced at these concentrations are efficiently recognized and repaired by the nucleotide excision repair system. Increased suscepti-bility to mutagenesis by BNU was detected in Uvr ~ Ogt+ bacteria, but the Uvr ~ Ogt " double mutant exhibited much higher sensitivity. These data suggest that the Ogt ATase can replace to a great extent the repair capacity of the (A) BC <b>excinuclease.</b> Forward mutations induced by 6 mM BNU within the initial part of the lacl gene of E. coli were recovered from Uvr+ Ogt~, Uvr " Ogt+ and Uvr ~ Ogt~ bacteria. A total of 454 independent mutations were charac-terized by DNA sequence analysis. The BNU-induced spectra were dominated by G:C—»A:T transitions, consist-ent with the major role of the 0 *-alkylguanine miscoding lesion in mutagenesis by alkylating agents. Specific sites for G:C—»A:T transitions were recovered more or less frequently in one genetic background versus the others, giving statistically significant differences among the spectra (P A:T transitions; preferences different from those previously reported for other alkylnitrosoureas were detected. We discuss how these differences might be caused by BNU producing branched chain derivatives, in addition to the expected linear chain adducts, and by possible preferences with respect to both the initial distribution of O'-butylguanine lesions and their repairability...|$|E
40|$|When {{populations of}} repair-proficient diploid human {{fibroblasts}} {{were treated with}} (+/-) - 7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy- 9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) during early S phase, just as the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRT) was being replicated, 5 % of the induced base substitutions were found at nt 212, and 5 % of the substitutions were found at nt 229 in exon 3. However, when the population was treated in early G 1 phase to allow at least 12 hr for repair {{before the onset of}} S phase, 21 % of the substitutions were found at nt 212, and 10 % were found at nt 229. No such cell-cycle-dependent difference in distribution of base substitutions occurred in excision-repair-deficient cells. To test whether the increase in the relative frequency of mutations resulted from inefficient repair at these sites, we adapted ligation-mediated PCR to measure the rates of removal of BPDE adducts from individual sites in exon 3 of the HPRT gene. Cells were treated with 0. 5 microM BPDE in early G 1 phase and harvested immediately or after 10, 20, and 30 hr for repair. the nontranscribed strand of exon 3 was analyzed for the original distribution of adducts and those remaining after repair, using Escherichia coli UvrABC <b>excinuclease</b> to excise the adducts and annealing a 5 ' biotinylated gene-specific primer to the DNA and extending it with Sequenase 2. 0 to generate a blunt end at the site of each cut. A linker was ligated to the blunt end, and the desired fragments were isolated {{from the rest of the}} genomic DNA by using magnetic beads, amplified by PCR, and analyzed on a sequencing gel. The distribution of fragments of particular lengths indicated the relative number of BPDE adducts initially formed or remaining at specific sites. The rates of repair at individual sites varied widely along exon 3 of the HPRT gene and were very slow at nt 212 and 229, strongly supporting the hypothesis that inefficient DNA repair plays an important role in the formation of mutation hotspots...|$|E
40|$|If {{excision}} repair-proficient {{human cells}} are {{allowed time for}} repair before onset of S phase, the premutagenic lesions formed by (+/-) - 7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy- 9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, BPDE) are lost from the transcribed strand of the hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene faster than from the nontranscribed strand. No change in strand distribution is seen with repair-deficient cells. These results suggest strand-specific repair of BPDE-induced DNA damage in human cells. To test this, we measured the initial number of BPDE adducts formed in each strand of the actively transcribed HPRT gene {{and the rate of}} repair, using UvrABC <b>excinuclease</b> in conjunction with Southern hybridization and strand-specific probes. We also measured the rate of loss of BPDE adducts from the inactive 754 locus. The frequencies of adducts formed by exposure to BPDE (1. 0 or 1. 2 microM) in either strand of a 20 -kilobase fragment that lies entirely within the transcription unit of the HPRT gene were similar; the frequency in the 14 -kilobase 754 fragment was approximately 20 % lower. The rates of repair in the two strands of the HPRT fragment differed significantly. Within 7 hr after treatment with 1. 2 microM BPDE, 53 % of the adducts had been removed from the transcribed strand, but only 26 % from the nontranscribed strand; after 20 hr, these values were 87 % and 58 %, respectively. In contrast, only approximately 14 % of the BPDE adducts were lost from the 754 locus in 20 hr, a value even lower than the rate of loss from the overall genome (i. e., 38 %). These results demonstrate strand-specific and preferential repair of BPDE adducts in human cells. They suggest that the heterogeneous repair of BPDE adducts in the human genome cannot be accounted for merely by the greatly increased rate of the repair specific to the transcribed strand of the active genes, and they point to a role for the chromatin structure...|$|E
40|$|The pH-inducible acid {{tolerance}} response (ATR) {{is believed to}} play a major role in acid adaptation and virulence of Streptococcus mutans. To study this phenomenon in S. mutans JH 1005, differential display PCR was used to identify and clone 13 cDNA products that had increased expression in response to pH 5. 0 compared to that of pH 7. 5 -grown cells. One of these products, confirmed to be pH inducible by RNA dot blot and reverse transcription-PCR analyses, had 67 % identity to a uvrA-UV repair <b>excinuclease</b> gene in Bacillus subtilis. Further sequence analysis of the uvrA homologue using the S. mutans genome database revealed that the complete gene was encoded in an open reading frame (ORF) of 2, 829 bp (944 amino acids; 104. 67 kDa). Immediately 3 ′ of uvrA was an ORF encoding a putative aminopeptidase gene (pepP). uvrA knockouts were constructed in S. mutans strains JH 1005, NG 8, and UA 159 using allelic-exchange mutagenesis, replacing the entire gene with an erythromycin resistance cassette. As with uvrA mutants in other bacteria, the S. mutans uvrA mutants were extremely sensitive to UV irradiation. The uvrA mutant of S. mutans JH 1005 was also more sensitive than the wild type to growth at pH 5. 0, showing a 15 % reduction in growth rate and a 14 % reduction in final resting culture density. Acid-adapted S. mutans JH 1005 uvrA mutants were shown to be more resistant to UV irradiation than was the parent but were unable to survive exposure to a killing pH of 3. 0. Moreover, agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from uvrA-deficient cells exposed to low pH demonstrated more DNA damage than that for the wild-type strain. Here we suggest that uvrA and the nucleotide excision repair pathway are involved in the repair of acid-induced DNA damage and are associated with successful adaptation of S. mutans to low pH...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the DNA damaging abilities of SR 4233 (Tirapazamine) and a range of congeners. These are novel benzotriazine-N-oxide compounds of potential clinical importance in the treatment of hypoxic tumours. The studies used a viral double transfection assay which involved exposing purified X 174 DNA to the compounds under oxic, hypoxic and hypoxic reductive conditions and subsequently transfecting the DNA into E. coli AB 1157 and E. coli C. Experiments under reductive hypoxia were carried out between pH 4 - 7 to establish if a reduction product required protonation for the DNA damage process. The biologically relevant druginduced DNA damage was assessed by utilising a range of E. coli mutants deficient in specific DNA repair genes, the products of which are involved in excision, recombination and SOS repair. Viscometry was used to assess the effects of various druginucleotide ratios and the ionic strength of the buffer on the DNA damage caused. DNA has been confirmed as a target for the action of the benzotriazine-N-oxides. SR 4233, the lead compound, was found to be the most active of all the compounds tested. Damage was only induced upon reduction of the compounds and there was no significant damage to DNA under oxic or hypoxic conditions. SR 4233 exhibited increased DNA damage at acid pH indicating that the radical anion responsible for DNA damage has a requirement for protonation. The damaging species is probably the 1 -electron reduction product of SR 4233 as SR 4317 and SR 4330, the 2 -electron and 4 -electron reduction products respectively, caused significantly less DNA damage under hypoxic reductive conditions. There is also evidence that the disproportionation reaction, which can lead to radical production without DNA damage, may not be an important reaction for SR 4233 bioactivation. Studies with repair-deficient mutants of E. coli indicated that SR 4233 is capable of inducing DNA damage which is recognised and repaired by the ABC <b>excinuclease</b> complex. However, the major damage caused is recognised and repaired by the gene products of the xth and nth mutants. This indicates that reduced SR 4233 induces primarily pyrimidine based oxidative damage in DNA...|$|E
