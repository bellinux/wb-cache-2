Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>Trying</b> to Break Your Heart (named after the opening song of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) beginning {{on the day that}} Coomer was dismissed from the band. The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

The series ran until November 1943, and includes many of Gibbons's private reflections on the conflict. In October 1941 she wrote: [...] "he war has done me good... I get a dour satisfaction out of managing the rations, salvaging, fire watching, and feeling that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to work for a better world". In July 1940 Webb enlisted in the Middlesex Regiment, and the following year was commissioned into the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He later served overseas, mostly in Cairo.|$|E
500|$|While {{a segment}} of the press has {{described}} Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticized her for being arrogant and vain—an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character, Poo, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters, and this further established her off- and on-screen personae. Before the release of Chameli (2004) (in which she played a sex worker), Kapoor stated that [...] "there is a certain image that people identify you with [...] t always follows you whichever role you play. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to transgress this image and become more screen-friendly than image-friendly."

500|$|This season's episodes were {{produced}} {{in a process}} {{similar to those of}} the previous season.

The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar, Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, Ako Castuera, Moynihan, Bert Youn, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Steve Wolfhard. Ward was proud with the writing staff for the season, saying, [...] "Everyone [...] is super talented [...] And they're all a bunch of brainiacs, super smart".

500|$|Bill Fay {{released}} {{his first two}} albums, Bill Fay (1970) and Time of the Last Persecution (1971), on the Deram Records label. The recordings did not perform well and Fay was dropped from Deram soon {{after the release of}} his second album. After failing to secure another recording contract, Fay took various jobs including fruit picking, working in a factory and in a supermarket. Fay continued to write songs and entered the studio with a group of musicians in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tapes of the resulting album, Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow, were sent to twelve record companies but the album did not receive a release. In 1998, British record label See for Miles Records re-issued Bill Fay and Time of the Last Persecution on compact disc, reviving interest in Fay's work. Wilco singer Jeff Tweedy, who sang Fay's [...] "Be Not So Fearful" [...] during the 2002 Wilco documentary <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>Trying</b> to Break Your Heart, Current 93s David Tibet, Okkervil Rivers Will Sheff, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, Jim O'Rourke and Nick Cave declared themselves fans of Fay's music.|$|E

Manager Chris Wilder said in January 2009 he wanted to extend Constable's stay the club, claiming he [...] "epitomises what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to build here at the club".

500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E

Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers.
