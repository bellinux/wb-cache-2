40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the challenges that}} the international community faces in responding to the terrorists and the need to change tactics to respond more effectively to an increasingly nebulous enemy. Terrorism can take different forms and is perpetrated by both state and non-state actors. This research looks into the network structure of terrorism and terrorist groups. In the contemporary setting, terrorist organizations operate transnationally hence {{the use of the term}} ‘terrorism without borders’. An enabling factor of terrorism today is the network structure that it has adopted which gives it the ability to both project its reach and prevent easy infiltration. The network structure has also brought about renewed interests in Africa, where global terror networks such as al-Qaeda and the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State</b> compete for influence. Boko Haram in West Africa is an affiliate of the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State</b> and this provides possible linkages with the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State</b> in Libya. Boko Haram refers to itself as the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State’s</b> Western Province. Al-Shabaab has dominated headlines by carrying out deadly attacks in East Africa. The al-Qaeda affiliate has however faced resistance from a section of its members who seek ties with the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State.</b> This resulted in the formation of Jabha East Africa, a group that aligns itself to the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State.</b> The <b>Sinai</b> Peninsula has also witnessed an upsurge of terror attacks perpetrated by the <b>Sinai</b> <b>Province,</b> which views itself as a province of the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State.</b> This surmounts to a complex network structure of terrorist networks in Africa and the growing threat to militant Islam. The special attention is paid to analysis of terrorist challenges in Kenia...|$|R

50|$|Ansar Bait al-Maqdis (ABM) {{has been}} part of the Sinai {{insurgency}} and had been active especially the Sinai since 2011 after the deterioration of security in the Sinai, focusing its efforts on Israel and the Arab gas pipeline to Jordan.

ABM and other jihadist groups intensified their campaign of attacks on Egyptian security forces.

5000|$|The Egyptian {{group from}} which the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade first {{originated}} from, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, appears to have split-off into another recently individualised group, formerly known as [...] "Ajnad Misr" [...] (Soldiers of Egypt) and presently known as [...] "Sinai Province" [...] or [...] "Wilayat Sinai" [...] (although still often referred to by the former), a Sinai-based group. The group's former leader Humam Muhammed pledged full allegiance to ISIL in late 2014, thereby founding the new Ajnad Misr-originated Salafist group <b>Sinai</b> <b>Province</b> (although often rather confusingly referred to by the general Western media as [...] "ISIS in Gaza"(also)), a group presently {{believed to be the}} Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade's arms-trade affiliate in the Sinai Peninsula. Following the leader's assassination by Egyptian police forces on April 5, 2015, the group has become increasingly disbanded. Despite this, it has been gaining an increasing presence in the Gaza Strip, where members are thought to be working closely by the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade as previously mentioned. The Egyptian group is known to display identical ideologies to those the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade i.e. the targeting of national security forces (Hamas and Fatah officials {{in the case of the}} ASheikh Omar Hadid Brigade, and the Egyptian Armed Forces in the case of <b>Sinai</b> <b>Province),</b> followed by the establishment of the al-Sham caliphate (see Ajnad Misr Wikipedia page for more details). Both groups are amongst the many small, yet rapidly growing Gaza-Egyptian ISIL-affiliated groups, which some experts believe could eventually combine forces in the event of an <b>Islamic</b> <b>State</b> insurgency in the area, this possibly resulting in a cross-border civil war. However, due to Egyptian reinforcements along the Gazan border during June 2015, others have suggested that this wouldn't be possible, at least during the near future.|$|R
