40|$|In this study, screw {{and nail}} {{withdrawal}} strengths parallel and perpendicular longitudinal to grain of some hardwoods; oak (Quercus castaneifolia), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), beech (Fagus orientalis), Sycamore (Platanus oriantalis) and poplar (Populus deltoids) were investigated. The {{tests were conducted}} following ASTM D 1761 with specimen dimension of 15 × 5 × 5 (T×R×L). Three kinds of screws namely sheet metal screw, wood screw and coarse <b>drywall</b> <b>screw</b> with diameter of 4 and 5 mm were used. Three different nails with nominal diameter of 2. 5, 3. 25 and 3. 75 mm were also used. The highest screw withdrawal strengths parallel and perpendicular to grain were related to hornbeam, beech, oak, Sycamore and poplar respectively. Furthermore, the highest nail withdrawal strengths parallel and perpendicular to grain were related to hornbeam, oak, beech, Sycamore and poplar respectively for nails with 3. 75 mm diameter. Higher density and shear strength of hornbeam {{compared to the other}} species accounts for its high screw and nail withdrawal strengths parallel and perpendicular to grain...|$|E

50|$|<b>Drywall</b> <b>screws</b> heads have {{a curved}} taper, which {{allows them to}} self-pilot and install rapidly without having to be punched through the paper cover. When {{finished}} driving, these screws are recessed slightly into the <b>drywall.</b> <b>Screws</b> for light-gauge steel framing have an acute point and finely spaced threads. If the steel framing is heavier than 20-gauge, self-tapping screws with finely spaced threads must be used. In some applications, the drywall may {{be attached to the}} wall with adhesives.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to present {{regression}} models for predicting resistance of joints made with screw and plywood members. Joint members were out of hardwood plywood that were 19 mm in thickness. Two types of screws including coarse and fine thread <b>drywall</b> <b>screw</b> with 3. 5, 4 and 5 mm in diameter and sheet metal screw with 4 and 5 mm were used. Results have shown that withdrawal resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws, diameter and penetrating depth. Joints fabricated with coarse thread drywall screws were higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. Finally, average joint withdrawal resistance of screwed could be predicted by means of the expressions Wc= 2. 127 ×D 1. 072 ×P 0. 520 for coarse thread drywall screws and Wf= 1. 377 ×D 1. 156 ×P 0. 581 for fine thread drywall screws by taking account the diameter and penetrating depth. The difference of the observed and predicted data showed that developed models have a good correlation with actual experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|A {{key element}} in the seismic load {{resisting}} system of a wood framed structure is the shear wall which is typically sheathed on one side with plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) and gypsum on the other. The shear capacity of gypsum sheathed shear walls is typically neglected in high seismic areas due to the susceptibility of conventional <b>drywall</b> <b>screw</b> connections to damage caused by earthquakes. The earthquake resistance of an innovative viscoelastic (VE) gypsum shearwall is evaluated and compared to conventional structural and non-structural walls. Ten 8 ft × 8 ft wood framed wall specimens of three configurations [nailed-OSB, screw-gypsum, and VE polymer-gypsum] were subjected to a cyclic test protocol. The energy dissipation, stiffness, and damage characteristics of all shearwalls are reported herein. Testing results indicate the VE-gypsum walls can dissipate more energy than the OSB structural panels and 500 % more energy that the conventional gypsum sheathed walls and contains {{a constant source of}} energy dissipation not seen in the structural and non-structural walls. The wall stiffness of the OSB wall degrades at a far greater rate that the VE gypsum wall and at continued cycling degrades below the VE wall stiffness. Unlike both of the conventional wall types, the VE wall showed no visible or audible signs of damage when subjected to shear displacements up to 1...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{predicting}} bending moment resistance plywood of screw (coarse and fine threads) joints using regression models. Thickness {{of the member}} was 19 mm and compared with medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard with 18 mm thicknesses. Two types of screws including coarse and fine thread <b>drywall</b> <b>screw</b> with nominal diameters of 6, 8 and 10 mm and 3. 5, 4 and 5 cm length respectively and sheet metal screw with diameters of 8 and 10 and length of 4 cm were used. The {{results of the study}} have shown that bending moment resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws diameter and penetrating depth. Screw Length was found to have a larger influence on bending moment resistance than screw diameter. Bending moment resistance with coarse thread drywall screws was higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. The highest bending moment resistance (71. 76 N. m) was observed in joints made with coarse screw which were 5 mm in diameter and 28 mm in depth of penetration. The lowest bending moment resistance (12. 08 N. m) was observed in joints having fine screw with 3. 5 mm diameter and 9 mm penetrations. Furthermore, bending moment resistance in plywood was higher than those of medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard. Finally, it has been found that the ultimate bending moment resistance of plywood joint can be predicted following formula Wc = 0. 189 ×D 0. 726 ×P 0. 577 for coarse thread drywall screws and Wf = 0. 086 ×D 0. 942 ×P 0. 704 for fine ones according to diameter and penetrating depth. The analysis of variance of the experimental and predicted data showed that the developed models provide a fair approximation of actual experimental measurements...|$|E
50|$|Battens {{are used}} for solid wall insulation. Regularly spaced battens are fitted to the wall, the spaces between them filled with insulation, and {{plasterboard}} or <b>drywall</b> <b>screwed</b> to the battens. This method {{is no longer the}} most popular, as rigid insulation sheets give better insulation (with battens bridging the insulation) and take less time to fit.|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{effects of}} screw diameter, screw type, panel type, and end {{distance}} on lateral {{resistance of the}} joints made with drywall and sheet metal screws were studied in bagasse particleboard {{and the results were}} compared to those obtained from commercial medium density fiberboard (MDF). The accuracy of EYM in prediction of lateral resistance was then investigated. The <b>drywall</b> <b>screws</b> comprised of size 8 with coarse thread and size 10 with fine thread; the sheet metal screws comprised of size 8 and 10 with normal thread. Results indicated that lateral resistance increased with the increase in the diameter of both screw types, although not statistically significant. The lateral resistance obtained from MDF specimens was 20 % more than that of bagasse specimens. Increase in the end distance also resulted in an increase in the lateral resistance. In all cases, sheet metal screws showed higher lateral resistance in comparison to those obtained from <b>drywall</b> <b>screws.</b> It can be concluded that Mode IIIs is more accurate than Mode Is in the prediction of lateral resistance in two-member screwed joints (single shear plane) for both MDF and bagasse boards...|$|R
50|$|Drywall is cut to size, using a large T-square, {{by scoring}} {{the paper on}} the {{finished}} side (usually white) with a utility knife, breaking the sheet along the cut, and cutting the paper backing. Small features such as holes for outlets and light switches are usually cut using a keyhole saw or a small high-speed bit in a rotary tool. Drywall is then fixed to the wall structure with nails or <b>drywall</b> <b>screws</b> and often glue. Drywall fasteners, {{also referred to as}} drywall clips or stops, are gaining popularity in both residential and commercial construction. Drywall fasteners are used for supporting interior drywall corners and replacing the non-structural wood or metal blocking that traditionally was used to install drywall. Their function serves to save on material and labour expenses, to minimize call-backs due to truss uplift, to increase energy efficiency, and to make plumbing and electrical installation simpler.|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{are heavy}} {{consumers}} of energy, and residential building design is rapidly addressing topics to maximize energy conservation {{en route to}} net-zero energy consumption. Annual energy analysis of a building informs the choice among disparate energy measures, for cost, durability, occupant comfort, and whole-house energy use. Physics-based and empirical models of elements of a building are used in such analyses. High-performance wood-framed walls enable builders to construct homes that use much less than 40 % of the energy consumed by similar homes built to minimum code. Modeling for these walls has considered physical features such as framing factor, insulation and framing properties, roughness and convective effects, and air leakage. The thermal effects of fasteners used to construct these walls have not been fully evaluated, even though their thermal conductivity is orders of magnitudes {{higher than that of}} other building materials. <b>Drywall</b> <b>screws</b> and siding nails are considered in this finite element thermal conductivity analysis of wall sections that represent wood-framed walls that are often used in high-performance homes. Nails and screws reduce even the best walls' insulating performance by approximately 3 % and become increasingly significant as the framing factor increases...|$|R

Sheilla is also aggressive with the tape, accidentally plastering over the primed wall (meaning that the clay wall treatment will not stick to the wall now that there is plaster on it).|$|R
50|$|Episode 2 - Days 4-6 (September 21) - The {{whole team}} (except Geoff) starts the episode by visiting a {{transfer}} station (Commissioners Street Transfer Station in Toronto's Port Lands) to raid the unwanted junk from visitors there, where they score an old dishwasher, a working microwave, and some stainless steel. A separate trip by Gordie and Cam {{leads them to}} a construction site, where they harvest their used lumber and weeping tile. However, a shortage of fasteners and drywall (being unable to find only scrap pieces and no full sheets) leads Geoff to spend $1000 on new <b>drywall</b> and <b>screws</b> (Cam agrees, as he believes that they would save on plaster compared to drywalling with their scrap pieces). Meanwhile, Michelle believes that she is being silenced in terms of design after Geoff has Gordie and Anthony design decorations made from freecycled materials behind her back (Gordie with a lamp and Anthony with a wine rack) while she and Ross go shopping, but her attitude changes for the better after the junk hotline leads Michelle, Gordie, and Jean-Marc to St. Luke's United Church, where they recover solid oak from old church pews, a large mirror, lockers, and an old desk that they intend to repurpose as their bathroom vanity. For the bathroom tiles, Anthony and Ross grab tiles from a warehouse where Anthony has previously freecycled for tile, but due to miscommunication with Michelle (who had insisted on going with them but was held back by Geoff), they return with more than twice what they need, forcing the team to give away the excess. In the end, Ron has some reservation as to the progress, and the accumulating pile of garbage at the worksite is leading him {{to believe that the}} site is being disrespected.|$|R
40|$|All {{walls that}} are {{not a part of}} the {{supporting}} structure in a building are called non-load bearing walls. It may be the inside of an external wall or a room separating wall. They are usually built as a stud wall with drywall and insulation if necessary. The dominant stud material is steel but it is also common with wood. The drywall is fastened with screws and that can be a time consuming method. Working at construction sites can be demanding for the body with a lot of heavy lifting and non-ergonomic postures. Steel is a finite resource and generates high emissions of substances which has an environmental impact for production because the mostly used energy resource is fossil fuels. The process of mining iron ore and converting the ore to steel is extremely energy intensive. It would be better with a more environmentally friendly alternative and that is what WTC Teknik together with Paper Province and BillerudKorsnäs Gruvön has developed. The product is called Woodpipe and it is made of fluting with a double-sided tape used for fastening the <b>drywall</b> instead of <b>screws.</b> An LCA has been done to find out how much less environmental impact Woodpipe generates compared to a steel stud. Data has been collected from BillerudKorsnäs, Europrofil, and through a literature review. The results show that Woodpipe has a lower impact for the environment in all phases of the life cycle regarding emissions of substances that affects global warming, acidification and eutrophication. Woodpipe is lighter and uses a faster method of assembling than regular steel studs. This makes Woodpipe easier to handle at construction sites and makes the product attractive to the market. The efficiency improvement for Woodpipe is in the raw material phase where the majority of the emissions now come from. ...|$|R
