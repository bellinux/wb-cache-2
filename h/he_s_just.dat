40|$|Presentation {{of audio}} or video files for {{browsing}} is difficult {{due to their}} serial and transitory nature whereas texts or photos may be simply placed in the user's visual field. This paper describes a simple technique for browsing and selecting among temporal signals such as audio and video. In the proposed method, only two among a set of the signals are presented to the user {{at a time and}} (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> needs to select a `winner' among the two. This process is repeated for many rounds until a single winner remains as analogous to the tournament match in many sport games. We applied this intuitive technique to browsing and selecting among computeranimation clips for motion parameter setting. It would also be applicable to browsing/selecting among retrieved candidates in audio/video retrieval systems. Key Words: browsing, retrieval, tournament, multimedia, audio, video, user interface. 1 Introduction Browsing in a visual user interface takes advantage of the fact that a variety of artifa [...] ...|$|R
