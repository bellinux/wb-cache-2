5|$|The Baltimore Ravens {{selected}} Smith {{with the}} 58th overall {{pick in the}} second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Smith, who ran the 40-yard dash in 4.41 seconds at the combine, was described as a deep threat that the team <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> previous season.|$|E
5|$|A dry track during Q2 {{saw the two}} Mercedes drivers fastest, Rosberg four-tenths of {{a second}} faster than Hamilton. Fernando Alonso failed {{to make it into}} Q3, the seventh time that season. He <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> last part of {{qualifying}} seven times over the entire course of his Ferrari stint in the five previous seasons. Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in 14th place, meaning that he - like Button - was unable to take the full extent of his ten-place grid penalty.|$|E

A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E

5|$|The first 14 {{picks in}} the draft belonged to teams that <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs; the order was {{determined}} through a lottery. The lottery determined the three teams that would obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss record in the previous season. As it is commonplace {{in the event of}} identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random drawing to break the ties on April 18, 2008.|$|E

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that {{the fallout from the}} Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs {{for the first time in}} four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Auburn {{took over}} on offense at its six-yard line—the {{point from which}} Tech <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown {{returned}} to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.|$|E

He was called out attempting to steal another base, though replays demonstrated that the umpire <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> call. The Washington Post and ESPN baseball writer Jayson Stark picked Kinsler as the AL MVP {{for the first half}} of the season.|$|E

Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti opted to start striker Filippo Inzaghi, who <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> 2005 final ahead of Hernán Crespo. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez opted to field a five-man midfield with Jermaine Pennant and Boudewijn Zenden on the wings, while Steven Gerrard was deployed behind lone striker Dirk Kuyt. Liverpool fielded five of the players that started the 2005 final: Xabi Alonso, Jamie Carragher, Steve Finnan, Steven Gerrard and John Arne Riise.|$|E

After {{a meeting with the}} suspicious Ottoman commander, Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of Anatolia on 4 July and turning westwards back towards Sicily.

5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|E

Nibali <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> 2013 Tour as he had focused on the 2013 Giro, which he won. His highest Tour result was third in 2012.

Valverde, who placed eighth in the 2013 Tour and won of the 2009 Vuelta a España, had a number of wins in the 2014 season prior to the Tour, most notably, the Vuelta a Andalucía stage race and the La Flèche Wallonne one-day race.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Fletcher {{left the}} Flames {{to become the}} general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He had been the team's general manager since its {{inception}} in 1972. He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough, and the two quickly completed a ten player mega-trade that saw disgruntled forward Doug Gilmour dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50 goal scorer Gary Leeman and four others. The trade transformed both clubs. The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately, while Leeman scored only eleven goals in a Flames uniform. Despite the blossoming of Theoren Fleury into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in 1992, only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history. It {{was the first time the}} Flames <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs since 1975, when they were still in Atlanta. It was also only the third time out of the playoffs in the franchise's 20-year history.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, the Nordiques {{announced}} that the team had been sold and were relocating from Quebec.

Sakic led the team to its first Stanley Cup championship, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. He was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the Cup, Sakic again proved himself to be an effective team leader. Although his Nordiques <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. He was one goal off from the record for goals in a playoff year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.|$|E

In their next game, Michigan lost to Oregon 39–7, the largest margin of defeat for Michigan at Michigan Stadium since 1968. Following the loss to Oregon, Michigan won their next eight games, leading the team to rank as high as No. 13 in the AP Poll. After Michigan lost their final two games, ending the regular season with an 8–4 record, they dropped off the poll entirely. After Michigan's season-ending loss to Ohio State, Carr announced he would retire as the team's coach after their bowl game. The Wolverines received an invitation to the Capital One Bowl, where they defeated Florida 41–35 to finish their season 9–4. Following their win in the Capital One Bowl, Michigan finished at No. 18 in the final AP Poll.|$|E
