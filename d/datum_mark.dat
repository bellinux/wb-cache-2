50|$|Until {{the modern}} age, plumb-bobs were used on most tall {{structures}} to provide vertical datum lines {{for the building}} measurements. A section of the scaffolding would hold a plumb line, which was centered over a <b>datum</b> <b>mark</b> on the floor. As the building proceeded upward, the plumb line would also be taken higher, still centered on the datum. Many cathedral spires, domes and towers still have brass datum marks inlaid into their floors, which signify {{the center of the}} structure above.|$|E
50|$|A broad arrow bench mark, or <b>datum</b> <b>mark,</b> is chiselled {{into a large}} granite boulder on the Rolling Bay (west) side of Bessie Point, {{located on}} the east side of Trinity Bay. The arrow was cut in early February 1878 during a hydrographic survey of Cairns Harbour by Navigating Lieutenant Edward Richard Connor, Royal Navy (RN). The bench mark, used to {{indicate}} the datum (low water ordinary spring tides) from which the depth of water in the harbour was calculated, is surviving physical evidence of 19th century efforts to survey the Queensland coastline to assist marine navigation, and of the development of Cairns as a port.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1878 Connor {{travelled}} from Brisbane to Cairns on the SS Victoria, arriving {{the evening}} of 31 January. He commenced {{work the next day}} (what vessel he used is not detailed), completing the survey of Cairns Harbour in fine weather by 9 February. He then travelled to survey Port Douglas on the SS Dugong, and returned to Brisbane on the SS Elamang on 22 February. He reported to the Colonial Treasurer, in a letter dated 24 March 1878, that Cairns Harbour, at the extreme south end of Trinity Bay, had an anchorage sheltered from [...] "east by south to west". Three channels existed from the anchorage into the port, the east channel being the most direct, and at least 6 inches deeper than the other two. He noted that the [...] "shoalest" [...] water of 7 feet 6 inches (2.29m) at low water springs was found from one to two miles inside the Fairway buoy. The water then deepened gradually until there was over 30 feet (9.14m) just off the wharves (on {{the west side of the}} mouth of Trinity Inlet). He added that he had left well defined datum marks at both Cairns and Port Douglas. His report included a map of Cairns Harbour, scaled at 4 inches to the nautical mile, which indicated soundings in feet, reduced to low water ordinary spring tides. The <b>datum</b> <b>mark</b> at Bessie Point was indicated on the map as being [...] "12 feet above low water ordinary Sptides", and near the map's title it was stated that the <b>datum</b> <b>mark</b> was [...] "on top of the largest boulder on Bessie Point".|$|E
50|$|On {{the north}} {{wing of the}} {{observatory}} was the height reference point for Prussia, known in German as Normalnull. The marking was formally presented on the 82nd birthday of Kaiser Wilhelm I. on 22 March 1879. This point {{was derived from the}} Amsterdam Ordnance <b>Datum</b> and <b>marked</b> off 37 meters over zero.|$|R
50|$|A {{bench mark}} is a point, at a known {{elevation}} {{above or below}} an adopted <b>datum,</b> <b>marked</b> on a durable object. Bench marks such as an upward-pointing broad arrow symbol (used to denote a government survey from 1852) could be chiselled on a rock - {{as was the case}} at Bessie Point. Alternatively, metal disks could be attached to a rock, or to a concrete block. Often a horizontal line was cut, balanced on the point of the arrow, although only an arrow was cut at Bessie Point. Other examples of broad arrow bench marks cut into rocks exist at Bowen (1887), and at Princess Charlotte Bay in the Flinders group of islands (1899, by HMS Dart). In the case of the Bessie Point 1878 bench mark, which is cut into the largest boulder on the shoreline, the datum was low water ordinary spring tides, calculated as being 12 feet (3.66m) below the broad arrow. All water depths (in feet) on the map of Cairns Harbour made in 1878 thus represented the depth available at low water ordinary spring tides, that water level being 12 feet below the bench mark. The tidal range for spring tides in the bay was 8-10 feet (2.4-3m).|$|R
40|$|Describing the {{physical}} drivers of water bodies plays an integral {{role in the}} marine environment. Lagrangian drifters are used to describe hydrodynamics, where tracking groups (clusters) of drifting floats is performed to determine the dispersion behaviour in the water. Using two types of Lagrangian drifters released in Moreton Bay, Australia, the dispersion behaviour is determined over the duration of a semi-diurnal spring tide cycle. A Self-Locating <b>Datum</b> <b>Marker</b> Buoy (SLDMB) was designed as the first drifter type. The second drifter (Small Drifter) {{was designed to be}} approximately half the size of the SLDMB. SLDMB and Small Drifter clusters were deployed for approximately 16 hrs and 9 - 12 hrs, respectively. Their trajectories and dispersion were influenced by the oscillating tidal current {{during the course of the}} drifter deployment, as well as fluctuating wind speed and direction. The Small Drifters exhibited a higher degree of dispersion than the SLDMBs; illustrating that the different drifter design had a significant impact on their susceptibility to wind induced shear dispersion - a consideration that all drogue based studies need to consider when interpreting results. A MIKE 3 model was used to assist with the investigation at hand using a dispersion coefficient of 0. 2 m 2 /s. The model required further adjustments with respect to tidal forcing and bathymetry resolution in order to enhance dispersion simulation.

40|$|A Cenomanian and Turonian (Late Cretaceous) {{sequence}} {{along the}} Shirakin River, Oyubari area, central Hokkaido, Japan contains seven datum planes of planktonic foraminifera {{that can be}} used to establish international correlations. These <b>datum</b> planes are <b>marked</b> by the first appearance of Praeglobotruncana gibba, Rotalipora greenhornensis, Rotalipora deeckei, Marginotruncana schneegansi and Marginotruncana pseudolinneiana, and the last appearance of Rotalipora deeckei and Rotalipora cushmani. These datum planes can be correlated with international Cretaceous planktonic foraminiferal zones in the interval KS 17 -KS 22. Seventeen planktonic foraminiferal species are described including five new species: Hedbergella kyphoma, Praeglobotruncana compressa, Praeglobotruncana inermis, Praeglobotruncana shirakinensis, and Dicarinella takayanagii...|$|R

40|$|In the east-central Alberta, isopach {{values of}} the McMurray Formation {{measured}} from the overlying Wabiskaw <b>Marker</b> <b>datum</b> show that paleotopographic relief on the sub-Cretaceous Unconformity is express by three paleo-valleys carved into the Grosmont-Wainwright Highlands. The paleo-valleys are named herein as: Grouse, Quail, and Ptarmigan. Mineralogical analysis of McMurray Formation sandstones in the paleo-valleys resolves subtle but recognisable vertical and spatial variations in composition. Feldspar contents decrease and lithic contents increase with stratigraphic depth. Based on petrographic analyses, McMurray Formation sandstones are sourced dominantly from a continental-scale drainage across the craton, with secondary input from uplifted sedimentary strata in the west {{as well as from}} the Canadian Shield in the east. Probable, paleo-tributaries can be superimposed on isopach maps of the McMurray Formation that, when coupled with net-sand maps, appear to bisect the highlands, suggesting that the Grosmont-Wainwright did not prevent some Cordillera sediment from entering the Ptarmigan and Quail paleo-valleys. This Cordillera-derived sediment was delivered via Edmonton Valley, and is calculated to constitute approximately 35 % of the sediment supplied...|$|R
