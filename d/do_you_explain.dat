2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How <b>do</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>explain</b> fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion. You can call me ignorant or intolerant or whatever you want, but I did not make fun of YOUR religion." ...|$|E
