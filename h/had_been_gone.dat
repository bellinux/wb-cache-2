25|$|After more staff turnover, McTavish again {{returned}} as head writer. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, {{which included the}} controversial rape of Bianca. Gone upon McTavish's latest return was Jean Dadario Burke as executive producer, being replaced with Julie Hanan Carruthers. Under McTavish, ratings fluctuated back and forth. To lure back long-time viewers, McTavish created new characters and romances, as well as scripted the return of various characters who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> for long. She introduced star-crossed couple JR Chandler and Babe Carey upon writing JR's return to the series, scripted most of popular pairing Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone's love story, and created fellow popular couple Zach Slater and Kendall Hart. Characters Julia Santos (Sydney Penny) and Janet Dillon (Kate Collins, who was originally slated to return for a brief stint) were eventually brought back.|$|E

Warren sent three regiments that Bartlett had detached to guard artillery and wagons down the Boydton Plank Road under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson and reported this to Meade. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been broken down by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan. Meade told Warren to have his entire force ready to move. By 9:17p.m., Warren was ordered {{to withdraw from the}} line and send a division to Sheridan at once.|$|E

2500|$|By {{then the}} Grants <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> two years, and were homesick. [...] They crossed the Pacific {{and landed in}} San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds. [...] After a visit to Yellowstone National Park, they {{returned}} at last to Philadelphia on December 16, 1879. [...] The two-and-a-half-year voyage around the world had captured popular imagination, and Republicans—especially those of the new Stalwart faction, who had excluded from the Hayes administration—saw Grant in a new light.

[...] DiMedio's lawyer criticized the report for faulting DiMedio's role in the district's use of web cameras. [...] He criticized the cover-page description of the investigators' work as an [...] "independent" [...] probe, saying: [...] "It was not an independent investigation. What flows from that [...] is a clear attempt to insulate and protect the current [...] board {{at the expense of the}} IT [...] department and employees like Ginny … to throw her under the bus." [...] He said DiMedio never hid the software's tracking features from administrators or board members. [...] He also noted that DiMedio <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> for months when the assistant principal confronted Robbins with the photo taken by his laptop webcam in his [...] home.|$|E
