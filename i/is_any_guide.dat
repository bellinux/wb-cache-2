A Daiwa executive estimates “between five and 10” companies to list during the YSE’s first year of operation in 2015, with 10 to 20 listed by the end of 2017.

The ships would have been very small by modern standards, too shallow in draught and sailing too low in the water to be able to withstand the heavy waves and winds of the open Atlantic, and suited for use only in the relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf.

Complaints of unfairness are ubiquitous, and the obsession of children for fairness is a notorious feature of family life. Yet the concept of fairness receives little attention from moral philosophers. This neglect may seem deserved for two reasons. First, it may be said that fairness is concerned only with procedures and with interpersonal comparisons, and that neither of these matters raises any deep philosophical issues. Thus there may seem no need to analyze the concept of fairness. Second, it may be said that fairness is a part of justice, and hence that issues of fairness are addressed, if only implicitly, by accounts of justice. Again, then, discussion of fairness is unnecessary...|$|R

50|$|According {{to his own}} book, he {{was imprisoned}} for years, thought to be between 1337 and 1350, as {{punishment}} for some of his deeds (if the poem <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>guide,</b> they were quite inconsistent with his position as priest). However, the poem has long been considered as pseudo-autobiography and the verses that mention his imprisonment appear {{at the end of}} the book and are generally thought to have been added after the fact. One of his poems states that he was imprisoned on the order of Gil Albornoz, An Archbishop of Toledo. It is not known whether he was sentenced for his irregularities of conduct, or on account of his satirical reflections on his ecclesiastical superiors. Nor is it possible to fix the precise date of his imprisonment. Albornoz nominally occupied the see of Toledo from 1337 to 1368, but he fell into disgrace in 1351 and fled to Avignon. A consideration of these circumstances points to the probable conclusion that Ruiz was in prison from 1337 to 1350, but this is conjecture. What seems established is that he finished the Libro de buen amor in 1343. Indeed, almost nothing is known about the author(s) of the poem or if he was even named Juan Ruiz. One scholarly study found hundreds of clerics in mid-fourteenth-century Castile named Juan Ruiz. The name appears to be the equivalent of John Smith and may have been chosen to represent everyman.|$|E

40|$|Baryonic R-parity {{violation}} {{could explain}} why low-scale supersymmetry {{has not yet been}} discovered at colliders: sparticles would be hidden in the intense hadronic activity. However, if the known flavor structures <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>guide,</b> the largest baryon number violating couplings are those involving the top/stop, so a copious production of same-sign top-quark pairs is in principle possible. Such a signal, with its low irreducible background and efficient identification through same-sign dileptons, provides us with tell-tale signs of baryon number violating supersymmetry. Interestingly, this statement is mostly independent of the details of the supersymmetric mass spectrum. So, in this paper, after analyzing the sparticle decay chains and lifetimes, we formulate a simplified benchmark strategy that covers most supersymmetric scenarios. We then use this information to interpret the same-sign dilepton searches of CMS, draw approximate bounds on the gluino and squark masses, and extrapolate the reach of the future 14 TeV runs.
