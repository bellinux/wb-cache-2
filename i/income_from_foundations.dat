The Trust then became the largest charity in the UK, providing funding for focus areas such as biomedical science, Technology transfer, Public engagement and Bioethics.

50|$|Following the Education Act of 1902, {{the school}} began {{to receive a}} grant from the British Government. Under the Education Act of 1944, {{secondary}} schools in England were reorganised in three categories: grammar schools, technical schools, and secondary modern schools. The school was naturally classed as a grammar school under this scheme, and had voluntary aided status: in other words the <b>income</b> <b>from</b> the <b>Foundation</b> was supplemented by {{a grant from the}} Local Education Authority. From now on, admission to the school was solely via the eleven-plus examination, and education was free (previously there had been fees of five guineas a year). Classes were held six days a week, with no lessons on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. Saturday morning school was abolished in 1967.|$|R

This tax-free Foundation is working to raise $1,000,000 to fund the Foundation's annual Ray Downey Courage and Valor Award in perpetuity. PennWell contributed an initial endowment of $25,000 and will match contributor donations at a rate of one dollar for every nine dollars contributed, up to $100,000. The <b>income</b> <b>from</b> the <b>Foundation</b> will be awarded annually to a firefighter, either posthumously or to a surviving family member for exemplary courage and valor in a rescue operation during the preceding year. The book, Fallen Heroes, has been published by PennWell to support the Courage and Valor Foundation.|$|R
5|$|Demand persisted for {{a similar}} school in Tonbridge; in July 1888, William J. D. Bryant, {{previously}} an assistant master at Tonbridge School, was named headmaster of Sir Andrew Judd's Commercial School, which opened on 17September at Stafford House in East Street, Tonbridge. The funds were provided by a loan of £13,000 repaid over the next 20years with <b>income</b> <b>from</b> the Judd <b>Foundation</b> (of which The Skinners' Company were trustees), which rapidly increased when the leases on the Sandhills Estate in London were renewed in 1906. The school also benefited from at least £500 per year <b>from</b> the Judd <b>Foundation,</b> after funding for Tonbridge School was reduced. Although established on a tentative basis, the school's early success led to its move to a larger, purpose-built site in south Tonbridge in 1896.|$|R

Bellingrath Gardens and Home is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of the garden and grand estate home through the highest quality horticultural standards of display and by welcoming visitors in the same spirit that the Bellingraths welcomed the community to their private estate.|$|R
