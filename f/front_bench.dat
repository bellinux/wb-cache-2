5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative <b>front</b> <b>bench.</b> Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the <b>front</b> <b>bench,</b> making room {{for members of the}} next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E
25|$|In November 1984 Heffer {{did not win}} {{re-election}} to the Shadow Cabinet {{and left}} the Labour <b>front</b> <b>bench.</b> He said that he took a principled stance not to take any <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> post unless elected to it.|$|E

25|$|In July 2004, however, Latham {{arranged}} for Beazley {{to return to}} the Labor <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> as Shadow Defence Minister. This followed controversy over Latham's policy of withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq by the end of 2004. Beazley's return to the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> was generally seen as a move by Latham to reassure Australian public opinion that a Labor government would not put the U.S.-Australian alliance at risk.|$|E
25|$|Farron {{resigned}} from the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> of the Liberal Democrats on 5 March 2008 in protest at the party's abstention from a parliamentary vote on a proposed Conservative referendum on Britain's accession to the Lisbon Treaty. However he later returned to the party's <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> as spokesperson for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He {{is a member of}} the Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Despite being aged nearly 70, Creech Jones was reappointed to the {{opposition}} <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> after the 1959 general election. In 1961 he signed a letter expressing disquiet at a British application to join the European Communities, and urging a Commonwealth conference to discuss the implications before formally applying. He left the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> in 1963; although hoping to continue in Parliament, he was forced by ill health to announce his retirement in August 1964.|$|E

50|$|In many jurisdictions, {{third parties}} (which are neither {{participant}} in the government nor in the official opposition) may also form their own parliamentary <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> of spokespersons; however, parliamentary standing orders {{on the right of}} parties to speak often dictate that it can only be granted to a party or group if a minimum number of members can be recorded by the party. In Ireland, for example, technical groups are often formed by third parties and independent TDs in the Dáil Éireann in order to increase the members' right to speak against larger parties which can afford the right to speak as <b>Front</b> <b>Benches</b> in Government or Opposition.|$|R

In opposition, and under new Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern, McCreevy {{was named to}} the <b>Front</b> <b>Bench</b> as Spokesman for Finance. In this role he was viewed as actively pro-enterprise, anti-spending and a key advocate for tax cuts.|$|E
5000|$|The Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, George Pell, {{supported}} change, but noted [...] "Without {{support from}} most of the <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> of both sides of the parliament, it would be wasteful to go to a referendum."

50|$|The {{original}} House of Commons chamber {{was slightly}} redesigned in the 1970s {{with the addition}} of a block of curved benches facing the Speaker's chair, along with new curved <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> for some of the remainder of the furnishings, to reduce the adversarial nature of the chamber and provide a symbolic middle ground for middle ground parties.|$|R
2500|$|As is {{the custom}} with Westminster parliaments, {{members of the}} {{governing}} party sit to the Speaker's right, and the Opposition sits to the Speaker's left. Independents and minor parties sit on the cross-benches. The long <b>benches</b> (the <b>front</b> <b>benches)</b> closest to the despatch boxes are reserved for the Cabinet on the government's side and the [...] "Shadow Cabinet" [...] on the Opposition's side.|$|R
25|$|He {{had a tough}} {{debut on}} the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> of the House of Commons on 3 April 1950 when he made a {{statement}} about Commonwealth sugar negotiations. Many Members of Parliament thought that the West Indies had been treated discourteously and the Leader of the House of Commons Herbert Morrison {{had to come to}} the aid of the junior Food Minister.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the only}} member of the Conservative <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> who consistently, openly and {{publicly}} opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

25|$|Muldoon {{continued}} to undermine McLay until 1986, when McLay was ousted in turn {{by his own}} deputy (and Muldoon's preferred candidate), Jim Bolger, who had served as Minister of Labour for {{the latter half of}} Muldoon's term as Prime Minister. Bolger returned Muldoon to the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> as spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, pitting him directly against Prime Minister David Lange.|$|E
50|$|While the {{opposing}} Members of Parliament may well espouse mutually opposed left-wing and right-wing views, the official division lies not between {{left and right}} but between Government and Opposition, with everyone aiming {{to sit on the}} Government side, and individuals often hoping to move in their careers from the back <b>benches</b> to the <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> - occupied by the leadership of each faction.|$|R
50|$|Out of {{government}} Deasy was {{included on the}} <b>Front</b> <b>Benches</b> of Alan Dukes and John Bruton as a Spokesperson for Tourism and Transport, Spokesperson for Agriculture and Spokesperson for the Marine, until {{his return to the}} backbenches in 1993.

5000|$|Pell was {{appointed}} a {{delegate to the}} Australian Constitutional Convention 1998 which considered the issue of Australia becoming a republic.

[...] Towards the end of proceedings, he called on conservatives to support change.|$|R
25|$|It is {{inferred}} from Fine Gael's relationship to European counterparts via {{membership of the}} European People's Party that FG belongs on the centre-right. The party conforms generally with European political parties that identify themselves as being Christian democratic. Some younger parliamentarians are identified with the centre-right. The Irish Times supplement described <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> member Leo Varadkar TD as having explicitly centre-right views.|$|E
25|$|Creech Jones' {{opportunity}} {{to return to}} Parliament came in 1954 when Arthur Greenwood, Labour MP for Wakefield, died. He was selected in Greenwood's place, and kept the seat in the by-election. He returned to the Labour <b>front</b> <b>bench,</b> but also retained his involvement in outside work. He {{was appointed to the}} governing body of Queen Elizabeth House, a Colonial Office-sponsored institution at Oxford University, in March 1955.|$|E
25|$|Dewar {{gained a}} {{parliamentary}} platform {{as chairman of}} the Scottish Affairs Select Committee. After a year honing his inquisitorial skills, he joined the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> in November 1980 as a Scottish affairs spokesman when Michael Foot became party leader. In 1981, as the Labour Party divided itself further due to internal disagreement, Dewar was almost deselected in his constituency by hard left activists, but he successfully defended himself against this threat.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 the National Party Parliamentary leader Don Brash {{promoted}} Key to the Opposition <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> {{and appointed}} him the party spokesman for finance.

5000|$|On 14 September 2015, Jones {{resigned}} from the <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> of Labour, following the election of Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership contest.

He had already made a decision the previous week that he would not serve under Corbyn. Jones is critical of Corbyn's policies on welfare, the economy and immigration.|$|R
60|$|And so on. You couldn't {{make out}} what the preacher said any more, {{on account of the}} {{shouting}} and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the <b>front</b> <b>benches</b> in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.|$|R
