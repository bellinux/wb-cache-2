To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Wally Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was a sore arm from the previous season, to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm.|$|E

As Screams box-office takings grew, a lawsuit would be filed against Dimension Films by Sony Pictures who claimed that the title Scream was too similar to that of Sony's own film Screamers (1995).

[...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer.

Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: [...] "It's <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although {{much has been made}} of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress â€“ I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] music video. He concluded by stating that: [...] "Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout."

The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as [...] "very slick and promotional".

A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: [...] "There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, SimTower sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all." [...] Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound.

Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two chickens that have similar abilities.

Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue.|$|E
2500|$|To {{shape the}} science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired {{scientific}} advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, was hired to advise {{the cast and crew}} after the director had seen Cox on the science TV series Horizon. Cox gave regular lectures to the film's cast members about solar physics, and also advised the filmmakers to scale down the nuclear device in the film from the mass of the Moon to the size of Manhattan. In the film's backstory, a Q-ball enters and is caught in the Earth's Sun, and begins to eat it away. According to Cox, the Sun would not be dense enough in real life to stop a Q-ball, but filmmakers took creative licence in writing the backstory. Cox noted in the DVD commentary that several inaccuracies were permitted to allow for plot. He also dismissed criticisms of the film by scientists: [...] "Sunshine is not a documentary. It's trying to just, in an hour and forty minutes, get across a feeling of what it's like â€“ not only to be a scientist, because obviously there's much more in it than that.
