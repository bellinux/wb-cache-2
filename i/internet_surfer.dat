However, regardless of the presence or absence of purchase tasks, aesthetic formality significantly influences perceived online service quality, and aesthetic appeal significantly influences satisfaction.

The changing patterns of <b>Internet</b> <b>surfer</b> access to e-commerce sites pose challenges for the Internet marketing teams of online companies.

40|$|The phenomenal {{growth of}} social media has {{resulted}} in transformation {{in the way we}} communicate and interact, described by Deighton and Kornfeld (2007) as a “digital interactive transformation in marketing”. According to them, blogs have {{become a part of the}} “non-marketing” communication paths, or new traffic lanes, not built for the convenience of marketers but for consumers. However, despite the profound implication of blogs for marketing communications, it is surprising that there exist very little theoretical and empirical studies, if any, on this emerging social phenomenon (Mutum 2009). Bloggers are early adopters of technology; are active, multi-tasking <b>Internet</b> <b>surfers,</b> they trust other bloggers and are more open-minded than the average online consumer does (Forrester 2006) and it is very likely that the perceived interactivity of the blogs is an important driver for blog usage. However, despite the fact that various authors acknowledge the importance of the interactivity construct, there is no consistent definition and conceptualization of the construct (Heeter 2000; Jee and Lee 2002). Moreover, the existing definitions are focused on the consumers’ interaction with a website and are not really applicable in the case of blogs where blog users are talking to the blogger and with other blog users as well. Perceived interactivity is more than the human-machine and human-message interactions. There is a need to take the human-human interactions into account as well.

Consumption in this era has become selective.Indeed, through research online, consumers are starting to make more and more informed decisions. For this reason, standing out from the contemporary advertising Pangea and building brand loyalty has become more challenging and getting in touch with consumers in a relevant way is essential. The analysis of how consumers use media is crucial in relation to inbound marketing.Users are surfing the Internet via multiple devices more than ever preferring mobile ones to the traditional computer or laptop. In addition the increasingly fast daily routine requires from the part of consumers to surf on internet while doing a number of other things.
