The essential features of the Pidgeon machine are, one, the combination of the rotating support and the fixed support for inducing charge, and, two, the <b>improved</b> <b>insulation</b> of all parts of the machine (but more especially of the generator's carriers).

50|$|After the war, Hawkins {{began work}} on an {{important}} project, a new and <b>improved</b> <b>insulation</b> for telephone cables.

50|$|NASA's Lewis Research Center (now the Glenn Research Center) {{was given}} the task of {{integrating}} Titan with Centaur, which required a number of modifications to accommodate the more powerful booster. The most obvious change was enclosing Centaur in a large shroud that protected the stage and the payload during ascent. This enabled the use of <b>improved</b> <b>insulation</b> on Centaur, which increased coast time in orbit from 30 minutes when launched on Atlas to over 5 hours on the Titan IIIE. Since Centaur was wider than the Titan's core stage, a tapering interface was required. This interface had to be insulated to prevent boiloff of Centaur's cryogenic propellants, since Titan used hypergolic propellants stored at ambient temperature, while Atlas used liquid oxygen. The Centaur stage also contained the guidance computer for the entire launch vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In {{many high}} voltage {{applications}} corona is an unwanted side effect. Corona discharge from high voltage {{electric power transmission}} lines constitutes an economically significant waste of energy for utilities. In high voltage equipment like televisions, radio transmitters, X-ray machines and particle accelerators the current leakage caused by coronas can constitute an unwanted load on the circuit. In air, coronas generate gases such as ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO), and in turn nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and thus nitric acid (HNO3) if water vapor is present. These gases are corrosive and can degrade and embrittle nearby materials, and are also toxic to people. Corona discharges can often be suppressed by <b>improved</b> <b>insulation,</b> corona rings, and making high voltage electrodes in smooth rounded shapes. However, controlled corona discharges are used {{in a variety of}} processes such as air filtration, photocopiers and ozone generators.|$|E
50|$|The Richards House was {{nominally}} {{designed by}} Warren, Smith & Biscoe of Boston, but Richards made specific demands in the design. It is a two story structure, using steel beams as its principal supports, one of Richards' requests. The ground floor exterior walls consist of five courses of brick, with seaweed sandwiched between the courses {{in a bid}} to provide <b>improved</b> <b>insulation</b> to the structure. The second floor of the house is clad in shingles. The main facade is three bays wide, with a symmetrical appearance. The main entry is accessed by a walk lined with brick walls the join to the house walls. The entry, recessed into the brick wall, is flanked by sidelight windows. The outside of the recess is framed by pilasters and topped by an entablature and a segmented-arch pediment. Above the entrance is a Palladian window, which rises into an eyebrow gable on the modillioned roofline. The first-floor bays flanking the entry are both projecting polygonal bays with four sash windows, and there are paired sash windows above them on the second floor. Two decoratively corbelled chimneys pierce the roof. The house interior follows a typical central-hall plan.|$|E

50|$|Concrete blocks may be {{produced}} with hollow centers (cores) to reduce weight or <b>improve</b> <b>insulation.</b> The use of blockwork allows structures {{to be built}} in the traditional masonry style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks.

In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually 440 x 215 x 100 mm excluding mortar joints. In New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually 390 x 190 x 190 mm excluding mortar joints.|$|R
