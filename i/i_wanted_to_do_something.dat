Not that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour." ...|$|E
500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Between series one and two, Wood {{said she}} thought {{it was a mistake to}} do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy. [...] "You pour everything you've got into one sketch and you don't ever want to write another - only you realise there are fifty-nine more to go before you've got enough for a series, it's torment".|$|E
500|$|Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he'd done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "We're doing some squeaky clean, sweet, optimistic, non-cynical piece, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that sorta tapped into the different side of my personality." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. He said, [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards." [...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album Control (1986), Jackson was motivated {{to take a}} larger role in her album's creative process. According to Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits (2002), A Records requested she record an album similar to Control. It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album entitled Scandal, which would have centered around her personal and family life. However, Jam later denied the claim that Scandal was ever suggested, although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a [...] "Control II." [...] Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to Control, stating [...] "that's what I didn't want to do. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about." [...] She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album's theme to social consciousness, but remained resolute in her commitment to the concept. Jam stated that her inspiration for the album's theme came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources. In particular, her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "State of the World".|$|E

500|$|The In Rainbows artwork was {{designed}} by Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork. Donwood experimented with photographic etching, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by NASA space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying [...] "it's a sensual record and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more organic." [...] Describing the album cover, Donwood said: [...] "It's very colourful—I've finally embraced colour! It's a rainbow but it is very toxic, it's more like the sort of one you'd see in a puddle." [...] The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release. The [...] "discbox" [...] release of the album includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E

500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, this is our fifth record, and I thought it would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> special." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> [...] that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a way they could dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. The record label reckoned that they would boost album sales with a radio-only promotion.|$|E
