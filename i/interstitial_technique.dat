40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of tissue temperature {{is necessary for}} effective delivery of clinical hyperthermia {{in the treatment of}} malignant tumours. This report compares computer-predicted versus measured intratumoral temperatures in 11 human subjects with intracranial tumours, treated with a conceptually simple 2 ̆ 7 conductive 2 ̆ 7 interstitial hyperthermia system. Interstitial hyperthermia was achieved by the use of parallel arrays of implanted, electrically heated catheters. The tissue was warmed by thermal conduction and blood convection. Simulation of intratumoral temperatures was achieved by solving a modified bioheat transfer equation on a digital computer using a finite difference method. Comparison of intratumoral temperatures from simulations and measured values differed by about ± 0. 75 oC. Further analysis of computed temperature distributions between catheters revealed a rapidly computable relationship between the local minimum tumour temperature and nearby catheter power and temperature that accounts for effects of varying blood flow. These findings suggest that 2 ̆ 7 on-line 2 ̆ 7 prediction and control of local minimum tumour temperatures are feasible with the conductive <b>interstitial</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundA {{standard}} linear-quadratic (LQ) {{model is}} now routinely used for clinical data analysis and {{the prediction of}} the clinical effect of radiotherapy. The typical α/β values suggested in the literature range from 10 to 20 Gy for most tumours and early responding normal tissues, and from 2 to 5 Gy for late responding tissues. AimThe estimation of α/β ratio values for planoepithelial lower lip cancer. Materials/MethodsThe clinical material {{is based on the}} records of 25 patients undergoing radical treatment with interstitial brachytherapy: 19 patients were administered brachytherapy exclusively and 6 patients were treated postoperatively. The following stage arrangement was applied: T 1 in 15 pts, T 2 in 9 pts, N 0 in 24 pts and N 1 only in one T 2 patient. Radiotherapy was based on HDR brachytherapy using the <b>interstitial</b> <b>technique.</b> Patients with positive margins after surgery were qualified for postoperative brachytherapy. The dose was either specified at the reference 80 % isodose according to the Paris System or points calculated 3 - 5 mm from the macroscopic tumour. The average total dose was 38. 3 Gy, the number of fractions being 7 and the fraction dose 5. 3 Gy. The overall treatment time was 12 days. The average follow-up period was 30 months. A standard probit regression in conjunction with a linear-quadratic model was used. ResultsThe estimated value of the α/β ratio for lip cancer was 12 Gy (± 3. 72 * 10 − 10 95 % CI). ConclusionsThe estimated α/β ratio is consistent with α/β ratios published for squamous cell head and neck cancers...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Brachytherapy is an {{important}} therapeutic strategy {{for the treatment of}} locally advanced gynaecologic (GYN) cancers despite evolution of different newer radiotherapy techniques like high-dose-rate and image-guided BT. Despite being used in the management of advanced gynaecological cancer, currently there is a scarcity of studies and data on interstitial BT in Indian context. This is a retrospective analysis on 71 patients with locally advanced gynaecological malignancies treated in the period of 2010 to 2016 to assess the local tumour control, survival, and complications with the template (Syed-Neblett) guided <b>interstitial</b> <b>technique.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients with a median age of 51 years treated from July 2010 to May 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. This study included previously unirradiated 71 patients with advance stage of gynaecological malignancies, not suitable for intracavitary brachytherapy due to distorted anatomy or extensive disease stage. Histologically all patients had squamous cell carcinoma (cervix= 56, vault= 9, vagina= 6) and treated by whole pelvis external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) up to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. These patients were further treated by high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy using SyedNeblett dedicated vaginal plastic template. During treatment all these patients were re-optimised and a dose of 15 - 21 Gy was delivered in 3 fractions with a minimum gap of 6 hours between fractions using Varisource iX HDR unit. RESULTS Out of 71 patients 5 were lost to followup during study period and they were excluded from the final analysis. The average followup duration ranged between 6 - 71 months and median followup was 20 months. This study included parameters like local disease control, acute/late complications and distant metastasis. Out of 66 patients, local disease control was seen in 54 (81. 81...|$|E

40|$|High-dose-rate {{brachytherapy}} (HDR-BT) is an <b>interstitial</b> <b>technique</b> for {{the treatment}} of intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancer that involves placement of a radiation source directly inside the prostate using needles. Dose-escalated whole-gland treatments have led to improvements in survival, and tumour-targeted treatments may offer future improvements in therapeutic ratio. The efficacy of tumour-targeted HDR-BT depends on imaging tools to enable accurate dose delivery to prostate sub-volumes. This thesis is focused on implementing ultrasound tools to improve HDR-BT needle localization accuracy and efficiency, and evaluating dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for tumour localization. First, we implemented a device enabling sagittally-reconstructed 3 D (SR 3 D) ultrasound, which provides sub-millimeter resolution in the needle insertion direction. We acquired SR 3 D and routine clinical images in a cohort of 12 consecutive eligible HDR-BT patients, with a total of 194 needles. The SR 3 D technique provided needle insertion depth errors within 5 mm for 93 % of needles versus 76 % for the clinical imaging technique, leading to increased precision in dose delivered to the prostate. Second, we implemented an algorithm to automatically segment multiple HDR-BT needles in a SR 3 D image. The algorithm was applied to the SR 3 D images from the first patient cohort, demonstrating mean execution times of 11. 0 s per patient and successfully segmenting 82 % of needles within 3 mm. Third, we augmented SR 3 D imaging with live- 2 D sagittal ultrasound for needle tip localization. This combined technique was applied to another cohort of 10 HDR-BT patients, reducing insertion depth errors compared to routine imaging from a range of [- 8. 1 mm, 7. 7 mm] to [- 6. 2 mm, 5. 9 mm]. Finally, we acquired DCE-MRI in 16 patients scheduled to undergo prostatectomy, using either high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution imaging, and compared the images to whole-mount histology. The high spatial resolution images demonstrated improved high-grade cancer classification compared to the high temporal resolution images, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 79 and 0. 70, respectively. In conclusion, we have translated and evaluated specialized imaging tools for HDR-BT which are ready to be tested in a clinical trial investigating tumour-targeted treatment...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There is no {{consensus}} for parametrial boost technic while both transvaginal and transperineal approaches are discussed. A prototype was developed consisting of a perineal template, allowing transperineal needle insertion. This study analyzed acute toxicity of concomitant cervical and transperineal parametrial high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRB) boost for locally advanced cervical cancer. Material and methods: From 01. 2011 to 12. 2014, 33 patients (pts) presenting a locally advanced cervical cancer with parametrial invasion were treated. After the first course of external beam radiation therapy with cisplatinum, HDRB was performed combining endocavitary and <b>interstitial</b> <b>technique</b> for cervical and parametrial disease. Post-operative delineation (CTV, bladder, rectum, sigmoid) and planification were based on CT-scan/MRI. HDRB was delivered in 3 - 5 fractions over 2 - 3 consecutive days. Acute toxicities occurring within 6 months after HDRB were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Median age was 56. 4 years (27 - 79). Clinical stages were: T 2 b = 23 pts (69. 7 %), T 3 a = 1 pt (3 %), T 3 b = 6 pts (18. 2 %), and T 4 a = 3 pts (9. 1 %). Median HDRB prescribed dose was 21 Gy (21 - 27). Median CTVCT (16 pts) and HR-CTV MRI (17 pts) were 52. 6 cc (28. 5 - 74. 3), 31. 9 cc (17. 1 - 58), respectively. Median EQD 2 αβ 10 for D 90 CTV and D 90 HR-CTV were 82. 9 Gy (78. 2 - 96. 5), 84. 8 Gy (80. 6 - 91. 4), respectively. Median EQD 2 αβ 3 (CT/MRI) for D 2 cc bladder, rectum and sigmoid were 75. 5 Gy (66. 6 - 90. 9), 64. 4 Gy (51. 9 - 77. 4), and 60. 4 Gy (50. 9 - 81. 1), respectively. Median follow-up was 14 months (ranged 6 - 51). Among the 24 pts with MFU = 24 months, 2 -year LRFS rate, RRFS, and OS were 86. 8 %, 88. 8 %, and 94. 1 %, respectively. The rates of acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 36 % (G 1 dysuria = 8 pts, G 2 infection = 2 pt, G 3 infection = 2 pts), and 27 % (G 1 diarrhea = 9 pts), respectively. One patient presented vaginal bleeding {{at the time of}} applicator withdrawal (G 3 -blood transfusion); no bleeding was observed due to the parametrial implant. Conclusions : Concomitant cervical and transperineal parametrial HDRB boost for locally advanced cervical cancer appears feasible and safe with no specific acute toxicity compare to cervical HDRB alone.

40|$|With {{evolution}} of different newer radiotherapy techniques, still {{the role of}} brachytherapy in different gynecological malignancies has not sublimed.

Characteristic spectro-angular snapshots of the liquid phantom alone and with the localized inclusions were obtained. For liquid phantoms without inclusions, the snapshots demonstrate wavelength dependent light distribution inside the turbid medium. For liquid phantoms with gold inclusions, the approach allows to isolate the spectroscopic signatures of the inclusions from the background, identify locations of the inclusions in the angular domain and show how a presence of water in the inclusion affects spectral identification and angular localization of the target. For liquid phantoms with water-based inclusions, an ability of the inclusion to enhance photon density above reference values and angular dependent signatures were demonstrated. The technique is seen as a potential tool in prostate treatment and diagnostics with gold nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} of methane (CH 4) from anaerobic sediments through the leaves, stems, and flowers of aquatic plants {{and into the}} atmosphere was found to provide a significant pathway for the emission of CH 4 from the aquatic substrates of flooded wetlands.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo analyse {{the overall}} {{clinical}} outcome and benefits by applying protocol based image guided adaptive brachytherapy combined with 3 D conformal {{external beam radiotherapy}} (EBRT) ±chemotherapy (ChT). MethodsTreatment schedule was EBRT with 45 – 50. 4 Gy±concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy plus 4 × 7 Gy High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Patients were treated in the “protocol period” (2001 – 2008) with the prospective application of the High Risk CTV concept (D 90) and dose volume constraints for organs at risk including biological modelling. Dose volume adaptation was performed {{with the aim of}} dose escalation in large tumours (prescribed D 90 > 85 Gy), often with inserting additional interstitial needles. Dose volume constraints (D 2 cc) were 70 – 75 Gy for rectum and sigmoid and 90 Gy for bladder. Late morbidity was prospectively scored, using LENT/SOMA Score. Disease outcome and treatment related late morbidity were evaluated and compared using actuarial analysis. FindingsOne hundred and fifty-six consecutive patients (median age 58 years) with cervix cancer FIGO stages IB–IVA were treated with definitive radiotherapy in curative intent. Histology was squamous cell cancer in 134 patients (86 %), tumour size was > 5 cm in 103 patients (66 %), lymph node involvement in 75 patients (48 %). Median follow-up was 42 months for all patients. <b>Interstitial</b> <b>techniques</b> were used in addition to intracavitary brachytherapy in 69 / 156 (44 %) patients. Total prescribed mean dose (D 90) was 93 ± 13 Gy, D 2 cc 86 ± 17 Gy for bladder, 65 ± 9 Gy for rectum and 64 ± 9 Gy for sigmoid. Complete remission was achieved in 151 / 156 patients (97 %). Overall local control at 3 years was 95 %; 98 % for tumours 2 – 5 cm, and 92 % for tumours > 5 cm (p= 0. 04), 100 % for IB, 96 % for IIB, 86 % for IIIB. Cancer specific survival at 3 years was overall 74 %, 83 % for tumours 2 – 5 cm, 70 % for tumours > 5 cm, 83 % for IB, 84 % for IIB, 52 % for IIIB. Overall survival at 3 years was in total 68 %, 72 % for tumours 2 – 5 cm, 65 % for tumours > 5 cm, 74 % for IB, 78 % for IIB, 45 % for IIIB. In regard to late morbidity in total 188 grade 1 + 2 and 11 grade 3 + 4 late events were observed in 143 patients. G 1 + 2 /G 3 + 4 events for bladder were n= 32 / 3, for rectum n= 14 / 5, for bowel (including sigmoid) n= 3 / 0, for vagina n= 128 / 2, respectively. Interpretation 3 D conformal radiotherapy±chemotherapy plus image (MRI) guided adaptive intracavitary brachytherapy including needle insertion in advanced disease results in local control rates of 95 – 100 % at 3 years in limited/favourable (IB/IIB) and 85 – 90 % in large/poor response (IIB/III/IV) cervix cancer patients associated with a moderate rate of treatment related morbidity. Compared to the historical Vienna series there is relative reduction in pelvic recurrence by 65 – 70 % and reduction in major morbidity.

Guided by transrectal ultrasonography, 12 catheters (range 7 - 16) {{were placed in the}} prostate through a template. Two electrodes per probe were inserted. Thermometry (average 100 sensors) was performed from within the probes for online temperature control. Additional thermometry was done in the prostate, rectum, urethra, and bladder. Reconstruction was done by sonography. Prostate perfusion was estimated from the thermal decay at the end of treatment. The full three-dimensional temperature distribution was calculated. No toxicities greater than Grade 2 were recorded. A learning curve for implantation, position verification, reconstruction, and temperature simulation was experienced. Perfusion was 47 mL/ 100 g/min (range 30 - 65). The average measured temperature was T(90) (90 % of the prostate reached a temperature of at least:) 39. 9 degrees C and T(50) 44. 1 degrees C. The average calculated temperatures were lower: T(90), 39. 4 degrees C and T(50), 41. 8 degrees C, because the entire prostate was taken into account.

30|$|In our case, we {{used the}} endoloop {{technique}} as described by Moon et al. [16] {{in the treatment of}} <b>interstitial</b> pregnancies. This <b>technique</b> provided us with an excellent tourniquet effect and resulted in effective hemostasis. Cornual closure was ended simultaneously with the removal of the conceptus by progressive tightening of the applied endoloop. This technique offered bleeding control during incision of the cornual area and both removal of the conceptus and effective closure of the uterine wall. This technique, however, can only be used in those cases where the cornual pregnancy is slightly elevated or pedunculated from the underlying myometrium. In those cases where the cornua is uniformly swollen and no distinction can be made between the cornual pregnancy site and the normal myometrium, a different technique should be used. A disadvantage of these conservative surgical techniques is that the cornual area might become weak, with the subsequent risk of uterine rupture during the ongoing pregnancy and labour. Therefore, in this case, we judged it safer to plan a primary caesarian section.|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityTreatment planning in brachytherapy involves a solution {{in the form of}} an acceptable seed and needle configuration fulfilling the treatment planning goals. The target has to be irradiated with uniform prescribed dose with minimal exposure to the adjacent or embedded organs at risk. The number of potential seed positions to choose from is large. More than one seed configuration can fulfill the treatment planning aims. Treatment planning algorithms based on forward dose calculations are iterative in nature as a seed configuration is evaluated against set criteria or constraints and accepted only when they are met. Methods based on adjoint transport have been proved to generate acceptable treatment planning solutions both in brachytherapy treatment planning and external beam treatment planning. The brachytherapy treatment planning device using adjoint methodology is a Greedy Heuristic (GH) algorithm that generates a solution noniteratively. The adjoint sensitivity fields operate as guidance tool for selecting seed positions with the maximum benefit towards depositing dose in the target and sparing the sensitive structure. The GH algorithm thus selects positions one after another and constructs a treatment plan that is acceptable.

40|$|Abstract. The {{rationale}} {{and results}} for interstitial therapies via interventional MRI {{in the treatment}} of tumors in various regions are presented. Different <b>interstitial</b> treatment <b>techniques</b> are presented based on varying technologies both for tumor ablation and treatment monitoring. Data are presented based on 335 patients, 29 ± 84 years of age (mean age 59 years, 196 men and 139 women) with a total of 932 liver tumors, 16 head and neck tumors and 14 abdominal recurrent pelvic and lymphatic tumors. All lesions had been treated with MR-guided laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) via 2516 laser applications and 1856 cannulations. Data in the literature are extremely varying depending on author experience, treatment technique, and the included patient material. In our patient material we were able to achieve a local tumor control of 96. 7 % {{depending on the size of}} the tumorous lesion, the topographical relationship, and the applied laser parameters. The overall cumulative survival rate of patients with liver metastases was 45. 74 months (median 40. 97 months, 95 % confidence interval 31. 42 ± 50. 52). The cumulative survival rate of the patient group with hepatic metastases of colorectal carcinoma was 42. 71 months (median 39. 33 months, 95 % confidence interval 33. 26 ± 45. 37). In patients with head and neck tumors a relevant reduction in clinically relevant symptoms such as pain, swallowing disorders, or nervous compression was achieved in 11 of 15 patients treated with LITT. In 14 soft tissue tumors, such as pelvic tumor recurrence and lymph node metastases, a local tumor control was obtained in 68 % of lesions.

Using the directly measured temperature in the tissue around the interstitial optical fiber diffusion tip for calibration, the theoretical temperature distribution predicted by the bioheat equation was used to extract optical properties of tissue. Finally, the three-dimensional temperature distribution was simulated to guide tumor destruction and immunological stimulation.

40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} outcome of {{permanent}} 125 I interstitial radiotherapy for unresectable retroperitoneal recurrences of gynecologic malignancies. Methods and Materials: A retrospective review of 20 patients treated between 1979 and 1993 was performed to evaluate survival and morbidity associated with the <b>interstitial</b> 125 I <b>technique.</b> Results: Nineteen tumors were located on the lateral pelvic wall {{and one in the}} para-aortic region. Eight patients, not previously irradiated, received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) along with 125 I interstitial implants placed at the time of celiotomy. Nineteen (95 %) are dead of disease at 1 - 69 months of follow-up. The median survival was 7. 7 months for patients treated with 125 I alone and 25. 4 months for those treated with both 125 I and EBRT. One patient is alive without evidence of disease 69 months after 125 I implantation. Fistulas, bowel obstructions, and fatal complications occurred only among patients previously irradiated. Conclusions: When used in a previously irradiated field, 125 I interstitial radiotherapy has major morbidity and is unlikely to be associated with cure or long-term survival. In radiotherapy-naive patients with unresectable isolated recurrent gynecologic malignancies, 125 I implants and EBRT are feasible and occasionally may contribute to long-term disease-free survival. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R

In the pre-dialysis state, interstitial colloid osmotic pressure was reduced compared to normal controls (12. 7 ± 3. 5 versus 15. 8 ± 2. 7 mmHg, mean values ± SD) and transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient increased (15. 3 ± 3. 0 versus 12. 8 ± 2. 7 mmHg). Ultrafiltration resulted in a parallel decrease of plasma volume and interstitial fluid volume of 19 to 20 %, {{and an increase in}} mean interstitial colloid osmotic pressure of 3. 4 mmHg and in mean transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient of 1. 9 mmHg. The mean ultrafiltration rate was 21. 9 ± 1. 9 ml/min and the plasma refilling rate was 16. 5 ± 2. 7 ml/min. It is concluded that the changes in plasma and interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure tend to preserve plasma volume and limit the interdialytic increase in interstitial fluid volume...|$|R

He also tries to delimit the areas of preoccupation concerning the enterprise; thus equipped, {{the purpose of the}} book is to bring into a unit the significant items of the subject. This goal being attained he now pays attention to the specific problems and the required instruments for their solution. This book hints at revising the setting in which enterprise economy is placed, and at the revision of the interdisciplinary relations. Identifying the contents of the principal works on the subject (Gutenberg, Colbert, Bradford-Alt, Dean y Fernandez Piria) the author finds out that the so-called administrative sciences lack a unifying bond, constituting therefore <b>interstitial</b> sciences and <b>techniques</b> which specialize on particulars of enterprise economy. His conclusion is that the subject is of most recent data. The subject has a well definable formal object, and it forms part of the political theory with a basis which explains the events in the general theory. This subject only exists on account of the instrumental whole provided to it by the so-called operating investigation. Instituto de Investigaciones Económica...|$|R
40|$|An iminodiacetate {{chelating}} resin was optimised for {{the rapid}} determination of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni in seawater. Using inexpensive, high-capacity, reusable cartridges allowed high flow rates {{of up to}} 25 ml min(- 1). High preconcentration factors, of up to 500, were obtained in order to analyse samples using an ICP-OES. The requirement for a buffer was eliminated due to the high tolerance of the ICP-OES to interfering matrix elements, thereby further reducing the potential for contamination. Quantification limits in seawater were: Co = 6 ng l(- 1), Cu = 8 ng l(- 1), Fe = 6 ng l(- 1), Mn = 5 ng l(- 1) and Ni = 6 ng l(- 1). The method was verified by the analysis of near shore seawater (CASS- 4) and open ocean seawater (NASS- 5) reference materials. In order to satisfy the high sampling demands using the iminodiacetate cartridges, a portable off-line preconcentration unit was developed for routine analysis. The multi-channel preconcentration unit, was capable of treating up to eight samples simultaneously with concentrating times as little as 30 minutes. The technique was also used to determine dissolved metals in fresh and <b>interstitial</b> waters. The <b>technique</b> has been successfully used {{in a number of}} environmental studies and impact assessments to evaluate the effects of mining on the New Caledonian lagoon...|$|R

We investigated different approaches to adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) engraftment into ADM to enhance this process. Lewis rat adipose-derived stem cells were isolated and grafted (3. 0 × 10 (5) cells) to porcine ADM disks (1. 5 mm thick × 6 mm diameter) using either passive onlay or <b>interstitial</b> injection seeding <b>techniques.</b> Following incubation, seeding efficiency and seeded cell viability were measured in vitro. In addition, Eighteen Lewis rats underwent subcutaneous placement of ADM disk either as control or seeded with PKH 67 labeled ASCs. ADM disks were seeded with ASCs using either onlay or injection techniques. On day 7 and or 14, ADM disks were harvested and analyzed for host cell infiltration. Onlay and injection techniques resulted in unique seeding patterns; however cell seeding efficiency and cell viability were similar. In-vivo studies showed significantly increased host cell infiltration towards the ASCs foci following injection seeding in comparison to control group (p < 0. 05). Moreover, regional endothelial cell invasion was significantly greater in ASCs injected grafts in comparison to onlay seeding (p < 0. 05). ADM can successfully be engrafted with ASCs. Interstitial engraftment of ASCs into ADM via injection enhances regional infiltration of host cells and angiogenesis, whereas onlay seeding showed relatively broad and superficial cell infiltration. These findings may be applied to improve the incorporation of avascular engineered constructs...|$|R

Demonstrating therapeutic drug concentrations in lamellar tissue is essential for evaluating the efficacy of these agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an experimental technique for repeatedly sampling lamellar <b>interstitial</b> fluid. A <b>technique</b> for placing ultrafiltration probes was developed in vitro using 15 cadaver limbs. Subsequently, lamellar ultrafiltration probes were placed in one forelimb in six living horses. Interstitial fluid was collected continuously from the probes as ultrafiltrate for 4 (n = 4) or 14 days (n = 2). The rate of ultrafiltrate collection was calculated every 12 h. Biochemical analyses were performed on ultrafiltrate collected on night 1 (12 - 24 h post-implantation) and night 4 (84 - 96 h post-implantation). Sections surrounding the probe and control tissue from the contralateral limb were harvested, stained with H&E and Masson 2 ̆ 7 s trichrome and scored based on the tissue response to the probe. Ultrafiltration probes were placed in the lamellar tissue in all six horses. Ultrafiltrate was collected from these probes at 55 (30 - 63) μL/h (median [interquartile range]). Fluid production decreased significantly with time from night 3 onwards (P 0. 05). The technique was well tolerated.

40|$|Background: Evaluation of feasibility, {{tolerance}} and efficiency {{for a new}} 3 D <b>interstitial</b> HDR brachytherapy <b>technique</b> combined with 3 D external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation for prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: Between January 1997 and August 1998 we treated 35 patients with Stage cT 1 - 3 N 0 M 0 prostate cancer. Thirty-two patients with a follow-up of 12 to 28 months (median: 18 months) were evaluated. After ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of 4 non-parallel needles, CT based 3 D brachytherapy treatment planning ("Offenbach system") was performed. All patients received 4 fractions brachytherapy using a fractional dose of 5 or 7 Gy, Time between each fraction was 14 days. After brachytherapy 3 D external irradiation followed up to 39. 6 or 45. 0 Gy. All patients received androgen deprivation, starting 2 to 19 months before brachytherapy, ending 3 months after 3 D external radiotherapy. Results: Posttreatment PSA levels dropped to < 1. 5 ng/ml in 29 / 32 patients (91 %). In 25 patients PSA levels were < 0. 5 ng/ml, in 4 patients 0. 5 to 1. 5 ng/ml. In 2 patients we noted biochemical relapse. Transrectal implantation was very well tolerated. Grade 3 acute urinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient. We noted no Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient developed a Grade 3 late urinary toxicity. No patient showed late gastrointestinal side effects. All 140 dose-volume histograms for 3 D HDR brachytherapy were analyzed. Conclusions: The new 3 D HDR brachytherapy technique, combined with 3 D external irradiation and androgen deprivation, is a feasible, so far well tolerated and effective treatment in the short-time follow-up of median 18 months...|$|R
40|$|Hyperthermia {{plays an}} {{important}} role in oncological therapies, most often being used in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The success of this therapy is strongly dependent on the precision and control of thermal deposition. Hyperthermia based on induction heating, with thermally self-regulating thermoseeds inserted into the tumorous mass, is used for <b>interstitial</b> treatment. The <b>technique</b> was the subject of the numerical study presented in the paper. The analysis was carried out using coupled electromagnetic heating and thermo-fluid dynamic FEM simulations. During thermal deposition by induction heating of inserted seeds, the simulations estimated the thermal field inside and outside the tumour, as well as the sensitivity of the thermal field to variations regarding seed temperature, configuration and proximity to vessels. The method, for which accurate anatomical patient's information is essential, is suitable for providing useful qualitative and quantitative information about thermal transients and power density distribution for hyperthermic treatment. Several grid steps were analysed and compared. A 1 cm seed grid was resulted in good homogeneity and effectiveness of the thermal deposition. The cold spot effect caused by large vessels was demonstrated and quantified. Simulations of the heating of a tumorous mass in the liver showed that an indcutor generator operating at 200 kHz frequency and 500 A current, producing a pulsating magnetic field of H = 60 A cm(- 1), was adequate for the treatment. The seeds that perform best among those tested (Nicu (28 % Cu), PdNi (27. 2 % Ni), PdCo (6. 15 % Co) and ferrite core) were the PdNi (1 mm radius, 10 mm length), as they have a low Curie temperature (52 degreesC), which is the closest to the desired treatment temperature and thus reduces the risk of hot spots...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to: 1) {{develop a new}} method for the {{determination}} of interstitial pH at rest and during exercise in vivo, 2) systematically explore the effects of different ingestion regimes of 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate on blood and urine pH at rest, and 3) to combine the new <b>interstitial</b> pH <b>technique</b> {{with the findings of}} the second investigation in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of H+ movement between the extracellular compartments. The purpose of the first study was to develop a method for the continuous measurement of interstitial pH in vastus lateralis was successfully developed using microdialysis and 2, 7 -bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 -(and- 6) -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). To avoid the presence of an artificial alkalosis during exercise, it was necessary to add 25 mM HCO 3 - to the perfusate. The outlet of the probe was cut less than 10 mm from the skin and connected to a stainless steel tube completing the circuit to a microflow-through cuvette (8 fÝl) within a fluorescence spectrophotometer. This prevented the loss of carbon dioxide from the dialysate and any subsequent pH artefact. Interstitial pH was collected from six subjects before, during and after five minutes of knee-extensor exercise at three intensities 30, 50, and 70 W. Mean,,bSEM interstitial pH at rest was 7. 38,,b 0. 02. Exercise reduced interstitial pH in an almost linear fashion. The nadir value for interstitial pH at 30, 50 and 70 W exercise was 7. 27, 7. 16 and 7. 04, respectively. The lowest pH was obtained 1 min after exercise, irrespective of workload, after which the interstitial pH recovered in a nearly exponential manner. The mean half time of interstitial recovery was 5. 2 min. The changes in interstitial pH exceeded the changes in venous blood pH. This study demonstrated that interstitial pH can be measured using microdialysis and that it is continuously decreased during muscle activity. The purpose of the second study was to establish an optimal ingestion regime for the ingestion of 300 mg. kg- 1 of sodium citrate and maximise the alkalotic effect while minimising any side effects. Increasing the effectiveness of alkali ingestion may lead to further increases in muscle performance. Ingesting 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate at a rate of 300 mg. min- 1 was identified as the optimal ingestion regime to maximise alkalosis at rest, which occurred 3. 5 h post-ingestion. This was determined by monitoring eight human subjects ingesting 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate at five different rates, control (no ingestant), bolus, 300, 600 and 900 mg. kg. min- 1 on five days separated by at least 48 hours. Sodium citrate was ingested in capsule form with water ad libitum, with the exception of bolus, which was combined with 400 ml less than 25 percent orange juice and consumed in less than 1 min. Arterialised blood (mean 71. 3,,b 3. 5 mmHg) acid-base and electrolyte status was assessed via the withdrawal of ~ 5 ml of blood every 30 min across an eight hour duration, placed on ice and analysed within five minutes. No alkalotic difference was found between ingestion rates (mean 7. 445,,b 0. 004, 7. 438,,b 0. 004 and 7. 442,,b 0. 004 for 300, 600 and 900 mg. min- 1, respectively). All experimental ingestion regimes were associated with elevations in [HCO 3 -] (29. 6, 29. 7, 29. 8, 29. 9 and 26. 3 mmol. l- 1 for bolus, 300, 600, 900 and control, respectively). The 300 ingestion regime had the greatest impact on [H+], a 0. 66 meq. l- 1,,e 10 - 8 change. Bolus ingestion (3. 93,,b 0. 08 mmol. l- 1) of sodium citrate had no effect on control (4. 06,,b 0. 08 mmol. l- 1) blood [K+], however, 300 mg. min- 1 decreased blood [K+] (p less than 0. 05). There was no effect of sodium citrate on blood [Cl-], but after 2. 5 h blood [Cl-] was lower than pre-ingestion values (p less than 0. 05). All ingestion rates of sodium citrate increased (p less than 0. 05) urine pH above control. This is the first study to investigate the effect of varying ingestion rates on acid-base status at rest in humans. The results suggest that ingesting sodium citrate in small doses in quick succession induce a greater blood alkalosis than the commonly practised bolus protocol. Using the <b>interstitial</b> pH <b>technique</b> described above and the optimal ingestion regime (300 mg. min- 1) identified above, the final experiment was designed to assess the influence of sodium citrate ingestion on interstitial pH at both rest and during exercise. Five subjects ingested 300 mg. kg- 1 sodium citrate at 300 mg. min- 1 again in capsule form with water ad libitum. Prior to ingestion, each subject had a cannula placed into their cephalic vein and one microdialysis probe (CMA- 60) inserted into their left thigh, orientated along the fibres of vastus lateralus. This probe was used for the measurement of pH as described above. At the end of this period, an exercise protocol required five subjects to perform light exercise (10 W) for 10 min, before starting an intense exercise period (~ 90 - 95 % leg VO 2 peak) to exhaustion followed by a 15 min recovery period. Dialysate and blood samples were collected across all periods. Mean,,bSEM interstitial pH for placebo and alkalosis were 7. 38,,b 0. 12 and 7. 24,,b 0. 16, respectively. Sodium citrate ingestion was not associated with an interstitial alkalosis. An exercise induced acidosis was observed in the interstitium during placebo but not during alkalosis (p less than 0. 05). Mean,,bSEM venous pH were 7. 362,,b 0. 003 and 7. 398,,b 0. 003 for placebo and alkalosis, respectively. Sodium citrate ingestion was not associated with a venous alkalosis. Sodium citrate ingestion was associated with an increase in mean,,bSEM venous [HCO 3 -] (placebo 25. 5,,b 0. 2, alkalosis 28. 1,,b 0. 2). This increase in the blood bicarbonate buffer system was not associated with an increase in time to exhaustion (placebo 352,,b 71, alkalosis 415,,b 171). This was the first study to investigate the effects of sodium citrate ingestion on interstitial pH. The results of this study demonstrated that an interstitial alkalosis does not ensue after alkali ingestion, however, it was associated with the lack of an exercise induced acidosis suggesting an improved pH regulation during exercise...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{acceptance of}} topical formulations intended for local and/or regional activity has prompted {{renewed interest in}} developing a model to determine the bioavailability of drugs {{in order to establish}} bioequivalence as a means of evaluating formulation performance of multisource products and also for use during formulation development. Current in vivo techniques such as blister suction and skin biopsy amongst others used to determine the bioavailability and/or bioequivalence of topical formulations are either too invasive to generate appropriate concentration-time profiles or require large numbers of study subjects thereby making the study expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there are currently no sampling techniques that can demonstrate dermal bioavailability and/or bioequivalence of topical formulations intended for local and/or regional activity. Dermal microdialysis is a relatively new application of microdialysis that permits continuous monitoring of endogenous and/or exogenous solutes in the <b>interstitial</b> fluid. The <b>technique</b> is involves the implantation of semi-permeable membranes which are perfused with an isotonic medium at extremely slow flow rates and collection of microlitre sample volumes containing diffused drugs. Tape stripping, a relatively older technique, has been extensively used in comparative bioavailability studies of various topical formulations. However, due to shortcomings arising from reproducibility and inter-subject variation amongst others, the published FDA guidance outlining the initial protocol was subsequently withdrawn. The incorporation of transepidermal water loss with tape stripping has garnered renewed interest and has been used for the determination of drug bioavailability from a number of topical formulations. Hence the primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate microdialysis sampling and tape stripping techniques, including the incorporation of the determination of transepidermal water loss, to assess the dermal bioavailability of ketoprofen from topical gel formulations and to develop models for bioequivalence assessment. A rapid UPLC-MS/MS method with requisite sensitivity for the analysis of samples generated from dermal microdialysis was developed and validated which accommodated the microlitre sample volumes collected. An HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the analysis of samples generated from the in vitro microdialysis and in vivo tape stripping studies. The work presented herein contributes to a growing body of scientific knowledge seeking to develop a model for the determination of bioequivalence of pharmaceutically equivalent topical formulations intended for local and/or regional activity in human subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{aortic valve}} {{maintains}} unidirectional blood flow between the left ventricle and the systemic circulation. When diseased, the valve is replaced either by a mechanical or a bioprosthetic heart valve, that carry {{issues such as}} thrombogenesis, long term structural failure, and calcification, necessitating {{the development of more}} structurally and biologically sufficient long-term replacements. Tissue engineering provides a possible avenue for development, combining cells, scaffolds, and biochemical factors to regenerate tissue. The overall goal of this dissertation was to create a foundation for the rational design of a tissue engineered aortic valve. The novel approach taken in this thesis research was to view each of the three leaflets as a laminate structure. The first three aims consider the leaflet as a laminate structure comprising of layers of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). In the first aim, the effect of GAGs on the tensile properties and stress relaxation in the leaflet was investigated, by removing GAGs through increasing amounts of hyaluronidase. A decrease in GAGs led to significantly higher elastic moduli, maximum stresses, and hysteresis in the leaflet. In the second aim, the 3 D elastic fiber network of the leaflet was characterized using immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. This structure was found to have regionally varying thicknesses and patterns. In the third aim, a novel hydrogel-fiber composite design was proposed to match the anisotropy of the leaflet. This composite composed of aligned electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) within a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) matrix. Surface modification and embedding of the PCL did not significantly alter the anisotropy or strength of the underlying PCL scaffold, providing the basis for an anisotropic, biocompatible scaffold. In the last aim, a novel co-culture model was designed using magnetic levitation as a layered structure of valvular endothelial cells and <b>interstitial</b> cells. This <b>technique</b> was used to create co-culture models within hours, while maintaining cell phenotype and function, and inducing extracellular matrix formation, as shown by immunohistochemical stains and their gene expression profiling. The overall result of this dissertation is a clearer understanding of the layered structure-function relationship of the aortic valve, and its application towards heart valve tissue engineering...|$|R
