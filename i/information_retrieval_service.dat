The ERIC database (only offering educational materials) was the first, extensive, nationwide application that was a non-defense related online <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>service.</b> This service was carried out through several centers around the country, and ultimately changed Dialog's business from installation of a system- to providing services of a system (Summit, 2002).|$|E

5000|$|Hailed as the 'Father of Online Systems,' Summit's work on DIALOG {{changed the}} {{information}} industry {{and provided a}} foundation for further research and development. Databases such as ERIC, LexisNexis, ProQuest, EBSCOHost among others all owe much to Roger Summit {{and the creation of}} DIALOG. The work with DIALOG would pave the way for today's leading online search engines like Yahoo! and Google. It shaped the growth of the online industry improving search capabilities. Having precise search capabilities was a product of Dialog's added large and consistent formatted databases and the incorporation of a search language (i.e. Boolean phrases). By providing a wider range of databases for users to search through, DIALOG allowed for the ability to multi-task in search. Users could find solutions with one query instead of running a separate search at a later time. Dialog has grown to be the world's most extensive online <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>service</b> - offering more than 1.4 billion unique records from more than 900 databases equaling over 15 terabytes of information, used by more than 25,000 corporate clients in 103 countries. Hence, with such enormous success, Dialog launched many different sub-systems for the corporation (DialogSelect, DialogWeb, DialogClassic and many more). The Thompson Reuters Corporation purchased the Information Services sector of The Dialog Corporation in 2000 and in 2008, ProQuest acquired Dialog from Thompson Reuters and launched ProQuest Dialog.
