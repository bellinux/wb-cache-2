5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E
5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E

25|$|Being {{tough on}} crime was a major plank of Pataki's {{campaign}} for governor. In 2011, the administration touted statistics that illustrated that crime had steadily reduced during the 11 years Pataki had served as governor, bringing New York from the 6th most dangerous {{state in the nation}} to the 7th safest. During his time in office, he signed into law over 100 new bills to change New York’s criminal statutes. In 1995, Governor Pataki was able to uphold a campaign promise by reinstating capital punishment in New York with the Sentencing Reform Act. The reinstatement of the death penalty was later suspended by the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) in a 4–3 decision. In 2000, Pataki helped lead the legislature in passing some of the then-strictest gun control laws in the country. Numerous aspects of the bill had been put forward by members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly but had never made it through the Republican held Senate. With numerous mass shootings in recent public memory, he urged a number of Republican Senators to support the bill, eventually passing it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> effort. His administration also launched programs such as SAF-T (Statewide Anti-Fugitive Teams) and the 100 Most Wanted. The initiatives were aimed at disseminating descriptions of criminals who were evading law enforcement officials to promote the ability of average citizens to help aid in their capture. Versions of Megan's Law and Kendra's Law were integrated into New York's laws under the governor {{as well as a number}} of reforms to the Rockefeller Drug Laws. The changes to the Rockefeller laws were largely focused on inmates' ability to appeal for an early release from sentences that were passed on them under mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.|$|E

[...] She was able to work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act. [...] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750million in increased spending for the agency. [...] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: [...] "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right." ...|$|E
