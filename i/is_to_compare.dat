25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs to dive into the water, it takes on water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to measure the}} marketability discount <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the prices of stock offered in initial public offerings (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks {{for a period of}} three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{government}} task forces, expert panels, private institutions, politicians, and journalists have made recommendations {{for reducing the}} deficit and slowing the growth of debt. Several organizations have compared the future impact of these plans on the deficit, debt, and economy. One helpful way of measuring {{the impact of the}} plans <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> them in terms of revenue and expense as a percentage of GDP over time, in total and by category. This helps illustrate how the different plan authors have prioritized particular elements of the budget.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{explicit}} phylogenetic methods <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> gene trees with their associated species trees. While weakly supported differences between gene and species trees can {{be due to}} inference uncertainty, statistically significant differences can be suggestive of HGT events (see Figure 1a). For example, if two genes from different species share the most recent ancestral connecting node in the gene tree, but the respective species are spaced apart in the species tree, an HGT event can be invoked. Such an approach can produce more detailed results than parametric approaches because the involved species, time and direction of transfer can potentially be identified.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{assumption}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> power densities {{at the same}} pressure, choosing the ion temperature for each reaction to maximize power density, and with the electron temperature equal to the ion temperature. Although confinement schemes can be and sometimes are limited by other factors, most well-investigated schemes {{have some kind of}} pressure limit. Under these assumptions, the power density for p–11B is about 2,100 times smaller than that for D-T. Using cold electrons lowers the ratio to about 700. These numbers are another indication that aneutronic fusion power is not possible with mainline confinement concepts.|$|E
25|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} is nucleus specific. Thus it {{can distinguish}} between hydrogen and deuterium. The amide protons in the protein exchange readily with the solvent, and, if the solvent contains a different isotope, typically deuterium, the reaction can be monitored by NMR spectroscopy. How rapidly a given amide exchanges reflects its solvent accessibility. Thus amide exchange rates can give information on which {{parts of the}} protein are buried, hydrogen bonded etc. A common application <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the exchange of a free form versus a complex. The amides that become protected in the complex, {{are assumed to be}} in the interaction interface.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} area {{error of}} 1− {{works out to}} about 21 percent, {{which is much more}} grave than the approximations of the lengths in the model circle of the previous section. It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see isoperimetry); the typical demonstration of this fact <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the precise}} {{structure}} or peptide sequence of a molecule is deciphered through {{the set of}} fragment masses, the interpretation of mass spectra requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> its experimental mass spectrum against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation or software assisted interpretation of mass spectra must be performed. Computer simulation of ionization and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An a priori structural information is fragmented in silico and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. Software taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{technique of}} comparative linguistics <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> phonological systems, morphological systems, syntax and the lexicon {{of two or}} more languages using techniques such as the comparative method. In principle, every difference between two related languages should be explicable to a high degree of plausibility and systematic changes, for example in phonological or morphological systems are expected to be highly regular (i.e. consistent). In practice, the comparison may be more restricted, e.g. just to the lexicon. In some methods {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct an earlier proto-language. Although the proto-languages reconstructed by the comparative method are hypothetical, a reconstruction may have predictive power. The most notable example of this is Saussure's proposal that the Indo-European consonant system contained laryngeals, a type of consonant attested in no Indo-European language known at the time. The hypothesis was vindicated with the discovery of Hittite, which proved to have exactly the consonants Saussure had hypothesized in the environments he had predicted.|$|E
25|$|Incremental {{health risk}} is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|E

25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} Roman Catholic Church in the Western {{world has been}} {{experiencing}} a decline in vocations to the priesthood and religious life since the 1960s, a relatively simple way to assess the vigour of this order <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the numbers of those in solemn profession (vows) with those in simple profession. For a mendicant order such as the Augustinians, the most formal and significant commitments are the permanent and lifelong vows of Solemn profession. Ordination is considered a separate matter, and though most are, the Augustinian friar {{may or may not}} be ordained priest or deacon. Those in simple profession are the newer members of the order, but have agreed to make a serious commitment (temporary, but with a view to permanent commitment), and been formally accepted as suitable by senior members of the order to make that formal commitment. The figures quoted do not include aspirants to the order who have not reached the significant step of simple profession. The details of the median age of friars in respective national grouping is another way of assessing the vigour of the order, but these details are not included here. They may be found on the order's international website. Likewise, the growth of lay organisations of Augustinian spirituality is another (less-precise) way of measuring the vigour of the order.|$|E
