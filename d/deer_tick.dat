25|$|The current {{research}} on Lyme's disease {{caused by a}} <b>deer</b> <b>tick,</b> and related toxins, is expanding the link between bacterial infections and mental illness.|$|E
25|$|Other {{infections that}} classically {{lead to a}} limp include Lyme disease (a {{bacterial}} infection spread by a <b>deer</b> <b>tick)</b> and osteomyelitis (an infection of the bone).|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the vector}} is Ixodes ricinus, {{which is also}} called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is {{probably}} the most important vector. In North America, the black-legged tick or <b>deer</b> <b>tick</b> (Ixodes scapularis) is the main vector on the East Coast.|$|E
25|$|Vaccination against Lyme disease, {{an illness}} that is spread via <b>deer</b> <b>ticks,</b> is also {{indicated}} in certain environments where <b>deer</b> <b>ticks</b> frequently occur. Lyme disease {{is known to}} cause lethargy, fever, soreness, and in cases gone untreated, damage to joints, paralysis, and nerve damage.|$|R
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{classified}} as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts. Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the main vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia). Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage, because they are very small and thus may feed {{for long periods of}} time undetected. Larval ticks are very rarely infected. Although deer are the preferred hosts of the adult stage of <b>deer</b> <b>ticks,</b> and tick populations are much lower in the absence of <b>deer,</b> <b>ticks</b> generally do not acquire Lyme disease spirochetes from <b>deer.</b> Rather, <b>deer</b> <b>ticks</b> acquire Borrelia microbes from infected small mammals and occasionally birds, including the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus.|$|R
25|$|Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic <b>deer</b> <b>ticks</b> (which {{are known}} to carry Lyme disease) are a {{potential}} hazard.|$|R
25|$|On October 9, 2013, at a live {{performance}} in Bay Shore, New York, Carlton {{announced that she}} was expecting her first child with her fiance John McCauley (of the band <b>Deer</b> <b>Tick),</b> and was very early on in her pregnancy. In November, she announced she had experienced an ectopic pregnancy, in which she later suffered a ruptured tube and internal bleeding. After surgery, her entire right fallopian tube was removed. On December 27, 2013, Carlton and McCauley married in a ceremony officiated by Stevie Nicks.|$|E
2500|$|Tick-borne {{diseases}} {{are common in}} dogs. [...] Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and spread by Ixodes pacificus on the West coast of the United States and by I. scapularis (<b>deer</b> <b>tick)</b> {{in the rest of}} the U.S. [...] Signs and symptoms include fever, joint swelling and pain, lameness, and swelling of the lymph nodes. [...] It has been diagnosed in dogs in all 48 states of the continental U.S. [...] Ehrlichia canis, which causes canine ehrlichiosis, and Rickettsia rickettsii, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are both spread by the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineous.|$|E
2500|$|The risk of {{infectious}} transmission increases with {{the duration of}} tick attachment. [...] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. If a <b>deer</b> <b>tick</b> that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may {{reduce the risk of}} Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70-80% of people infected).|$|E
40|$|Deer keds (Lipoptena cervi) {{are thought}} to have been {{introduced}} into New England from Europe during the 1800 s. We sought to determine whether L. cervi from Massachusetts deer contained evidence of infection by Bartonella schoenbuchensis, which appears to be maintained by L. cervi in Europe. Five of 6 keds were found to contain B. schoenbuchensis DNA, and 2 <b>deer</b> <b>ticks</b> cofeeding on <b>deer</b> with such keds did as well. The detection of Bartonella DNA in <b>deer</b> <b>ticks</b> probably represents contamination by infected deer blood...|$|R

In 1996 and 1997, the number of A. phagocytophilum-infected ticks markedly declined.
