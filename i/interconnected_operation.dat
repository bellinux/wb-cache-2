The scaling-induced rise in resistance in the future may be significantly exacerbated due to an increase in Cu resistivity it-self, through both electron surface scattering and diffusion bar-rier effect. The impact of these effects on resistivity is modeled under various technological conditions and constraints. These con-straints include the <b>interconnect</b> <b>operation</b> temperature, the effect of copper-diffusion barrier thickness and its deposition technology, and the quality of interconnect/barrier interface.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of transactive energy, the energy trading among interconnected microgrids (MGs) is promising to improve the economy and reliability of system operations. In this paper, a distributed energy management method for <b>interconnected</b> <b>operations</b> of {{combined heat and power}} (CHP)-based MGs with demand response (DR) is proposed. First, the system model of operational cost including CHP, DR, renewable distributed sources, and diesel generation is introduced, where the DR is modeled as a virtual generation unit. Second, the optimal scheduling model is decentralized as several distributed scheduling models in accordance with the number of associated MGs. Moreover, a distributed iterative algorithm based on subgradient with dynamic search direction is proposed. During the iterative process, the information exchange between neighboring MGs is limited to Lagrange multipliers and expected purchasing energy. Finally, numerical results are given for an interconnected MGs system consisting of three MGs, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} the globalization of financial services has not undermined the importance of local embeddedness in world financial centers, among global banks. Using qualitative data from interviews with senior bankers in the interest rate swaps (derivatives) industry in Australia, in this paper I demonstrate the importance of spatial relationships and processes of local embeddedness {{in the production of}} swaps. Local embeddedness is attributable to the rapid exchange of financial information in formal dealing networks that serve as central information sources, enabling dealers to formulate a "market feel" that influences their dealing strategies. Information interpretation and decision making in dealing processes and specialist financial labor provide the foundations for the product-based learning orientation of swaps dealing. Dealing networks are underpinned by social relationships, requiring face-to-face interaction that is facilitated by spatial proximity. Although the global swaps industry is dominated by multinational banks, the centrality of these embedded networks impedes globalization in interest rate swaps dealing.

The stator mainly {{consists of a}} steel package, two end plates and slot insulation. The particular benefit of this process technology {{lies in the fact}} that the winding machine produces a completely winded assembly group when adequate electrical slot fill factors are employed. If, however, the use of single teeth requires joining and <b>interconnecting</b> <b>operations,</b> all <b>interconnecting</b> measures of the coil sections of one phase may be executed by the winding machine for the stator laminations. In this case, the electric slot fill factor may amount up to 45%. Since manufacturing a functioning stator merely requires a small effort, the negative impact on the electric fill factor is gladly accepted. In order to be able to use various additional functions of the winding machine, the end plates are often designed in a way which allows e.g. the taking on of cutting terminal contacts. In addition, winding space restrictions and laying ducts for the connecting wires of a phase may be integrated.The material costs are also low due to the small number of individual components. In combination with the modest costs of the means of production, stator laminations constitute a practical solution. Three essential basic concepts frequently come to the fore when dealing with the design of stator laminations. Stator laminations for concentrated winding are divided into the following main groups.|$|R

After a review of a selected set of approaches to Urban Energy Systems study with a special focus on electrical power systems, urban energy systems are proposed as networks of multi-source hybrid energy hubs, where different energy flows are collected at the same bus and can be stored, delivered or transformed as needed. Resources at the hub and infrastructures interact with each other; therefore, both definition and boundaries of such energy systems at urban level are difficult to be clearly outlined.

More important than the cost, however, is the necessity of these services for bulk-power reliability and for the support of commercial transactions. FERC`s landmark Order 888 included a pro forma tariff with provision for six key ancillary services. The <b>Interconnected</b> <b>Operations</b> Services Working Group identified another six services that it felt were essential to the operation of bulk-power systems. Several groups throughput the United States have created or are forming independent system operators, which will be responsible for reliability and commerce. To date, the electricity industry (including traditional vertically integrated utilities, distribution utilities, power markets and brokers, customers, and state and federal regulators) has paid insufficient attention to these services. Although the industry had made substantial progress in identifying and defining the key services, much remains to be doe to specify methods to measure the production, delivery, and consumption of these services; to identify the costs and cost-allocation factors for these services; and to develop market and operating rules for their provision and pricing. Developing metrics, determining costs, and setting pricing rules are important because most of these ancillary {{services are}} produced by the same pieces of equipment that produce the basic electricity commodity.
