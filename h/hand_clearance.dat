40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{molecular}} communications (MC) in a proposed artificial synapse (AS), whose main difference from biological synapses (BSs) {{is that it}} is closed, i. e., transmitter molecules cannot diffuse out from AS. Such a setup has both advantages and disadvantages. Besides higher structural stability, being closed, AS never runs out of transmitters. Thus, MC in AS is disconnected from outer environment, which is very desirable for possible intra-body applications. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>clearance</b> of transmitters from AS has to be achieved by transporter molecules on the presynaptic membrane of AS. Except from these differences, rest of AS content is taken to be similar to that of a glutamatergic BS. Furthermore, in place of commonly used Monte Carlo based random walk experiments, we derive a deterministic algorithm that attacks for expected values of desired parameters such as evolution of receptor states. To assess validity of our algorithm we compare its results with average results of an ensemble of Monte Carlo experiments, which shows near exact match. Moreover, our approach requires significantly less amount of computation compared to Monte Carlo approach, making it useful for parameter space exploration necessary for optimisation in design of possible MC devices, including but not limited to AS. Results of our algorithm are presented in case of single quantal release only, and they support that MC in closed AS with elevated uptake has similar properties to that in BS. In particular, similar to glutamatergic BSs, the quantal size and density of receptors are found to be main sources of synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, the proposed model of AS is found to have slower decaying transients of receptor states compared to BSs, especially desensitised ones, which is due prolonged clearance of transmitters from AS...|$|E
40|$|This study {{profiled}} beach flags start kinematics for experienced {{young adult}} sprinters. Five males and three females (age = 20. 8 ± 2. 1 years; height = 1. 70 ± 0. 06 meters [m]; mass = 63. 9 ± 6. 0 kilograms) completed four sprints using their competition start technique. A high-speed camera, positioned laterally, filmed the start. Data included: start time; <b>hand</b> <b>clearance</b> time; posterior {{movement from the}} start line; feet spacing during the start; elbow, hip, knee, trunk lean, and trajectory angles at take-off; and first step length. Timing gates recorded 0 - 2, 0 - 5, and 0 - 20 m time. Spearman's correlations identified variables relating (p < 0. 05) to faster start and sprint times. The beach flags start involved sprinters moving 0. 18 ± 0. 05 m posterior to the start line by flexing both legs underneath the body before turning. Following the turn, the feet were positioned 0. 47 ± 0. 07 apart. This distance negatively correlated with start (ρ = - 0. 647), 0 - 2 (ρ = - 0. 683), and 0 - 5 m (ρ = - 0. 766) time. Beach flags start kinematics at take-off resembled research analyzing track starts and acceleration. The elbow extension angle (137. 62 ± 13. 45 °) of the opposite arm to the drive leg correlated with 0 - 2 (ρ = - 0. 762), 0 - 5 (ρ = - 0. 810), and 0 - 20 m (ρ = - 0. 810) time. Greater arm extension likely assisted with stability during the start, leading to enhanced sprint performance. The drive leg knee extension angle (146. 36 ± 2. 26 °) correlated with start time (ρ = - 0. 677), indicating a contribution to a faster start completion. A longer first step following the start related to faster 0 - 5 m time (ρ = - 0. 690). Sprinters quicker over 0 - 2 and 0 - 5 m were also quicker over 20 m (ρ = 0. 881 - 0. 952). Beach flags sprinters must ensure their start is completed quickly, such that they can attain a high speed throughout the rac...|$|E

Indomethacin clearance is lower in chronic migraine patients overusing IPC combination than in migraine patients only occasionally taking it. Objective: to verify if indomethacin reduced clearance reverts to normal after withdrawal of the overused IPC combination. Methods: We repeated the study of indomethacin pharmacokinetics in 9 female chronic migraine patients after 3 months from inpatient withdrawal treatment from IPC combination overuse. The IPC combination (indomethacin 50 mg, prochlorperazine 8 mg, caffeine 150 mg) habitually taken was administered by rectal route to each patient. Blood samples were drawn before dosing and at the following post-dose times: 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h. Indomethacin concentrations were measured by HPLC method. Results: Pharmacokinetic parameters of indomethacin in 4 patients who relapsed into IPC overuse {{were similar to those}} observed before withdrawal treatment; on the other <b>hand,</b> indomethacin <b>clearance</b> reverted to values consistent with published data in 5 patients who discontinued IPC combination overuse.

40|$|Rituximab is a {{monoclonal}} antibody that targets the CD 20 B-cell-specific antigen and {{is widely used}} as therapy for B-cell lymphoma. Since rituximab depletes both malignant and normal B cells, it is increasingly being used to treat various conditions in which normal B cells have a pathogenic role, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It is well-established that rituximab efficiently eliminates B cells in blood, lymph nodes, and spleen. In contrast, the effect of rituximab in non-lymphoid tissues remains poorly documented and is debated. Here, we report a rheumatoid arthritis patient who was treated with rituximab before receiving thoracic surgery for non-small cell lung cancer. Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we show that rituximab efficiently depleted CD 20 -positive B cells in a primary lung tumor, in lung-associated lymph nodes, and in normal lung tissue. We conclude that rituximab may be very efficient at depleting normal B cells in the lungs. This property of rituximab may potentially be exploited {{for the treatment of}} conditions in which pathogenic B cells reside in the lungs. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>clearance</b> of lung B cells may provide an explanation for the rare cases of severe non-infectious pulmonary toxicity of rituximab...|$|R
40|$|As {{the use of}} fibre {{reinforced}} {{polymer materials}} in bridge construction is becoming more popular, appropriate joining techniques, particularly for field joints, are necessary. Bolted joints are a common method for joining fibre reinforced polymer structures. The main advantage of bolted joints is their detachability, {{but they have a}} number of shortcomings. On the one <b>hand,</b> hole <b>clearances,</b> which are needed to facilitate on-site assembly, reduce the stiffness and joint efficiency. On the other hand, {{it is not possible to}} rely on the beneficial effects of bolt pre-defined tension loads, i. e. load transfer in friction, due to the considerable losses of bolt tension caused by the creep deformation in the composite material. To tackle these problems, a solution utilising metallic inserts in the hole is proposed in this paper. A series of experimental tests have been conducted to investigate the effect of inserts on the bolt-tension relaxation, the stiffness and the load-bearing behaviour of joints. Finite element analyses were also employed. The study demonstrates several benefits of the inserts: the bolt tension relaxation is minimised, the load transfer by friction may be feasible to be utilised in the bridge service state and the joint efficiency is increased in terms of stiffness and strength...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies was to analyse and compare changes in {{selected}} parameters of renal function in terms of water-electrolyte balance regulation in single- and twin-pregnant goats. Clearance analyses were carried out on 16 pregnant White Improved goats (8 in single and 8 in twin gestation). Blood plasma and urine samples were analysed for the concentration of inulin, endogenous creatinine, sodium, potassium, and chlorides. It has been demonstrated that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the goat kidney does not change significantly during gestation. GFR recorded from the 1 st week until the 20 th week of gestation in twin-pregnant goats was only slightly higher compared to those observed in single-pregnant does. Blood plasma concentrations of major electrolytes, i. e. sodium, potassium and chloride ions, {{did not differ significantly}} in pregnant and non-pregnant goats, and remained within the reference values. From the very beginning of gestation, the single-pregnant goats showed increased renal potassium clearance; however, the level of sodium clearance remained stable.

Problem facing in precision turning is how to minimize tool wear {{in order to obtain}} good accuracy of geometrical part and surface finish. In this study the effect of changing the rake angle of insert carbide geometries to the wear level was investigated. The tungsten carbide insert type of DNMA 432 was used as cutting tool. FCD 500, a difficult-to-cut ductile cast iron, was chosen as work material. There were seven simulations using Deform- 3 D were carried out at various tool geometries combination, whilst the cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were kept constant at 200 m/s, feed 0. 35 mm/rev, and 0. 3 mm respectively. The carbide insert geometries were designed in order to produce- 15,- 10,- 5 deg (negative rake angle), 0 and + 5, + 10, + 15 deg (positive rake angle) using pre processor of Deform- 3 D. Changing the rake and clearance angles will influence the wear depth of the inserts. The results also show that increase in rake angle will reduce the cutting force and temperature, therefore reduced the wear depth. On the other <b>hands,</b> decreasing <b>clearance</b> angle will caused bigger contact area between the clearance face and work piece surface, consequently, increase the tool wear...|$|R

MVDC systems are applicable for connection between microgrids (MGs) and integration of renewable energy systems (RESs) to distribution systems.

Aim: To evaluate the hepatic clearance of both proteases in experimental liver fibrosis. Methods: the hepatic clearance of these proteases was studied in porcine serum-induced liver fibrosis using the isolated and perfused rat liver model. To better interpret the results, we also studied four other experimental groups: the turpentine oil-induced acute-phase response (AP group), AP group followed by GdCl 3 administration (AP/Gd group), CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis (CCl 4 group) and normal group. Results: the tPA clearance decreased significantly by both fibrotic and cirrhotic rat livers whereas the RPK clearance was not altered by the fibrotic rat liver. the hepatic clearance of tPA was reduced in the AP and AP/Gd groups; on the other <b>hand,</b> RPK <b>clearance</b> was increased in the AP group and, interestingly, this effect was neutralized by concomitant GdCl 3 administration.

40|$|AbstractTopical agents {{containing}} vitamin D 3 (VD 3) analogues such as calcipotriol, maxacalcitol and tacalcitol and {{the combination}} of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (betamethasone) are prescribed for patients with psoriasis. However, they are known to occasionally cause hypercalcemia, {{and the frequency of}} hypercalcemia is suggested to vary according to the VD 3 analogue used. In this study, to address the reason for these differences, the calcemic effects of maxacalcitol-, calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments in rats were evaluated. The serum calcium levels in rats treated with ointments containing maxacalcitol, but not calcipotriol or calcipotriol/betamethasone, were significantly elevated, which is consistent with clinical observations. The serum concentration of VD 3 analogue in rats treated with ointments containing calcipotriol and calcipotriol/betamethasone was lower than that in rats treated with maxacalcitol-containing ointment. Thus, the calcemic effects appear {{to be associated with the}} systemic exposure of VD 3 analogues in rats. To understand the mechanism underlying the different systemic exposures of VD 3 analogues, skin permeation and metabolic stability of VD 3 analogues were evaluated. The cumulative amount of calcipotriol permeated through rat skin was significantly lower than that of maxacalcitol. On the other <b>hand,</b> the metabolic <b>clearance</b> of calcipotriol in rat hepatocytes was higher than that of maxacalcitol. Similar results were obtained using human skin and human hepatocytes. The current study demonstrates that the lower calcemic effects of calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments are caused by the low systemic exposure of calcipotriol according to low skin permeability and rapid hepatic elimination after topical application...|$|R

This clearance, a receptor-mediated endocytosis, is calcium-independent and not {{affected}} by the blockade of Kupffer cells. the effects of endothelial cells blockade and of acetaminophen intoxication on the clearance of 10 nm rat plasma-kallikrein (RPK) by the isolated, exsanguinated and perfused rat liver are now reported. Endothelial cells blockade obtained {{by the addition of}} large excess (30 uM) of formaldehyde-treated serum albumin to the perfusion fluid does not affect the hepatic clearance of RPK (the half-lives of hepatic uptake were 15. 5 +/- 1. 0 min in the absence versus 16. 5 +/- 1. 4 min {{in the presence of the}} treated protein, p > 0. 05). Some livers were perfused 24 hours after acetaminophen intoxication: 6. 6 mmol/kg given i. p. after a 42 -hour period of fast. Hepatocyte injury suggested by elevated aminotransferase activity (ALT 10 times control value, AST 30 times control value), acute phase inflammatory response (serum alpha 2 -macroglobulin increase) and reduced synthetic function (serum albumin decrease), was confirmed histologically and only zone 3 hepatocytes were necrotic. A 66 -hour period of fast does not affect by itself the hepatic clearance of RPK (16. 9 +/- 1. 3 min of half-life of hepatic uptake) when compared with the control group (15. 5 +/- 1. 0 min, p > 0. 05). On the other <b>hand</b> the RPK <b>clearance</b> by the livers of rats previously intoxicated with acetaminophen was markedly deficient (the half-life of hepatic uptake was 39. 2 +/- 3. 2 min).

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Biociências, apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de CoimbraEvery day {{the human}} body turns over billions of cells {{ensuring}} the disposal of unwanted targets that die by apoptosis. The prompt and efficient removal of apoptotic cells by cell line (vascular SMC). The maturation of phagosomes containing dying cells was compared with the processing of phagosomes loaded with IgG-opsonized particles, which are internalized via Fcγ-receptors and are the best characterized phagocytic model. At the present work, we provide evidence {{that the nature of}} the cargo modulates the phagocytic response, since phagosomes carrying apoptotic particles reach the lysosomes with a delay when compared to those containing IgG-opsonized particles. Furthermore, for the first time, we have identified some canonical autophagy effectors in phagolysosome formation, suggesting that LC 3 -Associated Phagocytosis (LAP), a process involved in phagosome maturation, implies more than the phagosomal recruitment of LC 3 (Sanjuan et al., 2007). Indeed, experiments performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from p 62 -KO mice clearly suggest that p 62, despite not being required for LC 3 recruitment, is important for phagolysosome biogenesis. In summary, this data will improve our knowledge on the molecular machinery and mechanisms involved in efferocytosis. In the end, we hope to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} efferocytosis and the ways to modulate this process, which could culminate with the discovery of therapies that may benefit patients with atherosclerosis and other type of diseases in which efferocytosis is not efficient. phagocytes, referred as to efferocytosis, plays an essential role during development, tissue repair and in the maintenance of homeostasis, triggering an immunological tolerance (Henson and Hume, 2006). On the other <b>hand,</b> defective <b>clearance</b> promote dying cell accumulation, converting harmless apoptotic cells into a risky secondary necrotic state that, eventually, expose self-antigens, which has been linked to the onset of several human disorders, including autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis (Elliott and Ravichandran, 2010). Atherosclerosis remains the biggest cause of mortality and disabilities worldwide, especially in developing countries. The formation of the atheroma starts with the retention of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) inside the wall of blood vessels, where they become subjected to several chemical modifications. These modified-LDL induce the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages, which internalize the deposited fatty material. Over time, these lipid-loaded macrophages are no longer able to process the cholesterol, forming foam-cells that eventually undergo apoptosis. In early stages of atherogenesis, efferocytosis is very efficient; however in advanced lesions this process somehow fails, triggering an inflammatory response that, in turn, recruits more cells, including neighboring smooth muscle cells (SMC). Besides macrophages, SMC, the major cell type in the blood vessels wall, play an essential role by dealing with the dying cell accumulation, thus preventing atheroma progression (Moore and Tabas, 2011). Although many efforts have been done to understand the machinery involved in the recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytic cells (receptors and ligands), as well as the immune response elicited, very little is known about the intracellular transport of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and its subsequent digestion into phagolysosomes, the final degradative compartment of the host cell (Hochreiter-Hufford and Ravichandran, 2013). Beyond that, C. elegans has been the model organism in studies of engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells, which reinforce the need to have more information about the development of this process in mammalian systems. Thus, it is crucial to our understanding, to figure out the causes of the inefficient efferocytosis and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of certain diseases. In this thesis, we have performed a detailed study on the maturation of phagosomes containing human aged red blood cells, our apoptotic cell model, using a mammalian phagocyti...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPublic housing {{has been}} built largely as a {{response}} to the spread of slums in American cities. The origins and growth of slums in different sections of Boston have been caused by several factors. The North and West Ends, originally the most exclusive districts in the city, declined as upper and middle-class residents moved outwards toward the periphery of Boston and beyond into the surrounding towns. The exodus of the upper classes from Central Boston was stimulated by the arrival of European immigrant laborers and by extensions and improvements in public transportation, especially after the middle of the 18 th Century. Af first settling in the North and West Ends and in the South Cove, immigrants soon moved into Charlestown, East Boston, the South End and South Boston, attracted by the shipping, factory, and warehouse employment in these areas. Further improvements in public transportation and reduced fares facilitated the migration of low-income families (mainly composed of immigrants) to other outlying sections of Boston; Roxbury, Dorchester and Brighton. Also important as a blighting influence was the elevated railway in Charlestown, the South End and Roxbury. In the West and South Ends and in Roxbury, many cheaply-constructed tenements were built. In 1891, the first city-wide census of housing conditions was made. A wide distribution of slum conditions existed; the North and South Ends and South Boston contained the highest percentages of unsanitary tenements, Charlestown and the built-up sections of East Boston and Roxbury had deteriorated and conditions below the city average were found even in Brighton, Dorchester and West Roxbury. During the first quarter of the present century, many lower-quality frame three-deckers were built in Dorchester, East Boston, Roxbury and South Boston. In studies undertaken by the City Planning Board in 1934 and 1935, physical housing characteristics were compiled, proposed public housing project sites were studied and the relative income and cost of different sections of the city were analyzed. The slums were found to be a heavy economic liability to the city. Although limited as a measurement of blight, 1950 U. S. Census of Housing figures, available by blocks, are the only recent data for the whole city. Boston's first public housing project was Old Harbor Village, built in 1938 under the Federal Government P. W. A. program. This project was built on an essentially vacant site in South Boston and most of the original tenants came from nearby substandard housing areas in South Boston and northern Dorchester. Zoning changes, designed as a protection from harmful land uses, were made in this area and several stores and a church have been attracted by the project. The three programs under which public housing {{has been built}} in Boston are; (1) Federally-aided for low-income families, (2) State-aided for low-income veterans and (3) City-State, sold to private individuals five years after construction. The U. S. Housing Acts of 1937 and 1949 that for all Federally-aided public housing units constructed, an equal number of slum dwellings be eliminated. The earliest projects were slum clearance projects located near downtown Boston. The State-aided and City-State legislations, passed soon after World War II, did not require slum clearance because of an acute housing shortage. Many of these, as well as some Federally-aided projects were built on vacant sites. In some cases, due to the lack of available vacant land in Boston and under the pressure of the housing shortage, vacant site projects were located on poorer quality land. City-owned land and private estates were sought for a number of housing projects in order that delays in assembling and clearing several parcels of land could be avoided. Of the several aspects of public housing distribution considered in this study, a sharp contrast between slum clearance and vacant site projects has been evident in respect to services; schools, public transportation and retail shopping. The lack of service availability has been most noticeable in projects located at the city is periphery; Orient Heights, Columbia Point and Fairmount. Both the Orient Heights and Fairmount projects have been primarily responsible for the recent construction of nearby elementary schools and the new Columbia Point School, built for the exclusive use of children from the Columbia Point Project, is not large enough. Another public school will be required for this project. Again, extensions of public transportation service have been necessary largely because of these three projects, and in the case of Columbia Point, a bus route was initiated solely for the project occupants. On the other <b>hand,</b> all slum <b>clearance</b> projects are well-served by public traasportation, in many instances by the surface and elevated routes that have strongly contributed to slum growth. Few stores, except for supermarkets, have been attracted by public housing projects. Only three stores have located adjacent to Columbia Point, the largest project in the city. The supermarket that serves Columbia Point is approximately 1400 feet from the project boundary and was built primarily for drive-in trade from Morrissey Boulevard. The most widely distributed store types within convenient walking distance from housing projects (taken as 600 feet) are grocery stores, drug stores and eating places. The most frequent store types within this distance are grocery stores, eating places and drinking places. A high percentage (up to 50 per cent in the case of the South St. Project) of the stores around several projects are vacant. Most of these vacancies are the result of overestimation of local markets, including housing projects, depopulation and successful competition of supermarkets. The percentage of registered Democratic voters in precincts containing housing projects is higher than the average for the city. In 1956, 85 per cent of all registered voters in Boston were Democrats; in housing projects approximately 95 per cent of the number of voters that could be determined were Democrats. In one ward, Ward IV, a slight Republican majority was changed to a slight Democratic majority primarily due to voters living in the Mission Hill Extension Project. Many projects, especially slum clearance projects, are not sufficiently protected by zoning restrictions from present and future intrusion of adjacent land uses harmful to the environment of the projects. Although most of the zoning changes and variances requested by the Boston Housing Authority have been granted, zoning restrictions have prevented the construction of several proposed vacant site housing projects. The location of a number of existing vacant site projects has depended on zoning changes. The proportion of younger people (under 21 years) is higher in public housing projects than in the city as a whole. Also high is the percentage of broken homes, often headed by females. Population density has even been increased over previously high densities in several slum clearance projects, especially the South End Project. This reflects expensive site acquisition in the slums. The assessed values of individual projects are extremely variable and there are no apparent factors accounting for the discrepancies. The per-dwelling-unit assessment in some projects is more than ten times that of others. The total effect of housing project construction in Boston has been to stabilize the centrifugal movement of population, since the median average distance of public housing dwelling units from the center of the city is approximately the same as all dwelling units in the city. The center of gravity of public housing distribution in the city has moved 1 1 / 2 miles to the southwest during the period 1940 to 1954, towards the largest amounts of vacant land. Formerly within a severely blighted area in the South End, the center is now located in Roxbury, south of the city's highest slum concentrations. The proportion of public housing to total housing is approximately 6 per cent in Boston, higher than in most other American cities. Most of the larger multi-family projects in the city are Federally-aided, while the smaller City-State temporary public housing projects usually consisted of two- and one-family houses. Except for the North and West Ends, projects have been well-distributed throughout the city. High land costs prevented the construction of projects in these two areas. The only probable construction of additional public housing in the city will be for low-income elderly individuals. As this would be a State-aided program, slum clearance would not be required and projects would be built on vacant sites. Eventually, public housing may also be built for low-income minority groups, perhaps Negroes. If built under a Federally-aided program, substandard housing sections in Roxbury or Dorchester would probably be chosen for sites. These are the areas of most recent Negro settlement in Boston and lower land values would permit slum clearance at a reasonable cost. Experimental forms of Federally-aided public housing in other parts of the country are small one- to four-faffiily projects on dispersed sites and the renovation of slum housing for use as public housing. Spreading slums and land scarcity would favor the latter approach to future public housing in Boston...|$|R
