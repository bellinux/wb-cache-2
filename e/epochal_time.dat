40|$|This 2013 East Central Writing Centers Association (ECWCA) Conference {{presentation}} draws {{a comparison}} between the notions of fungible and <b>epochal</b> <b>time</b> (cf. Geller, “Tick-Tock, Next”) and the classical rhetorical terms, chronos and kairos. While kairos is typically considered in terms of time, its roots suggest a fundamental physical sense, making it a rich concept for imagining both the temporality and the materiality of writing centers. In addition to tracing {{the meaning of the}} Greek word and considering some of the kairotic aspects of writing center work, this presentation advocates adopting a kairotic attitude among writing center practitioners, one that takes into account the most immediate of writing center constraints...|$|E
40|$|MatSeis's {{infrasound}} analysis tool, Infra Tool, uses frequency slowness processing to deconstruct {{the array}} data into three outputs per processing step: correlation, azimuth and slowness. Until now, an experienced analyst trained {{to recognize a}} pattern observed in outputs from signal processing manually accomplished infrasound signal detection. Our goal was to automate the process of infrasound signal detection. The critical aspect of infrasound signal detection is to identify consecutive processing steps where the azimuth is constant (flat) while the time-lag correlation of the windowed waveform is above background value. These two statements describe {{the arrival of a}} correlated set of wavefronts at an array. The Hough Transform and Inverse Slope methods are used to determine the representative slope for a specified number of azimuth data points. The representative slope is then used in conjunction with associated correlation value and azimuth data variance to determine if and when an infrasound signal was detected. A format for an infrasound signal detection output file is also proposed. The detection output file will list the processed array element names, followed by detection characteristics for each method. Each detection is supplied with a listing of frequency slowness processing characteristics: human time (YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS. SSS), <b>epochal</b> <b>time,</b> correlation, fstat, azimuth (deg) and trace velocity (km/s). As an example, a ground truth event was processed using the four-element DLIAR infrasound array located in New Mexico. The event is known as the Watusi chemical explosion, which occurred on 2002 / 09 / 28 at 21 : 25 : 17 with an explosive yield of 38, 000 lb TNT equivalent. Knowing the source and array location, the array-to-event distance was computed to be approximately 890 km. This test determined the station-to-event azimuth (281. 8 and 282. 1 degrees) to within 1. 6 and 1. 4 degrees for the Inverse Slope and Hough Transform detection algorithms, respectively, and the detection window closely correlated to the theoretical stratospheric arrival time. Further testing will be required for tuning of detection threshold parameters for different types of infrasound events...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of understanding processes {{that govern the}} hydroclimate of the Mediterranean Basin is highlighted by the projected significant drying of the region {{in response to the}} increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we study the long-term hydroclimatic variability of the central Levant region, situated in the eastern boundary of the Basin, as reveled by instrumental observations and the Holocene record of Dead Sea level variations. Observations of 19 th and 20 th century precipitation in the Dead Sea watershed region display a multidecadal, anti-phase relationship to North Atlantic (NAtl) sea surface temperature (SST) variability, such that when the NAtl is relatively cold, Jerusalem experiences higher than normal precipitation and vice versa. This association is underlined by a negative correlation to precipitation in the sub-Saharan Sahel and a positive correlation to precipitation in western North America, areas that are also affected by multidecadal NAtl SST variability. These observations are consistent with a broad range of Holocene hydroclimatic fluctuations from the epochal, to the millennial and centennial time scales, as displayed by the Dead Sea lake level, by lake levels in the Sahel, and by direct and indirect proxy indicators of NAtl SSTs. On the <b>epochal</b> <b>time</b> scale, the gradual cooling of NAtl SSTs throughout the Holocene in response to precession-driven reduction of summer insolation is associated with previously well-studied wet-to-dry transition in the Sahel and with a general increase in Dead Sea lake levels from low stands after the Younger Dryas to higher stands in the mid- to late-Holocene. On the millennial and centennial time scales there is also evidence for an anti-phase relationship between Holocene variations in the Dead Sea and Sahelian lake levels and with proxy indicators of NAtl SSTs. However the records are punctuated by abrupt lake-level drops, which appear to be in-phase and which occur during previously documented abrupt major cooling events in the Northern Hemisphere. We propose that the mechanisms by which NAtl SSTs affect precipitation in the central Levant is related to the tendency for high (low) pressure anomalies to persist over the eastern North Atlantic/Western Mediterranean region when the Basin is cold (warm). This, in turn, affects the likelihood of cold air outbreaks and cyclogenesis in the Eastern Mediterranean and, consequently, rainfall in the central Levant region. Depending on its phase, this natural mechanism can alleviate or exacerbate the anthropogenic impact on the regions' hydroclimatic future...|$|E
40|$|From {{the legacy}} of an {{original}} disciplinary approach, as the Dependence theory and its Marxian critics, or the neo-structural economic theory founded by The Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA), the Latin-American social sciences deny the Anglo-European centered approaches, {{in the way of}} reaffirming its own critical thinking, including the neo-colonial practices. The challenge for this critical thinking is to be, simultaneously, cosmopolitan and Latin American’s one. In this process, the Latin-American social thinking is regaining its own originality and its vigorous proposals, thanks to a rich south-south dialogue, that implies a global character of its reflections and the questioning of its universal references. Although neither classical nor western Marxism are hegemonic within critical theory, the (neo) Marxism enriched with criticism of the coloniality of power, the theory of World-System, critical geopolitics and political ecology recover the field of critical theory in key founder of an <b>epochal</b> thinking <b>time.</b> Epistemological debates with post-structuralism and postmodern approaches configure various recent developments in critical theor...|$|R
40|$|There {{are four}} conceptions of {{historical}} {{time in the}} modern era. In naturalistic cyclicity, traditional circular definitions of {{the rise and fall}} of nations predominate. Enlightenment rationalism is based on a more linear view of ineluctable political progress. In emancipatory revolution a social element is added to Enlightenment progressivism, accompanied by a denigration of the political. Finally, the antirevolutions of 1989 – 91 inaugurated a postrevolutionary phase characterized by the politics of krizis. These antirevolutions represented a conscious repudiation of the revolutionary style of politics. They made possible a return to naturalistic cyclicity. Krizis is a reflexive form of political action derived not from the <b>epochal</b> conceptualization of <b>time</b> characteristic of revolutionism but from solutions within politics itself...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of time in}} {{measuring}} group and team temporality constitutes more than a methodological issue—it is a theoretical question. That is, if group interaction is theorized as processual and processes occur through time, then research on team temporality, {{as well as a}} range of other issues, must grapple with the methodological implications of our theories. This article contributes to INGRoup’s aim to advance theory and methods for understanding groups by exploring methodological approaches that allow us to capture a variety of team processes over time. Three case studies address the practical issues involved with employing various types of time-sensitive data collection, time-dependent coding, and time-based analysis, including their advantages and disadvantages. Together, the authors describe diverse field and analytical methods useful for interrogating theoretical assumptions about time in groups. Doing so expands the notion of group temporality to consider the role of both <b>epochal</b> and fungible <b>times</b> at multiple stages of group research...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} I intend {{to show that}} certain aspects of A. N. Whitehead's {{philosophy}} of organism and especially his <b>epochal</b> theory of <b>time,</b> as mainly exposed in his well-known work Process and Reality, can serve in clarify the underlying assumptions that shape nonstandard mathematical theories as such and also as metatheories of quantum mechanics. Concerning the latter issue, I point to an already significant research on nonstandard versions of quantum mechanics; two of these approaches are chosen to be critically presented {{in relation to the}} scope of this work. The main point of the paper is that, insofar as we can refer a nonstandard mathematical entity to a kind of axiomatical formalization essentially 'codifying' an underlying mental process indescribable as such by analytic means, we can possibly apply certain principles of Whitehead's metaphysical scheme focused on the key notion of process which is generally conceived as the becoming of actual entities. This is done {{in the sense of a}} unifying approach to provide an interpretation of nonstandard mathematical theories as such and also, in their metatheoretical status, as a formalization of the empirical-experimental context of quantum mechanics...|$|R
40|$|While the {{question}} of survival of bodily death is usually approached {{by focusing on the}} mind/body relation (and often with the idea of the soul as a special kind of substance), this paper explores the issue in the context of our understanding of time. The argument of the paper is woven around the central intuition of time as an “ever-living present. ” The development of this intuition allows for a more integral or “complex-holistic” theory of time, the soul, and {{the question}} of survival. Following the introductory matter, the first section proposes a re-interpretation of Nietzsche’s doctrine of eternal recurrence in terms of moments and lives as “eternally occurring. ” The next section is a treatment of Julian Barbour’s neo-Machian model of instants of time as configurations in the n-dimensional phase-space he calls “Platonia. ” While rejecting his claim to have done away with time, I do find his model suggestive of the idea of moments and lives as eternally occurring. The following section begins with Fechner’s visionary ideas {{of the nature of the}} soul and its survival of bodily death, with particular attention to the notion of holonic inclusion and the central analogy of the transition from perception to memory. I turn next to Whitehead’s equally holonic notions of prehension and the concrescence of actual occasions. From his <b>epochal</b> theory of <b>time</b> and certain ambiguities in his reflections on the “divine antinomies,” we are brought to the threshold of a potentially more integral or “complex-holistic” theory of time and survival, which is treated in the last section. This section draws from my earlier work on Hegel, Jung, and Edgar Morin, as well as from key insights of Jean Gebser, for an interpretation of Sri Aurobindo’s inspired but cryptic description of the “Supramental Time Vision. ” This interpretation leads to an alternative understanding of reincarnation—and to the possibility of its reconciliation with the once-only view of life and its corresponding version of immortality—along with the idea of a holonic scale of selves leading from individual personality as we normally experience it, through a kind of angelic self (a reinterpreted “Jivatma”), and ultimately to the Godhead as the Absolute Self. Of greater moment than such a speculative ontology, however, is the integral or complex-holistic way of thinking and imagining that is called for by this kind of inquiry...|$|R
