5|$|In 1895, he {{published}} The Rules of Sociological Method, a manifesto stating what sociology {{is and how}} <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, and founded the first European department {{of sociology at the}} University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{motivation}} for paraconsistent logic is {{the conviction that}} <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possible to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and discriminating way. The principle of explosion precludes this, and so must be abandoned. In non-paraconsistent logics, {{there is only one}} inconsistent theory: the trivial theory that has every sentence as a theorem. Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them.|$|E
25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E

25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that homosexuality was non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical {{question of whether}} <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition {{of the difficulty of}} achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|E
25|$|With the {{southern}} moorland, {{the coast and}} the river, Tees-side has a splendid setting and <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made worthy of its 400,000 inhabitants. This task requires a comprehensive plan for the whole area designed to secure the benefit of its port, its industries and its commerce, the reclamation of its marshlands, the building of new roads and bridges, the renewal of obsolete parts of the old riverside development, the designing of new centres {{and the provision of}} new amenities. This formidable task gives scope not for ten authorities to develop or redevelop ten towns but for a single authority to work out the details of the probable future growth and needs of Tees-side, and then prepare and carry out a single plan for the whole area.|$|E
25|$|Grattan {{supported}} the veto, {{but a more}} radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland {{under the leadership of}} Daniel O'Connell, and Grattan's influence gradually declined. He seldom spoke in Parliament after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the Whigs and {{supported the}} final struggle against Napoléon. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, {{and at the same time}} the equable quality, of Grattan's character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered, as {{a comment}} on the {{unfavourable}} description by Jean de La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere's chief literary enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered {{that one of the}} chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine's attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon le bonhomme or le bon (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n'effaceront pas le bonhomme. They have not.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the Financial Services Authority had a {{moratorium}} on short selling 29 leading financial stocks, effective from 2300 GMT, 19 September 2008 until 16 January 2009. After the ban was lifted, John McFall, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, House of Commons, made clear in public statements and {{a letter to the}} FSA that he believed <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended. Between 19 and 21 September 2008, Australia temporarily banned short selling, and later placed an indefinite ban on naked short selling. Australia's ban on short selling was further extended for another 28 days on 21 October 2008. Also during September 2008, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Canada banned short selling leading financial stocks, and France, the Netherlands and Belgium banned naked short selling leading financial stocks. By contrast with the approach taken by other countries, Chinese regulators responded by allowing short selling, along with a package of other market reforms.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine; it {{contained}} a recommendation that Jerusalem be placed under a special international regime, a corpus separatum, {{administered by the}} United Nations and be separate from both the Jewish and Arab states envisioned. Following the conflict that ensued, cease-fires and the 1949 Armistice Agreements were negotiated and accepted by both sides. One of these resulted, in part, in a temporary division of Jerusalem. The relevant Armistice Agreement with Jordan was signed on April 3, 1949, but it was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of {{the provisions of the}} partition resolution for the internationalization of Jerusalem. On April 25, 1949, King Abdullah officially changed the name of Transjordan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He had secured the support of Great Britain (albeit qualified—Great Britain did not recognize the incorporation of East Jerusalem, maintaining that <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a corpus separatum, an international enclave).|$|E

500|$|Collective action {{should be}} {{restricted}} to two domains. First, it {{should be used to}} treat problems that are primarily [...] "geographical", which include issues of sanitation, transportation, electricity, and external threats. Second, <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used when a kind of individual freedom poses a major threat to public order; for instance, speech that incites the breaking of law (Russell 1938:227–228). The exception to this rule is when there is a minority which densely populates a certain well-defined area, in which case, political devolution is preferable.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineers}} who programmed the Apollo training simulator {{had a difficult}} time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, [...] "We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> We felt like we could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first manned Apollo mission." [...] NASA pressed on, and mid-January 1967, preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012.|$|E

500|$|The critic Johan Henric Kellgren, in his {{introduction}} to the first edition, found that the songs could not be known fully only as poems. Never before, he stated, had the art of poetry and the art of music been more fraternally united. They were not, Kellgren argued, verse that had been set to music; not music, set to verse; but the two were so thoroughly melted together into One beauty {{that it was impossible to}} see which would most miss the other for its fulfilment. Quoting this in the final paragraph of his thesis, the musicologist James Massengale commented [...] "That is how <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Play" [...] was {{acclaimed}} by Swedish music critics. Aftonbladet Fredrik Virtanen felt <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an international}} hit {{due to its}} catchiness. Similarly, Mattias Dahlström of Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter deemed the single an [...] "obvious" [...] success. The single fared moderately in Sweden; it debuted at number 53 on the Sverigetopplistan chart on 22 July 1999. The next week, it ascended to number 34 before reaching its peak position at number 31 in its third week. The single became Robyn's seventh consecutive top 40 entry on the chart, but failed to match the success of My Truth lead single [...] "Electric", which peaked at number 6. [...] "Play" [...] remained on the chart for seven weeks before falling off.|$|E
500|$|Cheney {{maintained}} a visible public profile after leaving office, being especially critical of Obama administration policies on national security. In May 2009, Cheney {{spoke of his}} support for same-sex marriage, {{becoming one of the}} most prominent Republican politicians to do so. Speaking to the National Press Club, Cheney stated: [...] "People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish. I do believe, historically, the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level. It's always been a state issue, and I think that's the way <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> handled today." [...] In 2012, Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same-sex marriage in that state.|$|E

500|$|Washington's loss at Philadelphia {{prompted}} {{some members}} of Congress to consider removing Washington from command. This movement termed the Conway Cabal, failed after Washington's supporters rallied behind him. Biographer Alden relates, [...] "it was inevitable that the defeats of Washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared." [...] The zealous admiration of Washington indeed inevitably waned. John Adams was never {{a fan of the}} southern delegation to the Continental Congress, and he wrote that [...] "Congress will appoint a thanksgiving; and one cause of <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that the glory of turning the tide of arms is not immediately due to the commander-in-chief nor to southern troops. If it had been, idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded.... Now we can allow a certain citizen to be wise, virtuous, and good, without thinking him a deity or a savior." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals convinced me [...] it wasn't something I wanted {{to be doing a}} lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} year of Thutmose's reign, the king cut a stele at Tombos, which records that he built a {{fortress}} at Tombos, near the third cataract, thus permanently extending the Egyptian military presence, which had previously stopped at Buhen, at the second cataract. This indicates that he already fought a campaign in Syria; hence, his Syrian campaign may be placed {{at the beginning of his}} second regnal year. [...] This second campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned. Although it has not been found in modern times, he apparently set up a stele when he crossed the Euphrates River. During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared allegiance to Thutmose. However, after he returned, they discontinued tribute and began fortifying against future incursions. Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of Niy, near Apamea in Syria, and returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates, [...] "that inverted water which flows upstream when <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flowing downstream." [...] The Euphrates was the first major river which the Egyptians had ever encountered which flowed from the north, which was downstream on the Nile, to the south, which was upstream on the Nile. Thus the river became known in Egypt as simply, [...] "inverted water." ...|$|E
