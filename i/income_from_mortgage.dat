5000|$|Accounts at savings {{banks were}} insured by the FDIC. When the Western Savings Bank of Philadelphia failed in 1982, {{it was the}} FDIC that {{arranged}} its absorption into the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS). Savings banks were limited by law to only offer savings accounts and to make their <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>mortgages</b> and student loans. Savings banks could pay one-third of 1% higher interest on savings than could a commercial bank. PSFS circumvented this by offering [...] "payment order" [...] accounts which functioned as checking accounts and were processed through the Fidelity Bank of Pennsylvania. The rules were loosened so that savings banks could offer automobile loans, credit cards, and actual checking accounts. In time PSFS became a full commercial bank.|$|R

50|$|Blackrod Grammar School {{was founded}} by John Holmes, a London weaver, in whose will of 1568 rental <b>income</b> <b>from</b> {{property}} in London was left to trustees to pay a schoolmaster in Blackrod, and a further legacy of rental income paid for a scholar to attend Pembroke College, Cambridge. Henry Norris's legacy in 1639 was left in trust to pay a schoolmaster. It is not known where the school started, possibly in St Katharine's Church but premises were later provided near the church. In 1627 Elizabeth Tyldesley left rental <b>income</b> <b>from</b> land and property at Graveoak in Bedford to provide a free school in the county of Lancashire. Her trustees decided to benefit Blackrod in 1631. <b>Income</b> <b>from</b> the trust paid the schoolmaster from 1640. No scholars went to Pembroke College for many years before 1766 or up to 1790 and funds built up with interest. In 1790 agreements with Lord Lindsay of Haigh Hall brought in further income. By 1807 the trustees had accrued a significant sum to which in 1812 John Ainscough left a legacy including the <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>mortgages</b> on a toll road between Wigan to Preston. The old school, converted into a house was rented to Richard Bury after a new school was built in 1798. Accounts provided for the charity commissioners show the school was well funded in 1828.|$|R

25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits will typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} interest <b>income</b> <b>from</b> its <b>mortgage</b> portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that {{the savings and loan crisis}} was in part caused by this problem, that the savings and loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|R
50|$|When Jefferson Davis and {{his family}} visited the {{property}} after his release from prison in 1867 they found the fields neglected and the house unlivable. Joseph Davis, who had never given Jefferson Davis title to the property, negotiated its sale after the war on a mortgage {{to members of the}} Montgomery family, former Davis family slaves, bequeathing the <b>income</b> <b>from</b> the <b>mortgage,</b> but not the real estate, to Jefferson in his will. The Montgomery family defaulted on the mortgage after Joseph Davis's death and the property reverted to his estate. The heirs to Joseph Davis's Hurricane plantation (his grandchildren by an acknowledged illegitimate daughter) claimed ownership of the reverted Brierfield as well, a claim disputed by Jefferson Davis, resulting in a lengthy lawsuit that was ultimately decided in Jefferson Davis's favor in 1881, giving him undisputed title to the Brierfield property for the first time more than forty years after he first settled the plantation.|$|R
40|$|The new {{knowledge}} economies have highlighted t he importance of intellectual capital (IC) and the imperative need {{to measure and}} manage their associated costs and benefits. Banks and financial institutions, which are rich in IC (human, customer, and social capital), {{are in danger of}} becoming subject to ‘IC walkouts’ if they resist accounting for the hidden value that exists in IC and its constituent elements. This paper discusses how New Zealand banks incur the cost of acquiring IC and realize the need to recognize related cost drivers. For banks in New Zealand, {{one of the most important}} sources of revenue or interest <b>income</b> is <b>from</b> <b>mortgage</b> business. This investigation looks at the value added by mobile mortgage managers (MMMs) and a possible model for measuring the IC vested in MMMs. Some of the issues and concerns explored should be of importance to accounting (management) academics. A number of potential problems that are identified suggest the need for more diversified research to develop an effective model for IC valuation that includes social networking and political underpinnings, in this age of globalization and value creatio...|$|R

Even though this hypothesis has often been discussed, formal {{evidence in support of}} it is rare. We use individual level, monthly, bank account data to examine how expected <b>income</b> shocks <b>from</b> final <b>mortgage</b> payments impact credit card consumption, and the repayment of credit card debt. Our data allows us to identify the exact magnitude and date of final mortgage payments, and also to exploit the random timing of these expected income shocks across individuals. Our results are consistent with the magnitude hypothesis. JEL Classification:credit card, final mortgage payment, income shocks, monthly mortgage account...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the subprime mortgage crisis on urban neighborhoods in Massachusetts. We explore the topic using a data set that matches race and <b>income</b> information <b>from</b> Home <b>Mortgage</b> Disclosure Act data with property-level, transaction data from Massachusetts Registry of Deeds offices. With these data, we show that much of the subprime lending in the state was concentrated in urban neighborhoods and that minority homeownerships created with subprime mortgages have proved exceptionally unstable in the face of rapid price declines. The evidence in Massachusetts suggests that subprime lending did not, as commonly believed, lead to a substantial increase in homeownership by minorities but instead generated turnover in properties owned by minority residents. Furthermore, we argue that the particularly dire foreclosure situation in urban neighborhoods actually makes it somewhat easier for policymakers to provide remedies.

A number of areas where further enhancements could be made are highlighted. The paper also examines the interrelationship between central bank management of short-term interest rates and domestic currency liquidity, and development of the wider money and bond markets; and suggests some lessons from the recent crisis in developed country financial markets which may be important for the future development of the ASEAN 5 markets.
