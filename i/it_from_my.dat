500|$|Early in {{the autumn}} of 1908, Potter wrote her {{publisher}} Harold Warne that she had several ideas for new books. She sent him the text of The Faithful Dove, a tale set in Rye she had composed years earlier and for which she had produced a group of sketches. With it, she included a sequel to The Tale of Benjamin Bunny starring Benjamin's offspring, The Flopsy Bunnies. Though she had complained at times that the rabbit characters had become [...] "wearisome", she had written a young fan, William Warner, that children liked her rabbits best and that she ought to write another rabbit book. The third tale she sent Warne was about the village shop in Sawrey. [...] "I should like to get rid of one of them," [...] she wrote Warne about her story ideas, [...] "When a thing is once printed I dismiss <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> dreams! & don't care what becomes of the reviewers. But an accumulation of half finished ideas is bothersome." [...] The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and the story about the shop (eventually The Tale of Ginger and Pickles) were chosen for publication in 1909. [...] The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies was finished in March 1909 and published in July of the same year.|$|E
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E
2500|$|Shankar later {{recalled}} {{of the moment}} he composed [...] "I Am Missing You": [...] "I don't know how I did it, but one day I wrote an English song without thinking …" [...] He played the composition to his friend, ex-Beatle George Harrison, who liked it immediately. Harrison told British DJ Nicky Horne in August 1974: [...] "It just blew my mind, because I heard <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> pop background. I said , 'That's a hit … It's a lovely song – you should write more of these, Ravi.' And he said, 'Oh, you know, I've been trying not to write these for years.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{party leaders}} {{rejected}} {{the idea that they}} are ruled by ideology alone. Former party leader Michael McDowell has said that he sees liberalism as not being on the left-right spectrum as it is a mix of the ideals of both. Mary Harney, on becoming health minister said [...] "I don't get my politics from any ideology, I get <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> experience and common sense". [...] Yet Harney was a controversial minister who attempted to extend private influence in the health service and McDowell's campaign in the general election included particularly strong attacks on Irish left-wing parties.|$|E
