50|$|The Liberal Unionists {{owe their}} origins to the {{conversion}} of William Ewart Gladstone {{to the cause of}} Irish Home Rule (<b>i.e.</b> limited self-government <b>for</b> <b>Ireland).</b> The 1885 General Election had left Charles Stewart Parnell's Irish Nationalists holding the balance of power, and had convinced Gladstone that the Irish wanted and deserved Home Rule. Some Liberals believed that Gladstone's Home Rule bill would lead to independence <b>for</b> <b>Ireland</b> and the dissolution of the United Kingdom, which they could not countenance. Seeing themselves as defenders of the Union, they called themselves 'Liberal Unionists' though at this stage most of them did not think {{it was going to be}} a permanent split from their former colleagues. Gladstone preferred to call them 'dissentient Liberals' as if he believed they would eventually come back like the 'Adullamites', Liberals who had opposed the extension of the franchise in 1866 but had mostly come back to the main party after the Conservatives had passed their own electoral reform bill in 1867. In the end it did not matter what the Liberal Unionists were called, the schism in the Liberal party grew wider and deeper within a few years.|$|R
