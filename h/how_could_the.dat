The government also claimed that the law did not permit payment to be made between the announcement of the tax sale and the date of the sale if the government were the purchaser.

25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs.

The crowd is confused. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song?

25|$|Nyastadaṇḍam (Sanskrit: न्यस्तदण्डम्). While Paraśurāma {{is on his}} pilgrimage, Sahasrārjuna's sons – the Haihaya princes, {{attack the}} Āśrama of Jamadagni to avenge their father's killing. The princes run down {{everything}} and everybody that comes their way. Jamadagni is in deep meditation when he is beheaded by the princes, who take his severed head with them to Māhiṣmatī. When Paraśurāma returns, he sees the Āśrama strewn with corpses. He then sees an inconsolable Reṇukā crying near the torso of Jamadagni. When Reṇukā sees Paraśurāma, she beats her chest 21 times saying <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> Haihaya kings kill her husband with Paraśurāma still alive. Paraśurāma places Jamadagni's torso in a boat filled with oil and asks Reṇukā to protect his father's body till he is back. The enraged Paraśurāma goes to Māhiṣmatī all alone and calls out to the Haihayas. He kills their entire army and annihilates the Haihaya race. He then brings back Jamadagni's severed head and attaches it to the torso. Jamadagni is resurrected. Paraśurāma annihilates the race of Kṣatriyas 21 times from the earth, leaving out the dynasties of Raghu and Yadu. After killing 12,000 kings, Paraśurāma creates five huge lakes of blood in Kurukṣetra. Finally, on {{the request of the}} sage Kaśyapa, Paraśurāma gives up anger and gives all the lands on the earth to Kaśyapa. He then goes to the Mahendra mountain to perform penance.|$|E

500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E
500|$|The Raft of the Medusa {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1819 Paris Salon, under the title Scène de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene), {{although}} its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers. The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. Géricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: [...] "It strikes and attracts all eyes" [...] (Le Journal de Paris). Louis XVIII visited {{three days before the}} opening and said: [...] "", or [...] "Monsieur Géricault, you've painted a shipwreck, but it's not one for you". The critics were divided: the horror and [...] "terribilità" [...] of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a [...] "pile of corpses", whose realism they considered {{a far cry from the}} [...] "ideal beauty" [...] represented by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea, which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: [...] "Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." [...] The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: [...] "our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa".|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{also argues}} that one couldn't {{possibly}} use {{the words of a}} private language. He invites the reader to consider a case in which someone decides that each time she has a particular sensation she will place a sign S in a diary. Wittgenstein points out that in such a case one could have no criteria for the correctness of one's use of S. Again, several examples are considered. One is that perhaps using S involves mentally consulting a table of sensations, to check that one has associated S correctly; but in this case, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> mental table be checked for its correctness? It is [...] "s if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true", as Wittgenstein puts it. One common interpretation of the argument is that while one may have direct or privileged access to one's current mental states, there is no such infallible access to identifying previous mental states that one had in the past. [...] That is, the only way to check to see if one has applied the symbol S correctly to a certain mental state is to introspect and determine whether the current sensation is identical to the sensation previously associated with S. [...] And while identifying one's current mental state of remembering may be infallible, whether one remembered correctly is not infallible. Thus, for a language to be used at all it must have some public criterion of identity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{school of}} Rabbi Yannai {{interpreted}} the place name Di-zahab (...) in [...] {{to refer to}} one of the Israelites' sins that Moses recounted in the opening of his address. The school of Rabbi Yannai deduced from the word Di-zahab that Moses spoke insolently towards heaven.

They said in the school of Rabbi Yannai that a lion does not roar with excitement over a basket of straw but over a basket of meat. Rabbi Oshaia likened it to the case of a man who had a lean but large-limbed cow. The man gave the cow good feed to eat and the cow started kicking him. The man deduced that it was feeding the cow good feed that caused the cow to kick him. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba likened it to the case of a man who had a son and bathed him, anointed him, gave him plenty to eat and drink, hung a purse round his neck, and set him down at the door of a brothel. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> boy help sinning?

2500|$|The Liberals {{lost the}} federal {{election}} of May 1979 to a minority Conservative government led by Joe Clark. When Pierre Trudeau regained power in February 1980, he appointed Chrétien Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In this role, he was {{a major force in}} the 1980 Quebec referendum, being one of the main federal representatives [...] "on the ground" [...] during the campaign. His fiery and emotional speeches would enthrall federalist crowds with his blunt warnings of the consequences of separation. During the 1980 referendum, Chrétien fiercely fought behind the scenes with the leader of the Quebec Liberals, Claude Ryan, who served as the chairman of the non committee about the best course to follow, with Ryan favoring a more Quebec nationalist message as opposed to Chrétien's unabashed Canadian nationalist message. In his speeches, Chrétien boosted the first white men to see the Prairies and the Rocky mountains had been the French-Canadian voyaguers and Coureur des bois in the 17th and 18th centuries, saying the Rockies and the Great Plains were part of French Canada's heritage, and asked <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>the</b> Québécois ever give up their heritage. Chrétien praised the great French fur traders like Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Médard des Groseilliers, and La Vérendrye who ventured west, saying what they had found belonged to all of French Canada, and often ended his speeches with the remark [...] "I want them [...] for my children and grandchildren!", which frequently brought his audiences to tears. Chrétien delivered an average of 6 or 7 speeches a day during the 1980 referendum all across Quebec and always managed to work in a local reference in every speech.|$|E
