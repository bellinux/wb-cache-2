40|$|A {{molecular}} triad {{consisting of}} a porphyrin (P) covalently linked to two photochromes - one from the dihydroindolizine family (DHI) and one from the dihydropyrene family (DHP) - has been synthesized and found to act as either a molecular AND logic gate or an <b>INHIBIT</b> <b>gate,</b> depending on the inputs and initial state of the photochromes. The basis of these functions is quenching of porphyrin fluorescence (output of the gates) by the photochromes. The spiro form of DHI does not quench porphyrin fluorescence, whereas its betaine isomer strongly quenches by photoinduced electron transfer. DHP also quenches porphyrin fluorescence, but its cyclophanediene isomer does not. The triad has been designed using suitable energetics and electronic interactions, so that although these quenching phenomena may be observed, independent isomerization of the attached photochromes still occurs.

Although the sensors {{are thought to be}} channels, relatively little is known about eukaryotic mechanosensitive channels or their molecular mechanisms. Thus, because of its tractable nature, a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that serves as an in vivo osmotic “emergency release valve,” MscL, has become a paradigm of how a mechanosensitive channel can sense and respond to membrane tension. Here, we have determined the structural rearrangements and interactions between transmembrane domains of MscL that occur upon gating. We utilize an electrostatic repulsion test: If two residues approach upon gating we predicted that substituting like-charges at those sites would <b>inhibit</b> <b>gating.</b> The in vivo growth and viability and in vitro vesicular flux and electrophysiological data all support the hypothesis that residues G 26 and I 92 directly interact upon gating. The resulting model predicted other interacting residues.

A quite simple, achiral benzo- 21 -crown- 7 -substituted bis(urea) low-molecular weight gelator hierarchically assembles into helical fibrils, which further develop into bundles and finally form a stable gel in acetonitrile. The gel–sol transition can be controlled by three different molecular recognition events: K+ binding to the crown ethers, pseudorotaxane formation with secondary ammonium ions and Cl− binding to the urea units. Addition of a cryptand that scavenges the K+ ions and Ag+ addition to remove the chloride and bases/acids, which mediate pseudorotaxane formation, can reverse this process. With the gelator, and these chemical stimuli, {{a number of different}} systems can be designed that behave as logic gates. Depending on the choice of components, OR, AND, XOR, NOT, NOR, XNOR and <b>INHIBIT</b> <b>gates</b> have been realized. Thus, the gel–sol transition as a property of the system as a whole is influenced in a complex manner.

40|$|The efferent {{synaptic}} specialization of {{hair cells}} includes a near-membrane synaptic cistern, whose presence suggests {{a role for}} internal calcium stores in cholinergic inhibition. Calcium release channels from internal stores include ‘ryanodine receptors’, whose participation is usually demonstrated by sensitivity to the eponymous plant alkaloid, ryanodine. However, use of this and other store-active compounds on hair cells could be confounded by the unusual pharmacology of the α 9 α 10 -containing hair cell nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR), which {{has been shown to}} be antagonized by a broad spectrum of compounds. Surprisingly, we found that ryanodine, rather than antagonizing, is a positive modulator of the α 9 α 10 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the first such compound to be found. The effect of ryanodine was to increase the apparent affinity and efficacy for acetylcholine (ACh). Correspondingly, ACh-evoked currents through the isolated cholinergic receptors of inner hair cells in excised mouse cochleas were approximately doubled by 200  μM ryanodine, a concentration that <b>inhibits</b> <b>gating</b> of the ryanodine receptor itself. This unusual positive modulation was not unique to the mammalian receptor. The response to ACh of chicken ‘short’ hair cells likewise was enhanced in the presence of 100  μM ryanodine. This facilitatory effect on current through the AChR could enhance brief (∼ 1  s) activation of associated calcium-dependent K+ (SK) channels in both chicken short hair cells and rat outer hair cells.

40|$|Rod {{photoreceptor}} cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) {{channels are}} modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Rod CNG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes {{are associated with}} constitutively active protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases that decrease and increase, respectively, the apparent affinity of the channels for cGMP. Here, we {{examine the effects of}} genistein, a competitive inhibitor of the ATP binding site, on PTKs. Like other PTK inhibitors (lavendustin A and erbstatin), cytoplasmic application of genistein prevents changes in the cGMP sensitivity that are attributable to tyrosine phosphorylation of the CNG channels. However, unlike these other inhibitors, genistein also slows the activation kinetics and reduces the maximal current through CNG channels at saturating cGMP. These effects occur in the absence of ATP, indicating that they do not involve inhibition of a phosphorylation event, but rather involve an allosteric effect of genistein on CNG channel gating. This could result from direct binding of genistein to the channel; however, the time course of inhibition is surprisingly slow (> 30 s), raising the possibility that genistein exerts its effects indirectly. In support of this hypothesis, we find that ligands that selectively bind to PTKs without directly binding to the CNG channel can nonetheless decrease the effect of genistein. Thus, ATP and a nonhydrolyzable ATP derivative competitively inhibit the effect of genistein on the channel. Moreover, erbstatin, an inhibitor of PTKs, can noncompetitively inhibit the effect of genistein. Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the rod CNG channel catalyzed by PTKs, genistein triggers a noncatalytic interaction between the PTK and the channel that allosterically <b>inhibits</b> <b>gating...</b>|$|R

To investigate the role of the three outermost arginine amino acid residues in segment 4 domain IV (R 1, R 2, R 3) in <b>gating</b> charge <b>inhibited</b> by site- 3 toxins, we recorded ionic and gating currents from human heart Na channels with mutations of the outermost arginines (R 1 C, R 1 Q, R 2 C, and R 3 C) expressed in fused, mammalian tsA 201 cells. All four mutations had ionic currents that activated over the same voltage range with slope factors of their peak conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships similar to those of wild-type channels, although decay of INa was slowest for R 1 C and R 1 Q mutant channels and fastest for R 3 C mutant channels. After Na channel modification by Ap-A toxin, decays of INa were slowed to similar values for all four channel mutants. Toxin modification produced a graded effect on gating charge (Q) of mutant channels, reducing Qmax by 12 % for the R 1 C and R 1 Q mutants, by 22 % for the R 2 C mutant, and by 27 % for the R 3 C mutant, only slightly less than the 31 % reduction seen for wild-type currents. Consistent with these findings, the relationship of Qmax to Gmax was significantly shallower for R 1 mutants than for R 2 C and R 3 C mutant Na channels. These data suggest that site- 3 toxins primarily <b>inhibit</b> <b>gating</b> charge associated with movement of the S 4 in domain IV, and that the outermost arginine contributes the largest amount to channel gating, with other arginines contributing less...|$|R

40|$|TRPM 2 is a Ca 2 +-permeable nonselective cation {{channel that}} plays {{important}} roles in oxidative stress–mediated cell death and inflammation processes. However, how TRPM 2 is regulated under physiological and pathological conditions is not fully understood. Here, we report that both intracellular and extracellular protons block TRPM 2 by <b>inhibiting</b> channel <b>gating.</b> We demonstrate that external protons block TRPM 2 with an IC 50 of pHo = 5. 3, whereas internal protons inhibit TRPM 2 with an IC 50 of pHi = 6. 7. Extracellular protons inhibit TRPM 2 by decreasing single-channel conductance. We identify three titratable residues, H 958, D 964, and E 994, at the outer vestibule of the channel pore {{that are responsible for}} pHo sensitivity. Mutations of these residues reduce single-channel conductance, decrease external Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]o) affinity, and inhibit [Ca 2 +]o-mediated TRPM 2 gating. These results support the following model: titration of H 958, D 964, and E 994 by external protons <b>inhibits</b> TRPM 2 <b>gating</b> by causing conformation change of the channel, and/or by decreasing local Ca 2 + concentration at the outer vestibule, therefore reducing [Ca 2 +]o permeation and inhibiting [Ca 2 +]o-mediated TRPM 2 gating. We find that intracellular protons inhibit TRPM 2 by inducing channel closure without changing channel conductance. We identify that D 933 located at the C terminus of the S 4 -S 5 linker is responsible for intracellular pH sensitivity. Replacement of Asp 933 by Asn 933 changes the IC 50 from pHi = 6. 7 to pHi = 5. 5. Moreover, substitution of Asp 933 with various residues produces marked changes in proton sensitivity, intracellular ADP ribose/Ca 2 + sensitivity, and gating profiles of TRPM 2. These results indicate that D 933 is not only essential for intracellular pH sensitivity, but it is also crucial for TRPM 2 channel gating. Collectively, our findings provide a novel mechanism for TRPM 2 modulation as well as molecular determinants for pH regulation of TRPM 2.

Such a function is called integrated logic and is exemplified by the BODIPY-based, half-subtractor logic gate illustrated by A. Coskun, E. U. Akkaya and their colleagues (as shown below). When monitored at two different wavelengths, 565 and 660 nm, XOR and <b>INHIBIT</b> logic <b>gates</b> are obtained at the respective wavelengths. Optical studies of this compound in THF reveal an absorbance peak at 565 nm and an emission peak at 660 nm. Addition of an acid results in a hypsochromic shift of both peaks as protonation of the tertiary amine results in an internal charge transfer. The colour of the emission observed is yellow. Upon addition of a strong base, the phenolic hydroxyl group is rendered deprotonated, resulting in a photoinduced electron transfer, which in turn renders the molecule non-emissive. Upon addition of both an acid and a base, the emission of the molecule is observed as red, as the tertiary amine would not be protonated while the hydroxyl group would remain protonated resulting {{in the absence of}} both PET and ICT.

Native CNG channels are heteromers, containing β as well as α subunits. To determine the contributions of α and β subunits to genistein inhibition, we compared the effect of genistein on native, homomeric (RETα and OLFα), and heteromeric (RETα+β, OLFα+β, and OLFα+RETβ) CNG channels. We found that genistein only inhibits channels that contain either the RETα or the OLFβ subunits.

Currents measured with 20 mM lumenal Ca 2 + as exclusive charge carrier were 4. 00 and 4. 07 pA, respectively, and not significantly different. Currents recorded at 1 – 30 mM lumenal Ca 2 + concentrations were attenuated by physiological [K+] (150 mM) and [Mg 2 +] (1 mM), in the same proportion (∼ 55 %) in mammalian and amphibian channels. Two amplitudes, differing by ∼ 35 %, were found in amphibian channel studies, probably corresponding to α and β RyR isoforms. In physiological [Mg 2 +], [K+], and lumenal [Ca 2 +] (1 mM), the Ca 2 + current was just less than 0. 5 pA. Comparison of this value with the Ca 2 + flux underlying Ca 2 + sparks suggests that sparks in mammalian cardiac and amphibian skeletal muscles are generated by opening of multiple RyR channels. Further, symmetric high concentrations of Mg 2 + substantially reduced the current carried by 10 mM Ca 2 + (∼ 40 % at 10 mM Mg 2 +), suggesting that high Mg 2 + may make sparks smaller by both <b>inhibiting</b> RyR <b>gating</b> and reducing unitary current...|$|R

Reduction of endogenous KCNE 1 or KCNE 3 expression by siRNA silencing, significantly increased macroscopic Kv 12. 2 currents in Xenopus oocytes by around 4 -fold. Interestingly, an almost 9 -fold increase in Kv 12. 2 currents was observed with the dual injection of KCNE 1 and KCNE 3 siRNA, suggesting an additive effect. Consistent with these findings, over-expression of KCNE 1 and/or KCNE 3 suppressed Kv 12. 2 currents. Membrane surface biotinylation assays showed that surface expression of Kv 12. 2 was significantly increased by KCNE 1 and KCNE 3 siRNA, whereas total protein expression of Kv 12. 2 was not affected.

The nAcChoR was purified and reconstituted from the electroplaques of Torpedo nobiliana, using affinity column chromatography, into bilayers of defined composition and the function of each sample assessed and compared with those of the native receptor. Investigation of the effect of bilayer composition upon the kinetics of agonist binding to the nAcChoR, using the fluorescent acetylcholine analogue, Dns-C 6 -Cho, established that the receptor pre-existed in equilibrium between the resting and two desensitised states. However, Dns-C 6 -Cho <b>inhibited</b> channel <b>gating</b> at high concentrations and another fluorescent probe was sought. The kinetics of carbachol induced nAcChoR conformational changes, reported by ethidium bromide (a non-competitive inhibitor) fluorescence, in native membranes were characterised and an assay developed to investigate whether cholesterol mediated rapid conformational changes in reconstituted samples. It was found that ethidium bromide reported on the carbachol-induced development of the fast desensitised state from the open channel state, and that this conformational change was sensitive to changes in bilayer composition. The onset of fast desensitisation from the open channel state was not observed when the receptor was reconstituted into DOPC or DOPC-DOPA bilayers. However, increasing the cholesterol content in these bilayers increased the amplitude of the component reporting this conformational change, while the observed rate at which it occurred was independent of bilayer cholesterol content. This result agrees with the suggestion that cholesterol facilitates channel opening and the onset of fast desensitisation by binding to specific sites on the nAcChoR and that these must be occupied for a functionally viable receptor (Jones and McNamee, 1988). </p...|$|R

M. contributed {{equally to}} this work * - Prion {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} the conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) to toxic β-sheet isoforms (PrP(Sc)), which are reported to inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Accordingly, UPS substrates accumulate in prion-infected mouse brains, suggesting impairment of the 26 S proteasome. A direct interaction between its 20 S core particle and PrP isoforms was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. β-PrP aggregates associated with the 20 S particle, but did not impede binding of the PA 26 complex, suggesting that the aggregates do not bind to its ends. Aggregated β-PrP reduced the 20 S proteasome's basal peptidase activity, and the enhanced activity induced by C-terminal peptides from the 19 S ATPases or by the 19 S regulator itself, including when stimulated by polyubiquitin conjugates. However, the 20 S proteasome was not <b>inhibited</b> when the <b>gate</b> in the α-ring was open due to a truncation mutation or by association with PA 26 /PA 28. These PrP aggregates inhibit by stabilising the closed conformation of the substrate entry channel. A similar inhibition of substrate entry into the proteasome may occur in other neurodegenerative diseases where misfolded β-sheet-rich proteins accumulate...|$|R
40|$|Arachidonic acid (AA) {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} of several different voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels by an unknown mechanism at an unknown site. The Ca 2 + channel pore-forming subunit (CaVα 1) {{is a candidate for}} the site of AA inhibition because T-type Ca 2 + channels, which do not require accessory subunits for expression, are inhibited by AA. Here, we report the unanticipated role of accessory CaVβ subunits on the inhibition of CaV 1. 3 b L-type (L-) current by AA. Whole cell Ba 2 + currents were measured from recombinant channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells at a test potential of − 10 mV from a holding potential of − 90 mV. A one-minute exposure to 10 µM AA inhibited currents with β 1 b, β 3, or β 4 58, 51, or 44 %, respectively, but with β 2 a only 31 %. At a more depolarized holding potential of − 60 mV, currents were inhibited to a lesser degree. These data are best explained by a simple model where AA stabilizes CaV 1. 3 b in a deep closed-channel conformation, resulting in current inhibition. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition by AA occurred in the absence of test pulses, indicating that channels do not need to open to become inhibited. AA had no effect on the voltage dependence of holding potential–dependent inactivation or on recovery from inactivation regardless of CaVβ subunit. Unexpectedly, kinetic analysis revealed evidence for two populations of L-channels that exhibit willing and reluctant gating previously described for CaV 2 channels. AA preferentially <b>inhibited</b> reluctant <b>gating</b> channels, revealing the accelerated kinetics of willing channels. Additionally, we discovered that the palmitoyl groups of β 2 a interfere with inhibition by AA. Our novel findings that the CaVβ subunit alters kinetic changes and magnitude of inhibition by AA suggest that CaVβ expression may regulate how AA modulates Ca 2 +-dependent processes that rely on L-channels, such as gene expression, enzyme activation, secretion, and membrane excitability...|$|R

40|$|The ClC protein family {{includes}} voltage-gated chloride {{channels and}} chloride/proton exchangers. In eukaryotes, ClC proteins regulate membrane potential of excitable cells, contribute to epithelial transport, and aid in lysosomal acidification. Although structure/function studies of ClC proteins have been aided greatly by the available crystal structures of a bacterial ClC chloride/proton exchanger, {{the availability of}} useful pharmacological tools, such as peptide toxin inhibitors, has lagged far behind that of their cation channel counterparts. Here we report the isolation, from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus venom, of a peptide toxin inhibitor of the ClC- 2 chloride channel. This toxin, GaTx 2, inhibits ClC- 2 channels with a voltage-dependent apparent KD of ∼ 20 pm, making it the highest affinity inhibitor of any chloride channel. GaTx 2 slows ClC- 2 activation by increasing the latency to first opening by nearly 8 -fold but is unable to inhibit open channels, suggesting that this toxin <b>inhibits</b> channel activation <b>gating.</b> Finally, GaTx 2 specifically inhibits ClC- 2 channels, showing no inhibitory effect on a battery of other major classes of chloride channels and voltage-gated potassium channels. GaTx 2 is the first peptide toxin inhibitor of any ClC protein. The high affinity and specificity displayed by this toxin will make it a very powerful pharmacological tool to probe ClC- 2 structure/function...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} {{situation}} (Scenario A), the jump is formed {{right at the}} apron, as it would {{if there was no}} downstream control. However, in the next scenario (Scenario B), the downstream tailwater depth has some control imposed on it such that it is less than the conjugate to y1. In this case, the jump travels downstream and initiates at a point where the upstream flow depth (y1’) has risen to the conjugate of the new downstream tailwater depth (yd). This rise from y1 to y1’ is caused by frictional resistance in the channel; and velocity decrease, the depth increase. In this image, y1’ and y2’ represent the conjugate depths of the hydraulic jump where y2’ assumes the depth of yd. In contrast, in the third setup (Scenario C), there is a downstream control that forces the tailwater elevation to a depth above the original conjugate depth. Here, yd is greater than the required depth so the jump is pushed upstream. In this scenario, the sluice <b>gate</b> <b>inhibits</b> the movement of the jump upstream so that the upstream conjugate cannot be attained. This leads to a situation known as a submerged or drowned hydraulic jump. These scenarios demonstrate how influential the role of tailwater is to jump formation and location.|$|R
