40|$|AbstractThe elastostatic {{problem of}} a mode-I crack {{embedded}} in a bimaterial with an imperfect interface is investigated. The crack is in proximity to and perpendicular to the imperfect interface, which is governed by linear spring-like relations. The Fourier transform is applied to reduce the associated mixed-boundary value problem to a singular integral equation with Cauchy kernel. By numerically solving the resulting equation, stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> near both crack tips are evaluated. Obtained results reveal that the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> {{in the presence of}} the imperfect interface vary between that with a perfect interface and that with a completely debonding interface. Moreover, an increase in the interface parameters decreases the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors.</b> In particular, when crack approaches to the weakened interface closer, the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> become larger for a sliding interface, and become larger or smaller for a Winkler interface, depending on the crack lying in a stiffer or softer material. The influences of the imperfection of the interface on the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> for a bimaterial composed of aluminum and steel are presented graphically...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{failure of}} cracked {{components}} {{is governed by}} the stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the crack tip. The singular stress contribution is characterized by stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors.</b> The stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> depend on the geometry of the component and on loading condition. This paper addresses the evaluation of stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> (SIFs) of opening, shearing and tearing modes for compact tension specimens for bonding homogeneous materials. The aim of this work is to find the optimal pre-cracked length, crack notch radius and crack notch angle in order to eliminate the effect of them on the SIF and then on the Fracture toughness. To achieve this goal, a three-dimension finite element analysis (FEA) model using ANSYS program is constructed for specimens made of homogeneous materials such as stainless steel bonding with epoxy as a filler material. The effects of notch angle, notch tip radius and pre-crack length on the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>factors</b> are studied for different fracture modes.

Modeling, meshing and {{the solution of the}} problem involving the whole assembly, i. e., loading devices, bolts and the specimen, with contact mechanics are performed using ANSYSTM.
