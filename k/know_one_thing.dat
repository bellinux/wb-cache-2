500|$|On 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard {{delivered}} a hoax speech for {{the radio station}} triple J in which she declared [...] "My dear remaining fellow Australians; {{the end of the}} world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if you <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about me it is this - I will always fight for you to the very end." [...] Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as [...] "immature" [...] and pondered whether it demeaned her office.|$|E
2500|$|Of the Zambaco affair, {{which would}} sputter {{on for some}} years, Georgiana wrote to her dear friend Rosalind Howard [...] "Dearest Rosalind, be hard on {{no one in this}} matter, and exalt no one, and may we all come through it at last. I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and that is that there is enough love between Edward and me to last out a long life if it is given us".|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} Twelve Plus One, Tate joined Polanski in London. She {{posed in}} their apartment for photographer Terry O'Neill in casual domestic scenes such as opening baby gifts, and completed {{a series of}} glamour photographs for the British magazine Queen. A journalist asked Tate in a late July interview if she believed in fate, to which she replied, [...] "Certainly. My whole life has been decided by fate. I think something more powerful than we are decides our fates for us. I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> — I've never planned anything {{that ever happened to}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear father," [...] she said, [...] "sometimes I really respect you. If {{you should}} come across that young man again, keep your eye upon him. He <b>knows</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at least which I wish he would tell us--he knows where Beatrice is." ...|$|R
5000|$|The shadowy {{figure of}} the Guilty Gear series. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> who That Man truly is except for his servant I-No, but {{everyone}} <b>knows</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for sure: he is the [...] "Gear Maker". In Guilty Gear 2: Overture he is there to test Sol Badguy's true extent as a Gear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{ask me what}} he wanted--I daresay {{we shall}} never <b>know.</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing's</b> very certain--that he didn't like my news, dear old Peter, and that I shan't soon forget {{the look in his}} face as he turned away from me and slipped out into the street. He was too much upset--he couldn't trust himself to come back; he had to walk about--he tried to walk it off." ...|$|R
2500|$|Later, as {{it became}} clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album {{to the top of the}} charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using Female Preacher as her springboard. Tonya Davis, {{pregnant}} at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. [...] "There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice," [...] the rapper insisted for Phoenix New Times in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. [...] "I feel like anything's possible and I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot." [...] Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, [...] "You Win, I Win, We Lose", while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album Sugar Time scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the US Dance chart, including the No. 1 single [...] "Gotta Know (Your Name)") mentioned the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying [...] "thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher".|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> first," [...] Miss Jethro proceeded. [...] "Did {{she tell}} you--as she once told me--that {{her father had}} died of heart-complaint?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care for}} your opinion! I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> They ought to have {{somebody}} else to mind the bridge, and perhaps they will have before long." ...|$|E
60|$|An indescribable {{feeling of}} sadness shot through Cytherea's heart. Why should she be sad {{at such an}} {{announcement}} as that, she thought, concerning a man she had never seen, when her spirits were elastic enough to rebound after hard blows from deep and real troubles {{as if she had}} scarcely known them? Though she could not answer this question, she <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> she was saddened by Owen's news.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know so much," [...] Duncombe said. [...] "I have {{no doubt}} that you <b>know</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which I would give years of my life to be {{satisfied}} about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>knew</b> just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I {{have never}} told you," [...] she confided, [...] "I {{think that you}} would feel sorry for him. I do, more and more every day, because {{in a way that}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is my fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} what you are right. I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that I {{am going to do}} when I get to Mauch Chunk--that is, if {{business}} continues good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't <b>know.</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> is certain: The name of Pelter is not common. Still, {{there may}} be other Pelters besides those related to that scoundrel of a broker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Shadow," [...] {{observed}} Dave. [...] "Was it William {{who paid}} the bill {{or was it}} Bill who {{had to put up}} several Williams to pay for it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his book}} Which Reminds Me, Randall {{maintained}} that any publicity an actor generates {{should be about}} his work, not himself. [...] "The public <b>knows</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about me: I don't smoke." ...|$|R
2500|$|Critics also {{questioned}} {{his commitment to}} Canada, pointing out that Ignatieff had lived outside of Canada for more than 30 years and had referred to himself as an American many times. When asked about it by Peter Newman in a Maclean's interview published on April 6, 2006, Ignatieff said: [...] "Sometimes you want to increase your influence over your audience by appropriating their voice, {{but it was a}} mistake. Every single one of the students from 85 countries who took my courses at Harvard <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about me: I was that funny Canadian." ...|$|R
40|$|David Laitin defies {{a famous}} binary {{classification}} of scholars between hedgehogs and foxes. The late Isaiah Berlin’s work, following Tolstoy’s, gave this distinction considerable currency {{in the social}} sciences. The hedgehog <b>knows</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> very well; and the fox knows quite a few things, if not each in great detail. Hedgehogs work on one given topic/theme/theory for an entire lifetime, adopting a cumulative research program, attempting to resolve one puzzle at a time, as they advance. Think of Arend Lijphart’s lifelong pursuit {{of the idea of}} consociational democracy...|$|R
60|$|Ah! If I could but <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> what {{a burden}} of {{suspense}} would be lifted from my shoulders! But whether the assassin's dagger reached one fair bosom or another, {{only time will}} divulge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{about this}} mullein leaf: the fairies {{use them for}} blankets," [...] said Demi, who had not quite given up his faith in the {{existence}} of the little folk in green.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait and see. Oh, I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{that has}} happened. I've {{been looking at}} you all this while trying to think what it was. You've grown a beard, and it looks {{perfectly}} horrid." ...|$|E
50|$|Years {{after his}} movie and sitcom career has run dry, Bruce Madsen {{is reduced to}} {{headlining}} one dingy comedy club after another, spending his nights in budget hotel rooms, and flying coach while his former fans sit in first class. He has only one question: What the hell happened? Amidst trying to revitalize his career, rekindle his love life, and put his daughter through college, Bruce <b>knows</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for sure - he must get off the road - hard. Road Hard {{is the story of}} that journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "I AM; {{and that}} I can look {{the truth in}} the face and not be angry or silly about it is, as you <b>know,</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in the world for which I think a bit well of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At Mrs Stumfold's? Yes;--sometimes, that is; {{but even}} there I {{always seem to}} want something. Miss Mackenzie, has it never {{occurred}} to you that the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> necessary in this life, the one thing--beyond a hope for the next, you <b>know,</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is--ah, Miss Mackenzie, what is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you tell}} me how I can help you," [...] I said, [...] "I want to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more. Have you decided in this serious matter entirely by yourself? Have you taken no advice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew it was}} a warning," [...] {{continued}} the vivacious George. [...] "W’y’e should come to me I don’t <b>know.</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> is I think ’e always ’ad a bit of a fancy for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that 'ud please her," [...] remarked Cap'n Bill, {{turning his}} round face with its fringe of {{whiskers}} toward {{the two girls}} and staring at them with his big, light-blue eyes wide open.|$|E
5000|$|Oh I've {{heard about}} you! You're {{the guy who}} does the whatchamacallits, you <b>know,</b> MacGyverisms; turns <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> into another? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that, I can't say," [...] said Mrs. Hilary. [...] "You and {{he ought}} to <b>know</b> best. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> is certain. There won't be any {{opposition}} on his part or mine, my son, that you won't see yourself is reasonable--" ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Jo! He {{was ugly}} and dirty and ignorant; but he <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> {{that it was}} wicked to tell a lie, and knowing this, he always told the truth. <b>One</b> other <b>thing</b> poor Jo knew too well, {{and that was what}} being hungry means. For little Jo was very poor. He lived in Tom-all-Alones, one of the most horrible places in all London. The people who live in this dreadful den are the poorest of London poor. All miserably clad, all dirty, all very hungry. They know and like Jo, for he is always willing to go on errands for them, and does them many little acts of kindness.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{world knows}} that, glory be to God!" [...] cries she; {{and then to}} Mr. Henry: [...] "There is none but me to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> - {{that you were a}} traitor to him in your heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> girls, {{and that}} is, she can wear a jersey {{and have it}} set elegantly, and we can't," [...] said Kitty, laboring with her own, which would wrinkle and twist, in spite of many hidden pins.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{one could}} do,' said Fernando thoughtfully. 'I say' as Felix made a {{movement}} {{as if he}} thought the subject concluded, 'I want to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more. Lance says it is believing all this that makes you--any one I mean--good.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What am I fit for? I <b>know</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that I am fit for, {{and that}} is, {{to go for}} a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for the {{prospect}} of taking counsel with your friendship and affection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Clym, [...] "whatever you do, {{you will}} always be dear to me--that you <b>know.</b> But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I {{have a right to}} say, which is, that at my age I am old enough to know what is best for me." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY. I'm so sorry. But you <b>know,</b> Captain, the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>one</b> misses {{on board}} a {{man-of-war}} is a woman.|$|R
