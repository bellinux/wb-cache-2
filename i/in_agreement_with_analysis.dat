Using serological data, the basic reproduction numbers for lineage- 1 rinderpest virus in southern Sudan and for lineage- 2 rinderpest virus in Somali livestock were estimated as 4. 4 and between 1. 2 and 1. 9, respectively. The model predictions for the inter-epidemic period in Sudan and Somalia (1. 2 and 4. 2 years, respectively) were <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysis</b> of livestock-owner reports (1 - 2 years and 5 years, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, fabrication {{and testing of}} a micromachined resonant accelerometer consisting of a symmetrical pair of proof masses and double-ended tuning fork(DETF) oscillators. Under the external acceleration along the input axis, the proof mass applies forces to the oscillators, which causes a change in their resonant frequency. This frequency change is measured to indicate the applied acceleration. Pivot anchor and leverage mechanisms are adopted in the accelerometer to generate larger force from a proof mass under certain acceleration, which enables increasing its scale factor. Finite element method analyses have been conducted to design the accelerometer and a silicon on insulator(SOI) wafer with a substrate glass wafer was used for fabricating it. The fabricated accelerometer has a scale factor of 188 Hz/g, which is shown to be <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysis</b> results...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-order}} {{implementation of}} the Discontinuous Galerkin (dg) method is presented for solving the three-dimensional Linearized Euler Equations on an unstructured hexahedral grid. The method {{is based on a}} quadrature free implementation and the high-order accuracy is obtained by employing higher-degree polynomials as basis functions. The present implementation is up to fourth-order accurate in space. For the time discretization a four-stage Runge–Kutta scheme is used which is fourth-order accurate. Non-reflecting boundary conditions are implemented at the boundaries of the computational domain. The method is verified for the case of the convection of a 1 D compact acoustic disturbance. The numerical results show that the rate of convergence of the method is of order p+ 1 in the mesh size, with p the order of the basis functions.

40|$|We {{explain the}} {{emergence}} and robustness of intense jets in highly turbulent planetary atmospheres, like on Jupiter, by a general approach of statistical mechanics of potential vorticity patches. The {{idea is that}} potential vorticity mixing leads {{to the formation of}} a steady organized coarse grained flow, corresponding to the statistical equilibrium state. Our starting point is the quasi-geostrophic 1 - 1 / 2 layer model, and we consider the relevant limit of a small Rossby radius of deformation. Then narrow jets are obtained, scaling like the Rossby radius of deformation. These jets can be either zonal, or closed into a ring bounding a vortex. Taking into account the effect of the beta effect and a sublayer deep shear flow, we predict an organization of the turbulent atmospheric layer into an oval-shaped vortex amidst a background shear. Such an isolated vortex is centered over an extremum of the equivalent topography (determined by the deep shear flow and beta-effect). This prediction is <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysis</b> of wind data in major Jovian vortices (Great Red Spot and Oval BC) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the fluctuating pressure in turbulent shear flaws at low Mach numbers is described. The treatment is both theoretical and experimental although, in the latter case, present limitations of pressure transducer design have restricted the experiments to surface measurements in wall shear flows over rigid plane boundaries. The turbulent flat-plate boundary layer is studied in detail. Calculations from existing turbulent, velocity data show that {{the ratio of the}} root-mean-square wall, fluctuating pressure to free stream dynamic pressure is approximately twice the local skin friction coefficient Cf.. The dependence on Cf has been verified for the Reynolds number range 3 x 105 to 8 x 106. The factor of proportionality was 2. 2. Although part of the test programme was performed in a low-noise wind-tunnel, {{it was not possible to}} determine completely the pressure power spectral density from laboratory measurements. This problem has been resolved by full-scale flight measurements on the wing of a high performance glider. The power spectral density of the surface pressure fluctuations was found to vary as the square of the frequency at low frequencies, a result <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysis</b> of the turbulence-mean shear contribution, to the wall pressure … [cont. ]...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in vivo that {{patients}} with the depigmentation disorder vitiligo accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) accompanied by low catalase levels and high concentrations of 6 - and 7 -biopterin in their epidermis. Earlier it was demonstrated that epidermal 4 a-OH-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase, an important enzyme in the recycling process of 6 (R) -L-erythro 5, 6, 7, 8 tetrahydrobiopterin (6 BH 4), has extremely low activities in these patients concomitant with a build-up of the abiogenic 7 -isomer (7 BH 4), leading to competitive inhibition of epidermal phenylalanine hydroxylase. A topical substitution for the impaired epidermal catalase with a pseudocatalase effectively removes epidermal H 2 O 2, yielding a recovery of epidermal 4 a-OH-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase activities and physiologic 7 BH 4 levels in association with successful repigmentation demonstrating recovery of the 6 BH 4 recycling process. Examination of recombinant enzyme activities, together with 4 a-OH-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase expression in the epidermis of untreated patients, identifies H 2 O 2 -induced inactivation of this enzyme. These results are <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysis</b> of genomic DNA from these patients yielding only wild-type sequences for 4 a-OH-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase and therefore ruling out the previously suspected involvement of this gene. Furthermore, our data show for the first time direct H 2 O 2 inactivation of the important 6 BH 4 recycling process. Based on this observation, we suggest that H 2 O 2 derived from various sources could be a general mechanism in the regulation of all 6 BH 4 -dependent processes...|$|E

40|$|Destructive {{post-irradiation}} examination {{was performed on}} fuel Compact 6 - 3 - 2, which was irradiated in the AGR- 1 experiment to a final compact average burnup of 11. 3 % FIMA and a time-average, volume-average temperature of 1070 °C. The analysis of this compact was focused on characterizing the extent of fission product release from the particles and examining particles to determine {{the condition of the}} kernels and coating layers. The work included deconsolidation of the compact and leach-burn-leach analysis, visual inspection and gamma counting of individual particles, measurement of fuel burnup by several methods, metallurgical preparation of selected particles, and examination of particle cross-sections with optical microscopy. A single particle with a defective SiC layer was identified during deconsolidation-leach-burn-leach analysis, which is in agreement with previous measurements showing elevated cesium in the Capsule 6 graphite fuel holder associated with this fuel compact. The fraction of the compact europium inventory released from the particles and retained in the matrix was relatively high (approximately 6 E- 3), indicating release from intact particle coatings. The Ag- 110 m inventory in individual particles exhibited a very broad distribution, with some particles retaining = 80 % of the predicted inventory and others retaining less than 25 %. The average degree of Ag- 110 m retention in 60 gamma counted particles was approximately 50 %. This elevated silver release is <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysis</b> of silver on the Capsule 6 components, which indicated an average release of 38 % of the Capsule 6 inventory from the fuel compacts. In spite of the relatively high degree of silver release from the particles, virtually none of the Ag- 110 m released was found in the compact matrix, and presumably migrated out of the compact and was deposited on the irradiation capsule components. Release of all other fission products from the particles appears to be less than a single particle equivalent inventory. Burnup measurements based on gamma spectrometry of individual particles and mass spectrometry of dissolved fuel kernels were in very good agreement (11. 0 % and 10. 9 % FIMA, respectively), and were also in good agreement with measurements based on previous gamma spectrometry measurements of the whole compact (11. 0 % FIMA) and the predicted burnup based on physics simulations of the AGR- 1 irradiation (11. 3 % FIMA) ...|$|E
