40|$|Factor <b>investing</b> {{has emerged}} as the new {{paradigm}} for long-term investment. Applied to equities, factor <b>investing</b> is probably the most serious contender to the classical industry-based approach to asset allocation. By organizing a multi-trial contest opposing factor <b>investing</b> and sector <b>investing,</b> we address two questions: 1) Are the excess returns of factor <b>investing</b> offset by higher risks, and if so, are factor-specific risks eliminable by means of factor diversification? 2) How does factor <b>investing</b> perform during crisis times? Our results suggest that this form of <b>investing</b> is the best strategy when short sales are permitted. It also outperforms industry-based allocation during expansion and bull periods. In contrast, sector <b>investing</b> offers defensive opportunities to asset managers since it delivers better risk-return trade-offs for long-only portfolios during recessions and bear periods. Overall, factor <b>investing</b> keeps its promises, but it {{still has a long way}} to go before it can oust sector <b>investing.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
