40|$|In {{order to}} save the {{switching}} ports {{and the cost of}} Multi-Granularity Optical Cross-Connect (MG-OXC), the waveband switching technique was proposed to groom multiple wavelength-level traffic to a few waveband tunnels to be switched by a few switching ports in MG-OXC. At the same time, protection for fibers is very important to ensure the service continuity since each wavelength carries a lot of traffic. Although existing works have addressed the waveband switching protection, most of them separately considered only the <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection</b> or shared protection in static demand scenario and did not deeply analyze and compare the <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection</b> and shared protection in dynamic demand scenario. Therefore, in this paper, we deeply study the consumptions of wavelengths in fibers and ports in MG-OXCs for Waveband Shared Protection (WSP) and Waveband <b>Dedicated</b> <b>Protection</b> (WDP) in dynamic demand scenario, and propose the port-cost calculation and update methods based on a new waveband layered auxiliary graph that is developed based on MG-OXC structure.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} thirst for bandwidth and the strict reliability and timing requirements of applications requires new network resilience methods in the fault management of optical backbone networks. It is particularly critical when an all-optical backbone {{is in place}} owing to its high data rate along each fiber and transparency in the data plane. In order to ensure an infrastructure of providing services requiring high Quality of Service (QoS), precise modeling of core optical mesh networks is crucial. For this pur-pose, the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept is introduced for modeling physical and geographical dependency among seemingly unrelated link failures. There have been numerous studies showing various benefits of (1 + 1) <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection,</b> which is the widely deployed technology in current optical backbone.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Survivable routing {{serves as}} {{a key role in}} connection-oriented {{communication}} networks for achieving de-sired service availability for each connection. This is particularly critical for the success of all-optical mesh networks where each lightpath carries a huge amount of data. Currently, 1 + 1 dedicated path protection appears to be the most widely deployed network resilience mechanism because it offers instantaneous recovery from network failures. However, 1 + 1 protection consumes almost twice as much capacity as required, which imposes a stringent constraint on network resource utilization. In addition, finding an SRLG-disjoint path is essential for 1 + 1 protection, which is nonetheless subject to non-trivial computation complexity and may fail in some SRLG scenarios. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework of 1 + 1 protection, called Generalized <b>Dedicated</b> <b>Protection</b> (GDP), for achieving instantaneous recovery from any SRLG failure event. It is demonstrated, that finding a non-bifurcated optimal solution for GDP is NP-complete. Thus, the paper presents a novel scheme applying Generalized <b>Dedicated</b> <b>Protection</b> and Network Coding (GDP-NC) to ensure both optimal resource utilization among <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection</b> approaches and instantaneous recovery for single unicast flows, which can be split into multiple parts in all-optical networks. We demonstrate that the proposed GDP-NC survivable routing problem is polynomial-time solvable, owing to the ability to bifurcate flows. This flexibility comes at the expense of additional hardware for linear combination operations for the optical flows. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} minimizing the energy consumption of IP networks. As traffic demands vary over time, energy savings are achieved by adapting traffic routing and node and link sleeping patterns while guaranteeing QoS and survivability requirements. Network survivability is based on shared protection for single link failures. The optimization framework considers a set of time intervals and, to guarantee network stability, inter-period limitations are imposed. Both exact and heuristic methods are proposed. Results obtained with realistic networks operated with flow-based routing protocols show that i) up to 60 % of the energy savings can be achieved without negatively affecting the network resiliency and that ii) the shared protection scheme better exploits backup capacity than the <b>dedicate</b> <b>protection</b> one...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dedicated</b> <b>{{protection}}</b> {{and shared}} protection {{are the main}} protection schemes in optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks. Shared protection techniques surpass the <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection</b> techniques by providing {{the same level of}} availability as <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection</b> with reduced spare capacity. Satisfying the service availability levels defined by the userâ€™s service-level agreement (SLA) in a cost-effective and resource-efficient way is a major challenge for networks operators. Hence, evaluating the availability of the shared protection scheme has a great interest. We recently developed an analytical model to estimate network availability of a WDM network with shared-link connections under multiple link-failures. However, this model requires the information of all possible combinations of the unshared protection paths, which is somehow troublesome. In this paper, we propose a more practical analytical model for evaluating the availability of a WDM network with shared-link connections under multiple link-failures. The proposed model requires only an estimate of the set of shared paths of each protection path. The estimated availability of the proposed model accurately matched with that of the previous model. Finally, we compare the previous model with the proposed model to demonstrate the merits and demerits of both models illustrating the threshold at which each model performs better based on the computational complexity. The proposed model significantly contributes to the related areas by providing network operators with a practical tool to evaluate quantitatively the system-availability and, thus, the expected survivability degree of WDM optical networks with shared connections under multiple-link failures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” Survivable routing of a {{connection}} involves computation {{of a pair}} of diverse routes such that at most one route fails when failures occur in the network topology. A subset of links in the network that share the risk of failure at the same time are said to belong to a Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) [3]. A network with shared risk link groups defined over its links is an SRLG network. A failure of an SRLG is equivalent to the failure of all the links in the SRLG. For {{a connection}} to be survivable in an SRLG network its working and protection paths must be routed on SRLG diverse paths. SRLG diverse routing problem has been proved to be NP-complete in [1] According to the quality of service requirement of a survivable connection request, <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection</b> or shared protection can be used to establish the connection request. With <b>dedicated</b> <b>protection,</b> the connection is established on both the SRLG diverse working and protection paths. The simplest heuristic for computing SRLG diverse path pair is the two-step approach, but it suffers from the trap topology problem. In [2] an iterative heuristic (ITSH) using the two-step approach was proposed to compute least cost SRLG diverse path pair. Suurballeâ€™s algorithm computes a pair of least cost linkdisjoint paths between a node pair. In this work we present a modified Suurballeâ€™s heuristic for computing the SRLG diverse routes between a node pair. We then propose an iterative heuristic (IMSH) which uses the modified Suurballeâ€™s heuristic for computing the least cost SRLG diverse routes.
