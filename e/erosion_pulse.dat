40|$|The {{need for}} high-aspect ratio micro {{structures}} in hard to machine materials is constantly growing. Electro-Physical machining {{processes such as}} EDM offer distinct advantages to conventional machining technologies such as independence of material hardness, but are difficult to control for high-precision and micro applications. It is therefore of great importance to provide means of fast and stable machining in Micro-EDM, e. g. optimize process and discharge efficiency. In this study, a novel approach to characterize erosion efficiency in Micro-EDM is made by recording erosion current and voltage with high resolution and long recording time. The paper presents the objectives of pulse shape classification for micro-EDM and lines out how a rating of erosion efficiency can be realized by studying the number and sequence of current and voltage of the <b>erosion</b> <b>pulses.</b> Thus, process analysis can be improved and optimized parameters can be adopted to the process state, eventually leading to an on-line process control...|$|R
40|$|Sediment cores {{from four}} lakes in the Tutira and Putere districts of Hawke's Bay, North Island, New Zealand, are {{analysed}} for {{the remains of}} pollen, charcoal, tephra and <b>erosion</b> <b>pulses</b> to reconstruct a 2000 year history of vegetation and landscape change. The Hawke's Bay region is disturbed frequently by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, cyclonic storms, droughts and fire.

Studies of surface pollen and differential pollen and spore preservation were undertaken to enhance the interpretations made from the palaeoecological record. Because New Zealand has only been settled by Polynesians relatively recently, the effects of natural disturbance on the vegetation and landscape can be assessed under similar climatic conditions to the present, but in the absence of cultural change. The effects of human settlement on a previously uninhabited landscape are assessed and compared with previously occurring natural disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vendian, chiefly clastic {{sedimentation}} on {{the southwest}} of the Siberian craton is discussed under the tenet of a foreland basin that came into being in the Vendian epoch at {{the margin of the}} Siberian continent (craton) due to its collision with island arcs and microcontinents. The Vendian foreland basin of the Siberian cratonic margin, over 3000 km in length, was formed in the Early and Late Vendian. To use a paleotectonic framework, the terrestrial and marine deposition in point took place in the Yenisei–Baikal belt of foredeeps and in its coeval Baikit–Nepa belt of forebulges in the cratonic interior. Vendian age of molasse and the foreland basin is proved by new data: (1) tillites reported {{from the base of the}} Oselkovaya Group (Marnya Formation) of the Sayan foredeep and (2) the find of a Metazoa mollusk biota. The tillite-bearing horizon occurs at the base of the “lower marine assemblage ” and, using cyclic sequences and carbonate sedimentary marker systems, it is traceable on the Yenisei Ridge, in Cisbaikalia, and in the cratonic interior. Sedimentologic data and the vector of clastic transport suggest that the ice cap was located on the Siberian craton, and the Siberian glacial horizon is correlatable to the global Laplandian horizon of the Vendian [Chumakov, 1978]. The foreland basin passed three evolutionary phases: (1) initial accretionary, (2) glacial (pre-collisional), and (3) collisional. Based on sedimentologic data, each phase falls into several evolutionary stages, each stage reflecting an <b>erosion</b> <b>pulse</b> and redeposition of clastic sediments. During the accretionary and collisional phases, changes in sedimentary systems were associated with tectonic activity and, indirectly, with eustatic sea-level oscillations. During the glacial phase, deposition of third-order cyclic sequences was chiefly controlled by eustatic changes of the sea-level, forced by growth and melting of ice caps. The synchroneity and interplay of climatic and tectonic events in the Vendian on most continents and microcontinents can be explained by a model for the Paleopangean supercontinent accretion in the Vendian...|$|E
40|$|Models {{to explain}} the {{distributed}} nature of continental deformation predict the propagation of strain and high topography away from the plate boundary. Yet {{a growing body of}} evidence in the Tibetan orogen suggests that deformation occurred at the far northern extent of the modern plateau early in the orogen's history and thus our current mechanical understanding of orogenic plateau development is incomplete. New apatite (U–Th) /He ages from four elevation transects document periods of rapid exhumation related to <b>erosion</b> <b>pulses</b> in hanging wall rocks of major thrust structures. Accelerated erosion is used as a proxy of fault timing, and is interpreted in a larger context of structural data and sediment accumulation in adjacent foreland basins. Helium results are synthesized with published geologic, thermochronometric, and sedimentologic data from which a growing picture of regional compressional deformation in Middle to Late Eocene time in northern Tibet emerges. We relate the early Cenozoic period of deformation to the initiation of collision between India and Eurasia, {{despite the fact that the}} plate boundary was located > 3000 km to the south. Regardless of whether or not high topography was built simultaneously as a result of this deformation, early Cenozoic strain signifies that the modern limit of the orogen has been relatively stationary since continental collision began and that deformation has not significantly propagated farther away from the plate boundary in time. ...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{associated}} {{factors such as}} global and regional sea-level rise; the upsurge in high-intensity flooding events; and coastal <b>erosion</b> are <b>pulse</b> and press disturbances that threaten to increase landslides in coastal regions. Under these circumstances; a rigorous framework is required to evaluate coastal vulnerability in order to plan for future climate change scenarios. A vast majority of coastal vulnerability assessments across the globe are evaluated at the macro level (city scale) {{but not at the}} micro level (small town scale); particularly in the United Kingdom (UK). In order to fill this vital research gap; the current study established a coastal vulnerability index termed here as the Micro Town Coastal Vulnerability Index (MTCVI) and then applied it to Barton-on-Sea; which is a small coastal town of the Hampshire region; England; UK. MTCVI was evaluated for Barton-on-Sea coastal vulnerability by integrating both novel and existing parameters. Results suggest that the entire shoreline frontage (2 km) exhibits very high coastal vulnerability and is prone to various coastal hazards such as landslides; erosion; and wave intrusion. This suggests that Barton-on-Sea coastal amenities will require a substantial improvement in shoreline protection measures. In this study; GIS (geographic information system) coastal vulnerability and landslide maps were generated; and these maps can be used by the local authorities; district councils; coastal engineers; and planners to improve and design coastal management strategies under the climate change scenarios.

30|$|Aquatic {{habitats}} {{are intimately}} connected to terrestrial landscapes in fire-maintained ecosystems (Minshall and Brock 1991, Bisson et al. 2003). Fire in terrestrial ecosystems {{plays a role}} in linked aquatic ecosystems through many dynamic factors (Gresswell 1999, Bisson et al. 2003). Mortality and injury of aquatic animals can be caused by fire by raising water temperature to lethal levels, possible toxic effects caused by fire-induced changes in stream pH, and acute levels of toxic chemicals (Gresswell 1999). Longer term fire effects on aquatic animals can result from chronic or <b>pulse</b> <b>erosion,</b> channel re-configuration (Gamradt and Kats 1997), {{the quality and quantity of}} coarse woody debris, reduced streamside vegetation, turbidity (Gill and Allan 2008) and stream sedimentation (Bozek and Young 1994, Lyon and O’Connor 2008). These factors have direct and indirect effects on aquatic organisms (fish and macroinvertebrates) and organisms that have aquatic phases in their life histories, such as emergent insects and amphibians (Dunham et al. 2007). Emerging aquatic insects, in turn, are an important source of food for many vertebrates (i.e., bats, birds, amphibians, and fish) and other insects. Modeling first-order effects on trees and shrubs within watersheds (defoliation or mortality) could be used to predict factors critical for aquatic life, such as turbidity, runoff, insolation, and coarse woody debris.|$|R
40|$|Passive margin {{highlands}} {{occur on}} most continents on Earth {{and play a}} critical role in the cycle of weathering, erosion, and atmospheric circulation. Yet, in contrast to the well-developed understanding of collisional mountain belts, such as the Alps and Himalayas, the origin of less elevated (1 - 2 km) passive margin highlands is still unknown. The eastern Australian highlands are a prime example of these plateaus, but compared to others they have a well-documented episodic uplift history spanning 120 million years. We use a series of mantle convection models to show that the time-dependent interaction of plate motion with mantle downwellings and upwellings accounts for the broad pattern of margin uplift phases. Initial dynamic uplift of 400 - 600 m from 120 - 80 Ma was driven by the eastward motion of eastern Australia 2 ̆ 7 s margin away from the sinking eastern Gondwana slab, followed by tectonic quiescence to about 60 Ma in the south (Snowy Mountains). Renewed uplift of ∼ 700 m in the Snowy Mountains is propelled by the gradual motion of the margin over the edge of the large Pacific mantle upwelling. In contrast the northernmost portion of the highlands records continuous uplift from 120 Ma to present-day totalling about 800 m. The northern highlands experienced a continuous history of dynamic uplift, first due to the end of subduction to the east of Australia, then due to moving over a large passive mantle upwelling. In contrast, the southern highlands started interacting with the edge of the large Pacific mantle upwelling ∼ 40 - 50 ∼ 40 - 50 million years later, resulting in a two-phase uplift history. Our results are in agreement with published uplift models derived from river profiles and the Cretaceous sediment influx into the Ceduna sub-basin offshore southeast Australia, reflecting the fundamental link between dynamic uplift, fluvial <b>erosion</b> and depositional <b>pulses</b> in basins distal to passive margin highlands...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Pacemaker pocket {{infection}} is a potentially serious problem after permanent pacemaker implantation. Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly prescribed {{to reduce the}} incidence of this complication, but current trial evidence of its efficacy is conflicting. A large prospective randomised trial was therefore performed of antibiotic prophylaxis in permanent pacemaker implantation. The intention was firstly to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is efficacious in these patients and secondly to identify which patients are at the highest risk of infection. METHODS [...] A prospective randomised open trial of flucloxacillin (clindamycin if the patient was allergic to penicillin) v no antibiotic was performed in a cohort of patients undergoing first implantation of a permanent pacing system over a 17 month period. Intravenous antibiotics were started at the time of implantation and continued for 48 hours. The trial endpoint was a repeat operation for an infective complication. RESULTS [...] 473 patients were entered into a randomised trial. 224 received antibiotic prophylaxis and 249 received no antibiotics. A further 183 patients were not randomised but were treated according to the operator's preference (64 antibiotics, 119 no antibiotics); these patients are included only in the analysis of predictors of infection. Patients were followed up for a mean (SD) of 19 (5) months. Among the patients in the randomised group there were nine infections requiring a repeat operation, all in the group not receiving antibiotic (P = 0. 003). In the total patient cohort there were 13 infections, all but one in the non-antibiotic group (P = 0. 006). Nine of the infections presented as <b>erosion</b> of the <b>pulse</b> generator or electrode, three as septicaemia secondary to Staphylococcus aureus, and one as a pocket abscess secondary to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Infections were significantly more common when the operator was inexperienced (< or = 100 previous patients), the operation was prolonged, or after a repeat operation for non-infective complications (principally lead displacement). Infection was not significantly more common in patients identified preoperatively as being at high risk (for example patients with diabetes mellitus, patients receiving long term steroid treatment), although there was a trend in this direction. CONCLUSIONS [...] Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of infective complications requiring a repeat operation after permanent pacemaker implantation. It is suggested that antibiotics should be used routinely...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two {{separate}} fields of microwave technology. The first section treats microwave characterization and applications of high temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films, {{while the second}} section treats microwave breakdown in transmit-receive (TR) switches and in air. Within the first section, four main topics are adressed. The first topic deals with non-destructive characterization of the surface impedance of HTS films. Two methods are investigated: the dielectric rod resonator method and the parallel-plate resonator method. Calibration measurements show that surface resistance measurements can be performed at 10 GHz {{in the range from}} 15 µ. OMEGA. to 100 µ. OMEGA. using both methods. Good agreement is obtained between a microstrip resonator method and the two non-destructive methods. The parallel-plate resonator is used as a fast non-destructive microwave characterization method for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) films grown on (001) yttria-stabilized ZrO 2 substrates, in order to optimize film deposition parameters. The second topic involves an analytical formulation for calculation of the quasi-static propagation parameters of HTS coplanar waveguides and striplines. The resistance and kinetic inductance per unit length of the line is calculated for HTS film thicknesses comparable to the penetration depth. The third topic deals with a YBCO microstrip modulator, which is based on the transition from the superconductive (S) state to the normal (N) state of current controlled YBCO film elements. The elements are used as terminations of a 3 dB hybrid coupler and work as shorts or terminations depending on state. The actual material parameters of the used YBCO films differ most likely from those used in the simulations, which can be deduced from the small measured difference in insertion loss between the S- and N-states. The fourth topic involves measurements and modeling of the frequency and quality factor of high quality YBCO thin film coplanar resonators as function of dc bias in the center strip conductor. Agreement between experiments and the results of a current-dependent coupled-grain model has been obtained. Within the second section, two topics are investigated. The first topic deals with a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the TR switch. It is shown that the characteristic physical phenomena which appear in connection with microwave breakdown of the filling gas as well as the subsequent interaction between the microwave and the breakdown plasma, can be described very well in terms of qualitative and quantitative physical models. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data from a number of experiments involving continuous and pulsed incident powers. The second topic of this section involves an investigation of the breakdown properties of high-power microwave pulses propagating in air. A simple analytical modeling of the breakdown-induced <b>pulse</b> <b>erosion</b> phenomenon is made by use of empirical approximations for the ionization frequency of the microwave. The theoretical predictions are compared and found to be in good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
