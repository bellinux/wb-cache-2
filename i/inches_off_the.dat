25|$|The 1900 {{portrait}} depicts Williams {{from the}} left side. She is wearing a black dress with red stripes, a pair of red ribbon bowties, and a red ribbon around her neck. Williams's hair is worn down, set against a dark brown background. Her cheek is slightly sunken. Her expression is much softer, virtually inscrutable. The portrait was originally painted on a 24 x 20inch canvas. Eakins cut two <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> right side, and tacked it to a new stretcher. This {{had the effect of}} re-centering the work on Williams's face.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells were}} {{extremely}} small, with three concrete walls with no windows, {{and a solid}} steel door with a five-inch square window facing the corridor. The cells contained only a wash basin/toilet combination (cold water only), and a radio selector (there were two channels), and a concrete pad covered with a sheet of plywood four <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floor on which the inmates slept. Inmates could not control {{the volume of the}} radio nor the temperature of the cell. The lights in the cell remained on 24 hours a day, but were dimmed to 25 watts at night.|$|E

5000|$|Lucius Glau, {{a servant}} of Madrigal Raith's in Proven Guilty, was said by Thomas {{to be the}} scion of a djinn. Though mostly human in appearance, he {{displayed}} sharklike teeth and was capable of superhuman speed and ferocity {{as well as the}} ability to levitate about an <b>inch</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground when running, but could be injured by normal means.|$|R
2500|$|Beak {{trimming}} {{was developed}} at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s. [...] The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6mm (1/4 <b>inch)</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> beak. It was thought that {{the tip of the}} beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.|$|R
25|$|After King Drupada and King Virata were slain by Drona, Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna fought him on {{the fifteenth}} day. Because Drona was very {{powerful}} and inconquerable having the irresistible Brahmanda astra, Krishna hinted to Yudhishthira that Drona would give up his arms if his son Ashwatthama was dead. Bhima proceeded to kill an elephant named Ashwatthama and loudly proclaimed that Ashwatthama was dead. Drona approached Yudhishthira to seek the truth of his son's death. Yudhishthira proclaimed Ashwathama Hatahath, Naro Va Kunjaro Va, implying Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure {{whether it was a}} Drona's son or an elephant, The latter part of his proclamation (Naro va Kunjaro va) were drowned out by sound of the conch blown by Krishna intentionally (a different version of the story is that Yudhishthira pronounced the last words so feebly that Drona could not hear the word elephant). Prior to this incident, the chariot of Yudhishthira, proclaimed as Dharma raja (King of righteousness), hovered a few <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground. After the event, the chariot landed on the ground as he lied.|$|E
2500|$|Moore's {{assassination}} attempt {{took place in}} San Francisco on September 22, 1975, just 17 days after Lynette [...] "Squeaky" [...] Fromme's attempted assassination of Ford. She {{was standing in the}} crowd {{across the street from the}} St. Francis Hotel, and was about [...] away from President Ford when she fired a single shot at him with a different firearm, a [...]38 caliber revolver. She was using a gun she bought in haste that same morning and did not know the sights were six <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> point-of-impact at that distance, and she narrowly missed.|$|E
2500|$|Levitation: The magician defies gravity, {{either by}} making {{something}} {{float in the}} air, or {{with the aid of}} another object (suspension)—a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician hovers a few <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floor. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including Asrah levitation, Balducci levitation, and King levitation. The flying illusion has often been performed by David Copperfield and more recently by Peter Marvey. [...] Harry Blackstone floated a light bulb {{over the heads of the}} public.|$|E

Indeed, it roused him so effectually that he jumped a clear <b>inch</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground and bit his tongue. Revolving on his axis, he found himself confronting a middle-aged man with a face like a horse. The man was dressed in something of an old-world style. His clothes had an English cut.

2500|$|The {{women were}} {{subjected}} to a strict 10 p.m. curfew, administered by a senior Harvey Girl who assumed the role and responsibilities of house mother. The official starched black and white uniform (which was designed to diminish the female physique) consisted of a skirt that hung no more than eight <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floor, [...] "Elsie" [...] collars, opaque black stockings, and black shoes. The hair was restrained in a net and tied with a regulation white ribbon. [...] Makeup of any sort was absolutely prohibited, as was chewing gum while on duty. Harvey Girls (as they soon came to be known) were required {{to enter into a}} one-year employment contract, and forfeited half their base pay should they fail to complete the term of service. Marriage was the most common reason for a girl to terminate her employment.|$|E
2500|$|Following a rough outing in long {{relief for}} Jacob Turner the {{previous}} day, the Nationals designated him for assignment on July 1. Left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was activated off the 60-day disabled list. The Nationals rallied {{in the ninth}} inning of their July 1 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, scoring a run and loading the bases against closer Trevor Rosenthal. St. Louis brought in reliever Matt Bowman to try to nail down his first career save, while Nationals manager Dusty Baker sent infielder Adrián Sánchez to the plate to pinch-hit in his first MLB at-bat. Sánchez worked the count full before taking a pitch roughly six <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plate away for what would have been ball four and a game-tying walk, but home plate umpire Manny Gonzalez called him out on strikes to end the game at 2–1 in the Cardinals' favor. Baker praised Sánchez after the game, saying the call [...] "just wasn't fair to him" [...] and remarking, [...] "You hate to have an at-bat like that and have it settled on apparently a bad call." [...] In the following game, on July 2, minutes after being named to play in the 2017 All-Star Game as the top overall National League vote-getter, right fielder Bryce Harper hit two home runs off fellow All-Star Carlos Martínez. Starting pitcher Max Scherzer, also named to the All-Star roster, struck out 12 Cardinals while allowing no runs in seven innings to earn the 7–2 win.|$|E

50|$|After retirement, {{he began}} public {{performances}} with a mystifying stage act. He would appear stripped {{to the waist}} and challenge anyone in the audience to try to lift him off his feet. It seemed an empty boast since at five feet and barely 110 pounds, he was smaller than many schoolboys. But those who took up the challenge soon left the stage baffled and frustrated when {{they were unable to}} lift Coulon an <b>inch</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floor. Coulon himself never made any extravagant claims that he could violate natural laws. He was content to make a living by presenting a baffling stage act. The trick was that Coulon would feign a struggle, grabbing the opponent by {{the back of the neck}} and right arm and applying pressure to a nerve there. Once he even successfully prevented imposing heavyweight Primo Carnera from lifting him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floor. His act also included what he described as levitation and his appearing to lose and gain weight at will.|$|R

Through the author's ability to draw the reader into the minds of each of the many and varied protagonists, the reader is given an in-depth and multifaceted view of both the heights and the depths of life in New York City for both its ordinary, and its more extraordinary citizens. In subsequent interviews, the author has noted his intention to point out the melodramatic tensions present in all of our lives, whether perched upon a death-defying high wire, or merely trying to live out a more [...] "ordinary" [...] life, [...] "where there is still an invisible tight-rope wire that we all walk, with equally high stakes, only it is hidden to most, and only 1 <b>inch</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground".|$|R

6000|$|... 1434. The brush is {{in reality}} a {{discharge}} between a bad or a non-conductor and either a conductor or another non-conductor. Under common circumstances, the brush is a discharge between a conductor and air, and I conceive {{it to take}} place in something like the following manner. When the end of an electrified rod projects into the middle of a room, induction takes place between it and the walls of the room, across the dielectric, air; and the lines of inductive force accumulate upon the end in greater quantity than elsewhere, or the particles of air {{at the end of the}} rod are more highly polarized than those at any other part of the rod, for the reasons already given (1374.). The particles of air situated in sections across these lines of force are least polarized in the sections towards the walls and most polarized in those nearer to the end of the wires (1369.): thus, it may well happen, that a particle at the end of the wire is at a tension that will immediately terminate in discharge, whilst in those even only a few <b>inches</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> tension is still beneath that point. But suppose the rod to be charged positively, a particle of air A, fig. 118, next it, being polarized, and having of course its negative force directed towards the rod and its positive force outwards; the instant that discharge takes place between the positive force of the particle of the rod opposite the air and the negative force of the particle of air towards the rod, the whole particle of air becomes positively electrified; and when, the next instant, the discharged part of the rod resumes its positive state by conduction from the surface of metal behind, it not only acts on the particles beyond A, by throwing A into a polarized state again, but A itself, because of its charged state, exerts a distinct inductive act towards these further particles, and the tension is consequently so much exalted between A and B, that discharge takes place there also, as well as again between the metal and A.|$|E

50|$|In November 1938, the two {{segments}} of the tunnel met under the mountain, {{no more than a}} few <b>inches</b> <b>off.</b> With <b>the</b> excavation completed, the tunnel was then grouted with concrete. This operation filled in cracks and crevices and reduced the tunnel to its finished size of 16 feet (4.9 m) tall and 16 feet (4.9 m) wide. About 24,100 tons of cement were used in the attempts to seal <b>off</b> <b>the</b> seepage, averaging about 20 sacks per foot of tunnel. As leaks were sealed, pressure would build and create a new leak elsewhere.
