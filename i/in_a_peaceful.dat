5|$|The Vistulans were {{probably}} also subjected to Magyar raids {{as an additional}} layer of embankments was often added to the gord fortifications {{in the early part}} of the 10th century.

This association turned out to be beneficial in terms of economic development, because Kraków was an important station on the Prague—Kiev trade route. The first known Christian church structures were erected on Wawel Hill. Later in the 10th century, under uncertain circumstances, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> way (the gord network suffered no damage on this occasion), the Vistulans became a part of the Piast Polish state.|$|E
