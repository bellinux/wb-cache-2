60|$|In {{a secluded}} and mountainous part of Stiria {{there was in}} old time a valley of the most {{surprising}} and luxuriant fertility. It was surrounded on all sides by steep and rocky mountains rising into peaks which were always covered with snow and from which a number of torrents descended in constant cataracts. One of these fell westward over {{the face of a}} crag so high that when the sun had set to everything else, and all below was darkness, his beams still shone full upon this waterfall, so that it looked like a shower of gold. It was therefore called by the people of the neighborhood the Golden River. It was strange that none of these streams fell into the valley itself. They all descended {{on the other side of}} the mountains and wound away through broad plains and by populous cities. But the clouds were drawn so constantly to the snowy hills, and rested so softly in the circular hollow, that in time of drought and heat, when all the country round was burned up, there was still rain in the little valley; and <b>its</b> crops were <b>so</b> heavy, and <b>its</b> hay <b>so</b> high, and <b>its</b> apples <b>so</b> red, and <b>its</b> grapes <b>so</b> blue, and <b>its</b> wine <b>so</b> rich, and <b>its</b> honey <b>so</b> sweet, that it was a marvel to everyone who beheld it and was commonly called the Treasure Valley.|$|R
