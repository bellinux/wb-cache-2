5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages are thought to <b>have</b> <b>passed</b> food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E

Charters from Beorthwulf's reign show a strained relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently returned it.|$|E

5|$|Each {{radioactive}} isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that {{is determined by}} the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives <b>have</b> <b>passed</b> only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.|$|E

It thus became the first known sungrazing comet. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 solar radii.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand.
