5000|$|An SOI MOSFET is a {{semiconductor}} device (MOSFET) {{in which a}} semiconductor layer such as silicon or germanium is formed on an insulator layer which may be a buried oxide (BOX) layer formed in a semiconductor substrate. [...] SOI MOSFET devices are adapted {{for use by the}} computer industry. The buried oxide layer can be used in SRAM designs. There are two type of SOI devices: PDSOI (partially depleted SOI) and FDSOI (fully depleted SOI) MOSFETs. For an n-type PDSOI MOSFET the sandwiched p-type film between the gate oxide (GOX) and buried oxide (BOX) is large, so the depletion region can't cover the whole p region. So to some extent PDSOI behaves like bulk MOSFET. Obviously there are some advantages over the bulk MOSFETs. The film is very thin in FDSOI devices so that the depletion region covers the whole film. In FDSOI the front gate (GOX) supports less depletion charges than the bulk so an increase in inversion charges occurs resulting in higher switching speeds. The limitation of the <b>depletion</b> <b>charge</b> by the BOX induces a suppression of the depletion capacitance and therefore a substantial reduction of the subthreshold swing allowing FD SOI MOSFETs to work at lower gate bias resulting in lower power operation. The subthreshold swing can reach the minimum theoretical value for MOSFET at 300K, which is 60mV/decade. This ideal value was first demonstrated using numerical simulation [...] Other drawbacks in bulk MOSFETs, like threshold voltage roll off, etc. are reduced in FDSOI since the source and drain electric fields can't interfere due to the BOX. The main problem in PDSOI is the [...] "floating body effect (FBE)" [...] since the film is not connected to any of the supplies.|$|E

One would certainly expect that the thickness limit for functionality would be altered {{in the presence of}} ionized impurities but how this would occur remains unclear. In this article, we analyze the domain structures as well as the phase transition temperatures in films with depletion charges for various film thicknesses. Due to the inhomogeneity created by depletion charges, saw-tooth like domain structures develop spanning the entire film thickness that are possible in films with depletion charges having perfect electrode screening, i. e., ideal electrodes if the film is above a critical thickness.

A semi {{analytical}} model describing the bulk mobility for holes in strained-p-Si layers {{as a function}} of applied uniaxial strain applied at the gate has been developed in this paper. The uniaxial tensile stress has been applied externally through the silicon nitride cap layer. The effects of uniaxial stress are understood on all the three components of mobility i. e. phonon, columbic and surface roughness mobility. The results show that the hole mobility is a strong rising function of applied uniaxial strain. Flatband voltage, <b>Depletion</b> <b>Charge</b> density, Inversion charge density, Energy gap and Effective surface electric field have been analytically modeled. There is a sharp increase in the vertical electric field and inversion charge density and decrease in the energy gap, <b>depletion</b> <b>charge</b> density and the flatband voltage when the uniaxial stress is applied.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of the <b>depletion</b> <b>charge</b> in the {{polysilicon}} gate on electron mobility in ultrathin oxide MOSFETs. An improved theory for remote-charge-scattering-limited mobility in silicon inversion layers is developed. The model takes into account the effects of image charges, screening, inversion layer quantization, the contribution of different subbands, oxide thickness, the actual distribution of charged centres inside the structure, the actual distribution of carriers in the inversion layer, the correlation of charged centres and the charged centre sign. It is shown that if the oxide is thin enough the remote Coulomb scattering due to the <b>depletion</b> <b>charge</b> in the poly-gate becomes an effective scattering mechanism, whose effect is comparable to those of the main scattering mechanisms that control the movement of the carriers in the MOSFET channel. As a consequence, this scattering mechanism {{must be taken into account}} in order to satisfactorily explain the experimental results obtained in ultrathin oxide MOSFETs. The model is implemented in a Monte Carlo simulator, where the effects of the ionized impurity charge in the substrate, the interface trapped charge and the contribution of other scattering mechanisms are taken into account simultaneously. Our results show that RCS cannot be neglected for oxide thicknesses below 2 nm, but that its effects for tox> 5 nmarenegligible. Good agreement with experimental results was obtained. 1...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) are new {{generation}} Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) with larger battery capacity compared to Hybrid Electric Vehicles. They can store electrical energy from a domestic power supply and can drive the vehicle alone in Electric Vehicle (EV) mode. According to the U. S. Department of Transportation 80 % of the American driving public on average drives under 50 miles per day. A PHEV vehicle that can {{drive up to}} 50 miles by making maximum use of cheaper electrical energy from a domestic supply can significantly reduce the conventional fuel consumption. This may also help in improving the environment as PHEVs emit less harmful gases. However, the Energy Management System (EMS) of PHEVs {{would have to be}} very different from existing EMSs of HEVs. In this thesis, three different Energy Management Systems have been designed specifically for PHEVs using simulated study. For most of the EMS development mathematical vehicle models for powersplit drivetrain configuration are built and later on the results are tested on advanced vehicle modeling tools like ADVISOR or PSAT. The main objective of the study is to design EMSs to reduce fuel consumption by the vehicle. These EMSs are compared with existing EMSs which show overall improvement. x In this thesis the final EMS is designed in three intermediate steps. First, a simple rule based EMS was designed to improve the fuel economy for parametric study. Second, an optimized EMS was designed with the main objective to improve fuel economy of the vehicle. Here Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is used to obtain the optimum parameter values.

As will be shown, a reduction of the threshold voltage is observed for typical stressing conditions, while simultaneously the maximum transconductance increases. Similar changes can be obtained nearly immediately by applying a strong pulse into multiplication, i. e. by pulsing the drain voltage beyond the kink. At 4. 2 K this 'low'-threshold-voltage (V(T)) state is metastable. These phenomena can be explained by considering hole trapping in the frozen-out film, yielding a reduction of the <b>depletion</b> <b>charge</b> and an increase in the film potential.
