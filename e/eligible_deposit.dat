40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a review of}} current literature addressing {{the issues of the}} deposit copy scheme within the two decades after 1989. The dynamic development of the publishing market in Poland following the emergence of the new social and economic reality, and the introduction of new media, prompted librarians and publishers to postulate changes in relevant obsolete legal regulations that dated back to 1968. The conflict of, or incompatibility of, interest between the two sections were most apparent in demands submitted by libraries to retain full control over the publishing market in terms of the obligation of publishers to furnish to libraries their complete publishing output according to the deposit copy scheme. On {{the opposite side of the}} conflict, publishers demanded the number of <b>eligible</b> <b>deposit</b> copy libraries to be significantly reduced. At the time, library periodicals and publishing journals abounded with articles presenting opinions, views and suggestions put forward by librarians and publishers alike. A number of stages in the discussion can be distinguished: from fact-finding evaluations produced soon after 1989 and proposals referring to changes in regulations with regard to passing an act in the lower house of the Parliament (the Polish Sejm), appraisals of new legal regulations in the light of their actual operation, to a new debate on amendments and changes in the Act. The article is complemented with an extensive bibliography in chronological order...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} consequences {{to be drawn from}} the course of the financial crisis up to now is the insight that more attention must be paid in the future to the factors of liquidity, liquidity management and liquidity protection. That holds true {{for the protection of the}} stability of an individual bank as it does for that of a whole national or even international financial system. The liquidity problems of a bank can certainly have a variety of causes. However, as an examination of the history of bank insolvencies and financial crises shows, an accelerated withdrawal of bank deposits by unsecured customers nearly always leads in the end to the collapse of an institution and, as an ultimate consequence, to a national or even international banking crisis. This insight has also brought the deposit insurance institutions in many countries around the world to the attention of political, regulatory and banking management discussions. The rapid, politically necessary, factually often not well founded, guarantee promises made by many governments have shown those responsible that in Europe the need for a fundamental revision of the present deposit insurance schemes must be urgently addressed. In most industrialized countries of the OECD, as well as in a range of other states, working groups are studying the necessary revisions and adjustments of the relevant institutions to meet the new economic and political conditions. Even if solutions of this sort continue to be arranged differently from one country to another on the basis of differing regulatory, historical and structural circumstances, a consensus is emerging over {{the important}} basic questions of deposit insurance system design and architecture. As a result of the worldwide financial crisis most European countries massively increased their coverage limits for their national deposit insurance schemes in the fall of 2008. Where no deposit insurance existed, it was introduced. Existing systems were critically scrutinized. In most countries the maximum insurance coverage was raised and the <b>eligible</b> <b>deposit</b> base was extended. Some individual states have even promised an unlimited deposit protection (in some cases with a time restriction). Under the pressure of an increasing number of bank failures these promises were made without revising the existing deposit insurance schemes themselves. In the course of 2009, both the individual European states and the EU itself then set about scrutinizing their existing protection schemes and mechanisms and revising the existing national deposit insurance schemes. It is accepted throughout the world that well designed deposit insurance is an important element in a national safety net for maintaining and extending the stability of the financial system. The design and structure, but also the implementation, of a deposit insurance scheme (DIS) of this sort throws up numerous institutional, procedural and instrumental questions. Such operative and strategic issues must be answered against the background of the overall national circumstances and in line with the country specific realities of the respective financial intermediate system. However, there is a series of topics that can be assessed and solved independently of such individual circumstances. This is even more the case since the worldwide revision of the deposit insurance schemes offers the opportunity to create the conditions for a future harmonization of national deposit insurance schemes at least within Europe. An assimilation of this sort is, in turn, the basis for future EU-wide or perhaps even European depositor protection, which, like any broadly based guarantee, would certainly be more efficient than a multitude of national solutions. This publication intends to make a contribution to the ongoing discussion of the complex questions connected with the further development of European deposit insurance schemes. Both complementing and extending the broad range of theoretical literature available, it focuses on some key design questions of modern deposit insurance schemes, on the discussion of their basic structural elements and on the appropriate consequences for the stakeholders in deposit insurance. We focus on: - the derivation of the most important requirements of a modern European deposit insurance, and the - discussion of specific organizational aspects and fundamental institutional requirements as well as of solutions for selected system building blocks. The first chapter analyzes the institutional framework of deposit insurance schemes and its various aspects of cost/benefit considerations. The second chapter discusses the fundamentals of modern deposit insurance. The third chapter examines selected strategic and instrumental questions concerning the organization and implementation of deposit insurance schemes. The fourth chapter focuses on some questions related to the international harmonization and coordination of the design of deposit insurance schemes. In all sections we address some lessons learned from the recent financial turmoil. The fifth chapter finally addresses some conclusions and sketches some policy implications for designing and implementing a modern deposit insurance scheme.

40|$|More {{than ten}} {{years have passed since}} the European Commission adopted Directive 94 / 19 /EC on deposit-guarantee schemes. The Directive laid the {{foundations}} for general harmonisation of deposit insurance across the European Union Member States, requiring them to legally set up deposit-guarantee schemes by a specified deadline. Based on minimum harmonisation, the Directive left it to Member States to develop their own deposit insurance systems in terms of e. g. definition of <b>eligible</b> <b>deposits,</b> level of cover, types of funding mechanism, and calculation of members’ contributions. This autonomy has resulted in quite divergent evolution of deposit-guarantee schemes and gives rise to a series of possible problems, which were the subject of the European Commission’s review of the Directive in 2006. This paper overviews the current state of deposit insurance across the European Union, highlights the main controversial issues which cause disparities in the implementation of deposit insurance between Member States (e. g. the definition of <b>eligible</b> <b>deposits,</b> the level of cover applied, the implementation of topping-up arrangements, the types of funding mechanism), and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} further harmonisation.

40|$|Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) {{become more}} visible {{under the current}} {{conditions}} of the world financial markets. If those have played in the past a rather discreet role for social stability through the function of pay box following a bank failure, the recent crisis {{put them in a}} new light, once the guarantee ceiling for <b>eligible</b> <b>deposits</b> grew in order to make for the accumulation of wealth worldwide and the increased risk incurred by the leverage of banking operations. Consequently, the resources accumulated by the DGS from the member banks and their proper management make possible their involvement in pre-emptive actions aimed to avoid bankruptcies via special administration and purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities. These new attributes give DGS a role in the mechanism of financial safety-net, along the supervisors of the market. Hence, an increased preoccupation for applied corporate governance has developed and Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems have been adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision together with International Association of Deposit Insurers. Concurrently, the EU Commission has put forward a process for reviewing the Directives 94 / 39 and 09 / 14 EC, {{in order to make the}} European DGS more prepared to deal with above mentioned issues and bestow increased confidence upon depositors...|$|R

A statistical regression model for rapid prediction of moisture content based on measurements of dielectric capacitance and test weight was developed for Eastern Canadian corn (Zea mays L.). For 336 samples of the 1986 crop, dielectric readings were determined with a Model 919 grain moisture meter, test weight values with an Ohaus half-litre measure and moisture content values by a single-stage air-oven procedure. The regression model, which incorporates linear terms for dielectric reading and test weight plus an interaction term which is a product of the two, is an excellent predictor of corn moisture as indicated by analysis of the residuals and by the high value of the coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 95) and low value of the standard error of estimate (SEE = 0. 85). Although the relationship between moisture content and dielectric reading for Ontario samples differed from that for Quebec samples, the proposed regression model helped to compensate for the difference. This model was also effective in predicting moisture content for 365 samples of 1987 -crop Eastern Canadian corn. As well, it yielded a better fit to 1986 - 87 crop data than did the dielectric-based regression model used in CGC Corn Moisture Conversion Table No. 9.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} effects of cross-border policy dynamics, specifically state level bottle deposit-redemption systems and international corporate income taxation. As governments can only enact policies within their own jurisdictions, borders often become areas with policy discontinuities. Mobility of economic factors allows firms and consumers to take advantage/arbitrage across such divides. The presence of borders therefore carries important positive and normative policy implications. Chapter 1 analyzes the effect of Michigan's deposit-redemption system on Michigan as well as Indiana and Ohio, two bordering states with no such policy. In conjunction with a sales tax differential between the three states, households are theoretically able to fraudulently redeem out-of-state bottles and evade use taxes via cross-border shopping. I hypothesize that evidence of this behavior should {{be reflected in the}} patterns of retail prices for <b>deposit</b> <b>eligible</b> goods near these borders. Results from a simulated model of imperfect competition and mobile households suggest that the main determinant of prices is travel costs. I then empirically analyze an original dataset and find that retail prices are increasing and decreasing with distance from the border in Indiana/Ohio and Michigan, respectively. At the border, prices are generally higher on the Michigan side. Chapters 2 and 3 analyze the strategic interactions between corporate income taxes of countries that compete to attract mobile firms and capital. Specifically, I analyze the equilibrium revenue implications when competing countries offer preferential tax rates for targeted tax bases. Chapter 2 uses numerical methods to generalize existing theoretical literature in analyzing a less restrictive model of international tax competition. In the context of bilateral tax agreements, I find that countries with greater productivity and population asymmetry generate greater equilibrium revenues by allowing for preferential policies. Conversely, more symmetric countries would do better by banning such policies. Chapter 3 focuses specifically on the equilibrium revenue effect of cross-country profit correlation, i. e., the degree to which firms generate the same profits across different countries. As profit correlation decreases, preferential regimes become more revenue-dominant...|$|R
40|$|Prehistoric site 41 MI 96 in Mills County, Texas was {{subjected}} to archeological data recovery excavations by staff archeologists from the Archeological Studies Program of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in May 1999. This work followed an initial environmental review by TxDOT personnel that concluded that a proposed bridge replacement and associated realignment of a county road (CSJ: 0923 - 23 - 011) had a high probability to impact previously unrecorded archeological sites. Subsequently, an archeological impact evaluation was conducted by TxDOT staff archeologists, {{under the direction of}} Dr. G. Lain Ellis. TxDOT investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit No. 2193 to perform data recovery efforts at 41 MI 96 prior to development impacts. In 2012, TRC Environmental Corporation (TRC) of Austin was contracted by the Environmental Affairs Division of TxDOT through Work Authorization 57 - 109 SA 003 to conduct analysis on the recovered remains and complete a technical report of TxDOT’s field investigations and TRC’s laboratory findings in fulfillment of TxDOTs’ Antiquities permit. Data recovery excavations consisted of the excavation of four mechanical trenches across two creek terraces (T 1 and T 2) and hand-excavations in two small blocks (Blocks 1 and 2) within the TxDOT right-of-way on the northwestern side of the project area. Hand-excavations in both blocks were initiated to target newly discovered burned rock concentrations encountered in the bottom of backhoe scrapings. A total 5. 5 m 3 of manualexcavation was completed, which was comprised of 16 total 1 -by- 1 m units, 11 in Block 1, and 5 in Block 2. Cultural materials were dominated by ca. 602 burned rocks and 2, 846 pieces of lithic debitage, 89 informal and formal tools, but lacked diagnostic artifacts and faunal material. Six small, intact burned rock features were identified in Block 1 and were the focus of laboratory analyses. The scattered burned rocks and debitage from Block 2 were only tabulated and discussed in a general way, as TxDOT personnel believed they were in mixed context. The six small burned rock features ranged in size from 33 to 100 cm in diameter and represented four intact heating elements (two with basins and two without), plus two small burned rock discard piles. Radiocarbon dating of organic residues in nine burned rocks from five intact features indicates multiple occupations over a span of roughly 700 years from 820 to 1450 B. P. (cal A. D. 560 to 1270). The lack of recorded depth measurements for cultural materials, combined with limited sediment deposition between the successive occupations, prevented isolation of individual occupational episodes. The lack of discernible vertical separation in the prehistoric occupations reflects slow soil aggregation during this period, likely lengthy surface exposure and possible erosion between events, and soil conditions which may also account for a near absence of charcoal and other organic materials such as vertebrate remains. Four technical analyses (radiocarbon dating, starch grain, lipid residue, and high-powered usewear) focused on a limited suite of chipped stone tools, associated lithic debitage, and burned rocks collected from five of the six intact features in Block 1 in the T 2 terrace. Starch grain analysis on fragments of 20 burned rocks from five features and 20 chipped stone tools from around the features in Block 1 yielded positive results from 47. 5 percent of the specimens. Of considerable interest is the documentation, in addition to multiple grass species, of grains of the tropical cultigen maize (Zea mays) on two burned rocks each, from Features 2 and 3, plus on two edge-modified tools in the vicinity of those two features. One specific burned rock with a gelatinized maize starch grain on it was directly AMS dated to 980 ± 30 B. P. or cal A. D. 1020 to 1150. Some identified maize starch grains had been damaged through grinding, heating, and/or boiling, evidence of processing as a food resource. This indicates use of maize as a food resource in central Texas a number of centuries earlier than previously suspected. Lipid residue analysis on portions of the same 20 burned rocks from those five features yielded residues in 100 percent of the samples. The results indicate that both plant and animal products were present on all the rocks, with large herbivore lipids (likely bison or deer) present on at least one rock, and oily seed lipids present on at least three rocks. Residues from conifer wood products, here likely juniper trees, were present on 60 percent of the rocks, and indicate at least one specific wood species used to heat the rocks. High-powered microscopic use-wear analyses on 15 chert tools (11 edge-modified flakes, 2 biface fragments, and 2 complete choppers) revealed their use in processing wood, plants, bone, and hide as well as unspecified soft and hard materials. The sparse frequency of formal chipped stone tools likely reflects the limited area investigated and also the possibility that these occupations reflect low-intensity and short-term camps that focused on preparing and cooking a few food resources in heating facilities and the manipulation of other perishable resources. The lipid and starch analyses of the burned rocks provides important information concerning the resources cooked by the rocks in these small burned rock features, most significantly the presence of maize and wild native grasses. These resources would have gone unidentified without these specialized analyses. Continued use of these two analytical techniques on suites of burned rocks from other features/sites in and around central Texas will provide an empirical basis for identifying changes in subsistence patterns over time and across geographical space. It is also notable that direct radiocarbon dating of organic residues contained within the porous sandstone burned rocks here has succeeded in providing satisfactory chronological control for the features and site, strongly indicating that this technique can be beneficially employed in the future in cases where other organics such as wood charcoal, charred seeds/nuts, and/or bone are unavailable for absolute dating. In 1999 the Texas Historical Commission accepted TxDOT’s field investigations as sufficient and concurred with TxDOT’s recommendation that no further work was necessary under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit No. 2193. Parts of site 41 MI 96 outside the current TxDOT right-of-way have not been fully evaluated. Based on the present findings and the excavated intact features in Block 1, it appears that potentially <b>eligible</b> <b>deposits</b> may be present beyond the current right-of-way.

The Bank Guarantee Fund (Bankowy Fundusz Gwarancyjny – BFG) – the Polish institution guaranteeing household deposits – is celebrating its 10 th anniversary this year. Over its 10 years of active operation the BFG has proved that, along with the National Bank of Poland and the Commission for Banking Supervision, it {{is among the most}} important institutions protecting the Polish financial system from destabilisation. The introductory part of this paper presents the position of the Bank Guarantee Fund within the Polish financial safety net. Other guarantee schemes operating in the Polish financial services sector have also been presented. Moreover, the paper explains the reasons for the launching of a DIS and points out the purposes for the establishment of the BFG. Further, it describes the evolution of Polish deposit guarantee arrangements since 1982. Special emphasis has also been put on the analysis of Bank Guarantee Fund administration. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} describe Polish deposit insurance scheme. Particular features of the Polish scheme are discussed with reference to the Community regulations in this field and also arrangements adopted in the remaining 24 countries of the European Union. The third chapter of this paper describes the fundamental area of the Fund’s activity, i. e. guarantee activities consisting in making compensation payouts to depositors in the event of a bank’s bankruptcy. The scope of coverage (<b>eligible</b> types of <b>deposits</b> and depositors) offered by the Polish scheme has been analysed. The scope of the BFG’s guarantee activities from 1995 to 2004 has also been presented. In the fourth chapter, the BFG’s activities aimed at minimising risk in the banking sector have been presented. The principles and experience of the Fund regarding financial support for the rehabilitation of banks threatened with insolvency have been discussed in greatest detail here. The fifth chapter describes the principles and procedures regarding the financing of guarantee and assistance activities of the Bank Guarantee Fund.
