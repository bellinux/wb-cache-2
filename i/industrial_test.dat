50|$|The USB connects {{peripheral}} devices, such as keyboards and mice, to PCs. The USB is a Plug and Play {{bus that}} can handle up to 127 devices on one port, and has a theoretical maximum throughput of 480 Mbit/s (high-speed USB defined by the USB 2.0 specification). Because USB ports are standard features of PCs, they are a natural evolution of conventional serial port technology.

50|$|Cleanliness is {{essential}} to successful electroplating, since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. ASTM B322 is a standard guide for cleaning metals prior to electroplating. Cleaning processes include solvent cleaning, hot alkaline detergent cleaning, electro-cleaning, and acid treatment etc. The most common <b>industrial</b> <b>test</b> for cleanliness is the waterbreak test, in which the surface is thoroughly rinsed and held vertical. Hydrophobic contaminants such as oils cause the water to bead and break up, allowing the water to drain rapidly. Perfectly clean metal surfaces are hydrophilic and will retain an unbroken sheet of water that does not bead up or drain off. ASTM F22 describes {{a version of this}} test. This test does not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but the electroplating process can displace these easily since the solutions are water-based. Surfactants such as soap reduce the sensitivity of the test and must be thoroughly rinsed off.|$|E

50|$|The Taean Machine Complex {{is made up}} of {{a central}} primary {{facility}} and subordinate facilities. The central facility consists of the primary manufacturing plant with facilities for production of electromechanical machinery, insulating materials, building materials, household goods and sewing equipment. The secondary facilities include the first and second processing workshops, and facilities for the production of metal cutting equipment, large generators and turbines, large gears and other similar equipment. The electromechanical machinery facility manufactures electric machinery required for power generation facilities, along with other workshops for the production of electric motors, transformers and other electric machinery, while the insulating material facility produces insulation needed in transformers and electric motors. Other workshops manufacture household items such as fans, universal transformers and sewing machines. There are also facilities for the production of glass fibre and insulation for use with molten steel, along with subsidiaries such as the Yonggang Motor Factory and the T'aesŏng Electric Factory. Other entities forming part of the complex are an insulation research institute, an <b>industrial</b> <b>test</b> centre, an automation design workshop, along with the Taean Industrial College, an electrical engineering college, a design college and a school for related trades.|$|E

Using this craftsman test, Mathez and Leibowitch discover a disturbing frequency of individuals contaminated by the retro-virus amongst the polytranfusion recipients, and later, in collaboration with Dr François Pinon, head of transfusions at the Cochin hospital, go on to discover, the alarming proportion of HV positive blood donors (1 in 200) in a pilot {{study carried out on}} [...] donors in the Paris and Ile-de-France area. The health authorities were alerted on this issue together with their dramatic consequences for hemophiliacs (« if the Cochin Hospital study is correct, then all anti-hemophiliac stocks are contaminated … », Jean Baptiste Brunet at the French General Directory on Health, Mars 1985 13). It was thanks to this artisanal test that 50 HIV positive blood donations, established then to be 100% contaminating, were taken out of the transfusion process, and 150 potential receivers of this blood were protected from contamination.|$|E
