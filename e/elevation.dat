5|$|The primary {{armament}} of the Kongō class {{consisted of}} eight 45-calibre 14-inch guns, mounted in four superfiring twin-gun turrets.

The shells could be loaded at any angle and the guns had a firing cycle of 30–40 seconds. These guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first {{reconstruction of the}} class during the 1920s, the <b>elevation</b> of the main guns was increased {{to a maximum of}} +33 degrees. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E
