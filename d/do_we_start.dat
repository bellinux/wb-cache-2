However, in mid February 2014, President Barack Obama announced his plan to propose a $1 billion “Climate Resilience Fund”. [...] The details of exactly what the fund will seek to accomplish are vague since the fund is only in the stage of being proposed for Congress’s approval in 2015. However, in the speech given the day of the announcement of this proposal, Obama claimed he will request “...new funding for new technologies to help communities prepare for a changing climate, set up incentives to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure. And finally, my administration will work with tech innovators and launch new challenges under our Climate Data Initiative, focused initially on rising sea levels and their impact on the coasts, but ultimately focused on how all these changes in weather patterns are going to have an impact up and down the United States - not just on the coast but inland as well - and how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> preparing for that.” [...] Obama’s fund incorporates facets of both urban resiliency and human resiliency theories, by necessarily improving communal infrastructure and by focusing on societal preparation to decrease the country’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.|$|E

If you walk into a room with some of the many experimental, cognitive psychologists at a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) conference, you can hear them complaining passionately. In fact, they untiringly bemoan their observation that research on HCI lacks methodological rigor. “These studies could advance our knowledge of human cognition and of the unquestionable impact of technology on cognition and behavior, if only, if only, they were done right!” This point of view seems disconcertingly arrogant. However, it is the nature of radical positions to energize new ways of thinking and change. This is what gave JoIS its impetus.|$|R

So Tony Bicat came to the theatre school to see me and he apparently made his mind up there and then that I was this girl." [...] Willcox got the part of Sue, a girl who sang with a band called Bilbo Baggins and was dreaming of appearing on Top of the Pops. In the course of the 30-minute play Willcox performed two songs she had co-written: [...] "Floating Free" [...] (an acoustic ballad, with Phil Daniels accompanying her on guitar) and [...] "Dream Maker". In a 1981 interview, having learned the play's footage had been wiped, Willcox commented: [...] "It's the best thing they could have done with it, really. It was the first time I ever sung in public, and I was shaking like a leaf... and I was so fat!" [...] It was Glitter, though, that launched Willcox's career: it was seen by Kate Milligan and Maximilian Schell, who offered her work with the National Theatre in London, where she got the part of Emma in Tales from the Vienna Woods. [...] "So I got a phone call the following day saying come down to London and I went down to London with a carrier bag and never went back", Willcox remembered. It was at this time that she formed a band, Toyah. In the National Theatre Willcox was known as [...] "The Animal", the nickname John Gielgud gave her after she and a friend [...] "discovered you could have a backwards wheelchair race" [...] and she wheeled herself [...] "into John's private parts".|$|E
