He also expanded his restaurant empire in other areas during 2008, with Murano (alongside Angela Hartnett), York & Albany and Maze Grill also opening. Partly due to the delays in opening the terminal, the restaurant made a loss of £780,767 during the first year.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E

25|$|Aviation {{controllers}} {{are often}} occupied with multiple tasks {{at the same}} time, and hazardous effects can occur when prospective memory fails. In an accident in 1991, a tower controller <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> forgot a step in a simple procedure and that led to two planes crashing into each other, killing a number of passengers and crew. An analysis of over 1300 fatal aviation accidents from 1950-2009 showed that the majority were due to pilot error: 50% attributed to pilot error, 6% due to non-pilot human error, 22% to mechanical failure, 12% to bad weather, 9% to sabotage, and 1% to other causes.|$|E

At a meeting in on 12 January 1934, hosted by Skien Chamber of Commerce, Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, chief aviator in the newly established Norwegian Air Lines, recommended that an airport be built in Skien. The lecture spurred municipal and commercial interest <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airport,</b> and within days there were carried out investigations of possible sites, notably Gråtenmoen, Vallermyrene and Geiteryggen.|$|E
