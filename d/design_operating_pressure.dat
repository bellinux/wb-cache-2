40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project, {{now in the}} {{advanced}} construction phase at CERN, comprises two proton storage rings with colliding beams of 7 + 7 TeV energy. The machine is housed in the existing LEP tunnel with a circumference of 26. 7 km and requires a bending magnetic field of 8. 3 T with 14 m long superconducting magnets operating at 1. 9 K. The beam vacuum system comprises the inner `cold bore' walls of the magnets which provide a nearly perfect cryopump. In view of reducing the cryogenic power consumption, both the heat load from synchrotron radiation emitted by the proton beams and the resistive power dissipation by the beam image currents have to be absorbed on a `beam screen', which operates between 5 and 20 K and is inserted inside the cold bore. The <b>design</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> must provide a beam lifetime of several days and this requirement comes from the power deposition in the superconducting magnet coils due to protons scattered on the residual gas {{which could lead to}} a magnet quench and interrupt the machine operation. Cryopumping of gas on the cold surfaces provides the necessary low gas densities but it must be ensured that the vapour pressure of cryosorbed molecules, of which H/sub 2 / and He are the most critical species, remains within acceptable limits.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis and its' review of a prestresied concrete reactor vessel (PCRV) for a HTR 500 -type nuclear reactor. The assignment of this report is to review the stress and deformation analysis of a PCRV of the HTR 500 -type, which is required {{to get to know the}} entire behaviour of the concrete vessel under various conditions of normal operation including the elastic, elastoplastic and limit state, as well as creep considering the influence of temperature and humidity. In this report the material parameters are taken from literature and they are not all completely true for the HTR- 500 design. Therefore the results cannot be transferred to the real vessel directly. The main aim of this first step of analysis is to test the feasibility of the SMART-code for a complete calculation of PCRV's and to establish the control programms for the finite element analysis. Curved triangular, quadrilateral and membrane shell elements are used in the axisymmetrical finiteelement analysis. The incremental model in the forth of tangential stress-strain law has been chosen as the constitutive model for the concrete. The three parameter failure envelope is used as the failure model of the concrete. For the numerical solution the incremental initial iteration method with constant stiffness is utilized. The creep strain is treated as a liner functional of the stress history and dependent on temperature, humidity and aging. The calculation of the creep behaviour is carriedout up to 7 years of operation using the model of SEKI and KAWASUMI. In this model the influence of temperature, humidity and the interaction between them is fully considered. The effects of interaction between temperature and creep with and without humidity's influence are studied and some interesting results are presented. The total creep curves vs time are gained, the deformations of nodal points after 7 years are 1. 8 - 5. 5 times larger then those of the initial elastic deformation after the first loading. Under the action of prestressing alone most parts ofthe PCRV and under the service condition the main part of the PCRV are in compression. Due to increasing the loading over the operating pressure some parts are cracked and the material behaves nonlinearly. At a loading value of 3. 25 times the operating pressure the whole transverse section is fully cracked. For the stage of prestressing, <b>design</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> and design limit pressure the vessel behaves elastically. The global safety factory is 1. 5 times larger than the design value of 2. 25 that shows the conservative design. The analysis method and computer codes, which are used in this review,are confirmed efficiently. The influences of existing liner and changing of prestressing forces are analyzed. In the next step of this analysis the real material parameters from a study of Prof. Rostasy and Prof. Schneider for the HTR- 500 vessel will be used for a sensitivity analysis including the service condition and the various accident conditions...|$|E
40|$|The PV- 4 {{isostatic}} press {{has a very}} large working volume (98 ft{sup 3 }) that was designed for routine operations at internal pressures up to 30 ksi and is, therefore, a unique and valuable component of the U. S. DOE Y- 12 manufacturing capability. More than 13, 000 pressing operations have been conducted since initiation of operations in September 1960. The pressure vessel portion consists of three concentric cylinders of high-strength steel with the outer two cylinders shrink-fitted on the imermost cylinder to minimize tensile stresses on the inner surface of the vessel. The third, outermost cylinder consists of two sections; each section is one-half {{the length of the}} pressure vessel. The vessel is contained within a large frame which is made of T- 1 steel. In 1982 and 1983 precision strain gauges were mounted at selected locations on the frame and the outer surface of the pressure vessel to monitor the operating stresses. Where possible, locations of the gauges mounted in 1982 and 1983 were at or near the same locations as the strain gauges mounted in 1960 to monitor stresses on the frame and vessel during preoperational testing and design verification of the press. This report presents the information obtained with these strain gauges for tests conducted in September 1960 prior to any operation of the press and for the period July 1983 to August 1997. On September 8 and 9, 1960, Sturm & Krouse used 120 strain gauges on the frame and 20 strain gauges on the outer surface of the pressure vessel to measure strains in PV- 4 as a function of operating pressure from O to 33 ksi. Although the design maximum operating pressure of the press was 30 ksi, to provide a safety factor for operations at 30 ksi and to assure totally elastic behavior of the steel components of the frame and pressure vessel at pressures above the design pressure, strains were also measured at operating pressures of 32 and 33 ksi. Sturm & Krouse observed that the stresses on the frame and vessel were a linear function of operating pressure over the test range from O to 33 ksi. They verified the design performance and parameters of the press and linear elastic behavior to at least 10 % higher than the <b>design</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure.</b> Stresses calculated from strain gauge measurements taken between July 29, 1983, and August 5, 1997, at an operating pressure of 30 ksi are in good to excellent agreement with those obtained in September 1960 on the frame and are in excellent agreement with those obtained on the pressure vessel. In addition, slopes of the measured strain as a function of internal pressure have remained the same from preoperational testing on September 8 and 9, 1960, through August 5, 1997, the last date on which strain measurements were conducted. Also, there have been no systematic changes in the zero strain values for measurements taken with the same data acquisitions ystem. The excellent agreement of the stresses and slopes measured from 1983 to 1997 with those measured in 1960 indicates that no cracks, defects, or other flaws have developed in the pressure vessel that could affect the integrity of the pressure vessel. Also, this excellent agreement indicates that there has not been any relaxation of the original shrink-fit pressures that were employed in fabrication of the vessel. Therefore, the original shrink-fit pressures may be used for stress analysis of the pressure vessel and for estimating the fatigue life of the vessel. The excellent agreement of the stresses and slopes of strain as a function of internal pressure obtained for the period 1983 to 1997 with those obtained in 1960 are exactly as expected for the metallurgical structure of the steels of which the press frame and pressure vessel were constructed. To assure long-term integrity of the pressure vessel and that the shrink-fit pressures are not relaxed, continued monitoring of the vessel with precision strain gauges is required...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{cryogenic liquid}} oxygen, liquid methane (LOX/LCH 4) reaction control system (RCS) was tested at NASA Glenn Research Center's Plum Brook Station in the Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility (B- 2) under vacuum and thermal vacuum conditions. The RCS is a subsystem of the Integrated Cryogenic Propulsion Test Article (ICPTA), a pressure-fed LOX/LCH 4 propulsion system {{composed of a}} single 2, 800 lbf main engine, two 28 lbf RCS engines, and two 7 lbf RCS engines. Propellants are stored in four 48 inch diameter 5083 aluminum tanks that feed both the main engine and RCS engines in parallel. Helium stored cryogenically in a composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) flows through a heat exchanger on the main engine before being used to pressurize the propellant tanks to a <b>design</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> of 325 psi. The ICPTA is capable of simultaneous main engine and RCS operation. The RCS engines utilize a coil-on-plug (COP) ignition system designed for operation in a vacuum environment, eliminating corona discharge issues associated with a high voltage lead. There are two RCS pods on the ICPTA, with two engines on each pod. One of these two engines is a heritage flight engine from Project Morpheus. Its sea level nozzle was removed and replaced by an 85 : 1 nozzle machined using Inconel 718, resulting in a maximum thrust of 28 lbf under altitude conditions. The other engine is a scaled down version of the 28 lbf engine, designed to match the core and overall mixture ratios {{as well as other}} injector characteristics. This engine can produce a maximum thrust of 7 lbf with an 85 : 1 nozzle that was additively manufactured using Inconel 718. Both engines are film-cooled and capable of limited duration gas-gas and gas-liquid operation, as well as steady-state liquid-liquid operation. Each pod contains one of each version, such that two engines of the same thrust level can be fired as a couple on opposite pods. The RCS feed system is composed of symmetrical 3 / 8 inch lines that tap off of the main propellant manifold to send LOX and LCH 4 outboard to the RCS pods. A Thermodynamic Vent System (TVS) is used to condition propellants at each pod by venting through an orifice and then routing the cold expansion products back through tubing that is welded along {{a large portion of the}} main RCS feed lines. Prior to final installation on the ICPTA, the RCS engines were tested in a small vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Energy Systems Test Area (ESTA) to verify functionality of the new COP ignition system and check out operation of the vacuum nozzles. After engine-level testing, the RCS engines were installed on the vehicle and a series of integrated hot-fire tests were performed at JSC consisting of various pulsing and steady-state firings as well as integrated main engine/RCS operation. The ICPTA was then integrated into the Plum Brook B- 2 facility for vacuum and thermal/vacuum testing. Testing in the B- 2 facility was composed of multiple thermal and pressure environments. The first set of tests were performed under ambient temperature and altitude pressure conditions. These tests consisted of a range of minimum impulse bit (MIB) pulsing sequences with low duty cycle, analogous to a coast phase in which the RCS is primarily used for station keeping. The primary goal of this sequence is to understand how propellant conditions were effected without an active TVS. In this scenario, consistent gas-gas operation is desirable since it results in a smaller MIB and more efficient propellant consumption. Multiple skin thermocouples are mounted on the feedlines, in addition to a submerged thermocouple on each commodity, in order to gather thermal data on the system. Higher duty cycle pulsing tests were then performed, analogous to an ascent or landing mission phase. The primary goal of this sequence was to examine how well the engines self-conditioned without active TVS when starting from a quiescent state. The TVS was then activated during some tests to demonstrate the capability to quickly condition the engines for higher pulsing demand scenarios. A thermocouple at the TVS outlet allows for the calculation of energy absorbed by the vented propellant. Lastly, tests with longer pulses and multiple engines firing either in sequence or simultaneously were run in order to gather transient system response data on waterhammer. Six total high-speed pressure transducers are installed on the RCS system, one sensor at the end of each propellant manifold line on the pods, and one at the tap-off location for each commodity. This will allow for the accurate characterization of waterhammer in the system under various propellant conditions and firing sequences. Other instrumentation for this test series includes nozzle throat thermocouples, chamber pressure measurement, heat soakback measurement, and tank wall plume impingement temperature measurement. The next set of tests were performed to demonstrate simultaneous main engine and RCS operation. Data from this test will be used to examine if there is any change to nominal operation of the RCS as a result of feed system interaction or other phenomenon. Some of these tests began under high vacuum conditions (target ambient pressure less than 1 x 10 (exp - 3) torr) and others began at altitude conditions. The last set of tests were performed with the B- 2 cold wall active. Under these tests, many of the same low duty cycle MIB tests were repeated in order to characterize how propellant conditions changed with the lower heat leak. In this scenario the RCS manifold experiences much less heat leak, resulting in a change to how well the engines self-condition. As a result, an increase in maximum waterhammer pressures and a change in natural frequency of the system was expected due to higher density propellants. The lower heat leak should also result in a change to the MIB pulse profile, and data will be examined to understand how MIB repeatability is affected in the different operating environments. Parallel to the test efforts, a set of transient model development efforts were made to predict RCS performance. The primary effort was aimed at producing a SINDA/FLUINT model to predict propellant conditioning up to the engine inlet as a function of different environmental and operating parameters, with the goal of predicting chamber pressure, TVS performance, and propellant consumption over time. Preliminary results for this effort will be presented in comparison with test data. Additional modeling efforts were made using SINDA/FLUINT to predict waterhammer in the system since the software is capable of handling multiphase transient fluid dynamics. These results will be compared with the high-speed pressure transducer test data for validation purposes...|$|E
40|$|Entropy {{generation}} in the receiver tube of a parabolic trough solar collector can mainly {{be attributed to}} the fluid friction and finite temperature differences. The contribution of each of these components is investigated under different circumstances. Mass flow rates, tube diameters and <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> are investigated to obtain good guidelines for receiver tube and plant <b>design.</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>pressures</b> between 3 MPa (saturation temperature of 233. 9 °C) and 9 MPa (saturation temperature of 303. 3 °C) were investigated. Results show that small diameters can result in excessive fluid friction, especially when the mass flow rates are high. For most cases, tube diameters beyond 20 mm will exclusively be subject to entropy generation due to finite temperature differences, and entropy generation due to fluid friction will be small to negligible. Increasing the concentration ratio will decrease entropy generation, due to a higher heat flux per unit meter. This will ultimately result in shorter receiver tube lengths. From a simulated annealing optimization it was seen that if the diameter is increased, the entropy generation can be lowered, provided that the concentration ratio is kept constant. However, beyond a certain point gains in minimizing the entropy generation become negligible. The optimal <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> will generally increase if the mass flow rate is increased.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on a {{numerical}} second law analysis and optimisation of a receiver tube op- erating in a parabolic trough solar collector for small-scale application. The receiver functioned in a Rankine cycle. The focus was on entropy generation minimisation in the receiver due to the high quality exergy losses in this component. Water functioned as the working uid and was heated from ambient conditions (liquid) to a superheated state (vapour), consequently, the receiver tube was subject to both single phase as well as two-phase ow. Entropy generation in the receiver tube was mainly due to nite temperature di erences as well as uid friction. The contribution {{of each of these}} components was investigated. Geometrical as well as operating conditions were investigated to obtain good guidelines for receiver tube and plant <b>design.</b> An <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> in the range of 1 MPa (Tsat = 180 C) to 10 MPa (Tsat = 311 C) was considered. Furthermore a mass ow range of 0 : 15 kg=s to 0 : 4 kg=s was investigated. Results showed that beyond a diameter of 20 mm, the main contributor to the entropy generation was the nite temperature di erences for most conditions. Generally, <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> below 3 MPa showed bad performance since the uid friction component was too large for small <b>operating</b> <b>pressures.</b> This phenomenon was due to long two-phase lengths and high pressure drops in this region. The nite temperature di erence component increased linearly when the tube diameter was increased (due to the increase in exposed area) if the focused heat ux was kept constant. However, the uid friction component increased quadratically when the diameter was reduced. In general when the concentration ratio was increased, the entropy generation was decreased. This was due to more focused heat on each section of the receiver pipe and, in general, resulted in shorter receiver lengths. Unfortunately, {{there is a limit to}} the highest concentration ratio that can be achieved and in this study, it was assumed to be 45 for two-dimensional trough technology. A Simulated Annealing (SA) optimisation algorithm was implemented to obtain certain optimum parameters. The optimisation showed that increasing the diameter could result in a decrease in entropy generation, provided that the concentration ratio is kept constant. However, beyond a certain point gains in minimising the entropy generation became negligible. Optimal <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> would generally increase if the mass ow rate was increased. Finally, it was seen that the highest <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> under consideration (10 MPa) showed the best performance when considering the minimisation of entropy in conjunction with the maximisation of the thermodynamic work output.

The Lee-Kesler-Plocker (LKP) and the Starling modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWRS) empirical models were used to simulate the compressibility factor, enthalpy and hence heat leakage at various pressures to determine the factors that affect the BOG in typical LNG tanks of different capacities. Using a case study data the heat leakage of 140, 000 kl, 160, 00 kl, 180, 000 kl and 200, 000 kl LNG tanks were analyzed using the LKP and BWRS models. The heat leakage of LNG tanks depends on the structure of tanks, and the small tanks lose heatto the environment due to their large surface area to volume ratio. As the operation pressure was dropped to 200 mbar, all four of the LNG tanks’ BOG levels reached 0. 05 vol%/day.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether improvements could be made to increase the capture distance of traditional local exhaust ventilation (LEV) hoods by designing a circular slotted-hood. The criterion of success for this study was to achieve increases in capture velocity at an upstream distance equal to the diameter of the hood (11 inches). By increasing capture velocity further from the face, contaminant capture could take place at distances more convenient to the circular slotted-hood operator while maintaining adequate suction. This was to be achieved by the addition of two slots and a flange to a traditional conical hood opening. Three plates were designed to change the geometry of a plain conical hood (slot area: 0. 1334, 0. 0963 and 0. 0694 ft 2). They were tested at different airflow rates (243, 347, 467, 647, 897 cubic feet per minute) for a set number of distances from the hood face using a thermal anemometer. Three-dimensional maps of performance were created for visual comparisons, and t-tests were conducted to analyze performance by comparison of velocity at any point upstream of the hood. Velocity contours illustrated that two of the three designs had greater capture velocities compared to the standalone conical hood, and paired t-tests confirmed the significance (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Each of the new designs failed to significantly increase capture distance further than 11 inches from the hood. However, increased velocities occurred near the hood opening (within 5 inches).

Peak temperature is observed to decrease with increasing <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> for a given level of preheat and dilution. OH mass faction is reduced with increasing pressure. The CO emissions show little sensitivity to <b>operating</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, CO mass fraction is slightly higher at 1  atm <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> as compared to 4 to 16  atm. Since the residence time of reactants increases as the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> increases, well-stabilized MILD combustion is observed for all highly diluted and low temperature preheat cases (3 % O 2 and 1100  K) ...|$|R

It is, however, desirable to habe an equitable method for metering and allocating the energy costs to the invidual occupants. Therefore, this study was undertaken for the Gas Research Institute to evaluate te current technology status of available thermal Btu meters for individual metering. The previous Phase I study measured the accuracies and operating characteristics of both new and used Btu metyers and their individual components. Also, serveral European companies were visited te review their experiences with Btu meters. This Phase II study evaluated the flow control features of one type of constant flow device, and also reviewed the literature to find methods of preventing magnetiite formation in these hydronic systems. The constant flow devices gave very accurate flow control over their <b>design</b> <b>operating</b> range of <b>pressure</b> differentials, and this could be used with Btu meters instead of conventional-type flow meters that exhibit larger errors and are prone to magnetite fouling problems. The study of magnetite and prevention indicates that a properly buffered and inhibited hydronic water loop should form very little corrosion products. Another solution would be to use an all-copper boiler and hydronic systems. Also, noninstrusive-type flow meters that do not use magnetic couplings or pickups would minimize the effects of magnetite buildup. ...|$|R

The findings indicated credible downwind lethal / semi lethal threat distance up to 300 meters. The conclusions of the H 2 S toxic risk assessment combined with the inherent safe design guidelines have yielded an entirely new set of requirement for the risk reduction. To start with it was realized that safe distance control room should be constructed and facilities should be designed for the remote operation, utilizing the new trends of foundation field bus, electronic marshaling and SIL- 3 fiber optic sensors. The facility should be access controlled with mandatory PPE requirement of personal H 2 S monitors and personal quick donning (5 sec) escape SCABA (15 minutes capacity). The centrifugal compressors should be new generation design of enclosed and hermetically sealed type, levitated with magnetic bearing, without dry gas seals and oil lubrication.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 A novel design, material, and {{fabrication}} method {{are presented}} to fabricate a passive micro-ball valve. Microvalves are critical components in microflow control devices {{used to control}} the fluid flows in microchannels. These microflow control devices can be integrated with microsensors to form micro analysis systems. Glass/silicon-based fabrication is complicated and expensive. Therefore, other materials and fabrication methods have been proposed. In this research, Melinex 453, a polyester film, and pressure sensitive adhesives were used to fabricate a micro-ball valve by a microlamination method. The valve was designed to have a 450 μm diameter glass ball floating inside a chamber size of 800 μm. The ball will permit flow in the forward direction and impede flow in the reverse direction. The fabrication method consists of three steps: patterning, registration and bonding. The patterning step was accomplished using laser micromachining. Registration and bonding were performed {{with the use of}} a pin-alignment fixture. Pressure sensitive adhesive was used in the bonding step using double-sided acrylic adhesive tape. The micro-ball valve has advantages over other microvalves in terms of little dead volume, simple <b>design,</b> disposability, low <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> in forward direction, and low leakage in reverse direction. The micro-bal 1 valve was characterized by pressure drop testing at different flow rates from 1 to 7. 5 ml/min. The experimental results tend to agree with a simple theoretical model of the pressure drop through an orifice. Moreover, an average pressure drop diodicity of at least 2980 has been achieved...|$|R
