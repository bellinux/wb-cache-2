In X. Li's study, the potential application of a commercial piezoelectric energy harvester in a central hub building at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia is examined and discussed. Optimization of the piezoelectric tile deployment is presented according to the frequency of pedestrian mobility and a model is developed where 3.1% of the total floor area with the highest pedestrian mobility is paved with piezoelectric tiles. The modelling results indicate that the total annual energy harvesting potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1MWh/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building. In Israel, there is a company which has installed piezoelectric materials under a busy highway. The energy generated is adequate and powers street lights, billboards and signs.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} various {{formulations of}} characteristics-based schemes {{in the framework}} of the artiﬁcialcompressibility method for variable-density incompressible ﬂows. In contrast to constant-density incompressible ﬂows, where the characteristics-based variables reconstruction leads to a single formulation, in the case of variable <b>density</b> <b>ﬂows</b> three diﬀerent schemes can be obtained henceforth labeled as: transport, conservative and hybrid schemes. The conservative scheme results in pseudo-compressibility terms in the (multi-species) density reconstruction. It is shown that in the limit of constant density, the transport scheme becomes the (original) characteristics-based scheme for incompressible ﬂows, but the conservative and hybrid schemes lead to a new characteristics-based variant for constant <b>density</b> <b>ﬂows.</b> The characteristics-based schemes are combined with second and third-order interpolation for increasing the computational accuracy locally at the cell faces of the control volume.

40|$|Sediment grains in {{carbonate}} turbidity currents {{vary greatly}} in size, shape, surface texture, and density {{depending on the}} evolution of the source carbonate platform in time and space. Facies character and distribution may vary from traditional siliciclastic turbidite models {{not only because of the}} difference in composition but also because variation in grain properties influences flow and depositional behavior. Experimental gravity flows were generated to investigate one control on this variation. The experiments used silicon carbide (= 3214 kg m– 3) and glass ballotini (= 2650 kg m– 3) with a similar grain-size distribution in varying proportions to assess the influence of particle <b>density</b> on <b>flow</b> and sedimentation processes. Mixed-particle <b>density</b> <b>flows</b> were more efficient than single-particle <b>density</b> <b>flows.</b> Flow propagation was faster in flows with greater initial bulk density determined by grain density and suspended-sediment concentration.

As a result mixed-particle <b>density</b> <b>flows</b> transported more sediment downstream compared to single-particle <b>density</b> <b>flows</b> of similar initial suspended-sediment volume concentration.

Cable breaking sediment <b>density</b> <b>flows</b> are triggered in nearly all areas exposed to tropical cyclones but most occur in the NW Pacific.

50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its <b>density,</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E

A constant-coefficient Poisson equation is solved for the pressure following both the predictor and corrector steps to fully satisfy the continuity equation at each time step. Spatial discretization is performed on a collocated grid system that offers computational simplicity and straightforward extension to curvilinear coordinate systems. To avoid the pressure odd-even decoupling that is typically encountered in such grids, a flux interpolation technique is introduced for the equations governing variable <b>density</b> <b>flows.</b> An important characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that it can be applied to flows in both open and closed domains. Its robustness and accuracy are illustrated with a series of numerical experiments.
