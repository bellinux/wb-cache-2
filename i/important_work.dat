5|$|Bernoulli {{wrote the}} text between 1684 and 1689, {{including}} {{the work of}} mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens, Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat, and Blaise Pascal. He incorporated fundamental combinatorial topics such as his theory of permutations and combinations (the aforementioned problems from the twelvefold way) {{as well as those}} more distantly connected to the burgeoning subject: the derivation and properties of the eponymous Bernoulli numbers, for instance. Core topics from probability, such as expected value, were also a significant portion of this <b>important</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|IUPAC is {{best known}} for its works {{standardizing}} nomenclature in chemistry and other fields of science, but IUPAC has publications in many fields including chemistry, biology and physics. Some <b>important</b> <b>work</b> IUPAC has done in these fields includes standardizing nucleotide base sequence code names; publishing books for environmental scientists, chemists, and physicists; and improving education in science. IUPAC is also known for standardizing the atomic weights of the elements through one of its oldest standing committees, the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote {{some of his most}} <b>important</b> <b>work,</b> including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.|$|E

5|$|Rodin {{earned his}} living collaborating with more {{established}} sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural {{pieces in the}} style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next <b>important</b> <b>work,</b> St. John the Baptist Preaching.|$|E
5|$|She {{found so}} much {{information}} about female patriots that {{the first edition of}} The Women of the American Revolution (1848) had to be published in two volumes. These volumes were well received, and a third volume of additional material was published in 1850. Later historians consider these volumes to represent her most <b>important</b> <b>work.</b> Ellet also authored Domestic History of the American Revolution summarizing the same material in narrative form and also published in 1850.|$|E
5|$|The 17th century {{mathematician}} Kamalakara, was a forward-looking astronomer-mathematician {{who studied}} Hindu, Greek and Arabic astronomy. His most <b>important</b> <b>work</b> was the Siddhanta-Tattvaviveka. He studied and agreed with Ptolemaic {{notions of the}} planetary systems. He {{was the first and}} the only traditional astronomer to present geometrical optics. Kamalakara proposed a new Prime Meridian which passed through the imaginary city of Khaladatta, and provided a table of latitudes and longitudes for 24 cities within and outside of India.|$|E

5|$|When the House {{convened in}} December 1849, a member from Mercer County {{nominated}} Breckinridge for Speaker against two Whigs. After receiving 39 votes—8 {{short of a}} majority—on the first three ballots, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Assigned to the committees on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic floor leader during the session. Davis wrote that his most <b>important</b> <b>work</b> during the session was bank reform.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing <b>important</b> <b>work</b> activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an <b>important</b> <b>work</b> of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work was a set of lampposts for the Plaça Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first <b>important</b> <b>work.</b> He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Plaça Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Born Elizabeth Fries Lummis, in New York, she {{published}} {{her first}} book, Poems, Translated and Original, in 1835. She married the chemist William Henry Ellet {{and the couple}} moved to South Carolina. She had published several books and contributed to multiple journals. In 1845 she moved back to New York and took {{her place in the}} literary scene there. She was involved with a public scandal involving Edgar Allan Poe and Frances Sargent Osgood and, later, another involving Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Ellet's most <b>important</b> <b>work,</b> The Women of the American Revolution, was published in 1845. The three volume book profiled the lives of patriotic women in the early history of the United States. She continued writing until her death in 1877.|$|E

5|$|Carl Eytel (September 12, 1862 – September 17, 1925) was a German American {{artist who}} built his {{reputation}} for paintings and drawings of desert subjects in the American Southwest. Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran Desert, Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert, and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Eytel's most <b>important</b> <b>work,</b> Desert Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the <b>important</b> <b>work</b> of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement {{to write a book}} refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, for more than a century, Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his <b>important</b> <b>work</b> on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Roa Bastos adapted Yo, el Supremo for the screen. His {{first novel}} since Yo, el Supremo, Vigilia del admirante (1992; Vigil of the Admiral) was {{published}} in 1992, and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor) the following year. Although neither of his later novels had the impact of his earlier work, El fiscal is considered an <b>important</b> <b>work.</b> Roa Bastos died on April 26, 2005 in Asunción from a heart attack. He was survived by his three children, his third wife, Iris Giménez, and {{a reputation as one}} of Latin American's finest writers.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most <b>important</b> <b>work</b> and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} early medieval sources {{relevant}} to Thurisind that survive, {{the only one}} providing independent evidence of the king, accounts of Justinian's wars, and {{a detailed account of}} the relations between Gepids and Lombards and their kings is De Bellis (550s), the most <b>important</b> <b>work</b> of Procopius. Considered the greatest historian of the 6th century, Procopius was a Greek writer born in Caesarea in Palestine in 527. The Lombard–Gepid wars are well described in Procopius' work, as the conflict played an important part in the Byzantine plans to invade Italy by a land route.|$|E
