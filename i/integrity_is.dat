5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. <b>Integrity</b> <b>is</b> ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E

The novel served as the basis for Sergei Prokofiev's opera The Fiery Angel.|$|E
25|$|Biological testing {{involves}} the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an aquatic ecosystem. They are any biological species or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> present. One example of a group of bio-indicators are the copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, or behavioral) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{for some}} Christians, {{it may be}} {{inferred}} that the Bible cannot both refer to itself as being divinely inspired and also be errant or fallible. For if the Bible were divinely inspired, then the source of inspiration being divine, would {{not be subject to}} fallibility or error in that which is produced. For them, the doctrines of the divine inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy, are inseparably tied together. The idea of Biblical <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> a further concept of infallibility, by suggesting that current Biblical text is complete and without error, and that the integrity of Biblical text has never been corrupted or degraded. Historians note, or claim, that the doctrine of the Bible's infallibility was adopted hundreds of years after those books were written.|$|E

25|$|For ZFS, data <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> {{achieved}} {{by using a}} Fletcher-based checksum or a SHA-256 hash throughout the file system tree. Each block of data is checksummed and the checksum value is then saved in the pointer to that block—rather than at the actual block itself. Next, the block pointer is checksummed, with the value being saved at its pointer. This checksumming continues {{all the way up}} the file system's data hierarchy to the root node, which is also checksummed, thus creating a Merkle tree. In-flight data corruption or phantom reads/writes (the data written/read checksums correctly but is actually wrong) are undetectable by most filesystems as they store the checksum with the data. ZFS stores the checksum of each block in its parent block pointer so the entire pool self-validates.|$|E
25|$|Cellular DNA <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> often {{compromised}} in cancer. Genome instability {{can refer}} to the accumulation of extra copies of DNA/chromosomes, chromosomal translocations, chromosomal inversion, chromosome deletions, single stranded breaks in DNA, double stranded breaks in DNA, the intercalation of foreign substances into the DNA double helix, or any abnormal changes in DNA tertiary structure that can cause either the loss of DNA, or the misexpression of genes. It appears that H19 expression is tightly linked to the ploidy of the cell. Diploid liver cells express high levels of H19, whereas the polyploid cell fraction do not express H19. Also, diploid mesenchymal stem cells express high levels of H19 compared to polyploid mesenchymal stem cells. Knock-down of H19 lead to increased polyploidization of mesenchymal stem cells, and induced polyploidy resulted in reduced expression of H19, providing a direct link between H19 expression {{and the amount of}} DNA within the cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} on an Eco-socialist revolution, Kovel advocates the “rapid {{conversion}} to ecosocialist production” for all enterprises, followed by “restoring ecosystemic integrity to the workplace” through steps like workers ownership. He then {{believes that the}} new enterprises can build “socially developed plans” of production for societal needs, such as efficient light-rail transport components. At the same time, Kovel argues for the transformation of essential but, under capitalism, non-productive labour, such as child care, into productive labour, “thereby giving reproductive labour a status equivalent to productive labour”. During such a transition, he believes that income should be guaranteed and that money will still be used under “new conditions of value… according to use and to {{the degree to which}} ecosystem <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> developed and advanced by any particular production”. Within this structure, Kovel asserts that markets will become unnecessary – although “market phenomena” in personal exchanges and other small instances might be adopted – and communities and elected assemblies will democratically decide on the allocation of resources.|$|E

25|$|While local (to a {{database}} system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized {{only when the}} application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which apparently have been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives {{due to lack of}} a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency control method in a 2010 edition of a text-book on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles). This book neither mentions CO nor references it, and strangely, apparently does not consider CO a valid Global serializability solution.|$|E

500|$|Zihuatanejo {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an analogue for heaven or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific ocean, whose name means [...] "peace". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised following Andy's admission of guilt over his wife's death. Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption. While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, {{it can also be}} interpreted as a Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he {{can be seen as a}} Zarathurstra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Ebert argued that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> lacking.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Andy Webster of The New York Times said, [...] "Its bargain-basement {{production}} {{values and}} lack of wit unexpectedly prove a greater liability than an asset". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times criticized its characters, costumes, and dialogue; he said it [...] "so desperately wants to be cultishly admired...that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of John Carpenter, The Warriors, Mad Max 2, and A Clockwork Orange, and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was [...] "a junky, disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, and forget about the next morning". Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave it 1½ stars out of 4, and called it a [...] "humorless void" [...] and a [...] "wannabe cult hit". Eric Hynes of The Village Voice said, [...] "the film's charm fades fast" [...] and , [...] "he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that <b>integrity</b> <b>is</b> best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. Mission accomplished, for whatever that's worth." [...] Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not [...] "obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is [...] "just plain badand boring, and repetitive" [...] and that [...] "as comedy, it just feels numbing". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film [...] "is {{by no means the}} worst thing I've ever seen", but that it [...] "should have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die".|$|E
