25|$|As the Mongols pushed westward and devastated their state, {{most of the}} Cumans fled to Hungary, {{as well as the}} Second Bulgarian Empire {{since they}} were major {{military}} allies. The Cuman participation {{in the creation of the}} Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. Bulgarian Tsar Ivan-Asen II was descended from Cumans and settled them in the southern parts of the country, bordering the Latin Empire and the Thessallonikan Despotate.

25|$|The Ottoman {{conquest of}} Bosnia marked {{a new era}} in the country's history and {{introduced}} tremendous changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> cultural landscape of the region. Although the kingdom had been crushed and its high nobility executed, the Ottomans nonetheless allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity - a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans. Within this sandžak (and eventual vilayet) of Bosnia, the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.|$|E
25|$|Bredenkamp gained {{considerable}} clout <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> {{economic affairs}} of Zimbabwe. It {{is known that}} he {{played a significant role}} in the events surrounding Zimbabwe's intervention in the DRC between 1998 and 2003. This intervention involved using the Zimbabwean army and air force to support the Kabila government in its war with rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. There appears to have been some linkage between the intervention and generous mining concessions granted by the DRC to figures in the Zimbabwe political and business elite. When Zimbabwe was subject to EU sanctions from 1999 onwards, the Mugabe regime was able to call on sanctions busting expertise from the UDI era to keep its armed forces supplied.|$|E

25|$|Russia {{remains the}} largest and most {{important}} partner for Belarus both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' customs duties were unified in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian industry, Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of raw materials and components. After initial negotiation with the Russian Central Bank on monetary union, the Russian ruble was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Constantinople (modern Istanbul) was {{the capital}} of the Byzantine Empire until 1453, when the city was conquered by Ottoman forces. A large {{indigenous}} Greek community continued to live in the multi-ethnic Ottoman capital city. The city’s Greek population, particularly the Phanariotes, came to {{play a significant role in}} the social and economic life of the city and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> diplomatic life of the Islamic but multi-ethnic, multi-religious Ottoman Empire in general. This continued even after rebellions against Ottoman rule in Greece and the establishment of an independent Greek state in 1829, although during the Greek War of Independence massacres against local Greek communities occurred. A number of ethnic Armenians and Greeks, who served in the Ottoman Imperial diplomatic service and were even leading politicians in the 19th and early 20th century, were targeted.|$|E
25|$|In {{alliance}} with the Bulgarians and Vlachs, the Cumans {{are believed to have}} {{played a significant role in}} the Vlach-Bulgar Rebellion led by brothers Asen and Peter of Tarnovo, resulting in victory over Byzantium and the restoration of Bulgaria's independence in 1185. Istvan Vassary states that without the active participation of the Cumans, the Vlakho-Bulgarian rebels could never have gained the upper hand over the Byzantines, and ultimately without the military support of the Cumans, the process of Bulgarian restoration could never have been realised. The Cuman participation in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. The Cumans were allies in the Bulgarian-Latin Wars with emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria, who was descended from the Cumans. In 1205, at the Battle of Adrianople (1205), 14,000 Cuman light cavalry contributed to Kaloyan's crushing victory over the Latin Crusaders. Cuman troops continued to be hired throughout the 13th and 14th century by both the Bulgarians and Byzantines.|$|E
