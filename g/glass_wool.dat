5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} <b>glass</b> <b>wool</b> is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make <b>glass</b> <b>wool</b> in 1933. The first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber, they introduced continuous filament glass fibers. Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.|$|E

The kingdom produced <b>glass,</b> <b>wool,</b> and was famous for breeding and trading in the Kunga, a hybrid of a donkey and a female onager. Tell Brak remained an important commercial center during the Akkadian period, {{and was one of}} Mitanni's main trade cities. Many objects were manufactured in Mitannian Tell Brak, including furniture made of ivory, wood and bronze, in addition to glass. The city provided evidence for the international commercial contacts of Mitanni, including Egyptian, Hittite and Mycenaean objects, some of which were produced in the region to satisfy the local taste.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, <b>glass</b> <b>wool,</b> cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E

In October 2001, an international expert {{review by the}} International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) re-evaluated the 1988 IARC assessment of glass fibers and removed <b>glass</b> <b>wools</b> from its list of possible carcinogens by downgrading the classification of these fibers from Group 2B (possible carcinogen) to Group 3 (not classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans). All fiber <b>glass</b> <b>wools</b> that are commonly used for thermal and acoustical insulation are included in this classification. IARC noted specifically: [...] "Epidemiologic studies published during the 15 years since the previous IARC Monographs review of these fibers in 1988 provide no evidence of increased risks of lung cancer or mesothelioma (cancer of {{the lining of the}} body cavities) from occupational exposures during manufacture of these materials, and inadequate evidence overall of any cancer risk." ...|$|R

Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and <b>glass</b> <b>wool.</b> The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E

50|$|Lyon was {{the center}} of France's banking and {{international}} trade markets. Market fairs occurred four times a year and facilitated the exportation of French goods, such as cloth and fabrics, and importation of Italian, German, Dutch, English goods. It also allowed the importation of exotic goods such as silks, alum, <b>glass,</b> <b>wools,</b> spices, dyes. Lyon also contained houses of most of Europe's banking families, including Fugger and Medici. Regional markets and trade routes linked Lyon, Paris and Rouen {{to the rest of the}} country. Under Francis I and Henry II, the relationships between French imports and the exports to England and to Spain were in France's favor. Trade was roughly balanced with the Netherlands, but France continually ran a large trade deficit with Italy due to the latter's silks and exotic goods. In subsequent decades, English, Dutch and Flemish maritime activity would create competition with French trade, which would eventually displace the major markets to the northwest, leading to the decline of Lyon.|$|R

At micro-scale, manufacturers, familiar with a manufacturing process, have the ability to modify the microstructure of these materials. Establishing relationships between macroscopic model parameters and the characteristics of the microstructure is important, not only to improve our knowledge of the dissipation mechanisms, but also to optimize the materials through the manufacturing process. In this work, extensive measurements were performed on five <b>glass</b> <b>wools</b> for different manufacturing parameters. The macroscopic parameters were obtained by direct or indirect characterization methods and the microstructure described using SEM images. Measurement methods were then discussed and some of their limits identified for the specific case of fibrous materials. An abundant literature containing empirical or analytical relations exists to link microstructure and macroscopic parameters. Most of them were confronted with the measured data. Finally, analytical relations were selected to determine the porosity and the characteristics lengths from the density and the fiber diameters. Resistivity was provided with the same microstructure parameters according to an empirical relation.

25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as <b>glass</b> <b>wool</b> in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E

Managing director Birger Natvik at the Norwegian insulation material company Glassvatt (today Glava AS) saw the announcement and suggested that the company take on the challenge. He estimated that by isolating the ice with <b>glass</b> <b>wool</b> ("glassvatt" [...] in Norwegian) made from fibreglass, the driver could make several million francs.

Altogether, sponsors from eight countries financed the expedition, including Glassvatt's French mother company, the Saint-Gobain corporation.
