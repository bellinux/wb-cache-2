5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize <b>Geneticist,</b> Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock.

Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false paternity are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
5|$|George Ledyard Stebbins Jr. (January 6, 1906 – January 19, 2000) was an American {{botanist}} and <b>geneticist</b> who {{is widely}} {{regarded as one of the}} leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century. Stebbins received his Ph.D. in botany from Harvard University in 1931. He went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where his work with E. B. Babcock on the genetic evolution of plant species, and his association with a group of evolutionary biologists known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis of plant evolution incorporating genetics.|$|E
50|$|Theodosius Dobzhansky, a {{postdoctoral}} {{worker in}} T. H. Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by}} the work on genetic diversity by Russian <b>geneticists</b> such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population <b>geneticists</b> and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population <b>geneticists,</b> these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population <b>geneticists</b> and put it into a more accessible form. Many more biologists were influenced by population genetics via Dobzhansky than were able to read the highly mathematical works in the original.|$|R

5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian <b>geneticist</b> Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in her teens, Regina {{traveled}} to Germany {{to visit her}} brother. It was there she met <b>geneticist</b> and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan {{to go to the}} United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.|$|E

5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a <b>geneticist,</b> Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with <b>geneticist</b> E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins {{was made}} a full {{professor}} in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, physiologist William Hiesey and the evolutionary <b>geneticist</b> Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker. With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, {{and was one of}} the few botanists involved with the new organization.|$|E

5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from <b>geneticist</b> Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins's Ph.D. {{was granted}} by Harvard in 1931. In March that year, he married Margaret Chamberlin, {{with whom he}} had three children. In 1932, he took a {{teaching}} position in biology at Colgate University. While at Colgate, he continued his work in cytogenetics; in particular, he continued to study the genetics of Antennaria and began to study the behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid peonies bred by biologist Percy Saunders. Saunders and Stebbins attended the 1932 International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. Here, Stebbins's interest was captured by talks given by Thomas Hunt Morgan and Barbara McClintock, who spoke about chromosomal crossover. Stebbins reproduced McClintock's crossover experiments in the peony, and published several papers on the cytogenetics of Paeonia, which established his reputation as a <b>geneticist.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} demands for genetic counselling and DNA diagnostics in cardiogenetics, the roles of cardiologists and clinical <b>geneticists</b> {{in the delivery of}} care need to be redefined. We investigated the preferences of both groups of professionals with regard to the future allocation of six cardiogenetic responsibilities in counselling and testing, using hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as a prevalent model disease. In this cross-sectional survey, the participants were Dutch cardiologists (n = 643) and clinical <b>geneticists</b> (n = 60), all members of professional societies. Response rates were 33 and 82 %, respectively. In both groups, the majority preferred to perform most of the tasks described above in collaboration. Informing HCM patients about the genetics of HCM and requesting DNA testing in symptomatic patients was viewed by 43 and 35 % of cardiologists, respectively, as their sole responsibility, however, and 39 and 59 % of clinical <b>geneticists</b> did not object to these views. Both groups felt that the task of discussing the consequences of HCM for offspring and that of discussing the results of DNA diagnostics should be shared or performed by clinical <b>geneticists.</b> Both groups considered co-ordination of family screening the sole responsibility of clinical <b>geneticists.</b> Opinions on who should request DNA diagnostics in asymptomatic relatives were divided: 86 % of clinical <b>geneticists</b> considered it their exclusive responsibility, 10 % of cardiologists believed that this task could be performed individually by either group and 30 % preferred to collaborate. Most professionals said that they would appreciate education programmes and clinical guidelines. Both cardiologists and clinical <b>geneticists</b> prefer to share rather than divide most cardiogenetic responsibilities in caring for HCM patients. Consequently, capacity problems in both groups are to be expected.
