[...] We grew up together and we complete each other off and on court – the first rule of doubles is communication." [...] He adds: [...] "Yoni and I are very proud of being Israelis.

2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (<b>Ever</b> <b>Since</b> <b>We</b> Met...)" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Ballad of Mona Lisa" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Alternative Press as [...] " [...] the upbeat pop energy of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, with the focus and clarity of Pretty. Odd." [...] Urie has explained that he and Smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former: [...] "We missed a couple things from our first record in terms of sonically, with these little instruments that we hadn’t really used on our second record. There [...] a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers. So we wanted to get back to some of that." [...] Smith agreed, and stated [...] "I think there's stuff from the first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy." [...] "The Calendar", originally written about an intimate relationship between a male and a female, soon began to resemble the friendships in former members Ross and Walker; the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group. [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] was written for Urie's wife. [...] "'Sarah Smiles' is about my girlfriend, actually, as sappy as that is," [...] he told Spin in 2011. [...] "When I met her I wrote this song to try and impress her. I was infatuated with her. I played it for her and we've been dating ever since. That was a huge step for me, personally." [...] "Nearly Witches (<b>Ever</b> <b>Since</b> <b>We</b> Met...)" [...] was rejected for inclusion on Pretty. Odd. due it not fitting within the concept of the album; Urie and Smith finished the song for Vices & Virtues.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. <b>Ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
