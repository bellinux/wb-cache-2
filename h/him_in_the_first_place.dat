Vegeta then came in to fight Frieza being able to transform to the form as well. Vegeta outmatched Frieza showing the flaw of his new form where his body hasn't been used to the energy that gets consumed. Out of desperation, Frieza had destroyed Earth but with Whis' do over ability, Goku was able to prevent Frieza from destroying the Earth after being too over confident against <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> and destroys him once more.|$|E

25|$|Another pre-game storyline {{involved}} backup Steelers tight end/fullback Sean McHugh. McHugh, {{who spent}} {{the past three seasons}} with the Detroit Lions, made that team's 53-man roster {{at the end of the}} preseason, only to be released 24 hours later alongside linebacker Anthony Cannon in order for the Lions to make room for linebacker Ryan Nece and running back Marcus Thomas. The Steelers promptly signed McHugh after the team traded center Sean Mahan back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a draft pick before the start of the season. The subsequent media attention surrounding McHugh had to do with him being deemed not good enough for the Lions (a team that would finish 0–16, the NFL's first imperfect season since the expansion 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), but good enough for a Super Bowl team such as the Steelers and being a valuable blocker for Ben Roethlisberger and Willie Parker. McHugh himself had mixed feelings about the situation, feeling bad for his former Lions teammates, but also feeling it's a little payback for the Lions for releasing <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> McHugh would play in the Super Bowl as a blocker, much like his regular season role.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} a short medley that comprised [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", [...] "What's My Name?"

Another medley, consisting of [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] and [...] "I Need a Doctor", was {{performed a}}t the 2011 Grammy Awards. [...] While the Chicago Sun-Times considered the track an unnecessary sequel, the BBC reviewer James Skinner wrote, Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' even bests the original, Eminem's verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> But it is Rihanna's vocal—at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable—that anchors the song".|$|E
500|$|Hancock {{began to}} feel the {{pressure}} of directing his first epic adventure film [...] "with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas". The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after {{a meeting with the}} producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for Rome and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months. Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still couldn't swim or bite after a year and a half; [...] "You get a couple of shots and [...] breaks." [...] Echoing the first film's production, Carl Gottlieb was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence. Gottlieb wrote on location at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{said that}} “Loud works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, {{maintaining}} the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until {{it gets to}} 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of The Washington Post said that [...] "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever." [...] James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, [...] "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly afterward, Conservative Minister Titu Maiorescu, {{leader of}} the {{influential}} literary club Junimea and himself one of Lazăr Șăineanu's former professors, appointed him to a position at the University, within the History and Literature Department of V. A. Urechia. The latter, an outspoken antisemite and prominent member of the opposition National Liberal group, reacted strongly against the measure, launching that claim that, unlike an ethnic Romanian, a Jew [...] "could never awaken in the mind and heart of the young generation the image of our past laden with lessons for the future". According to Șăineanu's own recollection, he had not himself asked for the university appointment, and suspected that it was offered to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> so that the Gheorghe Lazăr position would be assigned to [...] "a favorite of the day, the former tutor of Prince Ferdinand." [...] He nevertheless noted that Urechia had {{a conflict of interest}} when opposing his appointment, given that he had designed the department around his own chairmanship, and that, with the aid of University of Iași academic Alexandru D. Xenopol, he had set in motion a set of [...] "miserable intrigues" [...] to maintain his hold on the faculty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} into multiple languages, {{but all the}} lip syncing was for the English dialogue: this was done partly to show western audiences appreciation for their support of the title, and also because Japanese audiences had grown used to out-of-sync dialogue with dubbed Western films. English voice recording was done in Los Angeles. Localization was handled by Microsoft: initially, different departments in each region handled localization for their region. The need to translate and then include the material at long distance proved problematic, so the main development team brought the localization team into the main production, introducing them to easy-to-use development tools so changes could be made easily without direct consultation with Feelplus. The story segments written by Shigematsu were translated by Jay Rubin, a noted American academic and translator from Harvard University noted for translating the works of Haruki Murakami. Microsoft chose Rubin as they wanted Shigematsu's material treated and translated with the utmost respect possible. When first approached, Rubin was skeptical, as {{he did not want}} to work in a medium that generally seemed to glorify violence. However, he eventually agreed to have a look at the material, and was shocked by the anti-violence message present throughout all the stories while remaining family-friendly. He referred to the messages within Shigematsu's stories as [...] "essentially Buddhistic", and was surprised that Microsoft had contacted <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> given the stories' visual novel medium within the context of Lost Odyssey.|$|E
