We observe that physical (analog) mobility can be modeled {{in the same way}} as logical (<b>discrete)</b> <b>mobility</b> is modeled in the π-calculus by means of channel name passing. We chose SPIN because it supports channel name passing and can model reconfigurations. We extend the syntax of PROMELA and the verification algorithms based on the expected semantics.

40|$|In vitro {{phosphorylation}} of {{the regulatory}} subunit of yeast cAMP-dependent protein kinase was studied. The cAMP-binding regulatory subunit (R subunit) can be multiply phosphorylated. Three distinct phosphorylation sites were inferred from the different ATP concentrations required for phosphorylation and from the presence of two <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> shifts in NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the R subunit on phosphorylation. Limited tryptic digestion of the phosphorylated R subunit showed that a Mr 37, 000 cAMP-binding peptide contained one of the phosphorylation sites and that a separate Mr 12, 000 peptide contained another phosphorylation site. The yeast R subunit is therefore similar to the type II R subunit of mammalian origin, although it has a larger Mr (64, 000 vs. 58, 000) and is multiply phosphorylated. In vivo, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the R subunit were found in cells grown in lactate or to stationary phase in 1. 5 % glucose, while cells grown in 5 % glucose contained the unphosphorylated form...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{connection}} of two scales in the relaxation of axisymmetric crystal surfaces with a facet via an ad hoc evaporation-condensation model. We provide numerical evidence that the continuum slope determined under “natural boundary conditions ” at the facet, which are derived solely from continuum thermodynamics, follows closely the underlying discrete dynamics. At the microscale, the discrete scheme consists of a large system of differential equations for the radii of repulsively interacting line defects (steps) separated by terraces. We solve this system numerically and thereby describe step collapses {{on top of the}} facet. Each step velocity is proportional to the step chemical potential, the variation of the total step free energy; the relevant <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> is assumed linear in the width of the upper terrace. At the macroscale, the facet is a free boundary for a second-order, diffusion-like, nonlinear partial differential equation for the slope, which we study via the extended gradient method, boundary layer theory and a self-similarity ansatz. The proof of convergence of the discrete (step) scheme to the continuum solution is not addressed...|$|E

40|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} is {{the standard}} method to separate, identify and purify nucleic acids. SSCP detects single base changes by altered mobility of single-stranded segments electrophoresed through non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Herein, changes in electrophoretic mobilities due to single base substitutions were measured for single-stranded segments of lengths ranging from 333 to 547 nt. A 484 nt segment in exon H of the human factor IX gene was studied most intensively. After SSCP, mobilities were determined by scanning autoradiograms at very high resolution (1200 d. p. i.), which allowed precise measurement of mobilities. When the mobilities of 46 single base substitutions were characterized, the distribution of mutant segments relative to a wild-type control {{was found to be}} discrete, i. e. the observed mobility values occurred in distinct ranges. <b>Discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> distributions were seen at different electrophoretic temperatures, buffer concentrations, segment lengths and segment sequences. In addition: (i) single base substitutions caused discontinuous distributions between highly dispersed and sharp bands; (ii) at least one single-stranded segment produced two sharp bands of similar intensity. These observations suggest that: (i) the single base changes in DNA segments in the size range 333 – 547 nt result in discrete conformational changes; (ii) individual DNA molecules of the same DNA segment can occasionally adopt two or more discrete conformations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study {{linkages}} of two {{scales in}} the relaxation of an axisymmetric crystal with a facet in evaporation-condensation kinetics. The macroscale evolution {{is driven by}} the motion of concentric circular, repulsively interacting line defects (steps) which exchange atoms with the vapor. At the microscale, the step velocity is proportional to the variation of the total step free energy, leading to large systems of differential equations for the step radii. We focus on two step flow models. In one model (called M 1) the <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> is simply proportional to the upper-terrace width; in another model (M 2) the mobility is altered by an extra geometric factor. By invoking self-similarity at long time, we numerically demonstrate that (i) in M 1, discrete slopes follow closely a continuum thermodynamics approach with “natural boundary conditions ” at the facet edge; (ii) in contrast, predictions of M 2 deviate from results of the above continuum approach; and (iii) this discrepancy can be eliminated via a continuum boundary condition with a geometry-induced jump for top-step collapses. At the macroscale, both step models give rise to free-boundary problems for a second-order, parabolic partial differential equation, which we study via the subgradient formalism. We discuss the interpretation of the facet height as shock and prove convergence of the solution of each discrete scheme to the (weak) entropy solution of a conservation law if steps do not interact...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{fractionation}} of proteins in solution {{in which an}} electrophoretic adaptation {{of the principles of}} the Clusius column is utilized was suggested by Kirkwood in 1941 (1) and tested experimentally by Nielsen and Kirkwood (2) several years later. Recently an electrophoresis-convection apparatus of improved design has been described and successfully used in the fractionation of the pseudoglobulin of horse diphtheria antitoxin (3) and bovine serum proteins (4). Fractionation occurs in a narrow vertical channel between two semipermeable membranes, connecting an upper and lower reservoir. Separation depends upon the superposition of diflerential horizontal electrophoretic transport of the components on vertical convective transport of the solution as a whole. The vertical convective transport is controlled by the horizontal density gradient produced by the electrophoretic migration of the proteins across the channel. The result of the superposition of horizontal electrophoretic transport and vertical convective transport is movement of the mobile components from the top reservoir to the bottom reservoir at rates depending on their mobilities, with a relative enrichment of the top reservoir with respect to the slow components and the bottom reservoir with respect to the fast components. The separation of a protein mixture possessing <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> and isoelectric point spectra, e. g. serum, into its constituent proteins is accomplished by successive immobilization of the components at their respective isoelectric points and transport of the mobile components from the top reservoir of the apparatus...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that environmental events may trigger permanent and seasonal migration but less {{attention has been}} given to the way they shape the everyday mobility that shapes household livelihood strategies. This dearth of attention can be traced to a lack of statistical data, the difficulties of collecting information on local space-time trajectories and the absence of sound statistical measures by which to express them. We review prior work on the migration-environment nexus and trace the development of methods that aim to capture and measure temporary population movement. We identify nine <b>discrete</b> dimensions of <b>mobility</b> and introduce the Mobility in Space and Time among Individuals and Communities (MISTIC) toolkit that is designed to capture the spatio-temporal patterns of household everyday mobility using a flexible, participant centred approach that facilitates data recording and subsequent analysis. We illustrate application of the toolkit using data from 90 smallholder, subsistence households in semi-arid rural Northeast Brazil.

40|$|Key {{clinical}} studies for HIV coreceptor antagonists {{have used the}} phenotyping-based Trofile test. Meanwhile various simpler-to-do genotypic tests have become available that are compatible with standard laboratory equipment andWeb-based interpreta-tion tools. However, these systems typically analyze only the most prominent virus sequence in a specimen. We present a new diagnostic HIV tropism test not needing DNA sequencing. The system, XTrack, uses physical properties of DNA duplexes after hybridization of single-stranded HIV- 1 envV 3 loop probes to the clinical specimen. Resulting “heteroduplexes ” possess unique properties driven by sequence relatedness to the reference and resulting in a <b>discrete</b> electrophoretic <b>mobility.</b> A detailed optimi-zation process identified diagnostic probe candidates relating best to {{a large number of}} HIV- 1 sequences with known tropism. From over 500 V 3 sequences representing all main HIV- 1 subtypes (Los Alamos database), we obtained a small set of probes to determine the tropism in clinical samples. We found a high concordance with the commercial TrofileES test (84. 9 %) and the Web-based tool Geno 2 Pheno (83. 0 %). Moreover, the new system reveals mixed virus populations, and it was successful on speci-mens with low virus loads or on provirus from leukocytes. A replicative phenotyping system was used for validation. Our data show that the XTrack test is favorably suitable for routine diagnostics. It detects and dissects mixed virus populations and viral minorities; samples with viral loads (VL) of< 200 copies/ml are successfully analyzed. We further expect that the principles of the platform can be adapted also to other sequence-divergent pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C viruses.

40|$|We {{describe}} an efficient method for introducing and analyzing a comprehensive set of mutations in a cloned gene to map its functional organization. The technique, genetic footprinting, uses a retroviral integrase {{to generate a}} comprehensive library of mutants, each of which bears a single insertion of a defined oligonucleotide at a random position in the gene of interest. This mutant library is selected for gene function en masse. DNA samples are isolated from the library {{both before and after}} selection, and the mutations represented in each sample are then analyzed. The analysis is designed so that a mutation at a particular location gives rise to an electrophoretic band of <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility.</b> For the whole library, this results in a ladder of bands, each band representing a specific mutation. Mutants in which the inserted sequence disrupts a feature that is required for the selected function, ipso facto, fail the selection. The corresponding bands are therefore absent from the ladder of bands obtained from the library after selection, giving rise to a footprint representing features of the gene that are essential for the selected function. Because the sequence of the inserted oligonucleotide is known, and its position can be inferred precisely from the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding band, the precise location and sequence of mutations that disrupt gene function can be determined without isolating or sequencing individual mutants. This method should be generally applicable for saturation mutagenesis and high-resolution functional mapping of cloned DNA sequences...|$|E

The mobility analyzer was carefully tested by a new method to prove the laminarity of flow and the air velocity distribution inside the apparatus. The quantity of charged aerosol particles classified into <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> (or size) groups was estimated by the iX-radioactivity of collected particles tagged before entering the analyzer by ThB ions. The electrical mobility analyzer was then completed by a sonic jet diffusion charger for unipolar aerosol charging by diffusion and the elctrical parameters of this device were tested to ensure reliable operation. The activity size spectra A(r) were transformed to relative particle size distribution curves N(r). The measurements were carried out in Stockholm, Sweden, under varying physical conditions (varying the activity, the residence time, the collector voltage or applying the diffusion charger for unipolar charging of particles). All experiments gave very similar results. The activity curves A(r) of positive and negative particles as a function of radius show a similar profile with a maximum in the region of radius r = 3 - 6 x 10 - 6 cm corresponding to Junge's model of aerosol particle distribution. The calculated relative particle size distribution curves N(r) are not always characterized by a peak as expected from Junge's model but are increasing below radii r < 10 - 6 em, so that no peak is evident. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} three decades, rural-urban migrant-workers have been a driving force for China’s econ- omy, raising {{attention}} on associated socio-economical issues. However, {{the importance of their}} economic diversity and social mobility has been poorly considered in the analysis of urban development strategy. We use an agent-based model to simulate residential dynamics of migrants in Pearl River Delta (PRD) mega city region, taking into account the full range of migrants’ socio-economical status and their evolution. Mega-city regions have become a new scale of Chinese State regulation, and PRD represent the most prosperous and dynamic one in term of migration waves, standing as an ideal unit of analysis. Our model unveils emergent patterns of dynamics, from micro behavior rules of <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> choices. These choices are conditional to urban and economic environment, which evolution is controlled by meso-scale independent dynamics. The two scales are coupled through the dependance of discrete choice utilities to generalized accessibility that combines patch-level urban and economic context with a feedback of the dynamics themselves. This multi-scale aspect is crucial to distinguish endogenous form exogenous effects in regional migration patterns. We perform simulations to internally validate the model on synthetic data, by assessing statistical consistence and establishing phase diagrams across the parameter space. The application to the case study allows first to test how variation in socio-economic status yield more complex trajectories, and secondly to identify how the Party-State persist in controlling internal migration flows in a more sophisticated and strategically redefined way. Further work is directed towards a qualitative external validation of the model, by calibrating free parameters to reproduce meso-scale stylized facts, in order to guide interpretations of emergent outputs and potential policy applications...|$|E

40|$|Among the {{branches}} of astronomy, radio astronomy is unique in that it spans the largest portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, e. g., from about 10 MHz to 300 GHz. On the other hand, due to scientific priorities as well as technological limitations, radio astronomy receivers have traditionally covered only about an octave bandwidth. This approach of "one specialized receiver for one primary science goal" is, however, not only becoming too expensive for next-generation radio telescopes comprising thousands of small antennas, but also is inadequate to answer some of the scientific questions of today which require simultaneous coverage of very large bandwidths. This thesis presents significant improvements {{on the state of}} the art of two key receiver components in pursuit of decade-bandwidth radio astronomy: 1) reflector feed antennas; 2) low-noise amplifiers on compound-semiconductor technologies. The first part of this thesis introduces the quadruple-ridged flared horn, a flexible, dual linear-polarization reflector feed antenna that achieves 5 : 1 - 7 : 1 frequency bandwidths while maintaining near-constant beamwidth. The horn is unique in that it is the only wideband feed antenna suitable for radio astronomy that: 1) can be designed to have nominal 10 dB beamwidth between 30 and 150 degrees; 2) requires one single-ended 50 Ohm low-noise amplifier per polarization. Design, analysis, and measurements of several quad-ridged horns are presented to demonstrate its feasibility and flexibility. The second part of the thesis focuses on modeling and measurements of <b>discrete</b> high-electron <b>mobility</b> transistors (HEMTs) and their applications in wideband, extremely low-noise amplifiers. The transistors and microwave monolithic integrated circuit low-noise amplifiers described herein have been fabricated on two state-of-the-art HEMT processes: 1) 35 nm indium phosphide; 2) 70 nm gallium arsenide. DC and microwave performance of transistors from both processes at room and cryogenic temperatures are included, as well as first-reported measurements of detailed noise characterization of the sub-micron HEMTs at both temperatures. Design and measurements of two low-noise amplifiers covering 1 [...] 20 and 8 — 50 GHz fabricated on both processes are also provided, which show that the 1 [...] 20 GHz amplifier improves the state of the art in cryogenic noise and bandwidth, while the 8 [...] 50 GHz amplifier achieves noise performance only slightly worse than the best published results but does so with nearly a decade bandwidth. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGas-injection {{enhanced}} oil recovery (EOR) has good displacement efficiency but poor sweep efficiency. Foam can improve sweep efficiency in these processes, but its direct injection {{would not be}} practical due to its poor injectivity. Field {{results suggest that the}} well injectivity can be improved if gas and surfactant solution are injected in alternating slugs, leading to foam creation inside porous medium as gas and surfactant intermingle in situ. This process, referred to as Surfactant Alternating Gas (SAG), aims at reducing gas mobility at the displacement front. Behind the front, because of low water saturation, foam collapses (partially or completely); thus, gas mobility gradually increases to its original mobility at the injection well. This can potentially lead to fingering of the highly-mobile gas into the region with low-mobility gas in the form of foam. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this phenomenon has not been investigated in the literature, apparently due to poor grid resolutions employed in the numerical simulations and/or focus on other parameters, from which it is difficult to infer instabilities. In this paper we use an implicit-texture foam model to simulate a SAG process with fine grid resolution. The magnitude of the instabilities decreases with weaker foam, coarser grid resolution, increasing diffusion, and inclusion of capillary pressure, suggesting that fingering reflects the intrinsic physics of the process: it is not a numerical artifact. In a successful SAG process, as long as there is enough surfactant ahead of the gas bank to form a region with low mobility, the fluid ahead of it is efficiently displaced (i. e., stable front exists). In numerical simulations, however, there are extremely low <b>discrete</b> <b>mobility</b> values in grid blocks located at the front. In such a process, there can be fingering within the foam bank (unstable displacement), while the foam front itself appears relatively stable. Further studies are required to verify the extent to which simulations of fingering reflect numerical artifacts at the front. These results have practical implications, especially in calculation of the well injectivity and design of optimum slug size and foam strength in a SAG process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In a {{partially}} connected ad hoc network, two nodes communicate and share data {{when they are}} in proximity. For the query based (QB) scheme, a node retrieves data from another node by querying. Search efficiency deteriorates when the query success probability is small. We propose a Bloom filter based (BF) scheme to improve search efficiency. A data holder summarizes its content by a Bloom filter and broadcasts it to the data querier. The data querier then transmits a query only when the requested data is available. We first consider the single neighbor scenario, and derive the long run bandwidth utilization of a connection. More generally, a node may find multiple neighbors and neighbor relationship changes dynamically with time. Querying is more efficient due to the presence of multiple data holders. There may also be multiple Bloom filter transmissions over a busy period, reducing the effective data transmission time of the BF scheme. For a fair comparison of the QB and BF scheme, we characterize the search efficiency, as a function of node density. Numerical study shows that an optimal Bloom filter consumes negligible overhead, even in low bandwidth scenarios. We conclude that the BF scheme is superior for data retrieval. Our performance evaluation makes use of the M/M/ ∞ queue to model mobility, parametrized on node encounter rate and connection time. Moreover, the analysis is node-centric, avoiding the use of <b>discrete</b> locations, unrealistic <b>mobility</b> and interference models. This technique is novel and can be used for studying the impact of mobility in other mobile networks...|$|R
40|$|Proteoglycans {{extracted}} with 4 M-guanidinium chloride from pig laryngeal cartilage and bovine {{nasal septum}} were purified by density-gradient centrifugation in CsCl under 'associative' followed by 'dissociative' conditions [Hascall & Sajdera (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 2384 - 2396]. Proteoglycans were then digested exhaustively with testicular hyaluronidase, which removed about 80 % of the chondroitin sulphate. The hyaluronidase was purified until no proteolytic activity was detectable under the conditions used for digestion. The resulting 'core' proteins of both species were fractionated by {{a sequence of}} gel-chromatographic procedures which gave four major fractions of decreasing hydrodynamic size. Those that on electrophoresis penetrated 5. 6 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gels migrated as <b>discrete</b> bands whose <b>mobility</b> increased with decreasing hydrodynamic size. The unfractionated 'core' proteins had the same N-terminal amino acids as the intact proteoglycan, suggesting that no peptide bonds had been cleaved during hyaluronidase digestion. Alanine predominated as the N-terminal residue in all the fractions of both species. Fractions were analysed for amino acid, amino sugar, uronic acid and neutral sugar compositions. In pig 'core' proteins, the glutamic acid content increased significantly with hydrodynamic size, but in bovine 'core' proteins this trend was less marked. Significant differences in amino acid composition between fractions suggested that in each species {{there was more than}} one variety of proteoglycan. The molar proportions of xylose to serine destroyed on alkaline beta-elimination were equivalent in most fractions, indicating that the serine residues destroyed were attached to the terminal xylose of chondroitin sulphate chains. The ratio of serine residues to threonine residues destroyed on beta-elimination, was similar in all fractions of both species. Since the fractions of smallest hydrodynamic size contained less keratan sulphate than those of larger size, it implies that in the former the keratan sulphate chains were shorter than in the latter...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploration}} of the shifting role of race in Jewish American literature begins in the immediate postwar period, when Time magazine trumpeted the Jewish writer as a “culture hero” and newly-anointed spokesperson for the age. To many Americans, {{the role of the}} Jewish writer was allegorical, the embodiment of countless hopes and anxieties during the post-Holocaust atomic age. For a number of Jewish American writers, however, accepting the role of representative for suffering Everymankind was not in the least an allegorical move.
