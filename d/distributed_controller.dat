Light-weight controllets also allow for pushing control logic onto switches to minimize latency and communication overhead.

40|$|Abstract — A {{distributed}} supervisory controller {{is proposed}} to achieve battery component swapping modularity (CSM) for a plug-in {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV). The CSM permits the designer to distribute a part of the supervisory controller to the battery module such that the PHEV can use a range of batteries while providing corresponding optimal fuel economy. A novel feedback based controller for the charge sustaining mode is proposed to facilitate <b>distributed</b> <b>controller</b> design for battery CSM. The method based on sensitivity analysis of the control signals with respect to the battery hardware parameter is introduced to define the controller distribution architecture.

40|$|Robotic {{control systems}} are {{increasingly}} relying on <b>distributed</b> feedback <b>controllers</b> to tackle complex sensing and decision {{problems such as}} those found in highly articulated human-centered robots. These demands come {{at the cost of}} a growing computational burden and, as a result, larger controller latencies. To maximize robustness to mechanical disturbances by maximizing control feedback gains, this paper emphasizes the necessity for compromise between high- and low-level feedback control effort in <b>distributed</b> <b>controllers.</b> Specifically, the effect of <b>distributed</b> impedance <b>controllers</b> is studied where damping feedback effort is executed in close proximity to the control plant and stiffness feedback effort is executed in a latency-prone centralized control process. A central observation is that the stability of high impedance <b>distributed</b> <b>controllers</b> is very sensitive to damping feedback delay but much less to stiffness feedback delay. This study pursues a detailed analysis of this observation that leads to a physical understanding of the disparity. Then a practical controller breakdown gain rule is derived to aim at enabling control designers to consider the benefits of implementing their control applications in a distributed fashion. These considerations are further validated through the analysis, simulation and experimental testing on high performance actuators and on an omnidirectional mobile base.
