40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Zootécnica - Produção Animal - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe rabbit is a mammal, rodent and {{belongs to}} the lepórideos family. The rabbit‟s {{creation}} can be {{an alternative to the}} production far-reaching animals. The rabbit meat is consumed in different world regions, being Europe the principal market. It has an elevated protein content associate to low cholesterol. The European Union presents approximately 54 % of the world-wide consumption of rabbit meat, being Italy the biggest consumer. China is the biggest producer of rabbit meat, being Europe at second place. Portugal is opened to new implementations of explorations of rabbit meat production, since the capacity of the auto-provision does not reach 100 %. It exists at present countless rabbits breeds, divided in function of the adult weight in: giant or big breeds, middle breeds, small breeds, and dwarf breeds. Two of the principal meat production breeds are the Californian and the New Zeeland. In the current production are normally used hybrids of improved lines where were represented these two breeds. The three principal diseases of the rabbit are particularly Myxomatoxis, Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD) and epizootic rabbit enteropathy. The animals must be subject to a plan of vaccines with the advice of a veterinarian. The rabbits can begin his sexual behavior approximately to 3, 5 - 4 month‟s age. The best zootechnic results are obtained with a photoperiod of 16 horas of darkness and 8 horas of light (for the females), with a room temperature of 14 - 24 º C and moisture of 60 - 80 %. The handling in animals groups and the use of artificial insemination allows an organization of work on the rabbit‟s farm with a <b>fixed</b> <b>day</b> <b>weekly</b> for the principal activities, and it allows to group females in the same physiological state. The intensive exploration system (rest period minimum) makes difficult the females maintenance in good physical conditions leaving them more vulnerable. The artificial insemination 11 days after the childbirth (semi-intensive system) allows the maintenance of reproducers more time in reproduction because so manages to restore his physical reserves before next artificial insemination. The environmental factors can influence the animal‟s productivity and the control of these factors is very important in the production. So, from the type of the building, his direction, the animal density, temperature, moisture, light, ventilation, the food, etc., it can affect the economical results of a rabbit‟s exploration. There are different types of accommodation; they may be open-air, in semi-free-air, ship and classic ship industry. The orientation of housing is very important when using natural ventilation. The structure of the pavilions can be metal or in cement, the covering in plate (metal or cement) or of the type sandwich, the walls from cement or the type sandwich panels. The manure produced by rabbits can be withdrawn by water (elevated consumption of water), surface pit (cleaning of manual), deep pit (great accumulation of gases) and semi-deep pit (that is more used nowadays). The cleaning of the pits in the great explorations is automatic. The density of rabbits for cage in the fattening is of 15 rabbits for m 2, in the maternity of 0, 25 - 0, 3 for m 2 and in the substitution 0, 2 for m 2. The cages can be type flat-deck, Californian, battery, floor 1 + 1 / 2 or of 1 floor (these last ones are most used) ...|$|E

50|$|Flag Day {{was created}} by law Nº 12,361, on June 8, 1938. Initially, it was a celebration held in a <b>fixed</b> <b>day,</b> but law Nº 24,445 {{modified}} it to be commemorated on the third Monday of the month. This design creates long weekends and boost tourism. Within the jurisdiction of Rosario, however, June 20 is always a non-working day for employees of the municipal and provincial administrations, and for all public and private schools. Hermes Binner made a project of law in 2006 to derogate this modification and restore both celebrations in <b>fixed</b> <b>days,</b> but the proposal expired because of not being treated by the Congress in a whole year. Nevertheless, Binner (governor of Santa Fe by then) and the mayor of Rosario, Miguel Lifschitz, insisted in the 2010 Flag Day that Congress should repeal the law and restore the commemoration to <b>fixed</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R
