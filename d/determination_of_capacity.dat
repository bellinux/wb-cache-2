His thesis on the nature of tactical subdivision in combat was that <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> for tactical subdivision was capability for separate maneuver, offense, and resistance.In developing the Interposing Tactics concept, the Liddell Hart concept of the 'combat unit' (which in his time period, was the smallest grouping capable of tactical subdivision, namely the infantry platoon), has been redefined as, [...] "single individual fighters and unmanned or independently operating weaponry."The Interposing Tactics concept, further identifies, that in an area of operations, in particular terrorism or insurgency operations, there can be many independent fighters who are spread out independently through a population, and concealed among opponent combat forces (even within their own control zones), and can independently block and cover individual opponent forces.|$|E

40|$|For more urbanization, {{engineering}} structures {{are not limited}} to underground tunnels or metro stations, engineers are constructing underground multistoried building even underground city. Therefore accurate assessment of rock strength is necessary for the rational design of underground structures. Bearing <b>capacity</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important factor for assessment of rock strength. Various studies on <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> for intact as well as jointed rock mass have been performed. Concisely, various studies have been performed for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> rock mass under dry condition while for submerged condition, it is outnumbered. In this study, <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> submerged bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> rock mass is attempted. Most cases, the rock substratum is considered to be homogeneous, intact, but the practical scenario does not recommend so. In-situ rock mass variability renders the deterministic analysis to be inefficient and hence there arises the necessity for probabilistic or reliability analyses to model the uncertainties. Rather than calculating a deterministic factor of safety, a reliability based analysis is more appropriate for geotechnical design. Present study comprises of different aspects regarding ultimate bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> rock foundations for both dry and submerged condition. These are, development of algorithmic modelling for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> ultimate bearing <b>capacity</b> for both dry and submerged condition, analysis of behavior <b>of</b> ultimate bearing <b>capacity</b> due to the effect of submergence, comparative study between theorem mechanisms and reliability analysis through Monte-Carlo simulation for various parameters of rock mass.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate on the {{introduction}} of capacity markets in most European countries while {{a few of them}} have already established capacity markets.

Besides the impact on generation investments, market prices and system costs we analyse effects on production and security of supply. While coordinated capacity markets reveal high potentials for cross border synergies and cost savings, uncoordinated and unilateral implementations can lead to inefficiencies, in particular free riding effects and endanger security of supply due to adverse allocation of generation capacity...|$|E

40|$|Many present {{markets for}} goods and {{services}} have highly volatile demand due to short life cycles and strong competition in saturated environments. <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> levels is difficult because capacities often need to be set long before demand realizes. In order to avoid capacity-demand mismatches, operations managers employ mix-flexible resources which allow them to shift excess demands to unused capacities. The Flexibility Design Problem (FDP) models the decision on the optimal configuration of a flexible (manufacturing) network. FDP is a difficult stochastic optimization problem, for which traditional exact approaches are not able to solve but the smallest instances in reasonable time. We develop a Flexibility Design Genetic Algorithm (FGA) that exploits qualitative insights into the structure of good solutions, such as the well-established chaining principle, to enhance its performance. FGA is compared to a commercial solver, a simple GA, and a Simulated Annealing local search on instances of up to 15 demand types and resources.

Conceptual aspects related to seismic vulnerability, damage and risk evaluation are discussed first, together with a short review {{of the most widely}} used possibilities for the seismic evaluation of structures.

The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> curves for buildings using a non-linear structural analysis tools is then explained, together with a simplified expeditious procedure allowing the development of fragility curves. Next, the seismic risk of the special truss moment frame (STMF) systems of Tehran, the capital of Iran, is analysed in this paper using the capacity spectrum method. The seismic hazard of the studied area is described by using the reduced 5 %-damped elastic response spectra. Significant damage is obtained for mid-rise and high-rise special truss moment frames with a Vierendeel middle panel, because of the buckling and early fracture of truss web members. Special truss moment frames with an X-diagonal middle segment also show a low seismic capacity leading to significant expected damage...|$|E
