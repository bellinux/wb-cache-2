25|$|This {{complicated}} manoeuvre was simplified from 1955, {{when the}} staff {{lock on the}} main line <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> was replaced with {{a connection to the}} lever frame in the signal box at Macleod. In December 1958 Electric Staff safeworking on the mainline was replaced by 3 position automatic signals, and duplication was carried out from Rosanna Junction to Macleod.|$|E
25|$|Support of UNIX-style {{symbolic}} links. Previous Windows versions had {{support for}} a type of cross-volume reparse points known as <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> and hard links. However, <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> could be created only for directories and stored absolute paths, whereas hardlinks could be created for files but were not cross-volume. NTFS symbolic links can be created for any object and are cross-volume, cross-host (work over UNC paths), and store relative paths. However, the cross-host functionality of symbolic links does not work over the network with previous versions of Windows or other operating systems, only with computers running Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system. Symbolic links can be created, modified and deleted using the Mklink utility which is included with Windows Vista. Microsoft has published some developer documentation on symbolic links in the MSDN documentation. In addition, Windows Explorer is now symbolic link-aware and deleting a symbolic link from Explorer just deletes the link itself and not the target object. Explorer also shows the symbolic link target in the object's properties and shows a shortcut icon overlay on a junction point.|$|E

At a time when most passenger trains carried neither dining cars nor lounge cars, private businessmen such as the Van Noy's recognized a profit opportunity by operating eating houses at railroad <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> and selling snacks and novelties aboard the trains.|$|E

25|$|Preliminary Routing Indicators (PRIs) are {{installed}} on the approach to certain junctions. When the junction signal is displaying a 'proceed' aspect, the PRI will display an arrow. The arrow points up when the highest speed route is set. When a diverging route is set, the arrow points in the appropriate direction (mimicking the junction indicator on the junction signal). This advance indication gives the driver an opportunity to stop before the <b>junction</b> <b>points,</b> if wrongly routed. At the present time, PRIs are few in number, but {{they are likely to}} become more common.|$|E
25|$|Addition of Northern Powerhouse Rail and Station to the Manchester Piccadilly {{system will}} be the last step of the process of {{transforming}} the station in to a transport super hub. The NPR station and its construction will need to be considered throughout the design and implementation of the other station improvements which form the station concept but which are delivered earlier. The NPR station is proposed to stay underground on its way east as it passes through Manchester city. This provides opportunities and offers location and orientation alternatives. Staying under the existing Piccadilly station or positioning NPR under the HS2 station box will maximise interchange efficiencies and travel distances. The orientation will also dictate the number of vertical connection cores also referred to as “drums” and their locations. The drums will have the function to connect all levels of transport to one and other at critical <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
500|$|The game's [...] "junction point" [...] {{concept was}} created by Louden. There are {{approximately}} 40 variations in the game TV show, triggered by [...] "quantum ripples", which unlock deleted scenes and give players additional insight on the story, and <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> The player plays {{part of the game}} as Paul Serene and makes decisions as him at these points. Inspired by Die Hard, the writers hoped that this approach would allow them to create a complex villain with depth. According to Louden, the story characters are not [...] "black and white", and depending on the player's perspective, players will feel sympathy for the villain and feel torn when making the choices. <b>Junction</b> <b>points</b> were a tool used by Remedy to add replayability to the game, unlocking alternate content and changing the state of the world, and the gameplay segments remain identical regardless of players' choices.|$|E

500|$|Compatibility with {{existing}} APIs and technologies: ReFS {{does not require}} new system APIs and most file system filters {{continue to work with}} ReFS volumes. [...] ReFS supports many existing Windows and NTFS features such as BitLocker encryption, Access Control Lists, USN Journal, change notifications, symbolic links, <b>junction</b> <b>points,</b> mount points, reparse points, volume snapshots, file IDs, and oplock. ReFS seamlessly integrates with Storage Spaces, a storage virtualization layer that allows data mirroring and striping, as well as sharing storage pools between machines. ReFS resiliency features enhance the mirroring feature provided by Storage Spaces and can detect whether any mirrored copies of files become corrupt using background data scrubbing process, which periodically reads all mirror copies and verifies their checksums then replaces bad copies with good ones.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, {{residents}} in the Waiareka Valley inland from Oamaru started petitioning for a railway connection to the coast to provide easier access to farmland and to export agricultural produce and limestone. [...] The provincial government granted approval for a line to Ngapara in 1872, with construction commencing {{during the first half}} of 1874. [...] The Public Works Department began running trains on the line during 1876, but construction was hampered by delays and other problems, including an incident in May 1876 when two died after a contractor's locomotive exploded. [...] On 1 April 1877 the 24.34-kilometre line from Waiareka Junction on the Main South Line opened to Ngapara. The <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> faced south, away from Oamaru, because north-facing points would have required an excessively sharp curve.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1969 {{discussions were}} had with Pacific Scrap of Auckland {{with a view}} to them {{removing}} the then remaining 40 miles (61 kilometres) of the branch. [...] Pacific Scrap officials did a velocipede trip up the line for scrap assessment in early May 1969 and a contract was subsequently let to them. Removal of the line recommenced on a six-day-a-week basis from mid May 1969. The last work train had left Beaumont by early June 1969 hauled by a DJ locomotive. By early July 1969 the rail line had been removed from under the State Highway 8 road overbridge, tunnel and SH8 level crossing of Big Hill. By late July 1969 removal of the line was nearing Lawrence with the last train ever leaving Lawrence by early August 1969. By mid September 1969, Waitahuna too had seen its last train. By the end of October 1969 the last trains had moved through the Manuka Gorge and its tunnel. The final section into Clarksville was lifted on 24 November 1969. The mainline <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> and siding at Clarksville was finally removed on 29 July 1970 and so ended the Roxburgh Branch. Removal of some bridge structures further back up the line, for example the Waitahuna bridge, continued past this date into 1970, until the local Inspector of Permanent Way was satisfied the line had been demolished to [...] "Railways Department standards".|$|E
2500|$|Freight trains {{initially}} operated out of Lumsden and ran {{five days}} a week until 1956. [...] Services were re-organised to operate from Gore in 1959 and operated thrice-weekly. [...] In 1930 and 1952, the line was not considered to be a branch and thus was not assessed in the branch line commissions of those two years, but in 1967, it was announced that its future was under review. [...] The district negotiated a reprieve for three years, promising extra traffic, and DJ class diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives on the line in January 1969, but less than 24,000 tonnes were carried annually and through trains ceased running in October 1970, replaced with two shunting services, one from Gore to Riversdale and the other from Lumsden to Kingston Crossing, leaving a 9km gap of line unused, although the tracks were still in place and closure of most of the line came on 1 April 1971. A number of excursion trains ran on the line in its final weeks. Demolition of the line from Balfour back to Gore began in the later part of 1971. Although there were proposals to retain the line from Gore to Mandeville as an industrial siding to serve a proposed freezing works in the area, this proposal never eventuated and the line was lifted from Balfour {{all the way back to}} Gore. The last 2km section of line from the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> at Gore to the Gore Gravel and Crushing Company's plant was retained as an industrial siding until it too was closed on 1 October 1972. The 16 kilometres from Lumsden to a silo at Balfour remained open for the transport of wheat, but the quantity was not enough to justify the continued existence even of the truncated portion of the line, and it closed on 15 January 1978.|$|E
