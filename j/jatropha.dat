5|$|Pongamia pinnata is a legume {{native to}} Australia, India, Florida (USA) and most {{tropical}} regions, {{and is now}} being invested in {{as an alternative to}} <b>Jatropha</b> for areas such as Northern Australia, where <b>Jatropha</b> is classed as a noxious weed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jatropha</b> is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce <b>jatropha.</b> The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of <b>Jatropha</b> for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009, Continental Airlines used a {{sustainable}} biofuel to power a commercial aircraft {{for the first}} time in North America. This demonstration flight marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and <b>jatropha</b> plants. The algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy, and the <b>jatropha</b> oil by Terasol Energy.|$|E

5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The <b>Jatropha</b> leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to promote {{sustainable}} and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the <b>jatropha</b> plant. Air New Zealand carried out the first commercial flight using <b>jatropha</b> oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% <b>jatropha</b> oil and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data. Continental Airlines tested <b>jatropha</b> oil in one of its airliners on January 7, 2009. <b>Jatropha</b> is easy to grow, needs little fertilizer or water, and produces an oil-rich plant.|$|E
25|$|Plant Research International, a {{department}} of the Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing <b>Jatropha</b> Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large-scale <b>jatropha</b> cultivation through field and laboratory experiments.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit {{research}} {{organization dedicated to}} <b>jatropha</b> research {{in the areas of}} plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase <b>jatropha</b> farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.|$|E
25|$|Several {{groups in}} various sectors are {{conducting}} research on <b>Jatropha</b> curcas, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds {{considered by many to}} be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil. Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of <b>Jatropha</b> through advancements in genetics, soil science, and horticultural practices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the effort}} to develop an {{aviation}} biofuel, Air New Zealand and Boeing researched the <b>jatropha</b> plant {{to see if it}} was a viable green alternative to conventional fuel. A two-hour test flight, using a 50-50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A-1 feeding a Rolls Royce RB-211 engine of one of the airline's 747-400s, was completed on 30 December 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the <b>jatropha</b> blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found. The use of <b>jatropha</b> has been identified as a possible future fuel but large tracts of low quality land needed to grow the plant would have to be found without impeding other agricultural uses.|$|E

25|$|Low {{rainfall}} made farming difficult {{until the}} introduction of irrigation. Currently, the area under cultivation is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharastra to about 10% in Western Ghats. Except in developed areas of certain river valleys, double-cropping is rare. Rice is the predominant crop in high-rainfall areas and sorghum in low-rainfall areas. Other crops of significance include cotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar cane. Coffee, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, rubber, cashew nuts, tapioca, and cardamom are widely grown on plantations in the Nilgiri Hills and on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Cultivation of <b>Jatropha</b> has recently received more attention due to the <b>Jatropha</b> incentives in India.|$|E
25|$|The common rose {{frequently}} visits flowers such as Lantana, Cosmos, Zinnia, <b>Jatropha</b> and Clerodendron. The butterfly occasionally also visits wet patches. In {{parts of}} Sri Lanka, the males {{are known to}} congregate and form a beautiful sight while mud-puddling.|$|E
25|$|Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) is {{the only}} {{constituent}} laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Gujarat. A significant research effort is being carried out here to develop biodiesel from <b>Jatropha.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the wild, {{the most}} common seeds and nuts {{consumed}} by Spix's were from Pinhão (<b>Jatropha</b> pohliana var. mollissima) and Favela (Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus). However these trees are colonizers, not native to the bird's habitat, so {{they could not have}} been historical staples of the diet.|$|E
25|$|SG Biofuels, a San Diego-based <b>jatropha</b> developer, {{has used}} {{molecular}} breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds that show significant yield improvements over first-generation varieties. SG Biofuels also claims additional benefits have arisen from such strains, including improved flowering synchronicity, higher resistance to pests and diseases, and increased cold-weather tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation {{and fruit}} picking by hand is {{labour-intensive}} and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through <b>jatropha.</b> Moreover, villagers often {{find that they}} can grow other crops {{in the shade of}} the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too.|$|E
25|$|Foundry, {{agriculture}} and animal husbandry {{are the major}} contributors to the economy of Shimoga district. The crops cultivated in this district are paddy, arecanut, cotton, maize, oil seeds, cashewnut, pepper, chili, ginger, Ragi. Karnataka is the largest producer of arecanut in India, the majority of which is cultivated in the Shimoga district. The farmers have cultivated crops like Vanilla and <b>Jatropha</b> that has yielded high monetary benefits.|$|E
25|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Santo Tomas, Lozada has a 20-year experience in executive and management positions in the private sector. He assumed the post of president and CEO of PhilForest, a corporate arm of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, in 2004. In this capacity, he directed the government's program for the propagation and commercial cultivation of the tuba-tuba or <b>jatropha</b> plant, a source of biodiesel.|$|E
25|$|Algae {{is under}} {{development}} {{for use in}} biofuels. Researchers in Singapore were working on GM <b>jatropha</b> for biofuel production. Syngenta has USDA approval to market a maize trademarked Enogen that has been genetically modified to convert its starch to sugar for ethanol. In 2013, the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology was investigating poplar trees genetically engineered to contain less lignin to ease conversion into ethanol. Lignin is the critical limiting factor when using wood to make bio-ethanol because lignin limits the accessibility of cellulose microfibrils to depolymerization by enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Non-food crops like Camelina, <b>Jatropha,</b> {{seashore}} mallow and mustard, {{used for}} biodiesel, can thrive on {{marginal agricultural land}} where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts {{can be used to}} produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability.|$|E
25|$|Most Indigenous {{communities}} have economies {{based primarily on}} traditional agriculture such as the cultivation and processing of corn, beans and coffee as a cash crop {{and in the last}} decade, many have begun producing sugarcane and <b>jatropha</b> for refinement into biodiesel and ethanol for automobile fuel. The raising of livestock, particularly chicken and turkey {{and to a lesser extent}} beef and farmed fish is also a major economic activity. Many indigenous, in particular the Maya are employed in the production of traditional clothing, fabrics, textiles, wood items, artworks and traditional goods such as jade and amber works. Tourism has provided a number of a these communities with markets for their handcrafts and works, some of which are very profitable.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel is {{made from}} animal fats or {{vegetable}} oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as <b>jatropha,</b> soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.|$|E

500|$|Biofuels {{may provide}} a {{substitute}} for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price, independent of the international oil price. The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security, rural development opportunities and environmental benefits. [...] The <b>Jatropha</b> curcas species {{appears to be a}} particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia. Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia, based on the <b>Jatropha</b> or other sources, offers good potential benefits for the investors, the economy, rural communities and the environment.|$|E

[...] More {{than a dozen}} performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from Auckland International Airport. A biofuel blend of 50:50 <b>jatropha</b> and Jet A1 fuel was used to power one of the Boeing 747-400's Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Air New Zealand set several criteria for its <b>jatropha,</b> requiring that [...] "the land it came from was neither forest nor virgin grassland in the previous 20 years, that the soil and climate it came from is not suitable {{for the majority of}} food crops and that the farms are rain fed and not mechanically irrigated". The company has also set general sustainability criteria, saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources, that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels, and that they should be cost competitive.|$|E

500|$|Pioneering {{efforts in}} biofuel {{research}} {{have been conducted}} at the university. Studies conducted in the 1930s found that gasoline with 15-20 percent ethanol, dubbed [...] "gasanol", was more efficient than pure gasoline. Biofuel research in 2007 under the National Biofuel Program has considered new sources of biofuel, such as coconuts, Moringa oleifera, and sunflower seeds. Efforts have been concentrated on the <b>Jatropha</b> curcas due to its low maintenance and fast yield. Other fuel, such as coconut biofuel, {{were found to be}} too costly. Biofuel from Sorghum bicolor, Manihot esculenta crantz and Chlorella vulgaris are also being studied.|$|E
