500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), <b>dysdiadochokinesia</b> (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysdiadochokinesia</b> is {{also seen}} in Friedreich's ataxia and {{multiple}} sclerosis, as a cerebellar symptom (including ataxia, intention tremor and dysarthria).

50|$|<b>Dysdiadochokinesia</b> is {{demonstrated}} clinically {{by asking the}} patient to tap the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other, then rapidly turn over the fingers and tap the palm {{with the back of}} them, repeatedly. This movement is known as a pronation/supination test of the upper extremity. A simpler method using this same concept is to ask the patient to demonstrate the movement of trying a doorknob or screwing in a light bulb. When testing for this condition in legs, ask the patient to tap your hand as quickly as possible with the ball of each foot in turn. Movements tend to be slow or awkward. The feet normally perform less well than the hands. When testing for <b>dysdiadochokinesia</b> with speech the patient is asked to repeat syllables such as /pə/, /tə/, and /kə/; variation, excess loudness, and irregular articular breakdown are signs of <b>dysdiadochokinesia.</b>|$|E

Complete inability is called adiadochokinesia.|$|E
50|$|Abnormalities in {{diadochokinesia}} {{can be seen}} in {{the upper}} extremity, lower extremity and in speech. The deficits become visible in the rate of alternation, the completeness of the sequence, and in the variation in amplitude involving both motor coordination and sequencing.

50|$|<b>Dysdiadochokinesia</b> is {{a feature}} of {{cerebellar}} ataxia and {{may be the result}} of lesions to either the cerebellar hemispheres or the frontal lobe (of the cerebrum), it can also be a combination of both. It is thought to be caused by the inability to switch on and switch off antagonising muscle groups in a coordinated fashion due to hypotonia, secondary to the central lesion.|$|E
50|$|Dyschronometria is a {{condition}} of cerebellar dysfunction in which an individual cannot accurately estimate {{the amount of time}} that has passed (i.e., distorted time perception). It is associated with cerebellar ataxia, when the cerebellum has been damaged and does not function to its fullest ability. Lesions to the cerebellum can cause dyssynergia, dysmetria, <b>dysdiadochokinesia,</b> dysarthria, and ataxia of stance and gait. Dyschronometria can result from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA).|$|E
50|$|Cerebellar ataxia {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} many {{diseases}} and presents with symptoms of an inability to coordinate balance, gait, extremity and eye movements. Lesions to the cerebellum can cause dyssynergia, dysmetria, <b>dysdiadochokinesia,</b> dysarthria and ataxia of stance and gait. Deficits are observed with movements {{on the same side of}} the body as the lesion (ipsilateral). Clinicians often use visual observation of people performing motor tasks in order to look for signs of ataxia.|$|E
50|$|Karak {{syndrome}} {{is a novel}} degenerative disorder. It is a neurological disease involving excess cerebral iron accumulation. The family who the disease was discovered in their siblings lived in Karak, a town in southern Jordan. It is characterized by ataxia, inverted feet (calcaneovarus), dysarthric scanning speech with dystonic features, dystonic movement of the tongue and facial muscles and choreiform movement was present in both upper and lower limbs, being more marked in the lower limbs, along with dystonic posture of the distal feet, bradykinesiapresent in both upper and lower limbs, dysmetria, <b>dysdiadochokinesia,</b> and intentional tremor were bilateral and symmetrical.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{cerebellar}} ataxia {{is used to}} indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for integrating {{a significant amount of}} neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning. Although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions, many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia. [...] People with {{cerebellar ataxia}} may have trouble regulating the force, range, direction, velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions. [...] This results in a characteristic type of irregular, uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways, such as asthenia, asynergy, delayed reaction time, and dyschronometria. [...] Individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait, difficulty with eye movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypotonia, dysmetria and <b>dysdiadochokinesia.</b> These deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged, and whether the lesion is bilateral or unilateral.|$|E
5000|$|People with {{cerebellar}} ataxia may initially present with poor balance, {{which could be}} demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait. As the condition progresses, walking {{is characterized by a}} widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side. Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As {{cerebellar ataxia}} becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk. Dysarthria, an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by [...] "scanning" [...] speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm and variable volume. There may also be slurring of speech, tremor of the voice and ataxic respiration. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. There is overshooting (or hypermetria) with finger to nose testing, and heel to shin testing; thus, dysmetria is evident. Impairments with alternating movements (<b>dysdiadochokinesia),</b> as well as dysrhythmia, may also be displayed. There may also be tremor of the head and trunk (titubation) in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.|$|E

50|$|Despite dyschronometria's easily {{recognizable}} symptoms, {{the fact}} that they may also be present in other cerebellar ataxias can make diagnosis difficult. Other ataxias may also have symptoms that affect gait, speech, thought process, spatial awareness, and time orientation used in their diagnoses, covering up {{the fact that}} most of these patients also have dyschronometria. The most common ataxias dyschronometria has been seen to be evident in are dyssynergia, dysmetria, <b>dysdiadochokinesia,</b> dysarthria as well as ataxias effecting stance and gait. Dyslexia can be another problem in those individuals affected by dyschronometria, however it is uncertain whether dyslexia is developed or worsened by having it, or if it is the opposite in that having dyslexia increases the chance of developing dyschronometria. Another problem that dyschronometria faces in detection is that it is a relatively new term for this side effect and precursor to dementia, compared with other cerebellar ataxias such as those mentioned above. Even when dyschronometria is detected, it has usually progressed to the point where it cannot be reversed, and there is no benefit in taking the testing medication to either slow down the dyschronometria or the process of dementia setting in, which is what dyschronometria is a signal for.|$|E

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which neurological signs are more prevalent in schizophrenia patients, compared to mood-disorder patients and healthy subjects, and whether there is a pattern in any of the differences that may be found. We included 17 studies and calculated the weighted mean prevalence of 30 neurological signs. The prevalence of most signs appears to be si,significantly different between schizophrenia patients and normal controls, but there are fewer differences between schizophrenia and mood-disorder patients. Several signs - poor stereognosis and rhythm tapping - are even more prevalent in mood-disorder patients than in schizophrenia patients. Only lack of extinction, <b>dysdiadochokinesia,</b> poor tandem walk, finger-thumb-opposition and articulation are significantly more prevalent in schizophrenia compared to mood-disorder patients. Impaired motor coordination seems most specific to schizophrenia. The discriminating power of motor sequencing still needs to be studied.
