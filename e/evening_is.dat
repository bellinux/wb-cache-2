5|$|The word afternoon, which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from {{about the year}} 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for the word was at afternoon in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word <b>evening</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.|$|E

Complicating emotions triggered by the drug are the disappearance of Otis and a phone call from Joe's father bringing tragic news about his beloved sister Lucy.|$|E

Tancredi and the Count, in their full dress uniforms, fascinate the Prince's daughters and puzzle the Prince, who says {{he thought they were}} still fighting for Garibaldi. Tancredi and the Count react with disgust, saying there was no way they could stay with such a rough outfit when positions with the new king's army were available. Tancredi then produces the ring he has purchased for Angelica. A moment later, Angelica rushes in, having been informed by a note that Tancredi is back. The lovers embrace; sensuality fills the air.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{the other}} three images, Evening takes place {{slightly}} outside the built-up area of the city, with views of rolling hills and wide evening skies. The cow being milked in the background indicates it is around 5 o'clock. While in Morning winter cold pervades the scene, <b>Evening</b> <b>is</b> oppressed by {{the heat of the}} summer. A pregnant woman and her husband attempt to escape from the claustrophobic city by journeying out to the fashionable Sadler's Wells (the stone entrance to Sadler's Wells Theatre is shown to the left). By the time Hogarth produced this series the theatre had lost any vestiges of fashionability and was satirised as having an audience consisting of tradesmen and their pretentious wives.

Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and some of my friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of <b>evening</b> <b>is</b> sad– it was once my study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E
500|$|Buckell soon {{receives}} {{word that}} noted radiation-poisoning specialist Dr. Jacob Hoffman (Fred La Porta) {{has agreed to}} help Gil and plans on arriving in the area within a few days. When radiation poisoning studies offer no leads on solving Gil's own particular symptoms, the distraught scientist contemplates suicide, but soon changes his mind. Instead, Gil returns to the bar where Trudy joins him for a drink and comments that the <b>evening</b> <b>is</b> not over because it is [...] "never late until the sun comes up." [...] Although Gil is disturbed by the comment, his loneliness draws him closer to her. When bar patron George insinuates that he has purchased Trudy's company for the evening, Gil defends her, causing a fight between the two men. After knocking George unconscious, Gil flees with Trudy into the night. Later that evening, after walking the shoreline, they make love, falling asleep in the sand until the morning light awakens Gil. Horrified, Gil flees in his car leaving Trudy stranded on the beach. Arriving at the house, Gil runs in, but not before the transformation occurs.|$|E

500|$|D'Souza {{is deeply}} {{religious}} and says that, she regularly attends Sunday Mass at St. Anne's Parish (Bandra), and whenever {{the family is}} home, {{a part of their}} <b>evening</b> <b>is</b> reserved for saying the rosary together. In an interview with The Times of India, she comments, [...] "I keep a Novena every Wednesday at St. Michael's Church in Mahim." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, she said that [...] "My communication with God is conversational, [...] I'm God's favourite child; I believe that God has always been kind to me." [...] Her mother tongue is Konkani. Tabloids repeatedly linked D'Souza romantically with Ritesh Deshmukh, ever since they starred together in their debut film Tujhe Meri Kasam in 2003. They were reportedly ready to get engaged, but Ritesh's father, the then-Maharashtra Chief Minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh did not agree. D'Souza later denied any rumors of a relationship with Deshmukh, and responds that she had just friendly relations with him. However, the couple eventually got married on 3 February 2012, according to Marathi marriage traditions in a Hindu wedding ceremony. She got married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Bandra, the following day. The couple's first child, a son named Riaan, was born on 25 November 2014. Their second son was born on 1 June 2016.|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} [...] "" [...] (Abide with us; {{for it is}} toward evening), a {{large-scale}} tripartite chorus, reminiscent of a slow sarabande or of the closing Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine of the St John Passion. The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as [...] "of speech-like gestures". It is {{picked up by the}} voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on [...] "" [...] (for <b>evening</b> <b>is</b> nigh) [...] "as if the gloom of night were weighing upon them". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked Andante and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: [...] "denn es will Abend werden" [...] (for it is toward evening) and [...] "und der Tag hat sich geneiget" [...] (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the [...] "abiding" [...] or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus Ruht wohl from Bach's St John Passion, describing the cantata's [...] "tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed." ...|$|E
