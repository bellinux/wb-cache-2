Like in previous Metroid games, Fusion is played from the side-scrolling perspective. It introduces mission-based gameplay that aids the player to explore areas. The game consists of objectives, which are flexible in <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accomplished. Fusion was released simultaneously with the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America. The bonus features in Prime can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} false {{necessity}} attempts to understand humans and human history without making ourselves {{the object of}} a law-giving fate. It rejects the assumption that certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional deep structure theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of deep structure and routine practice with both indivisible types of social organization, and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E

500|$|The 2007–2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent Great Recession challenged macroeconomic theory. [...] Few economists predicted the crisis, and, even afterwards, {{there was great}} disagreement on how to address it. The new synthesis consensus broke down as economists debated policy responses {{to deal with the}} deep recession. The new synthesis formed during the Great Moderation and had not been tested in a severe economic environment. Many economists agree that the crisis stemmed from an economic bubble, but neither of the major macroeconomic schools had paid much attention to finance or a theory of asset bubbles: how they form, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> recognized, and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> prevented. The failures of current economic theory to deal with the crisis spurred economists to reevaluate their thinking. Commentary ridiculed the mainstream and proposed a major reassessment.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{creates a}} series of oppositional themes with aspects of nature {{representing}} each: seduction and innocence, order and chaos. These oppositions establish tension before the poem asks as to <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reconciled. These images and their being reconciled are described as analogous {{to the effects of}} an Aeolian harp and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings towards nature. In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. His approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe. [...] However, Coleridge's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker, and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature.|$|E

Nature is also seen in its oppositions, with a wildness within nature being contrasted with order within nature, especially in regards to the effects of an Aeolian harp and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings about nature. In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. Coleridge's approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe.
