500|$|Blood {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} as the first two OSI albums. Matheos and Moore worked together on the album long-distance, mainly by emailing each other files. Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then I ask what I can <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> mess around, complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{would have}} {{happened}} without the Pistols. It was like, [...] "Wow, I believe in this." [...] What they were saying was: [...] "It's a load of shite. I'm {{going to do what}} I <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't care what people think." [...] That was the key to it. People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
500|$|In {{more recent}} years, frontwoman Love {{stated that the}} album {{contains}} [...] "nothing melodic". In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as [...] "unlistenable", going on to say: [...] "That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [...] 'This is what I <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{am not going to}} back down from it. I am announcing my persona as a cunt. Thank you very much.'" ...|$|E

I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez told MTV News at an album-release {{event in}} May 2011, {{that out of}} all the songs on Love?, she was most excited for people to hear [...] "Run the World", [...] "(What Is) Love?", [...] "One Love", [...] "Papi" [...] and [...] "Starting Over". Lopez stated that: [...] "They all express {{different}} moments in love and that's what this album was about. You know, sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's amazing, sometimes overwhelming, sometimes you just don't know what to <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> hope that I captured all of that on this album". MTV News noted that on the songs, Lopez might be [...] "giving us some insight about what she was dealing with in her personal life in the months before it was released".|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was {{admitted}} to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired.

500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes. Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an incredible adventure, but it's also been really difficult, {{because there are so}} many people, and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now. She continued {{to do well in}} Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.|$|E

500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." [...] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac.

500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|On August 10, 2012, Beyoncé {{appeared}} at the Assembly for the rehearsals prior to the performance. Julia Stiles, The-Dream and Diane Warren were the celebrities who attended the performance. Prior to the performing the song, Beyoncé met with United Nations leader Ban Ki-moon. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, announced Beyoncé's performance giving a short introduction about the singer: [...] "Tonight [...] brings more than her stunning talents; she brings inspiration to help another person, to help another human being". He further recalled a [...] "dark day {{in the history of}} the U.N." [...] when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives in a terrorist attack in Iraq on August 19, 2003 adding that the event and the World Humanitarian Day both honor those lost lives and encourage others to join the effort. He further interviewed guests whose relatives lost their lives in the accident. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos also appeared encouraging everyone to log on to the website WHD-IWasHere.org by August 19 and commit to doing one good act to help someone in need further saying, [...] "I told Beyoncé: It's great that we have her, because she can reach millions of people.

500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E
500|$|After taping {{the pilot}} episode for Power of 10, Carey was {{contacted}} by CBS about replacing Bob Barker—who had earlier announced his own retirement—as host of The Price Is Right. After initially turning down the offer, Carey announced on Late Show with David Letterman {{that he would}} succeed Barker as host of the program beginning {{in the fall of}} 2007. His first episode of The Price Is Right was taped on August 15, and his shows began airing on October 15. In response to replacing Barker as host of the game show, Carey stated [...] "You can't replace Bob Barker. I don't compare myself to anybody... It's only about what you're doing and supposed to <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel like I'm supposed to be doing this." [...] When Carey began hosting, the set, theme music, and show logo were updated. However, Carey kept the old closing line about spaying and neutering the pets that originated with Barker, although his version uses slightly different wording. During Carey's second year as host, he began to write some of the sketches used during the Showcase, which sometimes features guest appearances by stars of other CBS programs. In the April Fools' Day 2013 episode, Carey and announcer George Gray switched places with the models, letting the two men be the models for the episode. On the April Fools' Day 2014 episode, Carey and Gray traded positions with Craig Ferguson (who was hosting The Late Late Show at the time) and Shadoe Stevens, reprising their respective roles on Ferguson's show while Ferguson hosted and Stevens announced on Price. On the first week of Season 46 (September 18-22, 2017), Carey celebrated his ten years as host of the show, joining Barker as the only two to have hosted for at least a decade.|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pekar's {{friendship}} with Robert Crumb {{eventually led to}} the creation of the self-published, autobiographical comic book series American Splendor. Crumb and Pekar became friends through their mutual love of jazz records when Crumb was living in Cleveland in the mid-1960s. Crumb's work in underground comics led Pekar to see the form's possibilities, saying, [...] "Comics could do anything that film could <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> wanted in on it."
