2500|$|In 1948 a new Pontiac styling {{included}} triple [...] "Silver Streaks," [...] {{a horizontal}} grille theme with vertical shaft, and round taillights. The word [...] "Silver Streak" [...] was {{carried on the}} sides of the hood with eights having an [...] "8" [...] placed between the two words. Streamliners were again larger and more expensive than other Pontiacs. All Streamliners, be they 2-door or 4-door fastbacks, or station wagons, now came standard or Deluxe. Deluxe models were destinguished by spear moldings on front fender, bright gravel guards, and chrome plated wheel discs on all cars except wagons. Deluxe interiors had two tone trims with pillow-and-tuft seatbacks, quarter sawed mahogany dash and window trim, electric glovebox door clocks, Deluxe steering wheels and other rich appointments. Standard Streamliner station wagons had tan <b>imitation</b> <b>leather</b> seats and Deluxe wagons had red upholstery of the same type. Station wagon prices ranged from $2364 for a standard Six to $2490 for a Deluxe Eight, making them Pontiac's most expensive model. In 1948 160,857 Streamliners were sold, accounting for nearly 66% of all Pontiacs.|$|E

2500|$|The first postwar Pontiac {{available}} (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which {{remained the}} sole product for a time. The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were wraparound bumpers, a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light parking lamps. Streamliners {{could be identified}} by straight back Indian moldings on the rear hood ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the [...] "speedline" [...] fender ribs. They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size. Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the [...] "speedlines" [...] identified Eights. Interior trim on passenger cars were in gray striped cloth. Station wagons had three seats in standard trim, two seats in Deluxe trim and used <b>imitation</b> <b>leather</b> upholstery and passenger car style interior hardware. Ranging in price from $1942 for a standard Six to $2047 for a Deluxe Eight, Streamliner station wagons continued {{to be the most}} expensive Pontiac model. A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs.|$|E
2500|$|The 1949 Pontiacs {{featured}} low sleek envelope bodies. Streamliner coupes and sedans {{utilized the}} fastback B-body shell. Station wagons {{continued to be}} part of the Streamliner line. All of these cars came as standards or Deluxes. All station wagons and other standard models had small hubcaps. Standard coupes, sedans, and wagons were characterized by an absence of beltline trim along with use of rubber gravel guards and painted headlight rims. Deluxes had beltline moldings, chrome gravel guards and bright plated headlight doors. Silver Streak styling was seen again. Silver Streak lettering was placed above front fender spears on Deluxes and high on the fenders of standards. Eights had the number [...] "8" [...] between the two words. Most standard models had gray striped pattern cloth upholstery. Most Deluxes used dark gray broadcloth trims. Wagons were trimmed as before except <b>imitation</b> <b>leather</b> was only used on standard wagons. 1949 was the last year for wood-bodied station wagons, as production shifted to all-metal station wagons with woodgrain trim during the model year. Streamliner station wagons continued to be the most expensive Pontiac model, ranging in price from $2543 for a standard Six to $2690 for a Deluxe Eight.|$|E

For an octoberfest costume people combine lederhosen with Haverlschuhe, stockings and a classic white or checked shirt.|$|R
6000|$|But {{in between}} {{the time when the}} Graf von Winterfeld had talked to him and this {{alarming}} conference with the Prince, Bert had explored the Vaterland from end to end. He had found it interesting in spite of grave preoccupations. Kurt, like the greater number of the men upon the German air-fleet, had known hardly anything of aeronautics before his appointment to the new flagship. But he was extremely keen upon this wonderful new weapon Germany had assumed so suddenly and dramatically. He showed things to Bert with a boyish eagerness and appreciation. It was as if he showed them over again to himself, like a child showing a new toy. [...] "Let's go all over the ship," [...] he said with zest. He pointed out particularly the lightness of everything, the use of exhausted aluminium tubing, of springy cushions inflated with compressed hydrogen; the partitions were hydrogen bags covered with light <b>imitation</b> <b>leather,</b> the very crockery was a light biscuit glazed in a vacuum, and weighed next to nothing. Where strength was needed there was the new Charlottenburg alloy, German steel as it was called, the toughest and most resistant metal in the world.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{did any of}} them {{notice the}} little black man who limped {{up the steps and}} stood looking on. Koho was a conservative. His fathers before him had worn no clothes, and neither did he, not even a gee-string. The many empty {{perforations}} in nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions long since dead. The holes on both ear-lobes had been torn out, but their size was attested by the strips of withered flesh that hung down and swept his shoulders. He cared now only for utility, and in one of the half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short clay pipe. Around his waist was buckled a cheap trade-belt, and between the <b>imitation</b> <b>leather</b> and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a long knife. Suspended from the belt was his bamboo betel-nut and lime box. In his hand was a short-barrelled, large-bore Snider rifle. He was indescribably filthy, and here and there marred by scars, the worst being the one left by the Lee-Enfield bullet, which had withered the calf to half the size of its mate. His shrunken mouth showed that few teeth were left to serve him. Face and body were shrunken and withered, but his black, bead-like eyes, small and close together, were very bright, withal they were restless and querulous, and more like a monkey's than a man's.|$|E

60|$|One writes {{now with}} a {{peculiar}} horror of the dress of the old world. The men's clothes were worn without any cleansing process at all, except an occasional superficial brushing, for periods of a year or so; {{they were made of}} dark obscurely mixed patterns to conceal the stage of defilement they had reached, and they were of a felted and porous texture admirably calculated to accumulate drifting matter. Many women wore skirts of similar substances, and of so long and inconvenient a form that they inevitably trailed among all the abomination of our horse-frequented roads. It was our boast in England that the whole of our population was booted--their feet were for the most part ugly enough to need it,--but it becomes now inconceivable how they could have imprisoned their feet in the amazing cases of <b>leather</b> and <b>imitations</b> of <b>leather</b> they used. I have heard it said that {{a large part of the}} physical decline that was apparent in our people during the closing years of the nineteenth century, though no doubt due in part to the miscellaneous badness of the food they ate, was in the main attributable to the vileness of the common footwear. They shirked open-air exercise altogether because their boots wore out ruinously and pinched and hurt them if they took it. I have mentioned, I think, the part my own boots played in the squalid drama of my adolescence. I had a sense of unholy triumph over a fallen enemy when at last I found myself steering truck after truck of cheap boots and shoes (unsold stock from Swathinglea) to the run-off by the top of the Glanville blast furnaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore a route towards surface engineering both {{by the introduction of}} a conceptual framework called Interactive Surface Modelling (ISM) and by the actual application of the concept on two functional surfaces of importance to the automotive industry: cylinder liners for engines and <b>leather</b> <b>imitation</b> surfaces for the interior of cars. The results are presented in six separate but related papers concerning the construction of the ISM system shell and the use of modern technology to explore and represent the functional knowledge relevant to the specification of surface properties. Functional demands control the route from the designer's specification of suitable characterization parameters to the manufacturing engineer's choice of machining processes and data and ultimately to the quality control engineer's choice of measuring devices and measuring strategy. A prototype was developed, where two functional surfaces were implemented: the cylinder liner surface for car engines and the <b>leather</b> <b>imitation</b> surface for car interiors. The prototype system was developed in the MS-Windows environment using commercial softwares and a unique concept for the specification of desired surface properties where functional surfaces are divided into a number of separate functional requirements (more or less independent) that could separately be specified in terms of design parameters, manufacturing variables, and measuring dito. Several tools were developed for the representation of the surface topography and characterization of the functional behaviour of the surface. CAD systems were used for the representation of simulated 3 D surfaces and various 3 D surface roughness measuring devices were tested to see which method would give the best insight and knowledge of cylinder liner surfaces subjected to engine tests. In order to study the wear process in the cylinder liner surface, an effective relocation and replication technique was developed and measurements were made not only with traditional stylus equipments but also with Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) that revealed some of the mechanisms of cylinder liner wear invisible to the ordinary 3 D stylus technique. The introduction of the AFM measurements to the field of surface engineering was a major breakthrough for the functional characterization of surfaces in my work with the ISM concept and much points to the benefits of using the AFM to seek answers to surface engineering questions in the new world of surface features accessible to this instrument...|$|R

60|$|December, 19. In the train. Fellow of 30 {{with four}} valises; a slim creature, with teeth which made his mouth {{look like a}} {{neglected}} churchyard. He had solidified hair--solidified with pomatum; it was all one shell. He smoked the most extraordinary cigarettes--made {{of some kind of}} manure, apparently. These and his hair made him smell like the very nation. He had a low-cut vest on, which exposed a deal of frayed and broken and unclean shirtfront. Showy studs, of imitation gold--they had made black disks on the linen. Oversized sleeve buttons of imitation gold, the copper base showing through. Ponderous watch-chain of imitation gold. I judge that he couldn't tell the time by it, for he asked Smythe what time it was, once. He wore a coat which had been gay when it was young; 5-o'clock-tea-trousers of a light tint, and marvelously soiled; yellow mustache with a dashing upward whirl at the ends; foxy shoes, <b>imitation</b> patent <b>leather.</b> He was a novelty--an imitation dude. He would have been a real one if he could have afforded it. But he was satisfied with himself. You could see it in his expression, and in all his attitudes and movements. He was living in a dude dreamland where all his squalid shams were genuine, and himself a sincerity. It disarmed criticism, it mollified spite, to see him so enjoy his imitation languors, and arts, and airs, and his studied daintinesses of gesture and misbegotten refinements. It was plain to me that he was imagining himself the Prince of Wales, and was doing everything the way he thought the Prince would do it. For bringing his four valises aboard and stowing them in the nettings, he gave his porter four cents, and lightly apologized for the smallness of the gratuity --just with the condescendingest little royal air in the world. He stretched himself out on the front seat and rested his pomatum-cake on the middle arm, and stuck his feet out of the window, and began to pose as the Prince and work his dreams and languors for exhibition; and he would indolently watch the blue films curling up from his cigarette, and inhale the stench, and look so grateful; and would flip the ash away with the daintiest gesture, unintentionally displaying his brass ring in the most intentional way; why, it was as good as being in Marlborough House itself to see him do it so like.|$|R
