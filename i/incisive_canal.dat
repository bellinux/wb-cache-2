5000|$|The mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> is a bony canal {{within the}} {{anterior}} mandible that runs bilaterally from the mental foramina usually {{to the region}} of the ipsilateral lateral incisor teeth. After branching into the mental nerve that exits the foramen of the same name, the inferior alveolar nerve continues anteriorly within the mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> as the incisive nerve, providing innervation to the mandibular first premolar, canine and lateral and central incisors. [...] The mandibular incisive nerve either terminates as nerve endings within the anterior teeth or adjacent bone, or may join nerve endings that enter through the tiny lingual foramen.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{dimensions}} of mandibular anatomical landmarks of human mandibles of three different chronological periods and seven different geographic regions. METHODS: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were acquired from human mandibles of three different chronological periods (Neolithic, Medieval and 19 - 20 th Century). The 19 - 20 th Century consisted of seven human mandibular samples from different geographic locations. Image analysis consisted of comparing anatomic variability and dimensions of the mandibular, lingual and <b>incisive</b> <b>canals,</b> mental foramen {{and their relationship to}} specific reference teeth as such to determine geographic region and historic period variabilities. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the 19 - 20 th Century group and the Medieval and Neolithic groups. The 19 - 20 th Century group differed significantly in mandibular canal diameter, tooth root length, length of the lateral lingual canal. In addition, the group also differed from the Medieval sample for the lateral lingual foramen diameter and the midline lingual canal length. Furthermore, the prevalence of anatomic variations was significantly different for the geographic samples tested, with double mental foramina significantly more present in the Congolese sample, and significantly more lateral lingual canals noted in Indonesian and Greenland Eskimo samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that mandibular neurovascularisation may show some geographic as well as historic variation. Further studies on larger data samples are needed to verify this statement, as such that it can be potentially used in anthropology and forensic dentistry. More research is also needed to address whether the geographic and historic variations are linked, as well to investigate evolutionary trends in these structures. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A reimplantation case of maxillary second incisive with periapical (radicular) cyst is reported. A 37 {{years old}} female who {{suffered}} periapical cyst on her maxillary second incisive requested conventional endodontic treatment {{in order to}} avoid tooth extraction. The tooth was treated with a conventional root canal treatment at the first visit. After the first treatment, the patient suffered a post endodontic treatment pain but was afraid to be operated with apex resection. On the second visit, the maxillary second incisive was extracted. On the third visit the patient requested periapical cyst removal after she received advices from her older sister (who was a medical doctor) about the important of removing cyst capsule {{in order to avoid}} cyst recurrency. The patient also requested her tooth reimplantation.

40|$|Abstract Background In setting {{goals for}} {{orthodontic}} treatment, determining the morphologies of the alveolar bone and maxillary incisor root {{is important for}} avoiding root resorption, dehiscence, and fenestration. This study aimed to analyze the configurational relationships among maxillary incisors, the alveolar border, and the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods Cone-beam CT images of 93 orthodontic patients were evaluated for length of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> (L); angles between the palatal plane and the maxillary alveolar border (θ 1), the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> (θ 2), and maxillary incisor (θ 3); distance from the left maxillary incisor to the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> (D); and cross-sectional areas of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> (CSAs) at three vertical levels. Comparison of variables {{between male and female}} patients was performed with the two-sample t test. Correlations between parameters were examined by Pearson’s correlation analysis and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results Male patients exhibited significantly greater values of L than female patients. There were significant positive correlations between θ 1 and θ 2, θ 2 and θ 3, and θ 3 and θ 1. While the value of D was the lowest at the oral opening, that of the cross-sectional area of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> (CSA) was the greatest at the incisal root apex. Conclusions This study demonstrated that the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> had large inter-individual variability, and the proximity between the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and the incisal root could not be precisely predicted by the conventional cephalograms.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} appearance, location, and {{course of the}} <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> as {{compared}} to other anatomical landmarks on spiral CT of the mandible. METHODS: Study material included 230 spiral CT scans taken for preoperative planning of implant placement in the posterior mandible. All scanning was performed using a standard exposure and patient positioning protocol. Axial, panoramic, and reformatted cross-sectional images were carefully examined. Visibility of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and other anatomical landmarks was scored using a four-point rating scale. The vertical and buccolingual diameter of the outer contour as well {{the diameter of the}} inner contour of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> were measured using a digital sliding caliper. RESULTS: An <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was identified in 93 % of the cases, with good visibility in 22 % of the cases. Mean (s. d.) vertical diameter, buccolingual diameter, and inner diameter of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> were 4. 7 (1. 1), 3. 7 (0. 7), and 1. 1 (0. 3) mm respectively. The mandibular canal, mental foramen, lingual foramen, and anterior looping appeared in 98, 100, 82 and 7 % of the images respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A well-defined <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> could be detected in the majority of spiral CT scans. Its radiographic detection remained lower than for the mandibular canal or mental foramen, but higher than for the visibility of the lingual foramen.

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> had large inter-individual variability, and the proximity between the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and the incisal root could not be precisely predicted by the conventional cephalograms.

30|$|The <b>incisive</b> <b>canal,</b> an {{anatomical}} structure {{located on the}} midsagittal plane of the maxillary bone running parallel and posterior to maxillary incisors, involves the nasopalatine vessels and nerves, branches of the trigeminal nerve, and the maxillary artery and {{is surrounded by a}} thick layer of cortical bone [21 – 23]. Because of its proximity to maxillary incisors, the possibility of sensory dysfunction in the anterior region and failure of osseointegration has been reported in cases of contact of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> through surgical interventions such as dental implant placement [24 – 26]. Recently, Chung et al. reported that proximity of maxillary incisal roots to the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> might influence the degree of root resorption after large incisal retraction [27]. Therefore, when planning orthodontic treatment, it is critical to confirm the exact location of maxillary incisors and the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and determine the morphology of the alveolar bone. Imaging of {{anatomical structure}}s at the maxillary anterior region by CBCT with a limited FOV has not been documented in literature.

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{obtain the}} mean {{dimensional}} {{measurements of the}} <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> structures and anterior maxillary bone thickness and the incisive foramen location of Malaysian Malays and Chinese. (2) To determine and compare <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> length and width between the Malays and Chinese. (3) To measure and compare the incisive foramen diameter and nasal foramina diameter between the Malays and Chinese. (4) To measure and compare maxillary bone thickness anterior to the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> between the Malays and Chinese. (5) To determine and compare incisive foramen location between Malays and Chinese. (6) To classify and compare <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> according to its direction between Malays and Chinese. (7) To classify and compare the canal according {{to the number of}} channels in the middle portion between the Malays and Chinese. (8) To determine the effects of advancing age on the dimensions of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and related structures. Materials and Methods Ninety-four Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. From sagittal views the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> morphology, location and the anterior maxillary bone thickness were identified and evaluated using CBCT. The length of the canal was measured as a distance between the nasal foramen and the incisive foramen, and the inner width of the canal measured at three levels (the mean was calculated). The anterior maxillary bone thickness was measured from the outer canal wall to the outer cortical plate of the buccal bone. While the location of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was the measured distance between the incisive foramen and the most anterio-inferior point of the maxillary buccal bone. A horizontal cross-section slice was studied in the middle portion of the canal to determine the iii number of channels. Subsequently, employing the interactive SimPlant software the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> direction and course were studied and classified. Results The mean length of the canal was 16. 24 (± 2. 96) mm. The right <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was longer than the left canal (the mean of the right canal- 16. 65 (± 4. 46) mm and the mean of the left canal- 15. 98 (± 4. 71) mm). <b>Incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was wider in males than females especially in Malays (the mean in males- 4. 05 (± 1. 57) mm and the mean for female- 3. 16 (± 0. 77) mm). The mean anterior maxillary bone thickness - 7. 54 (± 1. 65) mm with Chinese females having a thickness of 6. 76 (± 1. 41) mm. However, there was a reduction of the bone thickness with age affecting the position of the incisive foramen. When gender comparisons were made, the general bone thickness was greater in males than females, especially in Chinese (the mean bone thickness in males= 8. 21 (± 1. 82) mm and in females= 6. 76 (± 1. 41) mm). The majority of the cases had slanted-curve canal with one channel at their middle portion. Conclusion There are many anatomical variations in morphology and location of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and foramen. The right <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> is always longer than left canal regardless of gender, ethnicity and age group. Malay males exhibit large canals, thereby causing thin maxillary bone when compared with Chinese males. Interestingly Chinese females have the thinnest anterior maxillary bone thickness. The majority of the Mongoloid population have slanted-curve canal with one channel at the middle portion of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal.</b> These findings may be of clinical importance during surgical procedures, especially implant placement. For that reason, a careful assessment of this area during the pre-operative planning procedures is important...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{visibility}} {{and the course}} of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and the visibility and the location of the lingual foramen using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: In total, 100 CBCT examinations of patients for preoperative planning were used for this study. The examinations were taken using the NewTom 3 G CBCT unit, applying a standardized exposure protocol. Image reconstruction from the raw data was performed using the NewTom software. Three experts were asked to assess the visibility of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> using a four-point rating scale. The position of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was recorded in relation to the lower, buccal and lingual border of the mandible using the application provided by the CBCT software. Results: The <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was definitely visible in 83. 5 % of the scans and the mean endpoint was approximately 15 mm anterior to the mental foramen. The mean distance from the lower border of the mandible was 11. 5 mm and its course was closer to the buccal border of the mandible in 87 % of the scans. The lingual foramen was definitely visible in 81 % of the scans. Conclusions: The high detection rate of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and the lingual foramen in the anterior region of the mandible using CBCT indicates the potentional high preoperative value of CBCT scan for surgical procedures in the anterior mandible.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the presence and course of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> in the mental interforaminal region of the human mandible and to describe the occurrence of anatomical variations. Mandibles of 50 adult human cadavers were retrieved from the Department of Anatomy of the Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). Forty mandibles were edentulous, while 10 mandibles were partially dentate. Intra-oral, panoramic and tomographic imaging of the interforaminal region of the human mandible were performed. Afterwards, mandibles were sawn into vertical sections according to the respective tomographic cross-sections. The latter allowed exploration for the presence and course of an anterior prolongation of the mandibular canal. Measurements of the location of the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> towards the base of the mandible were made using a digital-sliding caliper. Results indicated a well-defined <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> [mean (SD) inner diameter 1. 8 (0. 5 mm) ], macroscopically observed in 96 % of mandibles. The <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was located on average 9. 7 mm (SD 1. 8 mm) from the lower cortical border and continued towards the incisor region in a slightly downward direction, with a mean (SD) distance to the lower cortical border of 7. 2 (2. 1) mm. It was concluded that there is an anterior intraosseous extension of the mandibular canal, denoted as the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal.</b> The latter might be considered as a true anterior extension of the neurovascular bundle.

40|$|Introduction:The maxillary <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> {{connects the}} roof of the oral cavity with the floor of nasal cavity and has the incisive and nasal {{foramina}} respectively at its two opposite ends. Its close proximity with the anterior incisors affects one's ability to place immediate implants in ideal position. Objective:To avoid causing complication, variations in their dimensions were studied. Material and Methods: Images of ninety Mongoloids patients examined with i-CAT Cone Beam Computed Tomography were included. The sizes of the nasopalatine foramen, the <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> and foramen, and anterior maxillary bone thickness were measured. The direction and course of the canals were assessed. Results:The mean labiopalatal and mesiodistal measurements of the incisive foramen were 2. 80 mm and 3. 49 mm respectively, while the labiopalatal width of the nasal foramen was 6. 06 mm. The <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was 16. 33 mm long and 3. 85 mm wide. The anterior maxillary bone has an average thickness of 7. 63 mm. The dimensions of the incisive foramen and <b>incisive</b> <b>canal,</b> and anterior maxillary bone thickness demonstrated gender differences with males showing greater values. The anterior maxillary bone thickness was affected by age but this difference was not observed in canal dimensions. The majority of subjects have a funnel shape-like <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> with the broader opening located at its superior. They seem to have a longer slanted-curve canal with one channel at its middle portion and a narrower incisive foramen opening than those reported elsewhere. Conclusions:This study found that gender is an important factor that affected the characteristics of the IC and the amount of bone anterior to it. Male generally had bigger IC and thicker anterior bone.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the location and characteristics of mental foramen, anterior loop and mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Materials and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated 200 mandibular CBCT scans for the location of mental foramen, anterior loop prevalence and mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> visibility, its mean length and distance to buccal and lingual plates and inferior border of the mandible. The effect of age and gender on these variables was also analyzed (P< 0. 05). Results: Anterior loop and mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> were seen in 59. 5 % and 97. 5 % of the cases, respectively. The mean length of the mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> was 10. 48 ± 4. 53 mm in the right and 10. 40 ± 4. 52 mm in the left side. The mean distance from the endpoints of the canal to buccal plate was 3. 63 ± 1. 73 mm in the right and 3. 66 ± 1. 45 mm in the left side. These distances were 3. 89 ± 1. 53 mm in the right and 4. 13 ± 1. 48 mm in the left side to lingual plate and 9. 98 ± 2. 07 mm in the right and 8. 62 ± 1. 97 mm in the left side to the inferior border of the mandible. The distance from the endpoints of the canal to lingual plate was significantly different in {{the right and left}} sides. The distance from the endpoint of the canal to the buccal plate and inferior border of the mandible was significantly shorter in females (P= 0. 016), and had a weak, significant correlation with age (rsp= 0. 215, P= 0. 003). Conclusions: Due to variability in mandibular <b>incisive</b> <b>canal</b> length and high prevalence of anterior loop, CBCT is recommended before surgical manipulation of interforaminal region.
