In his inaugural address, he appealed to his nation's special consciousness, saying: [...] "Our situation, which {{differs from that}} of most other nations, is no reason to deny {{ourselves}} a national consciousness. To do so would be unhealthy <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> eerie to our neighbors." [...] He dedicated his first years in office mainly to foreign policy, travelling widely with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and choosing former Foreign Office employees as his personal advisors.|$|E

Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902.

2500|$|Taunton {{was founded}} by {{settlers}} from England and officially incorporated as a town on September 3, 1639. Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton in Somerset, England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, [...] "in honour and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, {{in the midst of}} the heathen, for a possession <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> for our posterity after us."

After all, who in 1964 had ever heard of a former Conservative cabinet minister thinking that immigration was an important political issue?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Babur {{still wanted}} {{to escape from the}} Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, [...] "In the {{presence}} of such power and potency, we had to think of some place <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and,</b> at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman." [...] After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached Chenab, now in Pakistan, in 1519. Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire. At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim. He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne, but the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.|$|E

2500|$|During 1559 the Lords of the Congregation {{dominated}} most {{of central}} Scotland and entered Edinburgh, forcing Mary of Guise {{to retreat to}} Dunbar Castle. However, {{with the aid of}} 2,000 French troops, she regained control of the capital in July. A short-lived truce was made with the Articles of Leith on 25 July 1559. Guise received further military aid from France, thanks to the influence of Jacques de la Brosse and the Bishop of Amiens. The Lords considered this assistance a breach of the Leith articles. Châtellerault wrote to summon other Scottish lords at the start of October 1559 to resolve their situation: ...it is not unknawin how the Franchmen hes begun mair nor 20 dayis to fortifie the toun of Leyth, tending thairthrow to expell the inhabitantis thairoff and plant thame selffis, thair wyffis and bairnis thairintill suppressing the libertie of this realme. Mary of Guise responded to these letters by making a proclamation on 2 October and writing to Lord Seton, Provost of Edinburgh, that it was well known that Leith was fortified {{as a response to the}} Congregation's intent to come in arms to Edinburgh on 8 October 1559, rather than to accommodate French troops and their families. She wrote [...] "we could do no less than provide ourselves with some sure retreat <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> our company if we were pursued." [...] The French, she said, had not brought their families.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, Protestant {{soteriology}} {{developed the}} view that {{each one of the}} elect (saved) experienced instantaneous glorification upon death. [...] As such, there was little reason to pray for the dead. [...] Luther wrote in Question No. 211 in his expanded Small Catechism: [...] "We should pray <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> for all other people, even for our enemies, but not for the souls of the dead." [...] Luther, after he stopped believing in purgatory around 1530, openly affirmed the doctrine of soul sleep. Purgatory came to be seen as one of the [...] "unbiblical corruptions" [...] that had entered Church teachings sometime subsequent to the apostolic age. [...] Hence, the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England produced during the English Reformation stated: [...] "The Romish doctrine concerning Purgatory...is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture; but rather repugnant to the word of God" [...] (article 22). [...] Likewise, John Calvin, central theologian of Reformed Protestantism, considered purgatory a superstition, writing in his Institutes (5.10): [...] "The doctrine of purgatory ancient, but refuted by a more ancient Apostle. Not supported by ancient writers, by Scripture, or solid argument. Introduced by custom and a zeal not duly regulated by the word of God… we must hold by the word of God, which rejects this fiction." [...] In general, this position remains indicative of Protestant belief today, with the notable exception of certain Anglo-Catholics, such as the Guild of All Souls, which describe themselves as Reformed and Catholic (and specifically not Protestant) and believe in purgatory.|$|E

2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home <b>for</b> <b>ourselves,</b> <b>and</b> 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
