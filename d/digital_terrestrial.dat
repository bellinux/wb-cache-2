5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, <b>Digital</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> Broadcasting in Australia, containing the preliminary {{conclusions of the}} group.

It was too early at the time to make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analog television should be phased out.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 1998, Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, {{announced}} the government's {{decisions for the}} introduction of digital television.

5|$|By 2005, {{several other}} EyeTV {{products}} had been introduced, {{such as the}} EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. The EyeTV for DTT (<b>digital</b> <b>terrestrial</b> TV) is a small USB-powered device with an antenna for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar. A review in The Register gave it an 85 percent rating. The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with an analog tuner for watching TV on a Mac computer.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled <b>Digital</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E
5|$|The final report, of {{the same}} name, was {{released}} in 1997.

The year 2000 was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent <b>digital</b> <b>terrestrial</b> broadcasting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experience gained}} {{in the application}} of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>digital</b> photogrammetry and <b>terrestrial</b> laser scanning for the characterization of the structure of high mountain rock slopes and large landslides. A methodology allowing the creation and registration of 3 -D models with limited access to high mountain rock slopes is developed and its accuracy verified. The importance of occlusion, ground resolution, scale and reflectivity are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the concept of observation scale and resulting scale bias and its influence on discontinuity characterization. The step-path geometry of persistent composite surfaces and its role in remote sensing measurements are described. An example of combined <b>terrestrial</b> <b>digital</b> photogrammetry and <b>terrestrial</b> laser scanning applied in the generation of a 3 -D model of the South Peak of Turtle Mountain, the location of the Frank Slide, is presented. The advantages gained from the combined use of these techniques and the potential offered through long-range <b>terrestrial</b> <b>digital</b> photogrammetry, using high focal length lenses up to 400 mm is illustrated. Special emphasis is given to the potential of this specific technique, which has to the authors knowledge rarely been documented in the geotechnical literature...|$|R
