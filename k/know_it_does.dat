'Yes, miss,' {{returned}} her sister, 'and {{you ought to}} <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> And you do <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> {{and you do it}} because you <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> The principal pleasure of your life is to remind your family of their misfortunes. And the next great pleasure of your existence is to keep low company. But, however, if you have no sense of decency, I have. You'll please to allow me to go {{on the other side of}} the way, unmolested.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> sometimes, as in German now,' said Anne; 'but the {{question}} is, when it acquired a meaning equivalent in dignity to the French Chevalier.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheer up, Thea. It is over. You <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not often}} come here {{twice in the}} same night. I think we shall dare now to be comfortable." ...|$|E
60|$|My heart gave a {{jump and}} then stopped beating. I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> {{although}} Johnny says it is impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is nonsense. It is his own, and he <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Does</b> {{he think}} that I am likely to raise any {{question}} against his right?" ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. Never mind him, Ann. You were right, quite right. Ann {{was only}} doing her duty, Jack; and you <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>it</b> in the kindest way, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Payne--Aikin," [...] Ruby said, {{turning the}} names over to herself slowly. [...] "Ah, yes, I see. Excuse my misapprehension, Mr.--Mr. Aikin-Payne. It was very foolish of me; but really, you <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> sound so very ludicrous, doesn't it now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ta'e that 'at off—ta'e it off! Tha non goos wi' 'im this day, not if I <b>know</b> <b>it!</b> <b>Does</b> 'e think tha 'rt a cow, or a pig, to be fetched wheniver 'e thinks fit. Ta'e that 'at off, I say!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew I shouldn't go far {{wrong in}} putting {{you on the}} window. The fact is, you and me are gentlemen, mind you I wouldn't say this in the department, but you and me are gentlemen, and that always tells. It's no good your telling me it doesn't tell, because I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! sir--but a thoughtless {{young person}} will {{sometimes}} step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have often <b>known</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> myself." ...|$|R
50|$|Although 3...d6 was {{previously}} <b>known,</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not become a}} major variation until Fischer advocated it in a famous 1961 article in {{the first issue of}} the American Chess Quarterly.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Heschel {{asked the}} Jewish Theological Seminary in New York to {{consider}} her application to its rabbinical school, although she <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not ordain women at that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said Flora, not by {{any means}} wishing to displease her sisters. [...] "If {{there is such a thing}} as an excess of generosity, it is sure to be among ourselves. I only <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not suit me. It will make us all uncomfortable {{whenever}} we meet the Andersons or Mr. Wilmot, or any one else, and as to such tenderness to Harvey Anderson, I think it is thrown away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think--if {{it is to}} have an interpretation, though I am {{not sure}} we ought to take it so seriously, it would only mean that in younger days people care for victory and {{distinction}} in this world, like Norman, or as papa most likely did then; but, as they grow older, they care less, and others pass them, and they <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not signify, for in our race all may win." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{eyes are}} burning. I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> them harm to cry. How can I help crying? It {{is all over}} between us, if I let Oscar go away alone--his letter as good as tells me so. Oh, why have I behaved so coldly to him? I ought to make any {{sacrifice}} of my own feelings to atone for it. And yet, there is an obstinate something in me that shrinks--What am I to do? what am I to do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} that," [...] said Jock, hanging his mischievous black head a little, {{as he felt}} her shudder; [...] "but I {{thought it would be}} such fun to be Columbus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is false," [...] she answered, [...] "If {{your man}} Polden publishes Parkins's story my husband's {{political}} career is over, and you <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Do</b> keep as {{near to the}} truth as you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Ay, will there! Well I <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Do</b> {{you mind}} how {{when you were}} but a bairn you used to say, “Wait till I’m a man, and you’ll never have a reason for {{greeting}} again?”’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{that there}} is {{anything}} to forgive,' said Leonard, 'only it is odd that one cares for it more than--No, no, don't tell him that, but that I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not signify. It must not come between us, if {{this is to be}} the end; and it will make no difference. Nothing can do that but the finding my receipt. I see that book night and day before my eyes, with the very blot that I made in the top of my L.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{may have}} thought so in my rage once, but I know better now. She was the victim and not the agent. Did Madame de Florac play you false when she married her husband? It was her fate, and she {{underwent}} it. We all bow to it, {{we are in the}} track and the car passes over us. You <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> father." [...] The Colonel was a fatalist: he had often advanced this Oriental creed in his simple discourses with his son and Clive's friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't tell; you <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not depend}} on me, and I {{certainly}} shall not ask it as a favour. Camilla, did I tell you that I tried to make my father understand the state of things, and speak to Raymond? But he would only say, that while I am so young and inexperienced, {{it is a great}} advantage for me to live with Mrs. Poynsett, and that I must be the greatest comfort to her. Papa is an intense believer in Mrs. Poynsett, and when he once has taken up a notion nothing will convince him." ...|$|E
6000|$|FENWICK. <b>Know</b> <b>it?</b> <b>Do</b> {{you think}} I cannot guess? Do you think I {{had not heard}} he {{followed}} you? Do you think I had not suffered--O, suffered! George Austin is the man. Dear shall he pay it! ...|$|R
50|$|The frequentist {{interpretation}} does resolve {{difficulties with}} the classical interpretation, such as any problem where the natural symmetry of outcomes is not <b>known.</b> <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not address other issues, {{such as the}} dutch book. Propensity probability is an alternative physicalist approach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh,--so unmanly again! Of course I have to marry. Who <b>does</b> not <b>know</b> <b>it?</b> <b>Do</b> {{you want}} to see me begging my bread about the streets? You have bread; or if not, you might earn it. If you marry for money--" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the open}} door of the large room I met Mrs. Chester, evidently on her way out-of-doors. She wore a wide straw hat, her hands were gloved, and she carried a basket and a pair of large shears. When she saw me there was a sudden flush upon her face, but it {{disappeared}} quickly. Whether this meant that she was agreeably surprised to see me again, or whether it showed that she resented my turning up again so soon after she thought she was finally rid of me, I did not <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not do to predicate too much upon the flushes of women.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have been}} made so miserable by Chopin's Marche funèbre. Try two of Schubert's songs, [...] "Ich unglückselige Atlas" [...] and [...] "Du schönes Fischermädchen"--they are very jolly. I have read aloud my death-cycle from Walt Whitman this evening. I was very much {{affected}} myself, never so much before, and it fetched the auditory considerable. Reading these things that I like aloud when I am painfully excited is the keenest artistic pleasure I <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>does</b> seem strange that these dependent arts--singing, acting, and in its small way reading aloud seem the best rewarded of all arts. I am sure it is more exciting for me to read {{than it was for}} W. W. to write; and how much more must this be so with singing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your mother met every test cheerfully and instantly, and {{demonstrated}} to me, as Home did to Crookes, as Slade did to Zöllner, that matter, {{as we think}} we <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> <b>does</b> not exist. She convinced me not merely of her honesty, but of her high powers as a psychic. A calm, persistent, logical purpose ran through all her manifestations, and her Voices--whatever they may mean to you--advised me to sit again with her and to have you and Miss Wood, Mrs. Joyce, and Marie always in the circle. This I intend to do. I feel at this moment as if no other business mattered. I have been here at my desk since midnight, reading, comparing notes, trying to convince myself that I have not gone suddenly mad.|$|E
60|$|This little speech heartened me wonderfully, as I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> many of {{the other}} lads, because their faces brightened and they {{clutched}} their muskets with a certain show of determination which told that they would do their best to obey the command.|$|R
60|$|MILLIKEN.--Oh, Touchit <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> <b>did</b> he? {{and thought}} it honorable--honorable. Ha! ha! to marry a footman--and keep a public-house? I--I beg your pardon, John Howell--I mean nothing against you, you know. You're an honorable man enough, except {{that you have been}} damned insolent to my brother-in-law.|$|R
60|$|So {{long as you}} <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> which, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not make}} much difference.|$|R
60|$|I {{have learned}} a number of things, and am educated, now, but I wasn't at first. I was ignorant at first. At first it used to vex me because, with all my watching, I was never smart enough to be around when the water was running uphill; but now I do not mind it. I have experimented and experimented until now I know it never does run uphill, except in the dark. I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> in the dark, because the pool never goes dry, which it would, of course, if the water didn't {{come back in the}} night. It is best to prove things by actual experiment; then you KNOW; whereas if you depend on {{guessing}} and supposing and conjecturing, you never get educated.|$|E
6000|$|... "I crave your ladyship's pardon," [...] said Whitaker, {{with much}} reverence; [...] "I hope I know my place. I am your ladyship's poor servant; and I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not become me {{to drink and}} swear like your ladyship--that is, like his honour, Sir Geoffrey, I would say. But I pray you, if I am not to drink and swear after my degree, how are men to know Peveril of the Peak's steward,--and I may say butler too, since I have had the keys of the cellar ever since old Spigots was shot dead on the {{northwest}} turret, with a black jack in his hand,--I say, how is an old Cavalier like me to be known from those cuckoldly Roundheads that do nothing but fast and pray, {{if we are not}} to drink and swear according to our degree?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{people at}} Delhi have beaten back the Sepoys several times, and at Lucknow they resist stoutly. The Nana is very angry {{that the place}} has not been taken, but from what I hear the intrenchments there are much {{stronger}} than they were here, and even here they were not taken by the sword, but because the whites had no shelter from the guns, and could {{not go to the}} well without exposing themselves to the fire. At Lucknow they have some strong houses in the intrenchments, and no want of anything, so they can only be captured by fighting. Everyone says they cannot hold out many days longer, but that I do not <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not seem to me that there is any hope of rescue for them, for even if, as you think, the white troops should beat Nana Sahib's men, they never could force their way through the streets of Lucknow to the intrenchments there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no penalty unless we're found out, {{and there}} ain't {{the ghost of}} a chance of that. The books are in your hands; I got all the clerks fixed. Not a {{question}} will even be raised. I <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Do</b> you suppose I'd risk state's prison myself, if I wasn't sure?" ...|$|R
60|$|Q. What do {{you mean}} by feigning and dissembling in this work?--A. When men confess <b>it,</b> yet <b>know</b> not what <b>it</b> is; or if they think they <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> <b>do</b> not {{conclude}} <b>it</b> so bad as it is; or when men ask pardon of God, but do not see their need of pardon; this man must needs dissemble.|$|R
