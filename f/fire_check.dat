50|$|Fallout 2 is a {{role-playing}} open world video game. The {{player is}} free to move at will until they enter into combat. Combat gives them a number of action points to move, <b>fire,</b> <b>check</b> their equipment, reload and the like. When a player uses up all of their action points, they end their turn and enemies start theirs. If the player survives unharmed, {{he or she has}} their action points restored. Injuries and poisons can reduce the number of action points available both in a single term and semi-permanently until combat ends and the player can be treated. Combat and completion of jobs or quests rewards the player with experience points with which they can level up their characters and apply beneficial perks to become more suited to the dangerous post-apocalyptic world. General gameplay consists of traveling and interacting with local inhabitants and organizations to complete goals and aid or inhibit the NPCs. The player's actions dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Mature themes such as alcohol consumption, drug usage and sex are present.|$|E
50|$|A braai is {{a social}} {{occasion}} that has specific traditions and social norms. In black and white South African culture, women rarely cook meat at a social gathering, as this is normally the preserve of men. The men gather round the braaistand (the grill) outdoors and cook the meat, while women prepare the pap, salads, desserts, and vegetables in the kitchen. The meal is subsequently eaten outside by the braai stand, since these gatherings are normally hosted during the long summer months. The cooking of the meat is not the prerogative of all the men attending, as one person is normally in charge. He will attend to the <b>fire,</b> <b>check</b> that the coals are ready, and cook the meat. Etiquette holds that others {{are not permitted to}} interfere with the braai operator's duties, except if expressly asked to help. Other men may assist in the cooking, but generally only partake in fireside conversations while having a drink in hand. What often makes a braai different from barbecue in that it is the 'go-to' social event for many South Africans, from Christmas Day, to graduation parties, to birthdays and every day get togethers, used as a means to celebrate. Other cultures may reserve a barbecue as a special event in its own right.|$|E

However, their low wages and the uncongenial nature of the job attracted a fairly low standard of person, and they acquired a possibly-exaggerated reputation for being old, ineffectual, feeble, drunk or asleep on the job.|$|R
50|$|Poor {{coordination}} between Duffield's column and the North Atlantic Fleet {{led to an}} ineffective bombardment of the Spanish positions. By the time the Americans arrived, {{the west end of}} the only bridge had been dismantled and the river gorge was impassable. Seven hundred men of the 33rd Michigan Regiment pressed the attack on land but proved unable to close on the Spanish positions. Spanish rifle <b>fire</b> <b>checked</b> the American advance at the river crossing and Duffield, sustaining casualties from accurate small-arms fire, called off the attack and withdrew to Siboney.|$|R

The other three French columns advanced steadily, with thirty light guns in the intervals between them. Donzelat's brigade attacked La Haye Sainte, and, {{in spite of a}} gallant resistance by the Germans, made its way into the orchard and surrounded the inclosures. Another brigade, pushing along {{on the other side of}} the Charleroi road, were met by the fire of two companies of the rifle brigade who occupied a sandpit there, and by their heavy and accurate <b>fire</b> <b>checked</b> the French advance. The other two divisions moved straight against that part of the crest held by Picton's division.|$|R
30|$|On {{the day of}} the burn, the {{community}} member or members managing the <b>fire</b> <b>checks</b> wind strength and direction to determine ignition point placement. Personal preference and experience play a role in this placement. Some said that they prefer building controlled fires on days with light breezes, as stronger winds can blow the fire out of control. These farmers rely on the breezes to spread their headfire ignitions. More cautious and experienced fire managers “start their fires against the wind so that the fire doesn’t have much force and can be controlled” [REM Guard B, Madjadjane]. This backfire ignition practice allows people to use controlled burns in periods of stronger winds, such as during winter. Burn site size determines the use of a single ignition point or a series of ignition points.|$|R

At six in {{the morning}} the enemy were seen {{advancing}} in force, but Lieutenant Grant sent out thirty men to the farthest wall of the village, some four hundred yards in advance of the enclosure; and their <b>fire</b> <b>checked</b> the enemy, and forced them to retire. At three in the afternoon the enemy advanced in great force, their line being over a mile long. Grant again occupied the front wall, and held his fire till the enemy reached a point which had been carefully marked as being six hundred yards away. Fire was then opened, the muskets being sighted for this known range. The tribesmen fell in great numbers, and drew back under the protection of their artillery, who now opened fire at a range of about a thousand yards. In half an hour they were completely silenced.|$|R

500|$|The next morning, September 11, the 19th Infantry {{passed through}} the {{left-hand}} ROK regiment just south of Hill 131 and, with the 1st Battalion leading, attacked west. At 09:30 it captured without opposition the first hill mass [...] west of its starting point.

There, North Koreans held entrenched positions, and their machine gun <b>fire</b> <b>checked</b> the 2nd Battalion {{for the rest of}} the day. The morning of September 12 four Australian pilots from No. 77 Squadron RAAF struck the North Korean positions with napalm, and an artillery preparation followed the strike. The 2nd Battalion then launched its attack and secured Hill 482 about 12:00. That afternoon, ROK forces relieved Task Force Davidson on the hill mass, and the task force descended to the valley southwest of Yongdok-tong for the night. On September 13, Task Force Davidson returned to Kyongju.|$|R

These were, however, dispersed {{by the rest of the}} 13th and, driving back the Burmese on the flanks, the advance was continued. Presently, however, as the British issued from the jungle, a mass of the enemy's horse charged down, drove back the skirmishers and, for a time, the position of the general and his staff was one of great peril. His little body of troopers, however, dashed boldly at the assailants and held them in check, until the guns that had followed the staff were brought forward from the jungle. Then the troopers divided and rode right and left; and the guns, opening <b>fire,</b> <b>checked</b> the assailants until the infantry came up.|$|R

Red Cloud, Company E, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action against the enemy. From his position on the point of a ridge immediately in front of the company command post he was the first to detect the approach of the Chinese Communist forces and give the alarm as the enemy charged from a brush-covered area less than 100 feet from him. Springing up, he delivered devastating pointblank automatic rifle fire into the advancing enemy. His accurate and intense <b>fire</b> <b>checked</b> this assault and gained time for the company to consolidate its defense. With utter fearlessness he maintained his firing position until severely wounded by enemy fire. Refusing assistance he pulled himself to his feet and, wrapping his arm around a tree, continued his deadly fire again, until he was fatally wounded. This heroic act stopped the enemy from overrunning his company's position and gained time for reorganization and evacuation of the wounded. Cpl. Red Cloud's dauntless courage and gallant self-sacrifice reflects the highest credit upon himself and upholds the esteemed traditions of the U.S. Army.|$|R

A skirmish ensued, gallantly sustained on each side, but the superiority of Tarleton's horses gave him the advantage. General Choisy hastened up with a corps of cavalry and infantry to support the hussars. In the medley fight, a dragoon's horse, wounded by a lance, plunged, and overthrew both Tarleton and his steed. The rear-guard rushed from their covert to rescue their commander. They came galloping up in such disorder, that they were roughly received by Lauzun's hussars, who were drawn up on the plain. In the meantime Tarleton scrambled out of the melée, mounted another horse, and ordered a retreat, to enable his men to recover from their confusion. Dismounting forty infantry, he placed them in a thicket. Their <b>fire</b> <b>checked</b> the hussars in their pursuit. The British dragoons rallied, and were about to charge, when the hussars retired behind their infantry, and a fire was opened upon the British by some militia from behind a fence. Tarleton again ordered a retreat to be sounded, and the conflict came to an end. This was the last affair of Tarleton and his legion in the revolutionary war.
