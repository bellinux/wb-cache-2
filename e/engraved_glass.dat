5|$|Monastic {{foundations}} {{were once}} abundant in Dorset, but all {{ceased to exist}} at the Dissolution. The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until {{the turn of the}} 18th century. Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George's Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style. A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth—the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation. George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including St Peter's and St Stephen's. St Dunstan's Church (formerly St Osmund's) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior, {{it is one of the}} last examples of the Neo Byzantine style. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> windows designed by Laurence Whistler. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984.|$|E

25|$|Lower {{down the}} dining rooms were fitted {{out with the}} {{intention}} that the rooms would be visual equivalents of the excellent food served within them. The Chambord dining room was decorated by Mrs. Darbois-Gaudin in gold anodized aluminium, with monochrome chairs in red, orange and cream. The dome, painted black, contained an array of recessed spot-lights, and sat within a circular band of translucent, fluorescent-lit panels, all on a truncated rotunda of gold aluminium. Around all four walls of the room Jean Mandaroux's continuous mural, painted on 17 lacquered aluminium sheets, was entitled Les plaisirs de la vie: The Pleasures of Life. Less sumptuous in design, the Versailles dining room was done by Marc Simon in tones of green, white and grey. The walls were produced from Polyrey and Formica with a decoupaged gold leaf abstract pattern. Only the forward wall held a mural done in 14 <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> panels by Max Ingrand, {{as well as two}} tapestries, Les amoureux du printemps by Marc Saint-Saëns, and Paysage provençal by Auvigné. Lowest in the ship, the walls of the First Class swimming pool were covered with back-lit <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> panels by Max Ingrand, and a ceramic sculptural fountain by Jean Mayodon sat at the forward end of the room.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 17th century, Lehmann adapted the {{techniques}} of using copper and bronze wheels to engrave gems to <b>engrave</b> <b>glass.</b> Though both intaglio (Tiefschnitt, “deep cut”) and high relief (Hochschnitt, “high cut”) <b>engraving</b> on <b>glass</b> had been practiced since ancient times, Lehmann was the earliest modern <b>glass</b> <b>engraver</b> to develop an advanced technique and a personal style. His earliest dated work is a glass beaker, dated 1605. In 1609, he received an exclusive privilege from Emperor Rudolf II in Prague for <b>engraving</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{memorial}} {{sits on a}} hill {{overlooking the}} celebrated Thames meadow of Runnymede where Magna Carta, enshrining basic freedoms in English law, was signed in 1215. The memorial was designed by Sir Edward Maufe with sculpture by Vernon Hill. The <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> and painted ceilings were designed by John Hutton and the poem engraved on the gallery window was written by Paul H Scott. It overlooks the River Thames on Cooper's Hill at Englefield Green between Windsor and Egham on the A328 (Priest Hill), 4 miles from Windsor and is well signposted as 'Air Force Memorial'.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not confess {{any such}} thing," [...] said I hardily. [...] "I grant you that, in that {{department}} of paper-hangings which exhibits floral decoration, the French designs and execution are, and must be {{for some time to}} come, far ahead of all the world: their drawing of flowers, vines, and foliage has the accuracy of botanical studies and the grace of finished works of art, and we cannot as yet pretend in America to do anything equal to it. But for satin finish, and for a variety of exquisite tints of plain colors, American papers equal any in the world: our gilt papers even surpass in the heaviness and polish of the gilding those of foreign countries; and we have also gorgeous velvets. All I have to say is, let people who are furnishing houses inquire for articles of American manufacture, and they will be surprised at what they will see. We need go no farther than our Cambridge glassworks to see that the most dainty devices of cut-glass, crystal, ground and <b>engraved</b> <b>glass</b> of every color and pattern, may be had of American workmanship, every way equal to the best European make, and for half the price. And American painting on china is so well executed, both in Boston and New York, that deficiencies in the finest French or English sets can be made up in a style not distinguishable from the original, as one may easily see by calling on our worthy next neighbor, Briggs, who holds the opposite corner to our 'Atlantic Monthly.' No porcelain, it is true, is yet made in America, these decorative arts being exercised on articles imported from Europe. Our tables must, therefore, perforce, be largely indebted to foreign lands for years to come. Exclusive of this item, however, I believe it would require very little self-denial to paper, carpet, and furnish a house entirely from the manufactures of America. I cannot help saying one word here in favor of the cabinet-makers of Boston. There is so much severity of taste, such a style and manner about the best-made Boston furniture, as raises it really quite into the region of the fine arts. Our artisans have studied foreign models with judicious eyes, and so transferred to our country the spirit of what is best worth imitating that one has no need to import furniture from Europe." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>engraving</b> {{is a form}} of {{decorative}} glasswork that involves <b>engraving</b> a <b>glass</b> surface or object. It is distinct from glass art in the narrow sense, which refers to moulding and blowing glass, and from glass etching which uses acidic, caustic, or abrasive substances to achieve artistic effects. Some artists may combine two or more techniques. There are several different types of <b>glass</b> <b>engraving.</b>|$|R

50|$|He devoted {{himself to}} <b>glass</b> <b>engraving,</b> on goblets and bowls blown {{to his own}} designs, and (increasingly, as he became more celebrated) on {{large-scale}} panels and windows in churches and private houses. He also engraved on three-sided prisms, some of them designed to revolve on a small turntable so that the prism's internal reflections complete the image. The best-known of these was done as a memorial to his elder brother, Rex Whistler. His son, Simon Whistler, also became a <b>glass</b> <b>engraver.</b> In 1935 Laurence Whistler became the first recipient of the King's Gold Medal for Poetry.

40|$|Born in Sutton Coldfield in 1949, Katharine is a {{freelance}} <b>glass</b> <b>engraver</b> and designer. She was taught point, drill and copper wheel <b>engraving</b> on <b>glass</b> by Peter Dreiser at Morley College, Lambeth from 1984 - 7 and continues to explore these techniques at her workshop in Clerkenwell. Katharine engraves on clear lead crystal forms, overlaid with coloured glass, blown to her design. Her work requires close collaboration with glassblowers Potter Morgan Glass and Sonja Klingler. Once blown and annealed, the top surface of the glass is cut and polished to allow one to see inside the piece, usually {{with the help of}} coldworker Steve Frey of Cold Glass Workshop, Frome. It is then engraved on the outside surface. The engraved decoration reflects and refracts onto the inner surface,creating an illusion of one body floating inside another. The inspiration for her work ranges from natural history to the modern urban landscape. Katharine’s work has been exhibited widely in the UK and Europe, USA and Japan and can be seen in many public collections. She feels strongly that wheel <b>engraving</b> on <b>glass</b> {{does not need to be}} traditional in style or content. She prefers traditional techniques, <b>engraving</b> the <b>glass</b> surface with lathe-mounted copper, diamond and stone wheels, with which she is able to obtain the crispness, textures and fine finish; so difficult to achieve with sandblast and drill. Katharine was awarded an MBE for services to <b>glass</b> <b>engraving</b> in 2009.
