30|$|The next {{point of}} concern {{arises from the}} annual period of analysis. Without any data {{on the number of}} months of benefit receipt, we make the {{assumption}} of 12  months of receipt. In some cases, the amount recorded in the microdata for a particular aggregated benefit exceeds the maximum amount that can be gained from the instrument. In those cases, we reallocate the excess amount to other income. This can be the case where, for example, retirement income or lump sum pensions are recorded as part of old age benefits. Thus our methodology will tend to over-estimate insurance benefits for those with alternative income sources. In order to assess the effect of this, we utilised the equations to predict the likely receipt of disaggregated benefits, then simulated the value of each benefit and then re-aggregated them again to be able to compare with the <b>equivalent</b> <b>characteristics</b> in the data.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the valuation of derivative securities in a stochastic volatility framework, which is a central problem in financial mathematics. The derivatives to be priced are of European type with the payoff depending on both the stock and the volatility. The valuation approach uses utility-based criteria under the assumption of exponential risk preferences. This methodology yields the indifference prices as solutions to second order quasilinear PDEs. Two sets of price bounds are derived that highlight the important ingredients of the utility approach, namely, nonlinear pricing rules with dynamic certainty <b>equivalent</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and pricing measures depending on correlation and the Sharpe ratio of the traded asset. The problem is further analyzed by asymptotic methods in the limit of the volatility being a fast mean reverting process.

40|$|The new {{similarity}} {{laws for}} fluid-to-fluid modeling of two-phase flow {{critical heat flux}} (CHF) in horizontal helically coiled tubes were derived based on the dimensional analysis and similarity theory considering {{the effect of the}} geometrical parameters on CHF. A generalized factor Dn was introduced to the new similarity laws, and all the new dimensionless numbers were derived from the classical theorem of Buckingham for dimensional analysis. The obtained dimensionless parameter sets were a reasonable extension to Ahmad’s compensated distortion model, which may be considered as a special case of the new dimensionless parameter sets when the variable n is equal to unity. Based on the experimental data, the specific similarity numbers were determined for CHF phenomena in horizontal helically coiled tubes. A new <b>equivalent</b> <b>characteristic</b> parameter De-helix was developed, which could reflect the influence of complex flow channels on the occurrence of CHF. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>characteristic</b> parameter consists of the essential geometrical parameters of tubes and the fluid thermophysical properties.

This paper discusses the experimental assessment of the phenomenon in steady-state cornering, for a fully electric vehicle with multiple motors, allowing different front-to-rear wheel torque distributions. The results confirm that the yaw moment effect of the front traction forces is significant, especially at low vehicle speeds and high lateral accelerations. In particular, in the case study maneuvers, the RWD configuration of the vehicle resulted more understeering than the FWD one at the speed of 30 km/h...|$|E
30|$|The PD system {{investigated}} here {{is based}} on multi-carrier transmission on frequency selective channels as in [16], where different criteria can be adopted to partition the bandwidth in FD and HD segments. Two different strategies in the assignment of the FD sub-carriers are revised in Section 4.1, one based on a block allocation, named block partial-duplex, {{and the other one}} based on selective allocation, named selective partial-duplex. The PD scheme has obviously two extreme cases, the full HD and the full FD, and can be applied either to point-to-point high-capacity links or to point-to-multi-point links in cellular scenarios. W.r.t. FD, our approach balances a capacity loss, coming from the partial use of the bandwidth simultaneously in the two transmission directions, with a decrease of the SIC requirements. Here, we limit our study on symmetrical point-to-point links where the transceiver equipments at both ends have <b>equivalent</b> <b>characteristics,</b> e.g., noise figure and SIC capability, and the propagation introduces path loss and Rayleigh frequency selective fading. The numerical results are then extended to a standardized International Telecommunication Union - vehicular A (ITU-VehA) frequency selective fading model.|$|E

The internal characterization, which describes H(K) as a subspace of those continuous functions on a compact space K which are finely harmonic on the fine interior of K, is then used as the definition of H(K) in abstract potential theory. Further we concentrate on the solution of the Dirichlet problem for open and compact sets mainly with regards to its relation to subclasses of Baire class one functions. The results, proved at first in classical potential theory, are later generalized to abstract potential theory. With a use of more elemen- tary tools we initially prove these results in harmonic spaces with the axiom of dominance and, subsequently, using stronger tools we generalize them to harmonic spaces with the axiom of polarity. We engage also in a more abstract problem of approximation by differen- ces of lower semicontinuous functions in a more general context of binormal topological spaces...|$|E

In this paper, we extend the popular Wireless World Initiative for New Radio (WINNER) channel model with new features {{to make it as}} realistic as possible. Our approach enables more realistic evaluation results at an early stage of algorithm development. The new model supports 3 -D propagation, 3 -D antenna patterns, time evolving channel traces of arbitrary length, scenario transitions and variable terminal speeds. We validated the model by measurements in a coherent LTE advanced testbed in downtown Berlin, Germany. We then reproduced the same scenario in the model and compared several channel parameters (delay spread, path gain, K-factor, geometry factor and capacity). The results match very well and we can accurately predict the performance for an urban macro-cell setup with commercial high-gain antennas. At the same time, the computational complexity does not increase significantly and we can use all existing WINNER parameter tables.
