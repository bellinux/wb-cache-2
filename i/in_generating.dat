5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early bells not only have an important role <b>in</b> <b>generating</b> metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. With the emergence of other kinds of bells during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared to be involved <b>in</b> <b>generating</b> the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase <b>in</b> <b>generating</b> capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E
40|$|Whenever code {{generation}} {{is used to}} abstract from low-level details or to provide high-level interfaces to software developers, type errors <b>in</b> <b>generated</b> code jeopar-dize the abstraction barrier: First, error messages are <b>in</b> terms of <b>generated</b> code and thus expose programmers to low-level details that should be hidden. Second, manual inspection of generated code {{may be necessary to}} identify the cause of the type error. Third, since a type error <b>in</b> <b>generated</b> code may be caused by either a defective generator or by invalid generator input, manual inspection of the generator may be necessary to identify the generator’s contract and whether the input adheres to that contract. Type errors <b>in</b> <b>generated</b> code present a serious usability threat for abstractions implemented via code generation. We address this problem in the context of code generators that extend a base language with new language constructs by translation into other constructs of the base language. Such code generators are sometimes referred to as desugarings. Many compilers employ desugarings to transform programs of the input language into a core language, so that subsequent compiler phases can focus on fewe...|$|R
