5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a <b>dissent</b> from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in <b>dissent,</b> deemed this unrealistic. Taft's <b>dissent</b> in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to <b>dissent</b> to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that <b>dissent</b> could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E

5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that <b>dissent</b> from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of <b>Dissent</b> as a crime.|$|E

He also <b>dissented</b> in policies which would seem to curtail the basic liberties of people. For a time, Teehankee and Justice Cecilia Muñoz-Palma would make <b>dissents</b> together.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree at Strathmore University Law SchoolDissenting opinions are a common feature of multipartite common law and International tribunals. More often than not they are expressions of disagreement by members of the tribunal and they seek to convince the majority of the existence of a different logicality. Although they lack the force of law, <b>dissenting</b> opinions {{have played a role in}} the development of law by informing future generations, furthermore, <b>dissenting</b> opinions allow judges to exercise; intellectual integrity and judicial independence. The benefits of <b>dissenting</b> opinions in superior state courts and international adjudicatory bodies are obvious. What is much less obvious are the benefits of <b>dissenting</b> opinions in arbitration, especially domestic multipartite arbitration. This research paper proposes that the process of arbitration may actually benefit from <b>dissenting</b> opinions rendered in multipartite tribunals. Furthermore, this research explores the challenges posed by <b>dissenting</b> opinions in arbitration. This research will seek to look at the various statutes and instruments in Kenya and how <b>dissenting</b> opinions in arbitral awards can be rendered within that framework. It will also move a step further and look into how other jurisdictions and international arbitration institutions response to <b>dissenting</b> opinions in arbitral awards. The research methodology applied in this paper is the review of literature dealing with <b>dissenting</b> opinions and awards. It will also employ the use of historical analysis and comparative analysis. As will be revealed by the paper embracing <b>dissenting</b> opinions in multipartite arbitration does offer potential benefits such as improved awards, maintenance of intellectual integrity and they have proved beneficial to parties challenging awards and appellate courts. The challenges posed by <b>dissenting</b> opinions in arbitral awards include an increase in the likelihood that the losing party will challenge the award, they also risk violating the secrecy of violations and there is the risk that party appointed arbitrators will misuse them to appease their appointing parties. The paper will recommend that these risks can be offset by a comprehensive code of ethics and that <b>dissenting</b> opinion should be expressly provided for...|$|R
