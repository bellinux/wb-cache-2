40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{determined}} {{the effects of}} various surface treatment modalities on the bond strength of composite resins to glass-ionomer cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional (KetacTM Molar Quick ApplicapTM) or resin-modified (PhotacTM Fil Quick AplicapTM) glass-ionomer cements were prepared. Two-step etch-rinse & bond adhesive (AdperTM Single Bond 2) or single-step self-etching adhesive (AdperTM PromptTM L-PopTM) {{was applied to the}} set cements. In the etch-rinse & bond group, the sample surfaces were pre-treated as follows: (1) no etching, (2) 15 s of etching with 35 % phosphoric acid, (3) 30 s of etching, and (4) 60 s of etching. Following the placement of the composite resin (FiltekTM Z 250), the bond strength was measured in a universal testing machine and the data obtained were analyzed with the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey's HSD post hoc analysis (p= 0. 05). Then, the fractured surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The bond strength of the composite resin to the conventional <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> was significantly lower than that to the resin-modified <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> (p 0. 05). However, a greater bond strength was obtained with 30 s of phosphoric acid application.

40|$|<b>Glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> {{are widely}} used in {{dentistry}} as restorative materials and adhesives for composite restorations. A number of genotoxicity {{studies have been conducted}} using these materials with results conflicting so far. Thus, the approach was aimed to look at the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of three different <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> available commercially (Ketac Cem, Ketac Molar and Vitrebond) by the single cell gel (comet) assay and trypan blue exclusion test, respectively. for this, such materials were exposed to mouse lymphoma cells in vitro for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Data were assessed by Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric test. the results showed that all powders assayed did not show genotoxic effects. On the other hand, the liquid from Vitrebond at 0. 1 % dilution caused an increase of DNA injury. Significant statistically differences (P < 0. 05) in cytotoxicity provoked by all powders tested were observed for exposure at 1000 mu g mL(- 1) concentration and 100 mu g mL(- 1) for Ketac Molar. With respect to liquids of <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> evaluated, the major toxic effect on cell viability was produced at 1 %, beginning at the dilution of 0. 5 % for Vitrebond.

40|$|Adhesive' {{restorative}} dentistry originated {{with the work}} of Buonocore in 1955 in bonding resin to etched enamel. Since then, adhesive materials and techniques have developed at a rapid rate. The first chemically adhesive material (zinc polycarboxylate cement) was marketed in the late 1960 s, and <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> and dentine bonding agents have since become available. This review focuses on the latter two products. <b>Glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> have a particular role in adhesive dentistry because of their reliable chemical adhesion to enamel and dentine, and because of their apparent ability to promote the remineralization of 'affected' dentine. Dentine bonding agents have undergone marked changes in presentation over the last 15 years, but all have an essentially similar bonding system, that of hybrid layer formation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{developed}} a novel <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> system composed of multi-arm poly(acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid) s. These polyacids were synthesized via a chain-transfer polymerization reaction using newly synthe-sized multi-arm chain-transfer agents. The cements formulated with the multi-arm polyacids showed significantly lower viscosities in water as compared to those formulated with the linear polyacids. Due to the lower viscosities, the MW of the polyacids can be significantly increased for enhanced mechanical strengths, while keeping the ease of mixing and handling. The experimental cements showed significantly improved compressive strengths as compared to Fuji II after aged in water for 3 months.

40|$|<b>Glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> (GIC) is a {{promising}} dental restorative material with numerous advantages. However, its inferior mechanical performances have {{limited its application}} to low-stress bearing sites. In this dissertation, we successfully improved the mechanical performance and wear resistance of <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> using two strategies: (1) modification on polymer matrix by using star-shaped poly(acrylic acid) s; and (2) modification of glass filler by using surface modified OX 50 (SiO 2) nanoparticles. Star-shaped poly(acrylic acid) s were synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction and then formulated into <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement.</b> The resultant GIC showed significantly better mechanical performances and wear resistance than commercial GICs. It also exhibited significantly better biocompatibility. The fluoride release was maintained in the cements of star-shaped polymers, while the curing shrinkage was limited to a low level. Surface modification of OX 50 nanoparticles was performed via surface-initiated ATRP reaction. OX 50 surfaced modified with poly(acrylic acid) significantly improved the mixing property. Although little improvement in mechanical strength was found; a significant improvement in attritional wear resistance was observed for all the cements containing surface modified nanoparticles. In general, both strategies have proved effective to improve the mechanical performances and wear resistance of GIC. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{influence}} of saliva contamination over the structural strength and integrity of conventional <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> used for cementing orthodontic bands in the absence and presence of a surface-protecting varnish. METHOD: 48 samples were prepared by inserting 3 types of <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> into standardized metallic matrixes of 10 mm of diameter and 2 mm of depth. The cements used were: Meron (VOCO), Ketac-Cem (3 M ESPE) and Vidrion C (DFL), all of which comprised groups A, B and C, respectively. Subgroups A 1, B 1 and C 1 comprised samples with no surface protection, whereas subgroups A 2, B 2 and C 2 comprised samples of which surface was coated with Cavitine varnish (SS White), after cement manipulation and application, in order to protect the cement applied. All samples were stored in artificial saliva for 24 hours at 37 ºC. A Vickers diamond micro-durometer was used to produce indentations on the non-treated group (non-varnished) and the treated group (varnished). RESULTS: Varnished materials had significantly higher microhardness values in comparison to non-varnished materials. Ketac-Cem had the highest microhardness value among the varnished materials.

Conventional glass-ionomers (GIC) were introduced to the dental profession by Wilson and Kent in 1972. The adhesion of these materials to dental tissue and their fluoride releasing capacity brought about their use as restoration bases and cement. In 1988, resin-modified <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> were developed to improve the high sensitivity to humidity and low mechanical strength of glass-ionomers.

To examine {{potential}} {{correlations between}} streptococcal biofilm formation and lactate production in streptococcal biofilms formed {{on the surface}} of dental materials with different surface characteristics.

Samples of a <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> (Ketac Molar) and a ceramic (Empress 2) were incubated with whole saliva and suspensions of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 or Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 33478 for initiating single-species biofilm formation for either 4 or 24 h. The relative amount of adherent, viable cells was determined using a Resazurin and a MTT assay. Metabolic activity was assessed by quantifying lactate production with a modification of the commercial Clinpro Cario L-Pop kit. Results. Both assays identified similar S. sobrinus biofilm formation on the two substrata; for S. mutans, the MTT test showed significantly fewer streptococci on the <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> than on the ceramic. Concerning metabolic activity, for S. sobrinus, significantly higher lactate production was observed for biofilms formed on the <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> in comparison to the ceramic, whereas similar values were identified for S. mutans.

Each group was divided into two equal subgroups, in order to study the effect of the storage condition on the shear bond strength for each group. It was found that group (V), where saline coupling agent was applied to the non-etched <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cement</b> surface, followed by the application of bonding agent, demonstrated the maximum shear bond strength (10. 87 mm/m 2). On the other hand, group (II) where composite resin was packed directly on the etched glass-ionomer surface displayed the minimum shear bond (1. 93 Mn/M 2). Moreover, the wet storage of the different groups elicited a varying percentage of reduction in the shear bond strength values. Cairo Universit...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the fluorescence properties of dry and wet samples of contemporary tooth-coloured restorative materials using a fluorescence based DSLR camera and a variety of LEDs emitting different wavelengths of visible light as excitation sources. The materials examined included resin composites; ceramics and hybrid restorative materials such as ormocers, Vita Enamic™ and resin reinforced <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements.</b> The levels of fluorescence for each sample under different combinations of incident light wavelengths and filters was analysed by using histogram data for colour channels from Adobe Photoshop software. Fluorescence patterns were influenced by water sorption of the materials. UV-A/Violet light (405 ± nm) produced the greatest range of luminosity values (10 – 204) amongst the tooth-coloured restorative materials, and showed the greatest differences between restorations and tooth structure. The best filter combinations with violet light were orange or yellow filters. Under ultraviolet excitation, Fuji VIII A 2 exhibited a unique bright pink fluorescence emission, while VitaEnamic™, ormocer and <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> emitted bluish-pink fluorescence emissions. In conclusion, restorative materials exhibited varied emission pattern under UV-A (405 nm) light, which enables their detection and differentiation from natural tooth structure. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Eugenol {{possesses}} analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties {{with the}} ability to relieve pain in irritated or diseased tooth pulp, thus, incorporating polymers with eugenol moieties in dental cements is attractive. An acrylic derivative of eugenyl methacrylate (EgMA) was copolymerized with acrylic acid (AA) using a radical initiator, to yield awater soluble copolymer of acrylic acid and eugenyl methacrylate p(AA-co-EgMA), which was then applied in the formulation of <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> for potential application as dental cements. Three concentrations of the p(AA-co-EgMA) copolymer in water were studied by, 30 wt...|$|R
40|$|Biomaterials for the {{restoration}} of oral function are prone to biofilm formation, affecting oral health. Oral bacteria adhere to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, but due to fluctuating shear, little biofilm accumulates on hydrophobic surfaces in vivo. More biofilm accumulates on rough than on smooth surfaces. Oral biofilms mostly consist of multiple bacterial strains, but Candida species are found on acrylic dentures. Biofilms on gold and amalgam in vivo are thick and fully covering, but barely viable. Biofilms on ceramics are thin and highly viable. Biofilms on composites and <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements</b> cause surface deterioration, which enhances biofilm formation again. Residual monomer release from composites influences biofilm growth in vitro, but effects in vivo are less pronounced, probably due to the large volume of saliva into which compounds are released and its continuous refreshment. Similarly, conflicting results have been reported on effects of fluoride release from <b>glass-ionomer</b> <b>cements.</b> Finally, biomaterial-associated infection of implants and devices elsewhere in the body is compared with oral biofilm formation. Biomaterial modifications to discourage biofilm formation on implants and devices are critically discussed for possible applications in dentistry. It is concluded that, for dental applications, antimicrobial coatings killing bacteria upon contact are more promising than antimicrobial-releasing coatings...|$|R
