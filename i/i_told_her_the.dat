60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> tale of {{the birth}} of Umslopogaas, for I trusted her.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> reasons which induced me {{to think}} of hastening my departure, exactly as I have told them here.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few words}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> tale that we had heard from the dying soldier, and she listened eagerly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>the</b> {{story of}} my release, and Emily listened to it in {{profound}} silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] she replied, [...] "nor can {{she think}} so if she {{believes}} {{half of what}} <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about you since. She knows how you saved <b>the</b> boy's life. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that in <b>the</b> old Lair because she had some harsh memories of you there; {{and it was at}} the Cuttle Well that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about <b>the</b> glove." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> everything, {{including}} <b>the</b> Vrouw Prinsloo's advice.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no reason}} to conceal anything, and so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> whole affair, from the very {{beginning}} to the end.|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. Well, all I know is {{that when}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> mine was {{probably}} a frost she went for me like steam.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{no reason}} why I should not do so. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> story of my early morning adventure. She listened with quivering lips.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> Knight, that wore [...] Upon his Shield {{a burning}} Brand; [...] And that for ten long Years he woo'd [...] The Lady of the Land.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>the</b> person was, {{and where}} it happened--and about the burglary. You can't imagine how silly people get when they begin going in that direction." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} let the good woman hold this opinion of my tenants, and <b>I</b> briefly <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> truth. She {{looked at me with}} moist admiration in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{told her}} ever so many dreadful things {{as soon as}} I found them out. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> whole story of your ankle, sir, for instance." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> Devil {{had more}} Occasion to form Beauties than other Angels had, his Business being principally to deceive and ensnare Mankind. And then I gave her some Examples upon the whole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{about his}} young woman. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> story; it was thoughtless, and yet I don't know that I was wrong. After all, Bolter {{could not have}} been a {{comfortable}} fellow to marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> Knight that wore [...] 45 [...] Upon his shield {{a burning}} brand. [...] And how for ten long years he woo'd [...] The Ladie of the Land: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> Knight that wore [...] Upon his shield {{a burning}} brand; [...] 30 [...] And that for ten long years he wooed [...] The Lady of the Land.|$|R
60|$|She {{always used}} the French form of my name, {{because she said}} it sounded ridiculous in English, for a white man, though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>the</b> English was nearer the Greek in sound.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> {{tale of the}} {{lieutenant}} from {{the first step to}} the last of it, making it as mirthful as I could, and, indeed, there was matter of mirth in that absurdity.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a foolish}} man!" [...] said Euphemia, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> above incident, [...] "to {{talk that way}} when you stood there {{with a gun in}} your hand. You might have raked his wagon, fore and aft." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was now in}} tears. It seemed {{hard enough}} to go to Congress; but to be hanged--this was too sad, too dreadful. The woman seemed {{surprised}} at my grief. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> thoughts that were in my mind. Then she comforted me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I like {{to think}} how {{thoroughly}} I was taken with her, and how right I was, and how fortunate, to have that for my basis. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>the</b> good <b>I</b> thought of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if you didn't know Lance yet; I'm not sure you {{altogether}} know Evelyn. Anyhow, I saw <b>her</b> and stopped <b>the</b> thing. I think she got a bad jolt when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about <b>the</b> punt." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> scene <b>I</b> {{had just}} witnessed, of {{the arrival of}} the old pupil, the {{purchase}} of the tarts, the proclamation of the holiday, and the shouts of the boys of [...] "Hurray, Davison!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Duchess. Hear me, Jack! I {{was anxious}} {{only for a}} home for my child. I came to HER--the schoolmistress of Red Gulch--for aid. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> name of my boy's father. She--she brought me here. Oh, forgive me, Jack! I have {{offended}} you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From her manner, I should imagine not," [...] Dauncey replied. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, she asked first to whom she should apply for {{information}} respecting the Company. I {{thought you might like}} to see her yourself, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> Chairman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Putney," [...] said I. [...] "Her father's {{place is}} {{between here and}} Walford. I stopped there night before last." [...] And then, as I was glad of an {{opportunity}} to prolong the interview, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> history of my adventures at that place.|$|E
6000|$|... "This was {{the ruined}} cathedral, {{built at the}} time when the entire {{population}} was converted, and it was a large order; but I was afire with love, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>the</b> church <b>I</b> would build would be even bigger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] I said. And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> {{plan which}} I had made. [...] "Will {{you come with}} me?" [...] I said, when I had done, [...] "or will you creep back into the hut and bid me farewell?" ...|$|R
60|$|Marian {{preserved}} {{her composure}} while I described {{my interview with}} Mr. Kyrle. But her face became troubled when I spoke next {{of the men who}} had followed me from the lawyer's office, and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> discovery of Sir Percival's return.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> story, {{and while}} I was doing so, Anscombe joined us, walking by aid of his stick. Also I showed them both Marnham's letter {{to me and}} the will, but the other bit of paper I did not speak of or show.|$|E
60|$|Gently I unclasped {{her hands}} from about my neck, and still holding them in mine <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> {{story of my}} love for Dejah Thoris. That of all the women of two worlds that I had known and admired during my long life she alone had I loved.|$|E
60|$|I {{came home}} with this last booty to my governess, and really when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> story, it so {{affected}} {{her that she was}} hardly able to forbear tears, to know how such a gentleman ran a daily risk of being undone every time a glass of wine got into his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>the</b> trouble {{we had had}} in {{connection}} with <b>the</b> cow. <b>Her</b> sympathies were chiefly with <b>the</b> cow. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> had hopes of Robina's developing into a sensible woman. We talked quite a deal about Robina. We agreed that between us we had accomplished something rather clever.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{something}} of <b>the</b> intention {{and range of}} my travels, and {{something of}} the views that were growing out of their experiences.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are ways}} of doing everything," [...] I said; and, seeing it wasn't going to break <b>her</b> heart, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> just <b>the</b> plain facts. She listened without a word, and when I had {{finished}} {{she put her arms}} round my neck and kissed me. I am old enough to be her grandfather, but twenty years ago it might have upset me.|$|R
