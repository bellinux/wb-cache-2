500|$|Best {{had been}} good friends with Neil Aspinall since 1961 when he rented {{a room in the}} house where Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's road manager and {{personal}} assistant; accepting the job, he bought an old Commer van for £80 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).. Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon why they had fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's got nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> you're only the driver." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{war ended}} in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the {{marriage}} of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales ('Bertie') to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore {{an enemy of the}} German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has that got to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?...</b> Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone, but in vain...We have no [...] choice". Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia {{and the only way to}} keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work. Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it".|$|E
500|$|Best {{was sacked}} from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, by manager Brian Epstein acting {{on behalf of}} Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Accounts vary of Aspinall during this event. According to MerseyBeat editor Bill Harry, Aspinall was waiting downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop, and {{was the first one to}} talk to the by then ex-Beatle in the Grapes pub, across from the Cavern. Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for the band as well, but Best {{strongly}} advised him not to. Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best and was told, [...] "It’s got nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You’re only the driver." [...] However, in a 2007 interview, Aspinall provided Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn with a distinctly different version of events, saying that he was physically present when Epstein sacked Best, that he told Best unprompted that he planned to continue working for the band, and that on his first subsequent encounter with the other band members, their first question to him was how Best had taken being sacked. At any rate, Aspinall stayed with the band, but he ended his affair with Best's mother, a relationship that had led to the birth of baby Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best. Aspinall denied the story for years before publicly acknowledging that he was indeed Roag's father.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{accounts}} of Josiah's {{death in the}} Bible. The Books of Kings merely state that Necho II met Josiah at Megiddo and killed him (...) [...] The Book of Chronicles (...) gives a lengthier account and states that Josiah was fatally wounded by Egyptian archers and was brought back to Jerusalem to die. His death {{was a result of}} [...] "not listen to what Necho had said at God's command..." [...] when Necho stated: [...] "What have I to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; [...] and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you."

2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
