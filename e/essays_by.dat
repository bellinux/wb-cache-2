5|$|Kurosawa {{wasted no}} time moving onto his next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical <b>essays</b> <b>by</b> Hyakken Uchida, the film follows {{the life of a}} Japanese {{professor}} of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.|$|E

5|$|Resistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not {{in session}} when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams {{therefore}} used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same. By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott. Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, a series of popular <b>essays</b> <b>by</b> John Dickinson which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience.|$|E
