5000|$|Theriac or {{theriaca}} was {{a medical}} concoction originally formulated by the Greeks in the 1st century AD and widely {{adopted in the}} ancient world as far away as China and India via the trading links of the Silk Route. It was an alexipharmic, or antidote, considered a panacea, for which it could serve as a synonym: in the 16th century Adam Lonicer wrote that garlic was the rustic's theriac or <b>Heal-All.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pedicularis canadensis is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} Orobanchaceae family and {{is also known as}} wood betony, beefsteak plant, Canadian lousewort, high <b>heal-all,</b> snaffles and Canada lousewort. It is found in thickets and dry, open wooded areas throughout Canada and the United States. It is a low, hairy plant with a broad whorl of tubular, hooded flowers on top of a segmented stalk. It has long, soft, hairy leaves (many are basal, growing tufted from roots), some 5 to 15 inches long, deeply incised and toothed, often reddish. A favorite of bees, its flowers bloom from April through June. The flowers range in color from a greenish-yellow to purplish-red, clustered on short, dense spikes. The fruit is a long brown seed capsule.|$|E
50|$|The name {{is derived}} from the word kermes as {{denoting}} the compound’s red color. The origins of the term is from the French kermès, which is short for alkermès, from the Arabic al-qirmiz a reference to crimson dye made from the bodies of insects (see Kermes (dye)). It was also known as poudre des Chartreux from a story of how it saved the life of a Carthusian monk in 1714. Because of its reputation as a medication and <b>heal-all</b> (or panacea), the formula and production process for Kermes mineral was purchased by the French government in 1720. Used for centuries in medicine as a health treatment, diaphoretic (causing sweat), anti-inflammatory and emetic it was used through the 19th century and its use extended to epilepsy treatment in addition to hectic fever.|$|E
40|$|Network Address Translation (NAT) is {{very useful}} in Small Office and Home Office (SOHO) {{community}} {{to build a}} small private network by sharing global routable IP addresses. NAT creates a private IP address realm behind NAT translators. According to common firewall and NAT rule, hosts in private address realm cannot be reached directly from public Internet. In Peer to Peer network, hosts behind NAT gateway have to be reached directly by some way in order to communicate with other peers. NAT techniques hide private hosts thus causing peers not reachable globally. The main reason of the trouble is NAT mangling IP addresses and port numbers thus breaking common end-to-end connections. NAT Traversal Techniques is to let enable end-to-end protocol and application packets through NAT gateway directly or indirectly. NAT is and will be widely adopted over the Internet community, especially in SOHO community. However, NAT technologies are diverse, de facto but not standardized so that the proliferation of NAT devices makes Peer-to-Peer application maker confused and hard to inter-operate with. This paper reviews commonly existing and Peer-to-Peer widely using NAT transversal techniques. I try to give some advise about {{what should be done}} on NAT side and Peer-to-Peer application side in order that two things inter-operate smoothly. There is no <b>heal-all</b> technique to make NAT devices fully inter-operable with P 2 P applications. On the other hand, P 2 P applications could have to make use general purpose method combined with special efforts to cope with different NAT environment...|$|E
