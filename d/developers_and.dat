5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate <b>developers,</b> <b>and</b> the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E

5|$|Ignoring {{the events}} of the {{previous}} Doom games, the game is the first reboot to the series. Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to research into fields such as teleportation, biological research and advanced weapons design. However, the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons. The player, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base {{and find a way to}} stop the demons attacking Mars. Doom 3 utilizes the id Tech 4 game engine, which has since been licensed out to other <b>developers,</b> <b>and</b> later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{video game}} {{developers}} Wolf Team {{signed a deal}} with publisher Namco to release the game that would be Tales of Phantasia, which was later released in 1995 in Japan for the Super Famicom. However, the development cycle for this game was plagued with creative disputes between the <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> publisher, leading {{to much of the}} development team leaving to form a new company, which would become tri-Ace, which explains some of the common themes between the games, such as the similar battle systems.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Sega, facing {{financial}} {{troubles with}} the underperformance of their Dreamcast console, shifted from first to third-party software publishing, with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance (GBA) being their primary focuses. A team of developers {{was formed to}} begin development on Sonic the Hedgehog Advance (later renamed Sonic Advance), a Sonic title for the GBA that would commemorate the series' tenth anniversary. Development was led by Dimps—a team formed by several former Neo Geo Pocket Color <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> funded by Sega, Sony, and Bandai—with assistance from Sonic Team. Several of the team members had previously worked on the critically-acclaimed Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure (1999) for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.|$|E

5|$|Irish {{banks had}} lost an {{estimated}} 100 billion euros, {{much of it}} related to defaulted loans to property <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> homeowners made {{in the midst of}} the property bubble, which burst around 2007.

Unemployment rose from 4% in 2006 to 14% by 2010, while the national budget went from a surplus in 2007 to a deficit of 32% GDP in 2010, the highest in the history of the eurozone, despite austerity measures.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> {{publishers}} wanted to contribute the video game library. The NES, at its peak, controlled 90% of the 8-bit market in the United States. Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from two sources to better capitalize on the growing industry. The first strategy was to take games that were already popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television.|$|E
5|$|On April 7, 2004, federal {{officials}} held a groundbreaking {{ceremony at the}} site for what {{was estimated to be}} a $70 million project. The site on East Eighth Avenue and Ferry Street formerly housed an Agripac cannery and is situated along the Willamette River. Local <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> officials hoped the courthouse and a potential new hospital in that area of town would spur further development and revitalize the area. In July 2004, construction began with site preparation including digging out a hole for underground parking. At that time the project was expected to be completed in August 2006.|$|E
