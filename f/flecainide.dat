25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>flecainide</b> on the sodium {{channels}} {{of the heart}} increases as the heart rate increases; This is known as use-dependence and is why that <b>flecainide</b> is useful to break a tachyarrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} class I {{antiarrhythmic}} agents, <b>Flecainide</b> increases the capture thresholds of pacemakers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flecainide</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} into the treatment of arrhythmias in the pediatric population.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{cardioversion}} {{is performed}} with drugs, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, procainamide, ibutilide, propafenone or <b>flecainide.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Flecainide</b> also {{inhibits}} ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), a major regulator of sarcoplasmic {{release of}} stored calcium ions. It can reduce calcium sparks and thus arrhythmogenic calcium {{waves in the}} heart. While <b>Flecainide</b> therapy {{has been shown to}} suppress ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and mouse models of this disease, the relative contribution from the inhibition of sodium channels and of RyR2 in this effect on CPVT is unclear.|$|E
25|$|In the long-term, <b>flecainide</b> {{seems to}} be safe in {{patients}} with a healthy heart with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease or heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, <b>flecainide,</b> quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{negative}} inotropic effects of <b>flecainide,</b> it should be used with caution in individuals with depressed ejection fraction, and may worsen congestive heart failure in these individuals. It should be avoided in people with ischaemic heart disease and the elderly.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the dual}} {{elimination}} routes of <b>flecainide</b> and its tendency to decrease myocardial contractility, <b>flecainide</b> interacts with numerous pharmaceuticals and can potentiate {{the effects of}} other myocardial depressants and AV node blocking agents. [...] In addition, <b>flecainide</b> can decrease the metabolism or elimination of many (but not all) agents that use the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.|$|E
2500|$|The dose {{may need}} to be {{adjusted}} in certain clinical scenarios. [...] As with all other antiarrhythmic agents, there is a risk of proarrhythmia {{associated with the use of}} <b>flecainide.</b> [...] This risk is probably increased when <b>flecainide</b> is co-administered with other class Ic antiarrhythmics, such as encainide. [...] The risk of proarrhythmia may also be increased by hypokalemia. [...] The risk of proarrhythmia is not necessarily associated with the length of time an individual is taking <b>flecainide,</b> and cases of late proarrhythmia have been reported. [...] Because of the role of both the liver and the kidneys in the elimination of <b>flecainide,</b> the dosing of <b>flecainide</b> {{may need to}} be adjusted in individuals who develop either liver failure or renal failure.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of many types of supraventricular tachycardias, including AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and [...] Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). [...] This is because of the action of <b>flecainide</b> on the His-Purkinje system.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> is {{sold under}} the trade name Tambocor (manufactured by 3M pharmaceuticals). [...] <b>Flecainide</b> went off-patent on February 10, 2004. In {{addition}} to being marketed as Tambocor, it is also available in generic version and under the trade names Almarytm, Apocard, Ecrinal, and Flécaine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of <b>flecainide</b> is eliminated by the kidneys, {{with the remainder}} metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme in the liver. [...] Therefore, alterations in renal function or urine pH will greatly affect the elimination of <b>flecainide,</b> as more is eliminated by the kidney than by the hepatic route.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the narrow}} {{therapeutic}} index of <b>flecainide,</b> physicians should be alert for signs of toxicity before life-threatening arrhythmias occur like torsades de pointes. [...] While the toxic effects of <b>flecainide</b> {{are closely related to}} the plasma levels of the drug, it is unfeasible to check the plasma concentration in an individual on a regular basis.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> has a {{very high}} {{affinity}} for lung tissue [...] and is associated with drug-induced interstitial lung disease.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> {{works by}} {{blocking}} the Nav1.5 sodium channel in the heart, slowing the upstroke of the cardiac action potential. [...] This thereby slows conduction of the electrical impulse within the heart, i.e. it [...] "reduces excitability". [...] The greatest effect {{is on the}} His-Purkinje system and ventricular myocardium. [...] The effect of <b>flecainide</b> on the ventricular myocardium causes decreased contractility of the muscle, {{which leads to a}} decrease in the ejection fraction.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> {{has high}} {{bioavailability}} after an oral dose, meaning {{that most of}} the drug that is ingested will enter the systemic blood stream. [...] Peak serum concentrations can be seen 1 to 6 hours after ingestion of an oral dose. [...] While the plasma half-life is about 20 hours, it is quite variable, and can range from 12 to 27 hours. [...] During oral loading with <b>flecainide,</b> a steady state equilibrium is typically achieved in 3 to 5 days.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of <b>flecainide</b> cardiac {{toxicity}} involves {{increasing the}} excretion of <b>flecainide,</b> blocking its {{effects in the}} heart, and (rarely) institution of cardiovascular support to avoid impending lethal arrhythmias. [...] Modalities that have had success include administration of a beta-sympathomimetic agent, and administration of a sodium load(often {{in the form of}} hypertonic sodium bicarbonate). [...] Placing the individual on cardiopulmonary bypass support may be necessary in order to temporarily remove the need for a beating heart and to increase blood flow to the liver.|$|E
2500|$|It {{also has}} limited {{use in the}} {{treatment}} of certain forms of ventricular tachycardia (VT). [...] In particular, <b>flecainide</b> has been useful {{in the treatment of}} ventricular tachycardias that are not in the setting of an acute ischemic event. [...] It has use in the treatment of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia and in the suppression of arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). [...] Studies (notably the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) have shown an increased mortality when <b>flecainide</b> is used to suppress ventricular extrasystoles in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> acetate ( [...] ) is a class Ic {{antiarrhythmic}} agent {{used to prevent}} and treat tachyarrhythmias (abnormal fast rhythms of the heart). [...] It is used to treat a variety of cardiac arrhythmias including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (episodic irregular heartbeat originating in the upper chamber of the heart), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (episodic rapid but regular heartbeat originating in the atrium), and ventricular tachycardia (rapid rhythms of the lower chambers of the heart). [...] <b>Flecainide</b> works by regulating the flow of sodium in the heart, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential.|$|E
2500|$|In {{individuals}} {{suspected of}} having the Brugada syndrome, the administration of <b>flecainide</b> may help reveal the ECG findings that are characteristic of the disease process. [...] This may help make the diagnosis of the disease in equivocal cases.|$|E
2500|$|Signs of <b>flecainide</b> {{toxicity}} include marked prolongation of the PR {{interval and}} widening of the QRS duration {{on the surface}} ECG. [...] There may be signs and symptoms attributable to overt heart failure secondary to sudden decreased myocardial contractility.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flecainide</b> {{intoxication}} is rare but serious {{due to the}} {{cardiogenic shock}} that it provokes. Its diagnosis can be difficult in the lack of contributing anamnestic elements. Clinical and paraclinical signs are not specific. Treatment is primarily symptomatic, which gives good results thanks to the hypertonic solution of sodium salts.Organ donation is possible {{in the case of}} braindead ...|$|E
2500|$|After Food and Drug Administration approval, the {{antiarrhythmic}} agents <b>flecainide</b> and encainide came {{to market}} in 1986 and 1987 respectively. The non-randomized studies concerning the drugs were characterized as [...] "glowing", and their sales increased to a combined total of approximately 165,000 prescriptions per month in early 1989. [...] In that year, however, {{a preliminary report}} of an RCT concluded that the two drugs increased mortality. [...] Sales of the drugs then decreased.|$|E
