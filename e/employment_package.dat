This study was conducted to examine the influences of psychological empowerment on overall job satisfaction of Front Office Receptionists in Kuala Lumpur 5 -star hotels. A total of 210 questionnaires were distributed at 21 hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Results showed that psychological empowerment does have significant influences (through the dimensions of meaningfulness, competence and influence) on overall job satisfaction of the receptionists. The findings also suggested that receptionists’ age and tenure affected their sense of overall job satisfaction.

40|$|Issues {{relating}} to the rights and protection accorded to employees throughout their employment with the employers is a matter that has been given much attention and treated with utmost priority in any organization, be it in the public or the private sector. It is an undeniable fact that the success story of any organization in the generation of profits in its enterprise or the smooth running in achieving the organization's desired objectives is much attributed to having a reliable, skilled and efficient workforce. Today, employees have been {{regarded as one of}} the most valuable assets of any organization. In pursuant thereto, apart from having various <b>employment</b> <b>packages,</b> laws regulating <b>employment</b> were enacted as protective measures in guiding both employers and employees. At the international level, rights and protections to employees have been embedded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Comparatively, under the Shariah, though a similar concept has been forwarded, the notion of employment has been elevated to the status of ‘ibadah. Islam places importance of adhering to the Shari`ah principles in dealing with protection accorded to employees. As employment is regarded as ‘ibadah’ the employees are required and enjoined to observe full dedication, sincerity and commitment to their tasks. It is the responsibility of the employers, on the other hand, to ensure that the welfare of their employees is well protected. This paper attempts to outline the concept of employment under the Shari’ah and civil perspectives and to provide a comparative understanding on the rights and protection accorded to employees...|$|R

40|$|Background: Internationally, {{emergency}} medical services (EMS) are experiencing problems with recruiting, retaining and motivating advanced life support (ALS) practitioners. The persistent shortage of ALS practitioners in South Africa (SA) poses {{a challenge to the}} effective delivery of prehospital {{emergency medical}} care. The global demand for SA trained ALS practitioners is steadily increasing. SA EMS organisations are struggling to compete for these practitioners with the international market. The SA EMS industry currently has no effective approach to decrease the loss of ALS practitioners. This research study was therefore conceptualized to investigate factors that influence ALS practitioner recruitment, retention and motivation in an effort to enhance them. Methods: This study followed a sequential, explanatory, mixed method design. The two phase study was non-experimental and descriptive in nature. The quantitative phase was comprised of ALS practitioners (n= 1309) and EMS managers (n= 60) completing questionnaires. The qualitative phase of the study involved data gathering through focus group (n= 7) discussions with ALS practitioners and semi-structured interviews with EMS managers (n= 6). Quantitative data was analysed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Inferential techniques included the use of correlations and chi squared test values which were interpreted using p-values. Results: The study identified 19 recruitment, 25 retention and 16 motivation factors that influence ALS practitioners. Cumulatively, these factors revolved around the ALS practitioners' work environment, professional development and <b>employment</b> <b>package.</b> Strong recruitment factors that were identified include: ALS practitioner remuneration, skilled EMS management and organisation culture. Similarly, strong ALS practitioner retention factors that were identified include: skilled EMS management, remuneration, resources, availability of health and wellness programmes, recognition of practitioners, working conditions and safety and security. Strong ALS practitioner motivation factors included: remuneration, skilled EMS management and resources. Conclusion: More ALS practitioner training institutions are required to improve the number of these practitioners. EMS organisations must improve the work environment, <b>employment</b> <b>package</b> and professional development opportunities for ALS practitioners. Such practices will encourage ALS practitioner recruitment, retention and motivation...|$|E

Pensions are one of the few elements of the <b>employment</b> <b>package</b> which explicitly describe long term agreements between workers and their employers; consequently they offer a unique opportunity to study these agreements. The present paper combines labor supply and contract theory to examine pension responses to changes in taxes, Social Security benefits, and the federal government's recent decision to lift the age of mandatory retirement. Evidence on a longitudinal sample of pension plans from 1960 to the present suggests:(1) During the 1960 - 70 period, Social Security increases generated changes in pensions favoring early retirement; and (2) During the 1970 - 80 period, some plans reduced private pension benefits in response to the raising of the mandatory retirement age. ...|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that the government}} introduced an <b>employment</b> incentive <b>package</b> to subsidize social security contributions by employers in 2008 to limit {{the impact of the}} global financial crisis. While the change in legislation targeted female workers of all ages, it only targeted male workers aged between 18 and 29; regionally, however, this resulted in uniform cuts to contributions in all 26 regions without favoring any particular region. 17 I acknowledge that the availability of regional consumer credit data merely from 2009 on is a weakness, since we possess no data prior to 2009 to control for the full impact of the legislative change. As such, {{there is a possibility that}} the analysis mistakenly attributes the impact of legislative change to the increase in financial services. However, there are reasons why this change might not pose a severe problem for the purposes of this paper.|$|R

30|$|More generally, our {{estimates}} do {{not allow}} for drawing strong conclusions about the causal effect of flexi-time and telehomework on labour supply, however. This {{is due to the}} following issues. Self-selection and other sources of endogeneity, like common shocks that may at the same time influence the availability and usage of TLF {{on the one hand and}} the number of working hours on the other, may bias our estimates. Many employees may for example choose working hours and working conditions simultaneously as parts of a whole <b>employment</b> <b>package</b> at the start of a contract. 17 Time-varying family commitments like elderly care or the birth of a (second) child may lead to both decreases in hours worked and higher demand for TLF. Employers may also award TLF to employees with the largest productivity, status, or authority (cf. Golden 2009; Winder 2009; Noonan and Glass 2012). Since we control for changes in employment as well as for time-fixed-effects, both of these confounding factors are only relevant, however, if they are time-varying and independent of promotions and job switches for example.|$|E

40|$|Grant No. SES- 1061927 {{provided}} {{funding for}} some of the research. The paper does not reflect the opinion of the National Science Foundation in any way. The recent Financial Crisis and Great Recession has generated renewed interest in the Great Depression and particularly the New Deal, as people seek answers about the sources of recovery from a serious downturn. Studies of Depression-era labor markets have focused heavily on downward stickiness of wages because unemployment rose above 20 percent for four years and total hours of employment dropped more and recovered less than the number employed (Bernanke 1983; Cole and Ohanian 1999). High wages are often cited as causing the drops in employment and hours, {{but it is important to}} recognize that weekly hours and wages are part of an overall <b>employment</b> <b>package</b> simultaneously set in labor markets. Benjamin Bernanke (1983) recognized this in the analysis that underlay his seminal study of monthly data on employment, hours, and earnings in manufacturing during the Great Depression and in work with Powell (1986) on the post-war era until the early 1980 s. During both the Great Depression and the Great Recession total hours worked dropped dramatically and then remained well below long term trends during the recovery.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this report}} assumes {{that the price of}} transportation should reflect full costs unless a subsidy is specifically warranted or transaction costs are too high. This implies that society {{would be better off if}} the price of driving an incremental mile were changed to incorporate both external costs (congestion, road and parking facility costs, accident risks, pollution, etc.) and some costs that are actually variable but are charged as fixed costs. Since these changes would increase the price of additional driving, our {{analysis in}}dicates that the optimal quantity of automobile travel is somewhat less than what currently occurs. This raises the question, how is it possible that most people would benefit from higher prices and less driving? The answer has several parts. First, we all ultimately pay the external costs of automobile use. For example, local road costs are largely funded by general taxes that are paid by all households and businesses. Similarly, parking costs are incorporated into retail prices and <b>employment</b> compensation <b>packages.</b> Charging these costs directly would give vehicle users strong incentives to reduce driving, resulting in reductions in these indirect costs. Even under the extreme assumption of zero change in vehicle use, the average resident would see an equal, offsetting reduction in local taxes and retail prices, and perhaps higher wages. Second, cost-based pricing provides a test to ensure that trips taken actually provide benefits that exceed their incremental costs. To visualize this, we can rank the trips we take during a certain time period, according to their value to us, the trip-taker, as illustrated in Figure A- 1 below...|$|R
40|$|Workers' {{compensation}} {{insurance in}} the United States {{began in the}} early twentieth century when states rapidly enacted their own versions to protect workers and limit the liability of employers. Premiums account for two percent of payrolls, and substantially more in dangerous industries, and therefore represent an important portion of the modern <b>employment</b> compensation <b>package.</b> The introductory section provides an overview of worker's compensation insurance. The second chapter outlines the crucial issues relevant to workers' compensation programs between 1930 and 2000. It also explains how the program has evolved over the past seventy years. The third chapter delves into the political economy of workers' compensation benefits. States passed workers' compensation laws {{in the early twentieth century}} and continue to frequently update important aspects of these statutes. The trend has been for state legislatures to mandate more generous benefits; however, these changes seldom occur simultaneously in all states. A panel dataset is used to explain why states mandate unequal benefits. These benefits differ in several ways, including wage replacement rates, maximum weekly benefits, and the duration of payments. To take into account the important variation, state-level information is used to construct an index that describes the expected net present value of benefits an average worker might expect to receive in each state for each year. The results suggest that federal and state governments, employment characteristics, and unionization each influence overall benefits. Then, the interaction between the wages that workers earn and their state-mandated workers' compensation benefits is explored. Economic theory implies that, all else equal, higher expected benefits will be offset by lower wages. A new strategy is developed to reduce the biases inherent in the earlier estimation techniques. I apply a two-step procedure that divides the sample and uses separate measures of benefits to understand the impact on workers' wages. The results suggest that wage offsets are largely avoided by high-wage workers and offsets for workers in hazardous occupations vary over time...|$|R

Rather than making themselves hard to reach, these populations might be better described as underserved by mainstream services that are either inaccessible or inappropriate in terms of meeting their needs.
