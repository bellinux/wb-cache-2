500|$|Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper {{embarked}} on a murder spree that started with two college students and ended with the murders {{of his mother and}} her best friend. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their lifeless bodies back to his home where he would perform irrumatio on their severed heads, have sex with their corpses, and then dissect and dismember them. During this 11-month spree, he killed five women, including two college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he would often go hunting for victims after his mother's outbursts towards him, and that she would not introduce him to women attending the university she worked at. He recalled: [...] "She would say, 'You're <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> father. You don't deserve to get to know them'." [...] Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target, his mother, and that the humiliating acts he committed with his mother's corpse support this hypothesis.|$|E

2500|$|Kept saying, 'you're <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> father; you're too trusting' And there's {{a part of}} me that, I do {{give people}} {{the benefit of the doubt}} ... it's also being free ... that was the mode I was in at that {{particular}} time, when I took those racy pictures, because I was already in college so you can't tell me what to do. So - I wasn't actually in high school - so my mentality was what - I'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I can handle this; I can handle anything. And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.|$|E

50|$|The {{houses in}} horary astrology charts {{mean the same}} as in the natal chart.

Again, the meaning of each house is the same whether you're doing horary, natal or electional astrology.|$|R

6000|$|... "If they are," [...] she continued, [...] "I won't {{speak to}} them again. If they can't treat me as--as your {{daughter}} ought to be treated, I'll {{turn my back on}} them. I am--I am <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> daughter--am I not, Uncle Jethro?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] said d'Urberville drily, [...] "whatever your dear husband {{believed}} you accept, {{and whatever}} he rejected you reject, without the least inquiry or reasoning {{on your own}} part.

6000|$|... "It's dreadful {{for you to}} be here," [...] he said, {{indicating}} the yellow presence of the first fog of the year without, [...] "but your aunt told me something of what had happened. It's <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> Splendid Pride to do it. Quite!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it has! yes, it has!" [...] she declared. [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> {{thinking}} you hadn't taken cold, {{the other day}} when you were caught in the rain; and the next morning you got up with a sore throat, and it was Sunday morning, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What a {{suspicious}} person you are!" [...] she exclaimed, a little scornfully. [...] "You are <b>just</b> <b>like</b> all <b>your</b> countrymen. You {{get hold of}} an idea and nothing can shake it. Mr. Jocelyn Thew, I dare say, possesses a past. I {{know for a fact}} that he has been engaged in all sorts of adventures during his life. But--at your instigation, I suppose--they have already searched his person, his stateroom, and every article of luggage he has. After that, why not leave him alone?" ...|$|R

50|$|In the D.I.Y.: Design It Yourself book, Lupton links {{design with}} {{capitalism}} and the Marxist Theory. In a Capitalist society, producers of goods {{are able to}} create their own unique materials and have them shared with the public for a profit. D.I.Y designers are able to rid the wave of capitalism while seeking out new counter-currents that carry their own imprint. D.I.Y is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> creating <b>your</b> own brand of T-shirts and selling them worldwide; your designing something based on your idea of art or fashion in this case.|$|R
50|$|<b>Just</b> <b>like</b> WrestleMania, In <b>Your</b> House is not {{a wrestling}} game in the normal sense, as it is heavily {{influenced}} by Mortal Kombat.

The game also featured finishing moves which are performed before the final pin.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Nothing? Hein! Then {{you may as}} well be on your guard, Miss Egremont, or {{we shall}} have {{pleadings}} that you have encouraged them--church and world--or both, maybe.

6000|$|... "That's <b>just</b> <b>like</b> one of <b>your</b> assertions, Rudolph," [...] said I.

5000|$|Despite {{mounting}} pressure, Ellis {{refuses to}} enlist {{and says that}} he doesn't think he can kill anyone. As a result, Ellis' fiancée, Lizzie Roberts (Sue Roderick), accuses him of being [...] "afraid of becoming a man". At a fair, Ellis attempts to mend his relationship with Lizzie, {{only to find that}} she has taken up with an English soldier. [...] "It is nothing personal," [...] she says coldly, [...] "I <b>just</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>your</b> clothes." [...] Later, in the village pub, Ellis and Moi Davies (Emlyn Gomer) are giving Griff, who is now in uniform, a send-off. As fellow villagers sing the recruiting song [...] "Your King and Country Want You" [...] in their honor, Lizzie appears in the pub's doorway. Ellis spots her and begins to loudly sing [...] "Myfanwy", a song with implications of female betrayal.
