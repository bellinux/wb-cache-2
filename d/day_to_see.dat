When they arrived at the tannery the next morning, Lambert was disappointed to find that the building had burned to the ground the night before. He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto gas engine. This was the only one he had ever heard of or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a slide valve coal gas engine.|$|E

25|$|In 1978 Clare stormed {{through the}} National League again and {{qualified}} for the final {{for the third year}} in-a-row. Once again Kilkenny provided the opposition and, once again, an interesting game ensued. Clare's ability to get goals once proved the defining feature of a close game as McCarthy's side went on to win by 3–10 to 1–10. This victory buoyed up Clare for the provincial championship where they qualified for a second consecutive Munster showdown with Cork. Over 54,000 spectators turned up at Semple Stadium that <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Clare attempt to dethrone Cork. At half-time it looked as if Clare were about to triumph as they trailed by 0–5 to 0–3 after Cork recorded thirteen wides. With ten minutes left Cork led by five points, however, a late rally gave Clare some hope. At the full-time whistle Cork still had a narrow 0–13 to 0–11 win.|$|E
25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where {{she thought she would}} be safe. He told her he was no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
25|$|Miller's love of horseracing then {{interfered}} with his quest. Wanting {{to attend an}} afternoon race meeting, he convinced his captain Hassett {{to allow him to}} open the batting in the morning against Cambridge University after the Australians won the toss. Not intending to play a long innings, he attacked the bowling and was out for 20, before heading for the track. Miller had received gambling advice from a jockey friend. However, all six of the horses that Miller backed went on to lose and Miller and ran out of money. He went to place a bet on a seventh horse, only to find that he was no money left. The horse went on to win. Miller expected Australia to bat for the entire day, only to return late in the <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Hassett leading the team onto the field for Cambridge's innings, the tourists having been bowled out for 383. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings, before taking 2/27 in the second innings, including the wicket of top-scorer Raman Subba Row as Australia won by an innings and 110 runs.|$|E

500|$|Wills {{travelled}} inland in November {{to convene}} the players from Edenhope and Harrow, where they worked as station hands. One of their employers, William Hayman, acted as the team's manager and [...] "protector". They were mostly Jardwadjali men who shared common vocabulary with the neighbouring Djab wurrung people, which enabled Wills {{to use the}} Aboriginal language he learnt as a child. From their training ground at Lake Wallace, Wills, in a [...] "tactical strike", boasted to the Melbourne press of the Aborigines' powers, especially the batsmanship of Unamurriman, commonly known as Mullagh. In a response that drew widespread criticism, the MCC strengthened its ranks with non-members. Public sympathy was with the Aborigines when they arrived in Melbourne and over 10,000 spectators attended the MCG on Boxing <b>Day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them play. Captained by Wills, they lost the match, but won praise for their performance. Wills afterwards accused the MCC of [...] "treachery".|$|E

500|$|On 7 April Air America pilot Nikki A. Fillipi, with USMC Lt Robert Twigger, {{assigned}} to the DAO as the US Navy liaison officer, surveyed 37 buildings in Saigon as possible landing zones (LZ), selecting 13 of them as fit for use. Workers from Pacific Architects and Engineers visited each of the 13 LZs to remove obstructions and painted H's (the exact dimensions of a UH-1 Huey helicopter's skids) {{on each of the}} LZs. President Gerald Ford, in an address to the American public on 11 April, promised to evacuate Vietnamese civilians of various categories. The 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade (9th MAB), which was to supply helicopters and a security force for the evacuation, sent a delegation to consult with Ambassador Graham Martin on current plans on 12 April. Ambassador Martin told them that he would not tolerate any outward signs that the United States intended to abandon South Vietnam. All planning would have to be conducted with the utmost discretion. Brigadier General Richard E. Carey, commander of the 9th MAB, flew to Saigon the next <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ambassador Martin; he later said that [...] "The visit was cold, non-productive and appeared to be an irritant to the Ambassador". Thirteen Marines from the Marine Security Guard (MSG) detachment were deployed to the DAO Compound on 13 April to replace the eight Marine Guards withdrawn from the closed Danang and Nha Trang consulates who had been providing security up to that point.|$|E
2500|$|Patanjali's aphorism expands this idea: [...] "By contemplating on {{the form}} of one who has no attachments, {{concentration}} of mind is attained", Nigamananda advised his disciples to meditate on his physical form such that all the admirable qualities and attributes in him would get automatically transferred into their beings and fashion their souls. Further he assured that because he had, by employing three modes of spiritual practice, simultaneously experienced the nature of Brahman (ब्रह्म), Paramatma (परमात्मा) (supreme universal self) and Bhagawan (भगवान) (personal and universal Godhead.) He proclaimed that his disciples would simultaneously have such an experience. That, he said, [...] "was his only expectation from his disciples and he would love {{to wait for the}} <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that fulfilled".|$|E

2500|$|The Third Test {{cemented}} the [...] "Typhoon" [...] reputation. He took 2/68 in {{the first}} innings {{and at the end}} of the fourth day Australia needed 240 to win and were 75–2, with Tyson on 1/11. Over 50,000 Australian fans came on the fifth <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Neil Harvey and Richie Benaud knock off the remaining 165 runs, but what they got was 'the fastest and most frightening sustained spell of fast bowling seen in Australia'. as Tyson took 6/16 off 6.3 overs from the Richmond End. His 7/27 in the innings was his best Test innings analysis, the best by an England bowler in Australia since Wilfred Rhodes took 8/68 in 1903–04 and has not been bettered since. Australia added only 36 runs, were dismissed for 111 and England won by 128 runs. The game finished well before lunch and the caterers were left with thousands of unsold pies when the crowd deserted the ground.|$|E

[...] The Dodgers regained the lead by two games as they came to Houston on September 9. The Astros showed the Dodgers how serious they were by winning the first two games of the series to put both clubs tied for first in the division. By season's end the Astros held a three-game lead over the Dodgers with three games left in the season against the Dodgers.

2500|$|The {{group that}} most {{characterized}} London streets were beggars and vagrants. The broad eighteenth-century definition for beggar embraced {{not just the}} poorest people having {{to live on the}} street, but virtually anyone who would stop you asking for money, work, or offering you a service such as: shoe cleaners, linkboys, milkmaids, chimney sweeps, etc. Begging was quite an art, the way you held your body, the sores you showed or not showed, the tone of the voice, your gender and age, the time of the year, the narrative strategies you decided to adopt, all these elements affected the way you begged and had to be consider carefully. Moreton regards beggars and vagrants as potential criminals in disguise and affirms that they [...] "should be suppressed, who lounge about all <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where they can steal at night" [...] and that [...] "all shoe-cleaners, I mean boys and sturdy vagrants, be suppressed, [...] as for link-boys, alias thieves with lights". Shoeblacks are a peculiar example of a vagrant occupation. Established as an employment {{at the end of the}} seventeenth-century, shoe cleaning provided a perfect excuse for approaching passers-by without incurring a penalty.|$|E
