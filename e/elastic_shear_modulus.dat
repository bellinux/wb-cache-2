Ten subjects performed ten isometric elbow flexions consisting of linear torque ramps of 30 -s from 0 to 40 % of maximal voluntary contraction. The <b>shear</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> of each elbow flexor muscle (biceps brachii long head [BBLH], biceps brachii short head [BBSH], brachialis [BA], and brachoradialis [BR]) and of triceps brachii long head [TB] was measured twice with individual muscles recorded in separate trials in random order. A good repeatability of {{the shape of the}} changes in <b>shear</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> as a function of torque was found for each elbow flexor muscle (r-values: 0. 85 to 0. 94). Relationships between the <b>shear</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> and torque were best explained by a second order polynomial, except BA where a higher polynomial was required. Statistical analysis showed that BBSH and BBLH had an initial slow change at low torques followed by an increasing rate of increase in modulus with higher torques. In contrast, the BA <b>shear</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> increased rapidly at low forces, but plateaued at higher forces. These results suggest that changes in load sharing between synergist elbow flexors could partly explain the non-linear EMG-torque relationship classically reported for BB during isometric efforts.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{characterize}} the mechanical response to deforma- tions of a coarse-grained polymer model in the glassy state. In particular, we want to relate the mechanical behaviour to connectivity. To this aim MD simulations are performed with systematic variation of bond length and chain stiffness, which are the interaction parameters determining the connectivity of the model. Mechanical deformation is simulated via the Athermal Quasi-Static (AQS) procedure at zero temperature. We show that connectivity does not directly affect the <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus.</b> However, since the latter depend on the morphology of the solid state, con- nectivity still plays a role as it determines the solidification behaviour of the model.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique and}} a simple analysis are presented {{that can be used}} to quantitate the affinity of red blood cell membrane for surfaces of small beads or microsomal particles up to 3 micrometers Diam. The technique is demonstrated with an example of dextran-mediated adhesion of small spherical red cell fragments to normal red blood cells. Cells and particles are positioned for contact by manipulation with glass micropipets. The mechanical equilibrium of the adhesive contact is represented by the variational expression that the decrease in interfacial free energy due to a virtual increase in contact area is balanced by the increase in elastic energy of the membrane due to virtual deformation. The surface affinity is the reduction in free energy per unit area of the interface associated with the formation of adhesive contact. From numerical computations of equilibrium configurations, the surface affinity is derived as a function of the fractional extent of particle encapsulation. The range of surface affinities for which the results are applicable is increased over previous techniques to several times the value of the <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus.</b> It is shown that bending rigidity of the membrane has little effect on the analytical results for particles 1 [...] 3 micrometers Diam and that results are essentially the same for both cup- and disk-shaped red cells. A simple analytical model is shown to give a good approximation for surface affinity (normalized by the <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus)</b> as a function of the fractional extent of particle encapsulation. The model predicts that a particle would be almost completely vacuolized for surface affinities greater than or equal to 10 times the <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus.</b> Based on an <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus</b> of 6. 6 x 10 (- 3) dyn/cm, the range for the red cell-particle surface affinity as measured by this technique is from approximately 7 x 10 (- 4) to 7 x 10 (- 2) erg/cm 2.

The change in the <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus</b> with temperature was - 6 X 10 (- 5) dyne/cm degrees C. Fractional forces were shown to be only on the order of 10 - 15 %. The area compressibility modulus at 25 degrees C was measured to be 450 dyne/cm. The change in the area compressibility modulus with temperature was - 6 dyne/cm degrees C. The thermal area expansivity for red cell membrane was measured to be 1. 2 X 10 (- 3) /degrees C. With this data and thermoelastic relations the heat of expansion is determined to be 110 - 200 ergs/cm 2; the heat of extension is 2 X 10 (- 2) ergs/cm 2 for unit extension of the red cell membrane. The heat of expansion is of the order anticipated for a lipid bilayer idealized as twice the behavior of a monolayer at an oil-water interface. The observation that the heat of extension is positive demonstrates that the entropy of the material increases with extension, and that the dominant mechanism of elastic energy storage is energetic.

Membrane elasticity was characterized by the <b>elastic</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus,</b> which provided a measure of the resistance of the membrane to constant-area elastic deformations that occurred in the membrane plane.

Membrane viscosity was characterized by the coefficient of surface viscosity, which, in effect, was a measure of the membrane's resistance to rates of deformation. This coefficient was determined from the time required for an erythrocyte to recover its undeformed shape after it had been elongated by the application of an equal and opposite force applied at diametrically opposite points on the erythrocyte rim.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{finite element}} (FE) unit cell model {{is applied to}} studies on the elastic properties of ceramic spherical particle-polymer composite. In this model, hydroxyapatite particles (HAp) {{are assumed to be}} spherical and are arranged on a face-centered cubic (FCC) array in poly-L-lactide (PLLA) matrix surrounding. The three dimensionality of the proposed model enables simulation of elastic properties as well as developed stress states. The FE calculations provide estimates of compressive <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus,</b> <b>shear</b> <b>modulus,</b> Poisson's ratio and stress state of the composite for a range of particle volume fractions. The FCC unit cell FE models are evaluated by comparison to available experimental results, simple cubic (SC) unit cell FE calculations and Halpin-Tsai equations. In applying unit cell models for predicting elastic properties of particle-filled composites, the FCC arrangement can be observed to be more accurate compared with the SC arrangement.
