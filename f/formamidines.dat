50|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} pesticides specific for ticks (acaricides) {{are suspended}} {{in water for}} application to the hair coat of domestic animals. Cattle can be immersed in dip-baths containing dipwash, or soaked using a pressurized spray-race made of metal tubing and nozzles. Sheep can be treated in smaller dips or showers. Acaricides {{can be applied to}} dogs in watery shampoo formulations. Acaricide-active ingredients are usually soluble in oil. This makes them suitable for concentrated oily formulations which spread from a pour-on applicator over the hair coat. Alternatively, some acaricides are incorporated in polyvinylchoride plastic ear tags for cattle, or collars for dogs. 7 Modern acaricides belong to the general classes of organophosphates (example chlorfenvinphos), <b>formamidines</b> (example amitraz), synthetic pyrethroids (example flumethrin), phenylpyrazoles (example fipronil), and benzylphenyl ureas (example fluazuron). 2 When correctly applied, they can be highly effective. Problems with acaricides are: danger of acute poisoning of treated animals and human staff; residues contaminating meat and milk; environmental contamination especially water sources; resistance that ticks acquire to acaricides; and cost of application. Cost and contamination can be reduced by seasonal timing of application (strategic treatment) based on ecological knowledge. Prediction of best times for treatment can be made using computerized models of the population dynamics of ticks. Farmers lacking sufficient cash to purchase manufactured synthetic acaricides often use various herbal treatments, locally available. Nicotine as treated tobacco leaf is an example, but such unregistered preparations require careful use to avoid poisoning or skin damage.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the preparation and study of compounds with linear chains of metal atoms surrounded by four ligands. The majority of linear trimetal complexes are supported by dpa, the anion of dipyridylamine, having the general formula M 3 (dpa) 4 X 2, where X is typically a monoanion. It has been shown that the behavior of the trinuclear system is far more complicated than might have been expected. Specifically, both symmetrical and unsymmetrical chains can occur and the interpretation of the magnetic properties of certain compounds has been a challenging task. Present in this dissertation is the bulk of work completed on an exploration of syntheses and characterizations of linear trichromium and trinickel compounds with different types of tridentate ligands. These ligands include 2, 6 -bis(phenylamino) pyridine,H 2 BPAP, (the corresponding dianion of this is denoted by BPAP) and a set of five unsymmetrical <b>formamidines</b> with different organic substituents ranging from strong electron-donating groups, such as -OCH 3, to electron-withdrawing groups, e. g., F. Ligands impact on the trimetal chain in various ways. In the case of the M 3 (BPAP) 42 - ions, there are no axial interactions because these anionic species do not attract electron donating ligands. Thus they have properties which are different from those of M 3 (dpa) 4 X 2 molecules. Most notably, the Ni 3 (BPAP) 42 - ion is diamagnetic and all three nickel ions can be described as square-planar, low-spin NiII centers. ivWhen unsymmetrical <b>formamidines</b> are used to support linear trichromium chains with a Cl anion at each end, the separation between terminal chromium atoms is significantly longer (ca. 0. 15 - 0. 25) than those in trichromium compounds reported earlier. Moreover, the unsymmetrical formamidinates tend to support symmetrical trichromium chains, {{while the rest of the}} known tridentate ligands typically yield unsymmetrical Cr 36 + chains. The synthesis and structural studies of trinickel compounds with unsymmetrical <b>formamidines</b> are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{formamidine}} pesticide chlordimeform (N 2 ̆ 7 -(4 -chloro-o-tolyl) -N,N-dimethylformamidine) shows moderate {{acute toxicity}} to mammals. The N-demethylation of chlordimeform (CDM) yields metabolites of increasing acute toxicity, but of lower {{chemical and biological}} stability. Symptoms exhibited by mice poisoned with lethal doses of CDM or one of these formamidine metabolities are similarly excitatory in nature. Surviving animals subsequently show the prolonged depressed behavior typical of the non-formamidine metabolites of CDM. ^ Pretreatment of mice with hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) inducers such as phenobarbital or inhibitors such as SKF 525 -A or piperonyl butoxide, although having predictable effects on the rate of N-demethylation of CDM in vitro, did not affect its lethality to mice. Other MFO inducers such as Aroclor 1254 and 3 -methylcholanthrene significantly decreased the lethality of CDM, although they increased the rate of N-demethylation. The same trends were observed with N-demethylchlordimeform (DCDM) and N,N-didemethylchlordimeform (DDCDM). ^ Studies of the tissue levels of CDM and its metabolites in mice after pretreatments affecting MFO activity (phenobarbital, 3 -methyl-cholanthrene, and piperonyl butoxide) indicated that the best correlation {{to account for the}} resulting variations in the toxicity of CDM is with the level of total <b>formamidines</b> (CDM, DCDM, and DDCDM) in the brain. It is therefore concluded that although the successive N-demethylations of CDM are potential activation steps, they are not obligatory for the overall toxicity of CDM. However, the N-demethylated metabolites probably do contribute importantly to the overall toxicity. The protective action of Aroclor 1254 and 3 -methylcholanthrene was mainly due to an induced increase in the rate of formamidine cleavage to N-formyl- 4 -chloro-o-toluidine (NFT), a metabolite of low acute toxicity produced from all three <b>formamidines.</b> ^ In order to examine the metabolic basis for the carcinogenic activity of the formamidine pesticides, chlordimeform and amitraz (1, 5 -di-(2, 4 -dimethylphenyl) - 3 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazapenta- 1, 4 -diene), the behavior of these <b>formamidines</b> and some of their common metabolites was investigated in Ames Salmonella mutagenecity assay. The only positive responses were shown by the bacterial tester strains TA 98 and TA 100 with 4 -chloro-o-toluidine and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline, the aniline metabolites of chlordimeform and amitraz respectively. Metabolic activation by liver homogenates was essential for this response. Although both rat and mouse liver homogenates were capable of activating the promutagenic anilines, rat liver had greater activity. ^ When other selected mono- and disubstituted anilines were tested on strain TA 100, it was found that ortho-para disbustitution with a methyl group in the ortho position favored mutagenic activity. Unfortunately, it is precisely this substitution pattern which favors pesticidal activity. Thus {{it may be difficult to}} develop pesticidal <b>formamidines</b> which are not potential mutagens and carcinogens through metabolic release of their parent anilines. ...|$|E

The occurrence of a purely basic mechanism for benzamidine and <b>formamidine</b> resulted unlikely both in vacuum and in benzene. A complete reaction path was proposed which takes into account the relative energy of minima and transition states as well as the catalyst dimerisation versus substrate–catalyst interactions. The processes catalysed by <b>formamidine</b> and benzamidine displayed nearly coincident energetics, with slightly higher PT activation energies than the previously investigated formic acid and 2 -pyridone/ 2 -hydroxypyridine systems.
