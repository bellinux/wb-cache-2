To our knowledge, {{there have been}} no studies of the gelation behavior of IPNs. We found that the rheology of these systems can be easily tuned, with the elastic modulus of the IPN strongly dependent on the relative ratio of HMEHEC to alginate. The sol-gel transition of these systems was found to satisfy the Winter-Chambon criterion for gelation at various crosslinker densities. From the power law relationship of the dynamic moduli (G (') similar to G (aEuro 3) similar to omega (n)), the exponent n appears to be dependent on both the crosslinker density and relative amount of two polymers. The value of n was found to be similar to 0. 5 for all samples for stoichiometric amounts of crosslinker. The effect of molecular weight of HMEHEC on the gel point and viscoelastic exponent has also been reported. Alginate seems to dominate the kinetics of the process but the effect of high molecular weight HMEHEC on the gel point, especially at lower proportion was also evident...|$|E

Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to investigate {{the effects of the}} amount of PEG adding to the adsorbent, solution pH, dosage of adsorbent, initial Cd(II) ions concentration and contact time. The prepared adsorbent exhibited the maximum uptake of 148. 9 mg/g under the optimal adsorption condition. Kinetics experiments indicated that the pseudo-first-order model displayed the best correlation with adsorption kinetics data. The Crank model showed that the intraparticle solute diffusion was the rate-controlling adsorption step. Besides, experimental data could be better described by the Freundlich isotherm model. Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm indicated that the adsorption was mainly an ion exchange process. The results suggested that the prepared adsorbent is promising for using as an effective and economical adsorbent for Cd(II) ions removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{preparation}} of thin composite layers has promising advantages {{in a variety}} of applications like transdermal, buccal, or sublingual patches. Within this model study the impact of the matrix material on the film forming properties of ibuprofen−matrix composite films is investigated. As matrix materials polystyrene, methyl cellulose, or hydroxyl-ethyl cellulose were used. The film properties were either varied by the preparation route, i. e., spin coating or drop casting, or via changes in the relative ratio of the ibuprofen and the matrix material. The resulting films were investigated via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope experiments. The results show that preferred (100) textures can be induced via spin coating with respect to the glass surface, while the drop casting results in a powder-like behavior. The morphologies of the films are strongly impacted by the ibuprofen amount rather than the preparation method. A comparison of the various matrix materials in terms of their impact on the dissolution properties show a two times faster zero order release from methyl cellulose matrix compared to a polystyrene matrix. The slowest rate was observed within the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) release is limited by diffusion through a swollen matrix.

The UV indicator film is blue-coloured {{in the absence of}} UV light and loses colour upon exposure to UV light, attaining within a few min a steady-state degree of bleaching that can provide a measure of the irradiance of the incident light. The original blue colour of the film returns once the source of UV light is removed. The spectral characteristics of a typical UV indicator film, and its components, are discussed and the UV-absorbing action of the titania particles highlighted. From the measured %bleaching undergone by a typical UV indicator as a function of light irradiance the indicator appears fully bleached, within 7 min, by a UV irradiance of 3 mW cm- 2 or greater. The mechanism by which the UV indicator works is described. The reversible nature of the UV indicator is removed by covering a typical UV indicator with a thin, largely oxygen impermeable, polymer film, such as the regenerated cellulose found in Sellotape. The product is a UV dosimeter, the response of which is related to the intensity and duration of the incident UV light, as well as the amount of titania in the film.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the amount}} of {{cuttings}} that have accumulated in a drilled wellbore is part of the information necessary for the effective control of bottom-hole pressure, preventing stuck pipe and minimizing circulation time for cleaning the wellbore. Acquisition of this knowledge can be made difficult when washouts develop in the wellbore, thereby promoting uneven distribution of cuttings along different sections of the wellbore. The cuttings are essentially found to accumulate in the washouts causing the wells to be improperly cleaned and can also lead to stuck pipe scenarios {{and a host of other}} events causing Non Productive Time. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the stationary cuttings bed height in washouts and how long and wide the washouts need to be before any increase in height was expected. This was achieved by a theoretical and experimental approach. The theoretical approach involved a literature survey of issues relating to wellbore washouts such as its causes, basic indicators of its occurrence in a well, its effects on wellbore drilling and tripping processes as well as possible ways of minimizing these effects. In a bid to further unveil the concept of washouts in wellbores, a physical model was developed in the course of the work. Furthermore, a mathematical model useful for calculating the stationary cuttings bed heights in the washouts was also developed. The experimental work presented a detailed review of cuttings height in expansions. In order to verify this, a wellbore annulus with washout in the middle was simulated using a 6 m long loop. Three washouts of 60 cm, 30 cm and 15 cm in diameter respectively were used. The annulus was kept horizontal throughout the test period. Fluid flow rates were set in the frequency range of 5 to 30 Hz (28. 6 l/min to 51. 6 l/min). Water and aqueous solutions of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> polymer (HEC) were used for cleaning the cutting beds. Actual drill cuttings of were used. The stable cuttings bed height after long circulation as well as the effects of relevant drilling parameters was measured. During these tests, it was observed that a high Reynolds number leading to turbulent flow with low viscosity fluid (water) enabled cuttings to be removed in the largest washout diameter of 60 cm. It was equally observed that though cuttings accumulated in the washouts, it took an interval of 78 seconds at high flow rates for cuttings height increase to be seen in the largest washout, approximately 47 seconds for the 30 cm washout and 26 seconds for the 15 cm washout. This shows that washouts with wide diameters take much time to be filled with cuttings than when the washouts are smaller in diameter. However, the important issue here is the height of these cuttings in the washout sections. Experimental results were used together with a non-linear regression analysis program to establish a functional relationship among drilling fluid properties namely the fluid flow rate and the cuttings bed height. Finally, the results of non-linear regression analysis showed that the relationship between cuttings bed height and flow rate of mud in washouts could be described very well by a simple log-decay exponential expression: 	. </p...|$|E

Two main techniques were employed for the fabrication of these particles. Acidic hydrolysis of Nata de Coco bacterial cellulose was used to form cellulose nano-rods which were applied as a foam scaffolding material. Characterisation and modification of Nata de Coco nano-rods was also carried out. It was found that cellulose nano-rods modified with a surface layer of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> exhibited good foamability. Secondly, a combination of in-shear-flow dispersion and solvent attrition techniques were employed to form micro-rods from the edible polymeric materials shellac, <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and zein. Characterisation of the properties of shellac, <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and zein micro-rods was carried out, together with assessments of their foam stabilisation ability. Stable aqueous foams were produced using shellac, <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and zein micro-rods as stabilisers, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> micro-rods were also used to form water-in-oil emulsions. An extension of this technique was used in the fabrication of novel functional anisotropic food-grade micro-rods with micro-particle inclusions giving altered morphology. Enhanced foamability and drainage retardation was achieved using lumpy yeast-shellac micro-rods to stabilise aqueous foams. The method was extended to the production of aqueous dispersions of ballooned micro-rods, formed by two different protocols. This procedure also allowed the formation of novel, dual-function micro-rod capsules or ‘micro-ampules’ for stabilisation and encapsulation by inclusion of oils into the dispersed phase prior to micro-rod fabrication.

It was observed the increase in concentration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> increases the entrapment efficiency and mean particle size of the microspheres. The effect of polymer concentration on the in vitrorelease of cefpodoxime proxetil from the microspheres was also studied. It can be seen that by increasing the polymer concentration, decreases the rate of drug release from the microspheres dramatically. The best microsphere formulation was selected based on the in vitro release profile and subjected for further pharmacokinetic studies. An in vivo studies revealed that the relative bioavailability of the drug increased by more than 1. 5 times by formulating it into microspheres...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to design an {{asymmetric}} membrane capsule, an osmotic pump-based drug delivery system of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> for controlled release of terbutaline sulphate. asymmetric membrane capsules contains pore-forming water soluble additive, sorbitol in different concentrations in the capsule shell membrane, which after coming in contact with water, dissolves, resulting in an in situ formation of a microporous structure. The terbutaline sulphate is a β-adrenoreceptor agonist widely used in the treatment of asthma. The oral dosage regimen of terbutaline sulphate is 5 mg twice or thrice daily, the plasma half-life is approximate 3 - 4 h and it produces GI irritation with extensive first pass metabolism. Hence, terbutaline sulphate was chosen as a model drug with an aim to develop controlled release system. Different formulations of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> were prepared by phase inversion technique using different concentrations of sorbitol as pore forming agent. It was found that the thickness of the prepared asymmetric membrane capsules was increased with increase in concentration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and pore forming agent, i. e. sorbitol. The dye release study in water and 10 % sodium chloride solution indicates that, the asymmetric membrane capsules follow osmotic principle to release content. The pores formed due to sorbitol were confirmed by microscopic observation of transverse section of capsule membrane. Data of in vitro release study of terbutaline sulphate from asymmetric membrane capsules indicated that, the capsules prepared with 10 % and 12. 5 % of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and 25 % of sorbitol released as much as 97. 44 % and 76. 27 % in 12 h, respectively with zero order release rate. Hence asymmetric membrane capsule of 10 % <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> and 25 % of sorbitol is considered as optimum for controlled oral delivery of terbutaline sulphate...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to design sustained release matrix tablets of cefixime trihydrate by incorporating drug in a matrix made up of release retardant polymers, which prolong drug release leading to minimization of the peak and valley effect in the plasma and provide patient convenience. The effect of combination of polymers on parameters like release pattern, release mechanism of the drug were studied. Total nine formulations each containing 200 mg of drug were prepared by direct compression method. The formulations F- 1, F- 2, F- 3 were prepared with a 1 : 1 drug to polymer ratio using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl <b>cellulose</b> sodium and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose.</b> F- 4 was prepared with a 1 : 1 ratio of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, F- 5 as prepared with a 1 : 1 ratio of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> F- 6 was prepared with a 1 : 1 ratio of carboxymethyl <b>cellulose</b> sodium and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> F- 7, F- 8, F- 9 were prepared by using polymers hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl <b>cellulose</b> sodium and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> in the ratios of 0. 5 : 0. 5 : 1, 0. 5 : 1 : 0. 5, and 1 : 0. 5 : 0. 5. Designed matrix tablets were evaluated for various pre-compression and post-compression parameters.

40|$|Nimesulide was {{formulated}} as novel dual coated microparticles using chitosan (CTN) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (EC) as encapsulating {{materials for}} its improved delivery to the intestine {{and to prevent}} gastric irritation and increase patient compliance. The first coating was applied by chitosan using pH change method followed by second coating of <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> using thermal change method. This process was analysed for its capability to produce microparticles of uniform size, good flowability, uniform drug loading and maximum entrapment efficacy {{and the absence of}} interaction between drug and process parameters as well as the polymers confirmed by XRD and FTIR analysis. In vitro release study was carried out in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) for first 2 h and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) for next 6 h. The formulation M 7 and M 8 that contained chitosan and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> in the concentration of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 (M 1 :EC) were found to achieve the targets of the present study such as uniform intestinal release of acidic drug and thus improves the patient compliance...|$|R
40|$|Venlafaxine HCl is the freely {{water soluble}} drug with {{antidepressant}} activity. It {{is available in}} a dose of 25 mg- 45 mg. Being highly soluble drug there is possibility of burst effect which causes sudden peak levels of drug in blood. It is having many side effects and with a half life around 5 hours. To reduce the adverse effects due to burst effect {{and to have the}} sustain action of the drug we have prepared the <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> microspheres of the drug. The microspheres were prepared by the emulsification and solvent evaporation method. The prepared microspheres were evaluated mainly for the sustain release of the drug and then the anti depressant activity in albino mice apart from the other tests like % drug encapsulation, particle size and drug polymer compatibility by the FTIR studies. The method had resulted in good encapsulation efficiency and micron sized <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> spheres. The drug release was found to be sustained for 16 hours and was found to follow the Peppas kinetics.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to develop once daily {{extended}} release matrix tablets of minocycline hydrochloride, using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose either alone or in combination with <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> as the matrix material in different proportions. The formulated tablets were also compared with a marketed product. The results of the dissolution study indicate that formulations FC-IV, FC-V and FC-VI showed maximum drug release upto 24 h, whereas the marketed product was found to extend the release only up to 14 h. Incase of formulations containing combination of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (FC-I to FC-IX), {{the release of the}} drug was found to be dependent on the relative proportions of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> used in the tablet matrix. Mathematical treatment of the in vitro drug release data suggests that, all the formulations best fitted into first order release kinetics. Drug release from the matrix occurred by combination of two mechanisms, diffusion of drug from tablet matrix and erosion of tablet surface, which was reflected from Higuchi&#x 2032;s model and Erosion plot...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> microcapsules were {{developed}} {{for use as}} a drug-delivery device for protecting folic acid from release and degradation in the undesirable environmental conditions of the stomach, whilst allowing its release in the intestinal tract to make it available for absorption. The controlled release folic acid-loaded <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> microcapsules were prepared by oil-in-oil emulsion solvent evaporation using a mixed solvent system, consisting of a 9 : 1 (v/v) ratio of acetone:methanol and light liquid paraffin as the dispersed and continuous phase. Span 80 was used as the surfactant to stabilize the emulsion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the microcapsules had a spherical shape. However, the particulate properties and in vitro release profile depended on the concentrations of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> Span 80 emulsifier, sucrose (pore inducer), and folic acid. The average diameter of the microcapsules increased from 300 to 448 [*]µm, whilst the folic acid release rate decreased from 52 % to 40 %, as the <b>ethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> concentration was increased from 2. 5 % to 7. 5 % (w/v). Increasing the Span 80 concentration from 1 % to 4 % (v/v) decreased the average diameter of microcapsules from 300 to 141 [*]µm and increased the folic acid release rate from 52 % to 79 %. The addition of 2. 5 – 7. 5 % (w/v) of sucrose improved the folic acid release from the microcapsules. The entrapment efficiency was improved from 64 % to 88 % when the initial folic acid concentration was increased from 1 to 3  mg/ml...|$|R
