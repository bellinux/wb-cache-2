500|$|In early 2013, Gosling {{announced}} that he was taking a break from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing. I think it’s good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a break and reassess why I’m doing it and how I’m doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that.” Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as [...] "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself", while Varietys Justin Chang dismissed the [...] "derivative" [...] film as a [...] "train-wreck." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna later {{described}} the sentiment {{she wanted to}} express as [...] "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: [...] "I'm super inspired by reggae music [...] {{has been a part}} of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was exciting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E

2500|$|Moriarty has {{respect for}} Holmes's intelligence, stating that [...] "It {{has been an}} {{intellectual}} treat {{for me to see}} the manner in which you [...] have grappled with this case" [...] and that [...] "it would be a grief <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> an extreme measure." [...] Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted and he is placed [...] "in positive danger of losing my liberty" [...] as well as furiously elbowing aside passengers in the train station in his pursuit of the disguised Holmes. Moriarty also shows a fiercely independent streak, pursuing Holmes to Switzerland alone, while by contrast Holmes takes Watson with him everywhere he goes.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} themes was the value and importance which the interviewees placed on their jobs. Working overtime seemed to be normal for the interviewees [...] many spoke of waking up early so they could arrive at work up to 90 minutes before it officially began. Although they were suffering from extreme physical symptoms from inhaling sarin, most of the interviewees continued on their way to work, only reporting to the hospital for treatment when unable to carry out their responsibilities at work, or under the insistence of a colleague or superior. Several of the interviewees returned to work quite soon after the attacks, despite not being fully recovered. One salesman said, [...] "Honestly, {{it would have been better}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some time off with sick pay, but the company wasn't that generous. It was nine to five, plus overtime just like always." ...|$|E

It's really important <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy." [...] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs. In {{an interview}}, Ciara said [...] "I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I'm excited about...
