40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{methodology}} currently followed in the offshore industry for the prediction of the pile fatigue induced by pile hammering during installation. A few decades ago piles were thicker, of lower yield stress and hammers were less efficient. Today, to be cost effective, it is common to use high strength steel resulting in lower pile thickness and increased driving stress together with better hammer efficiency to reduce installation time. Hence <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> are more important. Evaluation of <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> depend on various parameters such as applied stresses, number of blows, Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) and S-N curves. It is shown how <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> are dependant on the choice of the values used for the SCF and S-N curves and also on applied stresses by the hammer, and in the end the impact of these parameters on the residual available fatigue life for the in-place conditions...|$|R

40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) coated Ti alloy is a {{promising}} material for biomedical implants. The successful applications of such implants rely on fundamental understandings of mechanical {{behavior of the}} HA coatings, particularly, the fatigue resistance. In this work the mechanical stability of HA coatings under cyclic loading was systematically investigated using four-point bending tests and the indentation tests in both air and simulated body fluid (SBF). Also, a shear cyclic test was developed for the coatings, considering the coatings of implants often failure under shearing loading in human body. Experiments revealed the conventional cyclic bending tests could not effectively evaluate the fatigue resistance of the HA coatings on Ti substrates. The contact fatigue under indentation might represent the worst service conditions of coatings. The cyclic indentation revealed that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> in the HA coatings were severer in SBF than in air, and thin HA coatings exhibited less <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> than the thick ones. The newly developed shear test for the coatings successfully generated similar shear loading as the conventional ones, however it is easier for alignment and for adapting coating thickness variation. Using the new method, the coating resistance to cyclic shear loading was evaluated with S-N curves. Also the tests revealed the existence of threshold stress which was required to generate <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> in the coating...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on CFRP strengthening of severely <b>fatigue</b> <b>damaged</b> SRC (steel-reinforced concrete) beams.

The experimental results showed that, for the <b>fatigue</b> <b>damaged</b> SRC beams, flexural bearing capacity can be restored if they were repaired by welding fractured beams and re-bars even without CFRP sheets, but the plastic strengthening of encased steel is weakened. CFRP sheets can effectively increase the ultimate flexural bearing capacity and overall stiffness of SRC beams.

Finally, the strength of CFRP sheets will be fully utilized by using end anchorages...|$|R

And modal analysis is used to determine frequencies and mode shapes of structure. Based on these danger stresses distribution and dynamic load time history, fatigue life can be estimated with Palmgren-Miner theory.

The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the effect of okara supplementation on <b>fatigue</b> and muscle <b>damage</b> in university athletes over an exercise training season. A total of 23 male university baseball players aged 18 - 23 years attending a summer intensive exercise training program completed an 8 -week exercise training-okara intervention study. The supervised exercise training program consisted of physical and technical training including warm-up exercises, physical and skill practice, and pre-game competition practice. Okara supplementation in this study was a randomized, double-blind and crossover dietary intervention in which subjects consumed 2 cookies/day containing 10 g of soybean or black soybean okara for a period of 6 weeks with a one-week washout period.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the applicability of WaveWatch-III wave model to fatigue assessment of offshore floating structures. The applicability was investigated for Bluewaters’ FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) which had been turret moored at Sable field for half a decade. The waves were predicted as sea-state time series consisting of one wind sea and one swell. The predicted waves were compared with wave data obtained from ERA-interim and buoy measurements. Furthermore, the fatigue calculations were also carried out for main deck and side shell locations. It has been concluded that predicted <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> of main deck using WaveWatch-III are in a very good agreement regardless of differences in predicted wind waves and swells caused by differences in wave system partitioning. When compared to buoy measurements, the model underestimates <b>fatigue</b> <b>damages</b> of side shell by approximately 30 %.
