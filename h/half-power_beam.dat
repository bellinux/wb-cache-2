Analytical expression of beam broadening spectrum for a vertical beam subject to a constant vertical wind {{in the absence of}} horizontal wind is derived first. We find that the resultant beam broadening spectral shape is in an exponential form, rather than a Gaussian shape. The peak of the exponential spectrum corresponds to the true vertical wind velocity, and the spectral width &sigma; is a function of vertical wind velocity w and the <b>half-power</b> <b>beam</b> width &theta; 1 / 2 of the radar beam, in accordance with the expression &sigma;= 0. 09 w&theta; 1 / 2 2 . The beam broadening spectrum for a vertical radar beam subject to both vertical and horizontal winds is numerically studied, and the result shows that the spectral shape is distorted from the Gaussian form. The estimated vertical wind velocity of the distorted spectrum is very close to the true vertical wind velocity with a difference of less than 0. 6 % for a typical case. However, its spectral width is substantially greater than that of the conventional Gaussian spectrum broadened by horizontal wind only. The difference of the spectral widths &Delta;&sigma; (in unit of percentage) in the two, {{as a function of the}} <b>half-power</b> <b>beam</b> width and the ratio of vertical to horizontal wind velocities, can be well approximated by a parabolic equation.

Through a transformation of wind velocity from vertical and horizontal winds into along- and cross-radar-beam winds defined on the cross section of an oblique radar beam, the results obtained from the case of vertical radar beam can be directly applied to the case of the oblique beam.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of the S/C by the launcher into a Low Earth Orbit (LEO), followed {{by a series of}} long duration manoeuvres to guide it to its final operational orbit around L 1 is a particular challenge for the signal acquisition. The complexity is {{explained by the fact that}} the dispersion of a launcher such as VEGA or Rockot greatly exceeds the 3 dB (<b>half-power)</b> <b>beam</b> width of a 15 m ESA network antenna in X-band. Furthermore, the S/C is flying over the short duration ground station passes equipped with a Low Gain Antenna of 9 dB gain variation, transmitting telemetry in low power mode and with an altitude varying from 200 to 1600 km. The solution found to cope with a large orbit dispersion was to develop an X-band Acquisition Aid (XAA), small diameter antenna (1. 2 m) covering the full 3 σ orbit dispersion area within its <b>half-power</b> <b>beam</b> width. However, such a small antenna is limited in its capability in acquiring a downlink signal. Given the specified LPF 200 x 1600 km LEOP orbit and the S/C launch configuration (low power mode and high data rate), the signal strength received by the XAA is not sufficient to guarantee carrier recovery when the S/C altitude exceeds 630 km. It should be noted that the orbit dispersion increases not only as a function of the antenna elevation, but also as a function of flight time. This underlines the necessity to accomplish the spacecraft initial acquisition as soon as possible using the available short station passes. The other issue is that once the 1 st acquisition has succeeded and the orbit is known with enough accuracy, the S/C is brought to its escape orbit to L 1 via a sequence of large main engine burns. If the full range of main engine performance 0 % to 110 %, is considered, this leads to significant time as well as azimuth shift of the acquisition of signal (AOS) location. This paper explains the mitigation measures found to optimize the acquisition of signal under the unfavorable conditions of a tight link budget and high orbit dispersion both after launch injection and each main engine burn.
