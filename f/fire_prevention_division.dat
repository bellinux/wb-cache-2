40|$|Fire is an {{important}} land management tool for smallholders in the Brazilian Amazon.

We use data from a survey of 220 households to examine <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> and the scale of <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> and burning activities among traditional subsistence households in the Tapajós National Forest in Pará, Brazil.

Our results confirm that traditional households actively engage in <b>fire</b> <b>prevention,</b> and suggest that <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> is motivated {{by a desire to}} protect agricultural plantations as well as standing forest reserves.
