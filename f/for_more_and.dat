5|$|During {{the summer}} break between the Old Vic 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons, Richardson {{played at the}} Malvern Festival, under the {{direction}} of his old Birmingham director, Ayliff. Salaries at the Old Vic and the Festival were not large, and Richardson was glad of a job as an extra in the 1931 film Dreyfus. As his wife's condition worsened he needed to pay <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more nursing; she was looked after in a succession of hospitals and care homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out <b>for</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E

Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was attempting to reform the country's communist system and to forge a new relationship with the United States.

25|$|The declining use of cash in Sweden {{is going}} to be {{reinforced}} cyclically. As more and more businesses find they can have a functional business without accepting cash, the number of businesses refusing to accept cash will increase. That will re-enforce the need <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more citizens to get the Swish (payment) app which is already used by half the population. Cash machines, which are controlled by a Swedish bank consortium, are being dismantled by the hundreds, especially in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|For all products, {{the demand}} curve has {{negative}} slope (slope, which is constant {{in case of}} a straight demand function, must not be confused with price elasticity of demand, which varies depending on the point of the curve on which it is calculated and is not therefore constant even along a straight demand curve; see the mathematical definition <b>for</b> <b>more),</b> <b>and</b> meets upwards sloping supply curve at a price point that defines the market for any given good or service at a particular moment in time.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} {{for the use of}} the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC. Also Demosthenes (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head. A play by Alexis from the 4th century BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting, and both Diogenes and Polybius mention men that sometimes stood <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> sometimes for less, like the pebbles on an abacus. The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.|$|E

25|$|Escobar {{quickly became}} known internationally as his drug network gained notoriety; the Medellín Cartel {{controlled}} {{a large portion}} of the drugs that entered the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Spain. The production process was also altered, with coca from Bolivia and Peru replacing the coca from Colombia, which was beginning to be seen as substandard quality than the coca from the neighboring countries. As demand <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> better cocaine increased, Escobar began working with Roberto Suárez Goméz, helping to further the product to other countries in the Americas and Europe, as well as being rumored to reach as far as Asia.|$|E
25|$|The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, {{in which}} Spain settled a border dispute and ceded Florida to the United States, brought big changes to St. Augustine. The only {{city on the}} Florida peninsula, it became a {{destination}} for curiosity-seekers and consumptives on doctors' orders to escape cold northern winters. The presence of Castillo de San Marcos, a coquina fort built by the Spanish and now controlled by the U.S. military and renamed Fort Marion, brought a larger military presence to town. A decade after Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, the need <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> better visitor accommodations became pressing. Local residents began advertising rooms for rent with board (meals) included. This kind of lodging was in most cases a step above staying at a hotel.|$|E
25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E

He would not be specific on their themes or message. [...] "I see my work as waves on the ocean", he told the latter. [...] "Some people look for shells in it, some surf, others—dive". He had always intended for them to be a series, regardless of whether they went viral or not. [...] "Currently, there is a call <b>for</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> I aim to please", he admitted.

This was no accident. Frazee and Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert were friends, and American League president Ban Johnson's attempts to drive Frazee out of the game had caused the five teams loyal to Johnson to make no deals with the Red Sox as long as Frazee owned the club, leaving only the Yankees and White Sox as trading partners. When the White Sox's reputation was destroyed in the Black Sox Scandal, Frazee's only option for trades was to deal with the Yankees.|$|E
500|$|Stone was not {{interested}} in making a film about Garrison's life, but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. He also bought the film rights to Jim Marrs' book Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy. One of the filmmaker's primary goals with JFK was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission's report that he believed was [...] "a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth." [...] Even though Marrs' book collected many theories, Stone was hungry <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on Born on the Fourth of July. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.|$|E

500|$|In March 1799, the Army of the Danube {{engaged in}} two major battles, {{both in the}} southwestern German theater. [...] At the Battle of Ostrach, 20–22March 1799, the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian forces, {{under the command of}} Archduke Charles, {{defeated}} French forces. The French suffered significant losses and were forced to retreat from the region, taking up new positions at Messkirch (also spelled Mößkirch or Meßkirch), and then at Stockach and Engen. [...] At the second battle, in Stockach, on 25March 1799, the Austrian army achieved a decisive victory over the French forces, and again pushed the French army west. Jourdan instructed his generals to take up positions in the Black Forest, and he himself established a base at Hornberg. [...] From there, General Jourdan relegated command of the army to his chief of staff, Jean Augustin Ernouf, and traveled to Paris to ask <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> better troops and, ultimately, when these were not forthcoming, to request a medical leave. [...] The Army was reorganized, and a portion placed under the command of André Masséna and merged with the Army of Helvetia. Following the reorganization and change in command, the Army participated in the Battle of Winterthur and the First Battle of Zürich and, three months later, the Second Battle of Zürich.|$|E
2500|$|Couples often meet through {{religious}} institutions, work, school, or friends. [...] "Dating services," [...] {{services that}} are geared to assist people in finding partners, are popular both on and offline. The trend {{over the past few}} decades has been <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more couples deciding to cohabit before, or instead of, getting married. The 2000 Census reported 9,700,000 opposite-sex partners living together and about 1,300,000 same-sex partners living together. These cohabitation arrangements have not been the subject of many laws regulating them, though some states now have domestic partner statutes and judge-made palimony doctrines that confer some legal support for unmarried couples.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017, a {{sub-group}} of the ethnically Hungarian Székely {{community in}} southeastern Transylvania launched a petition demanding autonomy for their region, arguing {{for political and}} administrative self-rule, their own elected president and flag, {{as well as the}} recognition of Hungarian as an official language next to Romanian. Iohannis, on a visit to the region in July, cautioned against decentralization and the creation of regions based on the ethnic origin of residents. He argued <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> improved cooperation between Romanians and Hungarians [...] "as the only solution for us" [...] instead, stressing local administrative reforms and developing the region.|$|E

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked if the government had any evidence to support that claim; when Martin restated his argument another justice indicated he had a problem with that as well.
