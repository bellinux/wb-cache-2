40|$|Accelerated ageing {{occurs in}} {{transformers}} when loads exceed nameplate ratings or ambient temperature exceeds the design value. A software package {{has been developed}} by the authors based on IEC 354 : Loading guide for oil immersed power transformers. It identifies the risks involved and indicates how transformers may be loaded {{in excess of the}} nameplate rating (abnormal loading) without adverse effects for specific load curves. A matrix formulation of top oil temperature allows a near continuous load curve simulation. The relative ageing rate is calculated using Simpson’s rule. Results of the package agree exactly with the two step approach specified in the Loading guide for two step load curves. However, it is shown that the two step approximation gives somewhat inaccurate results for certain practical complex load curves. Thus use of the package could minimise unexpected future damages to transformers. Calculations have been done based on practically obtained data to determine the excess voltage regulation introduced by the abnormal loading and the variation of efficiency of a practical induction motor within this range of voltages. These show that there is no adverse effect on motor efficiency. In addition other general effects of voltage regulation on induction motor characteristics were also considered with the guidance of IEEE standard 141 : 1993.

40|$|While most loads on wind {{turbines}} are originated from wind speed fluctuations, they show a periodic nature with a time-varying frequency {{proportional to the}} turbine rotation.

The resulting controller is designed for both partial and <b>full</b> <b>load</b> wind <b>speed</b> conditions, therefore, {{it is able to}} reject periodic loads even when the wind turbine system is subject to changes in the operating rotation speed. Furthermore, a novel piecewise linear representation of the system is presented allowing a systematic design procedure, based on Linear Matrix Inequalities, in order to compute the control parameters. Simulation results in a 2. 5 MW large scale three-bladed wind turbine illustrate the proposed method, which is able to reduce the root mean value of blade load up to 12 times when compared to a traditional LPV controller.
