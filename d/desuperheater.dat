The hot water heat pumps (HWHP) markets in Canada and United States are relatively weak, and declined during the last two decades, notably because the total installed cost is more than double than of conventional equipment.

50|$|The four boilers have single divided {{furnaces}} {{and assisted}} circulation. Each has a {{maximum continuous rating}} of 1565 t/h (3,450,000 lb/h) and a design efficiency of 90.75%. Built by International Combustion, the design is similar in many respects {{to that of the}} now redundant 550 MW ICL boiler at Thorpe Marsh which had two furnaces with centre division walls. There are six stages of superheat and three stages of reheat in each boiler, with superheat and reheat stages mixed in position. As a result of operating experience on boilers of this size at Thorpe Marsh it was found that higher superheat temperatures and larger pressure drops than the design figures occurred in the boiler. New materials had to be employed for the superheat sections and the tube paths redesigned as a result. The boilers are 53.65 m (176 ft) high and the main suspension girders span 27.43 m (90 ft). The total downward thermal expansion is about 228 to 305 mm (9 to 12 in). The superheater output is at 569 ¬∞C 2,400 psi (165.5 bar). The reheater has inlet and outlet temperatures of 364 and 569 ¬∞C with an inlet pressure of 592 psi (40.82 bar) and steam flow of 1243 t/h (2,740,000 lb/h). The single steam drum weighs 162.6 tonne (160 tons). The furnace is tangentially fired with eight burner boxes, each with six burners, together with oil burners in each box for lighting up. Steam temperature control is by electrically operated tilting burners and by electro-hydraulically operated spray <b>desuperheaters,</b> giving a control range of 70 to 100% of the maximum continuous rating. There are four <b>desuperheaters</b> for each of the superheater and reheater circuits. The economisers have a heating surface of 44,970 m¬≤ (484,000 sq ft). There are two forced and two induced draught Davidson fans per boiler. The f.d. fans are driven by constant speed 1,300 hp motors at 596 rpm and are rated at 11,380 m¬≥/min (402,000 (cu ft)/min). A saving in the overall size of the boiler house building, which measures 259.69 m (852 ft) long, 44.2 m (145 ft) wide and 60.05 m (197 ft) high, was achieved by arranging the pulverised fuel mills in two rows between adjacent boilers instead of in a line {{along the length of the}} boiler house as usual. This meant that coal conveyors at right angles to the trunk conveyor had to be installed for each line of mills, but the cost of these was more than offset by the saving in capital on the building. There are six roller type mills per boiler, each powered by a direct coupled 635 hp motor at 985 rpm The coal is fed to the mills by Lopulco chain feeders with induction regulator speed controllers.|$|R
40|$|Disponible au lien suivant : [URL] audienceA {{heat pump}} enables one to {{transfer}} heat from a heat source to {{a heat sink}} using mechanical work. In water heating systems, the heat sink is water and the heat source can be ambient or exhaust air, {{the ground in a}} closed water loop, groundwater in an open loop or any other medium in which heat can be recovered. In normal operating conditions, the produced thermal energy is at least two times higher than the mechanical work consumed. That is why heat pumping technology can be interesting compared to conventional boilers or electric heaters. This chapter deals with vapour-compression air-source heat pumps applied to water systems for space heating and domestic hot water production. First, the classic subcritical heat pump cycle is detailed in terms of processes by means of Mollier diagrams. Basic notions will be given concerning the efficiency of the cycle (coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency) depending on different parameters such as temperature, high and low pressure, subcooling and superheating. This cycle is then compared to the transcritical cycle used with CO 2 for hot water production. The list of advantages (such as temperature glide at high pressure) and drawbacks (such as lower efficiency for low temperature water heating) of this cycle will tend to limit the use of the CO 2 transcritical cycle to DHW production. Secondly, some of the major improvements brought to the vapour compression cycle will be reported through works made by the research community on multi-stage and inverter compressors, expansion devices, such as ejectors and work recovery devices and the design or the specific use of heat exchangers. Multi-stage compressors enable one to achieve higher pressure ratios and to reduce the heat losses during the compression. Ejectors recover some kinetic energy of expansion and increase the suction pressure at the compressor. Work recovery devices produce some mechanical work that can be reused at compression to reduce the energy consumption. Other improvements are made using internal heat exchangers, <b>desuperheaters</b> for domestic hot water production, microchannels instead of regular tubes for refrigerant and a special fin design to enhance the convection heat transfer coefficient. Heat pumps can also satisfy simultaneous needs in heating and cooling to carry out energy savings. Finally, dealing with air-source heat pumps compels to examine two points: the frosting problems and the defrosting strategies. Frosting reduces the global performance by diminishing the air flow cross section area and by adding a thermal resistance between air and refrigerant. It appears when the ambient air temperature is low and grows faster when the air humidity is high. These conditions occur during winter, when the needs in space heating are high. So an efficient defrosting strategy becomes necessary to ensure the user a satisfactory winter seasonal performance. Conventional defrosting strategies such as hot-gas bypass, reversed-cycle, electric heating and other strategies more in a research phase using air recirculation or a two-phase thermosiphon are discussed in the final part of this chapter...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} low grade waste heat from {{industrial}} processes are not utilized, {{due to lack}} of heat integration equipment. Industrial processes tend to have specifications at high temperature lifts, that not are suited to be operated by conventional technology from residential heat pumps. Standard vapor compression heat pumps have undesirable high pressure ratios that are inefficient at high temperature lifts. Compression-absorption heat pumps use zeotropic working fluid mixtures that are suitable for temperatures between - 10 and + 160 ‚ÑÉ at system pressures below 20 bar, which make them applicable for delivering heat to high temperature processes. The advantages of the compression-absorption heat pumps, also known as the hybrid heat pump are the use of non-ozone depleting working fluid mixtures, reduced irreversibilities due to heat transfer with temperature glides, high temperature lifts, low pressure ratios and flexible capacity control. Two separate simulation models were developed comprising a two-stage CAHP system and an absorber model. The two-stage CAHP system used waste heat water at 50 ‚ÑÉ as heat source and heat sink temperatures, with the objective of achieve maximum supply temperature at four different compressor discharge temperature limitations. The absorber model compared five different compact heat exchangers heating air in a cross-flow, where the main goal was to minimize the absorber height and the fan work. The two-stage process investigated the benefits of the <b>desuperheater,</b> where the supply temperatures with and without the <b>desuperheater</b> where nearly the same. Maximum supply temperatures were obtained at 171. 8 ‚ÑÉ with a COP of 2. 08, when the maximum discharge temperature was set to 250 ‚ÑÉ. A correction factor was used for the intermediate pressure as K‚àô‚àö(P_LP‚àôP_HP) The optimum K-factor increased at elevating absorber pressure from 1. 16 to 1. 35 at absorber pressure from 17 to 47. 5 bar. Simulations from the absorber model yielded much larger mass flow rate for the air than for the mixture. The heat exchange between the air and the mixture was sensitive to the absorber height and the air mass flow rate, which resulted in large pressure drops and fan work. Finned at tube heat exchangers gave the best results with respect to the absorber height and fan work. There is suggested to conduct further work with other heat sink and source temperatures and also optimize the temperature lift in the two stage model. Finned at tube heat exchangers could be further investigated in an absorber model with other dimensions and more accurate approaches for thermal resistance and fin efficiency...|$|E

In practice, {{it can be difficult to}} identify the optimal form of a WHRS for a particular installation, since this can depend on various design objectives, which are often mutually exclusive. More so when the number of objectives is large.

This result indicates that more investigations in the process configuration are important. Based on the recent tender of 5000 m 3 /dar MSF plant of Eoun Mousa (Egypt), the thermoeconomics results showed that the unit cost of the produced fresh water is 1. 14 $/m 3. The analysis of the plant under partial loads showed that the unit product cost increased by 45 % when the load decreased to 53 % of its design value...|$|E
40|$|OpenStudio, {{developed}} at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is a cross-platform collection of simulation tools for whole building energy modeling. EnergyPlus and Radiance are the primary simulation engines in OpenStudio and the latest addition {{is a collection of}} refrigeration objects {{developed at}} the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) which makes the refrigeration system components of EnergyPlus available for use through OpenStudio. This paper highlights the benefits of including refrigeration modeling functionality in OpenStudio, the object model, the exposed Application Programming Interface, and discusses some of the design challenges faced. The project was implemented in four phases with each phase focusing on one aspect of the software. An initial set of EnergyPlus refrigeration components were selected and implemented, following which, additional components in decreasing order of priority were implemented. An Agile software development philosophy was employed along with modern source control tools such as GitHub. During the initial design, six main refrigeration components were determined to be critically important. These were Refrigeration System, Compressor, Display Case, Walk-In, Air-Cooled Condenser and Secondary System. Scripts were used to automatically convert various objects from the EnergyPlus Input Data Dictionary (IDD) file into C++ code. These prototypical source code files for the refrigeration objects were then modified to allow full instantiation of the objects. The objects, complete with their unit tests, were then submitted for integration into the main development branch of the software. During the second phase, the following components were implemented: Mechanical Subcooler, Liquid-Suction Subcooler, Cascade Condenser, Evaporative-Cooled Condenser, and Water-Cooled Condenser. During the third phase, the remaining refrigeration components from EnergyPlus were added: Air Chillers, Transcritical Refrigeration System, Transcritical Compressors, Air-Cooled Gas Cooler and waste heat recovery using the Air Heating <b>Desuperheater</b> Coil or the Water Heating <b>Desuperheater</b> Coil. In addition, EnergyPlus comes with metadata information of hundreds of refrigerated display cases and refrigeration compressors. These were added to the U. S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Building Component Library (BCL), which is a comprehensive online digital library of various building blocks of an energy model. During the fourth and final phase, documentation of the developed Application Programming Interface was created. In all phases, close collaboration with multi-lab partners was maintained who provided extensive support and developmental feedback to the ORNL team. It is expected that the addition of these refrigeration components fills a gap and will enhance the successful adoption of OpenStudio as a modeling tool of choice in the buildings simulation community. Furthermore, it is hoped that these refrigeration capabilities will allow retailers to assess the energy impact of a variety of supermarket and distribution facility refrigeration system design options and aid in the selection and implementation of energy efficient systems...|$|E
40|$|As utility {{costs have}} risen despite {{political}} campaign promises and energy conserving measures {{implemented by the}} utility companies such as alternative fuel use (coal and nuclear), co-generation, etc., homeowners have begun to search for effective methods of reducing their electricity bills. In some cases homeowners are faced with utility bills That are approaching {{the cost of their}} mortgage payments. For those with fixed incomes, such as the elderly or those looking forward to retirement in the near future, this has become an alarming reality. Virtually every homeowner would like to reduce his utility bill but the question is, what items should he address {{in order to have a}} significant impact on his electricity costs? According to Houston Lighting h Power Company, 50 % of an electricity bill can be attributed to the air conditioning system, and another 15 - 20 % to the hot water heating system. Therefore, to dramatically reduce utility costs one should look first at these two "energy gulpers" and next at proper home insulation, window coverings, etc. The other electrical appliances in the home use relatively minor amounts of electricity compared to the air conditioning and hot water heating system. This paper will describe the geothermal heat pump and the <b>desuperheater</b> as the latest developments in energy efficient air conditioning and water heating...|$|E
40|$|Ground loops {{are used}} for water source heat pumps. Refrigeration can be put on a ground loop. Water-cooled {{condensing}} units are more efficient than air-cooled, {{and they can be}} put indoors. Indoor location makes piping for <b>desuperheater</b> hot water easy. Since refrigeration equipment runs more than heat pumps, energy savings can be large for ground-coupled refrigeration. The paper presents a design procedure for ground loops for heat pumps, hot water, ice machines, and water-cooled refrigeration. It gives an overview of the commercial ground-coupled systems in Louisiana that have both refrigeration and heat pumps. Systems vary from small offices to a three-story office building with 187 tons. A chain of hamburger outlets uses total ground-coupling in all of its stores. A grocery store has ground-coupling for heat pumps and refrigeration. Desuperheaters provide 80 percent of the hot water for a coin laundry in the same building. A comparison of energy costs in a bank with a ground-coupled heat pump system to a similar bank with air-conditioning and gas for heat revealed a 31 percent reduction in utility costs for the ground-coupled building. Two buildings of the Mississippi Power and Light Co. have ground-coupled heat pumps in one, and high efficiency air source heat pumps in the other. Energy savings in nine months was 60, 000 kWh (25 percent), and electric peak demand was reduced 42 kW (35 percent) ...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} used where {{geothermal}} water or ground temperatures are only slightly above normal, generally 50 to 90 oF. Conventional geothermal heating (and cooling) {{systems are not}} economically efficient at these temperatures. Heat pumps, at these temperatures, can provide space heating and cooling, and with a <b>desuperheater,</b> domestic hot water. Two basic heat pump systems are available, air-source and water- or ground-source. Water- and ground-coupled heat pumps, referred to as geothermal heat pumps (GHP), have several advantages over air-source heat pumps. These are: (1) they consume about 33 % less annual energy, (2) they tap the earth or groundwater, a more stable energy source than air, (3) they do not require supplemental heat during extreme high or low outside temperatures, (4) they use less refrigerant (freon), and (5) they have a simpler design and consequently less maintenance. The main disadvantage is the higher initial capital cost, being about 33 % more expensive than air-source units. This {{is due to the}} extra expense and effort to burying heat exchangers in the earth or providing a well for the energy source. However, once installed, the annual cost is less {{over the life of the}} system, resulting in a net savings. The savings is due to the coefficient of performance (COP) averaging around 3 for GHP as compared to 2 for air-source heat pumps...|$|E
40|$|Between October 2008 and May 2013 ORNL and ClimateMaster, Inc. (CM) {{engaged in}} a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop a groundsource {{integrated}} heat pump (GS-IHP) system for the US residential market. A initial prototype was designed and fabricated, lab-tested, and modeled in TRNSYS (SOLAR Energy Laboratory, et al, 2010) to predict annual performance relative to 1) a baseline suite of equipment meeting minimum efficiency standards in effect in 2006 (combination of air-source heat pump (ASHP) and resistance water heater) and 2) a state-of-the-art (SOA) two-capacity ground-source heat pump with <b>desuperheater</b> water heater (WH) option (GSHPwDS). Predicted total annual energy savings, while providing space conditioning and water heating for a 2600 ft{sup 2 } (242 m{sup 2 }) house at 5 U. S. locations, ranged from 52 to 59 %, averaging 55 %, relative to the minimum efficiency suite. Predicted energy use for water heating was reduced 68 to 78 % relative to resistance WH. Predicted total annual savings for the GSHPwDS relative to the same baseline averaged 22. 6 % with water heating energy use reduced by 10 to 30 % from <b>desuperheater</b> contributions. The 1 st generation (or alpha) prototype design for the GS-IHP was finalized in 2010 and field test samples were fabricated for testing by CM and by ORNL. Two of the alpha units were installed in 3700 ft{sup 2 } (345 m{sup 2 }) houses at the ZEBRAlliance site in Oak Ridge and field tested during 2011. Based on the steady-state performance demonstrated by the GS-IHPs it was projected that it would achieve > 52 % energy savings relative to the minimum efficiency suite at this specific site. A number of operational issues with the alpha units were identified indicating design changes needed to the system before market introduction could be accomplished. These were communicated to CM throughout the field test period. Based on the alpha unit test results and the diagnostic information coming from the field test experience, CM developed a 2 nd generation (or beta) prototype in 2012. Field test verification units were fabricated and installed at the ZEBRAlliance site in Oak Ridge in May 2012 and at several sites near CM headquarters in Oklahoma. Field testing of the units continued through February 2013. Annual performance analyses of the beta unit (prototype 2) with vertical well ground heat exchangers (GHX) in 5 U. S. locations predict annual energy savings of 57 % to 61 %, averaging 59 % relative to the minimum efficiency suite and 38 % to 56 %, averaging 46 % relative to the SOA GSHPwDS. Based on the steady-state performance demonstrated by the test units it was projected that the 2 nd generation units would achieve ~ 58 % energy savings relative to the minimum efficiency suite at the Zebra Alliance site with horizontal GHX. A new product based on the beta unit design was announced by CM in 2012 ‚Äì the Trilogy 40 ¬Æ Q-mode‚Ñ¢ ([URL] The unit was formally introduced in a March 2012 press release (see Appendix A) and was available for order beginning in December 2012...|$|E
