5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements}} of the division, including its special troops battalion and the 1-87th Infantry deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. The division headquarters arrived at Karshi-Khanabad, under Major General Hagenbeck, on 12 December 2001 to function as the Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) (Forward). This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek, the Third US Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> of operations. As such, Hagenbeck's headquarters was responsible for commanding and controlling virtually all Coalition ground forces and ground force operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater,</b> to include security of Coalition airfields in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, {{as well as the}} logistics operations set up to support those forces.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Beghe, Kennedy became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> program at Collegiate. Beghe later also persuaded Duchovny to pursue work in acting.

5|$|The Southwest Pacific {{was not a}} {{promising}} theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day {{did not have the}} range to reach Japan from Australia, and there were no typical strategic targets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> other than a few oil refineries. This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> 1978, <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> was {{transformed}} once again into a Spanish-language cinema, {{still under the}} name El Cine Plaza, and continued showing Latino films until 1984, when a boiler explosion devastated <b>the</b> <b>theater,</b> collapsing <b>the</b> stage and resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater's</b> condemnation.|$|R
5|$|Tzara {{continued}} to write, becoming more seriously interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> In 1924, he published and staged the play Handkerchief of Clouds, which was soon {{included in the}} repertoire of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the Seven Dada Manifestos. Marxist thinker Henri Lefebvre reviewed them enthusiastically; he later {{became one of the}} author's friends.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E

Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E

The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{insisted that}} Anvil {{required}} an experienced commander, and with Patton gone, Clark {{was the only}} one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> Then Devers received a cable that IV Corps headquarters {{was on its way to}} the theater. It was commanded by Major General Alexander Patch, who had a distinguished combat record leading the soldiers and marines of XIV Corps in the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific. With Marshall's concurrence, Devers appointed Patch to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March. While Patch and his staff planned the operation, Devers ensured that the supplies accumulated for it were not dissipated.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April 1942, MacArthur was {{appointed}} Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). Lieutenant General George Brett became Commander, Allied Air Forces, and Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary became Commander, Allied Naval Forces. Since {{the bulk of}} land forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> were Australian, George Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, Allied Land Forces, and the job went to General Sir Thomas Blamey. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur's command also included small numbers of personnel from the Netherlands East Indies, the United Kingdom, and other countries.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a casino}} in the 1920s, the Rosendale Theater {{was seized by}} the village and {{converted}} into a theater in 1949 by Anthony Cacchio, a man who bore a strong resemblance to filmmaker Otto Preminger. The first film shown on opening night in February 1949 was Blood on the Moon. Caccio owned the building outright by 1954, and operated it with his son, Anthony Cacchio Jr., who banned popcorn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> in 1969. The theater served as the village's fire department at one point.|$|E

5|$|The {{unit was}} first {{constituted}} on 3 April 1959 in the Army Reserve as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Group before being activated on 25 May {{of that year}} in Washington, D.

The group remained in the reserves throughout the Vietnam War, and was never called upon to serve in the Vietnam theater of operations, as active duty military police groups were already being organized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> and additional, reserve commands were not needed. As such, the group received no campaign participation credit for the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In September, the UN Forces {{launched}} another counteroffensive {{with the}} 24th Infantry Division {{at the center}} of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies. In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations. In late 1951, the 1st Cavalry Division, depleted after having suffered 16,000 casualties so far in the conflict, was relegated to the Far East reserve to rebuild. It was replaced by the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, which was newly arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b>|$|E

5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's {{arrest and}} {{conviction}} for marijuana possession‚Äîhe would serve {{two months in}} jail‚Äîwas widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations‚ÄîRKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.‚Äîwith the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce {{was one of the}} crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E
5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade mobilized {{in support}} of the Global War on Terrorism in 2003. It was {{commanded}} by Colonel Gregg F. Martin. As preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 130th Engineer Brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps' staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed the border to Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south. Coupled with the landings of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to the north, the operation would see the US Forces surround and destroy Iraqi forces in and around the capitol.|$|E
5|$|The 89th Military Police Brigade {{deployed}} for {{a second}} tour in August 2006 to the Iraqi theater of operation in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 2006‚Äì2008. During the deployment, it was composed of over 5,000 military police soldiers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theater.</b> Brigade responsibilities included corrections and security operations. It deployed K-9 units during some operations. The brigade's primary responsibility, though, was the training of Iraqi police units. The brigade focused on local police units throughout the country, as another MP brigade handled the national police. The brigade commander would brief US Department of Defense officials in The Pentagon on the current situation, live from Iraq. It suffered several casualties, including a soldier killed by sniper fire, a soldier killed by a suicide car bomb, and two soldiers who died of non-combat related causes. The brigade returned home in October 2007, replaced again by the 18th Military Police Brigade. After this, the brigade resumed its policing roles at Fort Hood.|$|E
