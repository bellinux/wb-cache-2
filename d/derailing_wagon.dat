50|$|On 26 September 1905, {{a freight}} train derailed at Dock Junction, fouling the {{adjacent}} line. A passenger train collided with <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons.</b> Four passengers were injured, one seriously.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was that the train was travelling at up to 75 mph, which was {{in excess of the}} 60 mph limit of the wagon. Although {{it was not possible to}} weigh the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagon,</b> other wagons in the train were unevenly loaded, which meant that individual wheel loads exceeded permitted limits.|$|R
25|$|D 5146 was hauling {{a freight}} train that was derailed near Weedon, Northamptonshire on 1 April 1963. The {{accident}} was due to a defective wagon. An express passenger train collided with the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fixed diamond {{crossings}} (with no moving parts) {{count as}} trailing points in both directions, although in very exceptional circumstances such as propelling a train in reverse over fine angle diamond crossings they can <b>derail</b> <b>wagons</b> as they bunch up.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 May 1965, {{a freight}} train was derailed at Preston-le-Skerne, County Durham. Locomotive No. D350 was hauling a {{newspaper}} train that ran into the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> and was itself derailed. Recovery of the locomotive was not until 16 May.|$|R
50|$|At 12:32 Moscow Standard Time (08:32 UTC) on 20 May 2014, {{a freight}} train derailed between Bekasovo and Naro-Fominsk on the Moscow - Kiev railway. The <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> fouled an {{adjacent}} track. A Moscow - Chisinau, Moldova passenger train collided with the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons,</b> killing nine people and injuring 51; 29 of whom were taken to hospital. There were 394 passengers on board. The passenger train was operated by Moldovan Railways. It was travelling at 95 km/h before the driver made an emergency brake application, having seen the cloud of dust caused by the derailment of the freight train. The seventh and eighth carriages of the train were those most severely damaged in the accident. The side {{of one of the}} carriages was ripped open in the accident.|$|R

2500|$|On 6 April 1906, {{an express}} freight train was derailed [...] south of , Dumfriesshire {{due to the}} failure of a wheel on the third wagon of the train. [...] The <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> fouled the {{opposite}} line; an express passenger train ran into them and was derailed. One person was killed and several were injured.|$|R
50|$|On 11 October 1977, the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> of an {{eastbound}} coal train {{were struck}} by a Northfleet to Dunstable cement train between Lee and Mottingham. The locomotive {{ended up at the}} bottom of a garden of a house in Mottingham. There were no serious human injuries but several caged budgerigars in the garden were killed.|$|R
50|$|On 6 April 1906, {{an express}} freight train was derailed 2 mi south of , Dumfriesshire {{due to the}} failure of a wheel on the third wagon of the train. The <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> fouled the {{opposite}} line; an express passenger train ran into them and was derailed. One person was killed and several were injured.|$|R
5000|$|A {{disaster}} in the tunnel was narrowly avoided in April 1918, when a munitions train carrying high explosives ran into some <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> inside the tunnel. The entire munitions train was derailed filling a length of the tunnel with explosive debris, but fortunately there was no fire. It took forty hours to clear the line.|$|R
50|$|A major {{incident}} occurred on 4 July 1971 when {{a freight train}} derailed on the points at the London end of platforms 3 & 4. Unaware of the incident, the driver continued through the station {{with the result that}} two <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> eventually toppled over south of the platforms and obstructed the down fast through line. At the same time, a down express passed through the station and collided with the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> at a speed that caused the front of the express to derail and topple over. The leading coach finally came to rest as it struck the road bridge that passes under the line south of the station. Fortunately, there were no fatalities and the cause of the initial derailment was eventually attributed to overloading of some of the ballast wagons in the freight train which resulted in buffer locking when the train initially left Clapham Junction yard that day.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} was {{hostile to the}} railway since it threatened many trades. Trains were <b>derailed</b> and <b>wagons</b> set on fire.|$|R
50|$|On 22 June 2007, a {{goods train}} derailed at Hawk Bridge which carries the Ipswich line over the River Great Ouse a mile south of Ely. Photographs showed <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> on their side, only {{prevented}} from plunging off the embankment by subsidiary structures and their {{attachment to the}} rest of the train. As a consequence of the derailment the bridge had to be rebuilt and there were no train services between Ely and Bury St. Edmunds until the works were completed on 21 December 2007.|$|R
50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred at}} {{the northern end of}} the cutting, at the junction, on 31 December 1969 when a northbound goods train on the slow lines derailed. A southbound passenger train from Northampton was passing at the time at about 75 mph and collided with the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> and was partly de-railed itself. The driver of the passenger train was killed. The cause of the derailment was the failure of a main bearing spring on an empty 16-ton mineral wagon and very similar to a previous incident on the Northampton loop in 1967.|$|R

50|$|Shortly after {{lifting the}} ceasefire, FARC {{conducted}} attacks on a coal transport railway, which <b>derailed</b> 17 <b>wagons</b> and forced a suspension of operations and assaulted Milan, {{a town in}} the southern Caquetá, killing at least seven government soldiers and injuring five others.|$|R
50|$|At about 14151 on 10 March 2008, train 6MP9 was {{carrying}} containerised general freight from Melbourne to Perth when it <b>derailed</b> 11 <b>wagons</b> near Hines Hill in Western Australia. Although there were dangerous goods on the train, {{they were not}} involved in the derailment.|$|R
50|$|Freight train No. 50325 from Trecate to Gricignano, hauled by Class E655 {{locomotive}} E 655 175 with 14 tank <b>wagons</b> was <b>derailed</b> at Viareggio at 23:48 {{local time}} (21:48 UTC) on 29 June 2009. Of the 14 wagons, the first wagon was registered by Polskie Koleje Państwowe, the other 13 wagons by Deutsche Bahn (DB) The first DB-registered wagon, No. 338078182106, which {{was owned by}} GATX Rail Austria GmbH derailed on plain track in Viareggio station. The wagon hit the platform of the station and overturned to the left. The next four wagons also overturned and the two following were derailed but remained upright. The last seven <b>wagons</b> were not <b>derailed,</b> remaining intact on the track. The <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> crashed into houses alongside the railway line.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 September 1996, an {{eastbound}} Railfreight Distribution service, {{train number}} 6O67, the 00:53 Wembley Yard to Dollands Moor Yard, hauled by locomotives 47 033 and 47 360, {{came to a}} stand under the Sweetlands Lane bridge east of Staplehurst. A French-owned wagon loaded with steel coil derailed nearly 3 mi earlier, at Godden Cottages foot crossing; but as the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagon</b> was mid-train it remained upright and in formation, until striking a crossover at Staplehurst, causing the derailed bogie to disintegrate. The wagon mounted the station platform breaking the train brake pipe thus applying the brakes. The older brick section of the station platform deflected the wagon back onto the line, narrowly missing the A229 trunk road bridge, which {{otherwise would have been}} severely damaged.|$|R

50|$|Three {{men were}} injured {{and a number}} of freight <b>wagons</b> were <b>derailed</b> when a truck struck a goods train at the North Wangaratta level {{crossing}} on the afternoon of 19 April 1935. Two of the injured were riding illegally in one of the <b>derailed</b> freight <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unable to {{get close}} enough to safely fight the fire directly, the fire brigades forced high-expansion foam into {{ventilation}} shafts far from the fire. This created blockages that starved the fire of oxygen. By mid-afternoon the next day, the inferno was no longer burning, though the fire was by no means knocked down. Petrol continued to leak from the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagons</b> through the tunnel drainage and ballast and the vapour sporadically reignited when it came into contact with the hot tunnel lining. It also became apparent that petrol vapour had leaked into the nearby River Roch, possibly creating explosive atmospheres in the nearby towns of Summit and Todmorden. Two hundred people were evacuated from their homes and workplaces in Walsden in response. They were allowed back home the next day.|$|R
50|$|At about 0542 on Tuesday 22 April 2008, empty {{southbound}} {{manganese ore}} train 3DM4 <b>derailed</b> four <b>wagons</b> approximately 58 km south of Darwin near Manton Dam in the Northern Territory (NT). There were no injuries {{as a result}} of the derailment but there was minor damage to the track and rolling stock.|$|R

5000|$|The Hamstead Miners Memorial Trust, a {{registered}} charity (number 1098711) exists to record and commemorate the mine {{and those who}} worked there. The trust erected, and maintains, a memorial on the junction of Hamstead Road and Old Walsall Road (...) , near the former pithead. Erected in 2008, on the centenary of the disaster, it comprises a <b>derailed</b> tramway <b>wagon</b> full of coal, with a buffer-stop, and commemorative plaques.|$|R
50|$|On 12 July 2002 a coal train derailed at the Newcastle {{suburb of}} Hexham {{due to a}} points failure. A {{signalman}} closed {{two of the four}} tracks at the site to traffic, however a passenger train on one of the adjacent pair of tracks continued onwards to collide with the <b>derailed</b> coal <b>wagons,</b> injuring eight people. The cause was found to be a breakdown in communication between train and signalling staff.|$|R
50|$|A train crash {{occurred}} on September 2, 1954 near Fabrica, Negros Occidental, Philippines when a timber train carrying more than 100 passengers <b>derailed</b> and multiple <b>wagons</b> {{fell off a}} bridge. At least 82 people were killed.|$|R

50|$|Janata Dal came {{to power}} in the state in 1990 on the back of its victory at the {{national}} stage in 1989. Lalu Prasad Yadav became Chief Minister after winning the race of legislative party leadership by a slender margin against Ram Sundar Das, a former chief minister from the Janata Party and close to eminent Janata Party leaders like Chandrashekhar and S N Sinha. Later, Lalu Prasad Yadav gained popularity with the masses through a series of popular and populist measures. The principled socialists, Nitish Kumar included, gradually left him and Lalu Prasad Yadav was the uncrowned king by 1995 as both Chief Minister as well as the President of his party, Rashtriya Janata Dal. He was a charismatic leader who had people's support and Bihar had got such a person as the chief minister after a long time. But he couldn't bring the <b>derailed</b> <b>wagon</b> of development of the state on to the track. When corruption charges got serious, he quit the post of CM but anointed his wife as the CM and ruled through proxy. In this period, the administration deteriorated fast.|$|R
