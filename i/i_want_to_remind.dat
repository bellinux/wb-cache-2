5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of the RF member for the Salisbury constituency of Arundel, Welensky was given a chance to re-enter the political arena. Clifford Dupont, Deputy Prime Minister, resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose Welensky. Welensky knew if the RF won the byelections it would appear as a mandate for unilateral independence; the campaign, for only two seats, was intense. At public meetings, Welensky was heckled by opponents to ironic cries of 'Communist', 'traitor', and 'coward'. Sharing a television platform with Smith on 3 September, Welensky talked of the economic and political dangers of a UDI, but nonetheless wished Smith luck when he departed for independence talks in London. Welensky had much more antipathy for the British Government than his RF opponents, and was disgusted at their treatment of the Rhodesians during constitutional talks: [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> you that I am no friend of the present Government in Rhodesia: I have opposed their policies and can be considered a political opponent. But I was as horrified as any other Rhodesian at this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth.|$|E

My dad used to call me after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there."The song was written as a plea for Germanotta to have the open-heart surgery he needed for his condition. In October 2009, Gaga confirmed that Germanotta had undergone the surgery. [...] "My Daddy had open-heart surgery today.

Breakthrough was defined as an album about growing up, experiencing life, love, making mistakes and learning from them, with particular emphasis on love and making mistakes, with [...] "most of the mistakes Caillat chronicles have to do with matters of the heart", as noted by Plugged In's Adam R. Holz. Caillat stated that she [...] "wanted to make music that people could listen to while driving on a long road trip, while dancing at a party with friends, while laying out at the beach or sitting at their desk at work. I wanted to give people songs that they could fall in love to, lay down & cry to, songs & stories that they can relate to so they feel like they aren't the only ones going through whatever it is they are going through in life. Music is for you to listen to & forget about your worries. These songs can mean whatever you want them to mean, they are now yours." [...] She further elaborated over the album's themes and the inspiration behind it, explaining:"I recently learned something about myself. For a lot of us, when life gets hard to deal with & keep up with, it becomes easier to give up on & let go of. I found myself doing that a lot & I was slowly falling apart. But...I woke up from it. I realized I wasn't happy settling for less or letting myself become someone I wasn't supposed to be due to laziness. I had to Breakthrough my fears, my insecurities & my self doubt.

40|$|So, I'm sure {{everyone}} here knows what double-blind review is, but nonetheless, I'm going {{to define it}} anyway [...] {{just to make sure}} we're all on the same page. Double-blind peer review is where the identities of a paper's authors and reviewers are concealed from each other. This is in contrast to single-blind review, in which reviewer identities are concealed from authors but not vice versa, and open peer review, where neither the identities of authors or reviewers are concealed. The primary motivation behind double-blind review is to eliminate bias in the reviewing process by preventing factors other than scientific quality from influencing the perceived merit of the work under review. At this point in time, double-blind review is the de facto standard for machine learning conferences. * Disclaimers and Context I want to start with a couple of disclaimers and some context.

5000|$|For {{the next}} five years, Frann {{continued}} to work in television and also worked in theatre in Los Angeles and New York. In 1974, she landed the role of Amanda Howard on the daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives. She would remain on the show until 1979. While on the series, Frann also made guest appearances on Quincy, M.E., The Rockford Files, Fantasy Island, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and WKRP in Cincinnati. In 1978, Frann was nearly cast as Sue Ellen Ewing on the CBS prime-time drama Dallas. Producers later decided to cast actress Linda Gray. In 1982, she starred on the short-lived series King's Crossing with Linda Hamilton. That series was canceled after one season due to low ratings. Later that year, she landed her most memorable role as Joanna Loudon, the wife of Vermont inn owner Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart), in the sitcom Newhart. The series, which aired from October 1982, to September 1990, was a hit with audiences and was nominated for 25 Emmys and five Golden Globes. Shortly after filming the series finale, Frann was cast as [...] "Clementine Duke" [...] in the miniseries Lucky/Chances. The series was based on two of Jackie Collins' novels, Lucky and Chances.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{what gives}} the Karst its typical architectural appearance {{and why is}} there such a difference between old and new types of construction. The thesis begins with a description of villages and different parameters that defined and restricted the construction. Using the existing literary sources I briefly described historical conditions, focusing mainly on different habitats. I continued with a review of external elements which make a house typically "karstian" and then moved onto interior spaces. First I established which rooms there were in a typical Karst house and whether there were any differences in regard to the number of family members or family wealth. Then I explored their functionality and equipment. I received the information by interviewing older natives, who described the region between the two wars. They were telling me about their homes, about the houses they were born in, their exterior and interior, furniture, how it was built, what they did for a living, etc. Each one of them had an anecdote to go with the story. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know how they felt about their houses back then, how they see it today and what do they think about the new houses that are so much different from the old ones.
