5|$|On 19 November, he {{was sworn}} in as a Privy Counsellor. He {{suspended}} his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, due to an old custom that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty.</b> He only served until 8 April, and {{there is no evidence of}} his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties. He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, {{and he thought he}} would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty.</b> Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck said it was not his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E

25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont Plage Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks. When the group reached the hotel they discovered <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> and {{the doors and windows}} boarded up. Unable to find another target, they returned to the beach, only to discover their boat had put back out to sea. During the wait, two German sentries stumbled on the group and were quietly killed by the troops' bayonets. Another German patrol then approached across the sand dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E

25|$|Sullenberger {{opened the}} cockpit door and ordered evacuation. The crew began {{evacuating}} the passengers through the four overwing window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed {{from the front}} right passenger door (the front left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). A panicked passenger opened a rear door, which a flight attendant was unable to reseal. Water was also entering {{a hole in the}} fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open, so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats.

25|$|Some Christchurch {{members of}} the ATS moved into Aramoana at about 6:00a.m. on 14 November. The ATS went first to Gray's house, passing bodies on the street. After {{clearing}} neighboring houses, they put a stun grenade into Gray's, blowing out the windows, followed by tear gas. Kicking down the door, they discovered <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty.</b> The group then worked down the road, checking each house, a squad {{on either side of}} the street. The ATS called up the AOS, with members from Wanganui, Palmerston North, Napier, and New Plymouth, to their backs. The group discovered Sergeant Guthrie's revolver in a garden, and a woman who had been hiding under a table for more than twenty hours.|$|E
25|$|This {{design by}} Mallinson and Barber was an 1871 rebuild of a 17thcentury house for client Tom Holdsworth. It is located off Mansion Lane near Huddersfield Road, Halifax. By 1905 {{it had been}} bought by James Booth JP, a mill owner, then in 1916 its annexe became a World War I hospital. Between 1919 and 1931 it was a guest house for young men, owned by J.H. Whitley. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> until 1938 when Patons and Baldwins {{acquired}} it as a sports facility for employees. In 1948 they presented it to Halifax Corporation and its gardens became a school sports ground. The Northern Ballet Theatre Company was there briefly in 1990, then the building fell into disrepair. In 2011 the Calderdale Register Office moved into the building, and as of 2014 it remains in occupation. This building {{is now known as}} Spring Hall Mansions, and is not listed.|$|E

The Office of the Comptroller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency both occupied the building by March 2012.|$|E
500|$|In August 1968 {{the unit}} created a [...] "Total Encounter Capsule", {{which was a}} windowless, soundproofed room, [...] wide and [...] long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat {{on the floor and}} a ceiling {{containing}} a one-way mirror. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide [...] "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions." [...] Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with LSD-25. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Trent Reznor played {{keyboard}} in a Cleveland {{band called}} the Exotic Birds, then managed by John Malm, Jr. Reznor and Malm became friends, and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds {{to work on}} music of his own, Malm informally became his manager. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios, in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> commenting that it cost him [...] "just a little wear on [...] tape heads". While completing the early recordings, Reznor {{was unable to find}} a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.|$|E

2500|$|It {{turned out}} that the {{machinery}} was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: Summer and Winter, by Morris Barnett; a melodrama, The Sergeant's Wife; and a farce, The Midnight Hour. The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill. She sought to lease the theatre, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of Charles Dickens's productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property.|$|E
2500|$|The New Palace {{became the}} target of Fenian bombs on 24January 1885, along with the Tower of London. The first bomb, a black bag {{containing}} dynamite, was discovered by a visitor on the steps towards the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft. Police Constable (PC) William Cole attempted to carry it to New Palace Yard, but the bag became so hot that Cole dropped it and it exploded. The blast opened a crater in the floor [...] in diameter, damaged {{the roof of the}} Chapel and shattered all the windows in the Hall, including the stained-glass South Window at St Stephen's Porch. Both Cole and PC Cox, a colleague who had joined him to offer assistance, were seriously injured. A second explosion followed almost immediately in the Commons Chamber, causing great damage—especially to its south end—but no injuries, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> at the time. The incident resulted in the closure of Westminster Hall to visitors for several years; when visitors were re-admitted in 1889, it was under certain restrictions and never while the two Houses were sitting.|$|E
2500|$|... "Skip the Charades" [...] {{was based}} on the idea of {{relationships}} using charades and the theatricality of it all. [...] "Sensitive Kid" [...] is about a son dealing with the separation of his parents by throwing a party in his empty house and being admonished for it when told, [...] "Sensitive kid, start acting like a grown-up." [...] Willett explained that in high school, he would have parties at his house because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> and that his mother was out dating other people. The overall sound of the track utilizes [...] "fractured stabs of piano, electronic percussion, and obtuse grooves" [...] reminiscent of Spoon. [...] "Bulldozer" [...] is about [...] "plowing over a relationship to start over again on fresh soil." [...] Willett said that the inspiration for the song came from the marital problems that some of his college friends had gone through in their relationships, but with more of a happy ending from the aftermath of it all. [...] "Cold Toes on the Cold Floor" [...] was described by critics as a return to the band's debut record Robbers & Cowards, specifically the track [...] "Hang Me Up to Dry". Willett called the track one of his favorites off the album because of its similarity to their previous efforts and its playability live that allow for a lot of improvisation.|$|E
