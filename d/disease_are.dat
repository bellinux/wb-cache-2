5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity. The latter behaviors are similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction.|$|E
5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to be}} incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E

5|$|Some brain {{disorders}} such as Tay–Sachs <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> congenital, {{and linked}} to genetic and chromosomal mutations. A rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of, or inadequacy of, cortical folding. Normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies, teratogens, infectious diseases, and {{by the use of}} recreational drugs and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E

5|$|Although 300 {{mutations}} of ATP7B {{have been}} described, in most populations {{the cases of}} Wilson's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> due to {{a small number of}} mutations specific for that population. For instance, in Western populations the H1069Q mutation (replacement of a histidine by a glutamine at position 1069 in the protein) is present in 37–63% of cases, while in China this mutation is very uncommon and R778L (arginine to leucine at 778) is found more often. Relatively {{little is known about the}} relative impact of various mutations, although the H1069Q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems, according to some studies.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
50|$|Fatty liver <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} {{by many to}} be caused by bad diet. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods that are high in fat and sugar.

5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E
5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{now known}} that Bright's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> due {{to a wide range}} of diverse kidney diseases; thus, the term Bright's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{retained}} strictly for historical application.

5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> due to cell {{death in the}} target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E

5000|$|An aging-associated <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a <b>disease</b> that <b>is</b> {{most often}} seen with {{increasing}} frequency with increasing senescence. Essentially, aging-associated <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> complications arising from senescence. Age-associated <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> to be distinguished from the aging process itself because all adult animals age, save for a few rare exceptions, but not all adult animals experience all age-associated diseases. Aging-associated diseases do not refer to age-specific diseases, such as the childhood diseases chicken pox and measles. [...] "Aging-associated disease" [...] is used here to mean [...] "diseases of the elderly". Nor should aging-associated <b>diseases</b> <b>be</b> confused with accelerated aging diseases, {{all of which are}} genetic disorders.|$|R

5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
