During an interview with Andrew Neil on BBC2's Daily Politics, Prof Silver said: [...] "I didn’t actually see the speech but I’ve read the draft. And I’ve {{looked at all the}} feedback that there was to the speech. I’ve read the speech carefully and I’ve looked at all the feedback. It’s discriminating against foreigners, you pick on them and say we want to give jobs to British people and not to foreigners. It was interpreted that way." [...] During the subsequent discussion on the programme, former Conservative Party leader Michael Howard responded by stating: [...] "Of course it wasn't a <b>hate</b> <b>incident...</b> What Amber Rudd said was no different from Gordon Brown Labour prime minister when he said there should be British jobs for British workers. I think Mr Silver should be thoroughly ashamed of himself because what he's doing is to bring a well-intentioned piece of legislation into disrepute." [...] The BBC subsequently reported that West Midlands Police had not formally investigated the speech, but had recorded it as a [...] "non-crime hate incident" [...] in accordance with national police guidelines.|$|E

40|$|After a <b>hate</b> <b>incident</b> is {{reported}} to the police or other relevant agency, the victim is often looking for a response from the service and the helping professional they are telling their experiences to (Chahal, 1999, 2003). However, within the increasing literature on hate crime {{there is very little}} on the support, casework and help provided by hate crime support services and other helping professionals and the relationship with the victim as a service user (see for example, Jennes & Broad, 1997, Chahal, 2003, Jalota, 2004). Casework is both a historical and changing concept and approach that has transformed over a long history - stretching over a period of 120 years. Previously directly associated with the practice of social work, casework as a problem-solving tool has largely disappeared from practice due to the growth of managerialism and the development of processes of case management. However, within the broad arena of hate crime, victim support and casework continues in different forms as a co-produced, problem-solving tool that aims to provide justice for the victims of the prejudices. This chapter provides a United Kingdom (UK) perspective on current UK policy and prevalence of hate crime, the history, practice and some theoretical issues relating to supporting victims of hate crime and providing a casework approach that aims to co-produce solutions with a service user...|$|E

40|$|Hate {{offenders}} and those convicted of ‘radical’ or ‘extremist’ terror-related offences have a well-established presence online, and <b>hate</b> <b>incidents</b> which {{occur in the}} real world are increasingly being linked to online ‘virtual’ activities (INCAH, 2010). Building on psychological research and theory, in particular McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002), and Gerstenfeld, Grant, and Chang (2003), this study has developed an original typology of online hate offending, dividing it into four distinct types of user: Browsers, Commentators, Activists, and Leaders. In a partial test of this typology, an online search was conducted for <b>hate</b> <b>incidents</b> relating to a single London borough over seven months. The search uncovered a wide variety of online incidents. Content and thematic analysis supported the division of the typology into four distinct superordinate themes.

This article presents some of the research that has taken place on the nature and policing of hate crime over the past 5 years in the London Metropolitan Police Service. Focusing in particular on recent research into anti-Semitism where a new typology of incidents has been developed, the article reveals that the majority of <b>hate</b> <b>incidents</b> reported to the police in London are perpetrated by people with whom victims come into contact in their daily lives, rather than predominantly by strangers or extremists.

40|$|A {{treatment}} {{model for}} the psychological sequelae of discrimination is illustrated via three treatment cases in which experiences of racism and gender, ethnic, or religious hos-tility were a primary focus of intervention. The client’s level of psychological function-ing, acuity of hate victimization, and coping and identity re-formation strategies are addressed in this phase-oriented model of counseling. The five treatment phases are (1) event containment and safety, (2) assessment of client-event characteristics, (3) address-ing diversity in the counseling alliance, (4) acute symptom reduction, and (5) identity recovery and re-formation. Counseling tasks with clients of hate victimization include the amelioration of acute postevent symptoms, reframing of aversive out-group attitudes, alleviating disturbance of in-group identity, and the eradication of avoidant intergroup behaviors. It is proposed that the effective treatment of victims of chronic harassment and acute <b>hate</b> <b>incidents</b> requires the integration of behavioral, cognitive, and multicultural counseling modalities. The past two decades have seen a refinement of theory concerning multi-cultural counseling and psychotherapy (Atkinson, Morten, & Sue, 1993...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between impairment, dis¬abling barriers and risk factors relating to <b>hate</b> crime <b>incidents.</b> The study analy¬ses quantitative data collected in 2011 – 2012 where there were 81 <b>incidents</b> of disability <b>hate</b> crime reported in the Tyne and Wear area of England. The research discovered that in the Tyne and Wear region people with learning diffi¬culties have a greater likelihood of experiencing hate crime than do people with other impairments. Although there was no significant difference between impair¬ment and types of <b>hate</b> crime <b>incidents</b> recorded (i. e. verbal abuse/harassment, violence and criminal damage), there were distinct differences between police and victim support responses to victims which correlated to impairment catego¬ries (p ≤ 0. 05). The study concludes by suggesting that owing to specific dis¬abling barriers experienced by people with learning difficulties, this group is at increased risk of being victimised and is less likely to receive support from crim¬inal justice agencies...|$|R

40|$|Based on ethnographic {{research}} methods, {{the chapter}} provides important {{insights into the}} social worlds of victims of racist hate crimes. This includes the challenges faced by victims and caseworkers in maintaining hate crime victim status, particularly in respect of {{agencies such as the}} police who were supposed to be guided by the victim-centred definition of hate crime which operates {{in the criminal justice system}} in England and Wales and which was institutionalized in casework practice. The findings show how the rejection by police officers of some victims’ perceptions that they had experienced <b>hate</b> <b>incidents,</b> for example, due to lack of evidence, resulted, in some cases, in retaliatory acts by the victim. Highlighting the ‘processual’ (Bowling 1994, 1999) dynamics of victimization, the analysis captures the failure of the victim’s perception to trump police discretion in the reporting and recording of racist incidents at various stages and the consequences of the loss of victim status, including the risk of criminalization. It is concluded that whilst the victim-orientated definition of hate crime defines who is a victim, it is everyday ‘interactional practice’ (Holstein and Miller 1990) which determines who can be a victim...|$|R

40|$|At {{the time}} of writing, the United Kingdom is grabbling with its {{decision}} to abandon its European Union membership. As the country is divided and <b>hate</b> <b>incidents</b> are increased by almost 50 %, this think-piece presents a critical analysis of Europe’s missed opportunity for social justice. The paper presents evidence by analysing the {{civil and political rights}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in order to explore the potential of what it calls the “human rights project” for a regional democracy. The paper shows that a key objective of the European Convention of Human Rights was the development of case law that would construct a regional democracy for bringing consistency in the enjoyment of civil and political rights across the continent. This “human rights project” was well underway, but is now hampered by contemporary forces of power and control that are ridiculing the work and status of the Council of Europe. The paper identifies three levers that move these forces, namely: financial and security terror as well as nationalism. The paper warns that if these forces are not managed, the backlash in social justice will continue while the human rights project for a regional democracy will come to its demise...|$|R
