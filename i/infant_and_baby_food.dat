Korean government has controlled level of AFM 1 in milk at 500 ppt as maximum residue level (MRL), and more recently, government also publicized the proposal for more strict control on fun-gal toxins about <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> <b>foods.</b> In this study the levels of Aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) of 42 marketed milk samples were determined with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to evaluate the status on the contamination of Aflatoxin M 1. The evaluated ELISA performances of limit of detection (LOD) and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 were 5 pg/mL (ppt) and 49 ppt, respectively.

40|$|Understanding {{the dietary}} intakes of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> {{toddlers}} {{is important because}} early life nutrition influences future health outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the dietary sources of total energy and 16 nutrients in a nationally representative sample of U. S. <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> toddlers aged 0 - 24 months. Data from the 2005 - 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Dietary intake was assessed in 2740 subjects using one 24 -h dietary recall. The population proportion was used to determine the contribution of foods and beverages to nutrient intakes. Overall <b>infant</b> formulas <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> were the leading sources of total energy <b>and</b> nutrients in <b>infants</b> aged 0 - 11. 9 months. In toddlers, the diversity of food groups contributing to nutrient intakes was much greater. Important sources of total energy included milk, 100 % juice and grain based mixed dishes. A number of foods of low nutritional quality also contributed to energy intakes including sweet bakery products, sugar-sweetened beverages and savory snacks. Overall non-flavored milks and ready-to-eat cereals were the most important contributors to micronutrient intakes. In conclusion this information can be used to guide parents regarding appropriate food selection as well as inform targeted dietary strategies within public health initiatives to improve the diets of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> toddlers...|$|R

The present study reports PFASs levels in human milk, <b>infant</b> formulas <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> (dry cereals <b>and</b> pots) from the Valencian Community (Spain) in order to evaluate the infant exposure to these substances through the diet. The results show that perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were in all the samples of the four selected matrices (except PFOA in one sample of dry cereal <b>baby</b> <b>food).</b> Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were also detected in 70 % of the breast milk samples. In <b>infant</b> formulas, PFDA <b>and</b> perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were detected in 75 % and 69 %, respectively. In dry cereals <b>baby</b> <b>food,</b> PFBA was in 100 % of the samples while PFOA and PFOS in 92 %. In <b>baby</b> <b>food</b> pots, PFDA was also detected in 83 % of the samples.

40|$|Objective: Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites of fungi {{that cause}} toxic and carcinogenic outcomes in humans exposed to them 1. Mycotoxins affect several commodities including cereal grains and their finished products, <b>infant</b> formula <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> 2. This study aimed {{to determine the}} incidence and levels of 20 mycotoxins (AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1, AFG 2, AFM 1, OTA, NIV, NEO, DAS, FUS-X, DON, 15 -AC-DON, 3 -AC-DON, HT- 2, T- 2, VER, T- 2 TETROL, T- 2 TRIOL), in breakfast cereals available in the Portuguese market, and compare the results with the maximum limits established by the EU. Methodology: Twenty six breakfast cereal samples, including corn, wheat, oat, rice and multigrain, were collected from supermarkets in Lisbon region and analyzed by HPLC-FLD, LC-MS/MS and GC-MS. Results: Results showed that 88 % breakfast cereals samples were contaminated with mycotoxins (with values above the detection limit), although all samples presented levels below the maximum limits established by the Commission Regulation 1881 / 20063. OTA and DON were the most commonly detected mycotoxins, with 88 % and 73 % of samples revealing values above the LOD, respectively. The co-occurrence of different mycotoxins in the same sample was observed in 92 % of the analyzed samples. From these, 46 % include mixtures of 3 or 4 mycotoxins. These results are accordingly to those reported by Juan et al (2014) 4 and Iqbal et al (2014) 5.

40|$|Cheese {{producers}} want {{to increase}} cheese yield. The yield is improved by enhanced transfer of milk proteins and fat to cheese. This requires modifications to the traditional cheese process. During high-temperature heat treatment (HH), whey proteins are partially denaturated and co-precipitated with the cheese matrix. Elevation of the protein concentration of milk enhances {{the formation of the}} protein network in which whey proteins and fat are enclosed. The protein concentration is usually increased by ultrafiltration (UF) or microfiltration (MF) membranes. UF concentrates all milk proteins in the cheese milk. With MF, the casein content of milk is increased, as part of the whey proteins are transferred to MF permeate. Often, HH treatment is used in combination with membrane processes. All these milk processing technologies {{have an effect on the}} quantity and quality of whey. Whey is processed into different products, such as demineralised whey powders (DWP), whey protein concentrates (WPC) or isolates (WPI). All of these are used in infant formulas as well as in numerous other applications in food industry. The changes in the cheese process may have an undesirable effect on the composition and functional characteristics of the whey product. In addition to stable functional properties, the nutritional content of the raw material of <b>infant</b> formulas <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> is expected to remain within the specification. In this work, the effects of HH, UF, combination of HH and UF (UFHH) and MF processes on the yield and nutritional quality of whey were studied. The focus was on proteins and amino acids, which are especially important to the infant formula industry. There were no significant differences in the protein and amino acid compositions of the whey products obtained by HH, UF and UFHH. The functional properties of DWP were not adversely affected by these treatments. However, the whey obtained by ceramic and polymeric MF was considered to be of limited use in infant formulas due to its inferior amino acid profile compared to the traditional whey. The applicability of MF cheese whey in other food industries is also questionable, as the gelling properties of whey proteins were adversely affected by the elevated concentration of caseinomacropeptides...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{prevention}} of obesity {{is more effective}} if a well designed strategy {{is focused on the}} early roots of the causes of overweight and obesity. Increasing duration of breast feeding was shown to be associated with a lower risk of overweight later in life, whereas others failed to confirm that association. Breast-feeding for more than one year was the rule in most villages and rural areas of the Kingdom as reported by several investigators. However, later others researchers indicated that there is a sharp drop in the duration of exclusive breast-feeding in rural and urban areas alike which was attributed partly to availability of <b>infant</b> formula <b>and</b> other <b>baby</b> <b>foods</b> on the market at reasonable price as well as modernization behavior. The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide has been described by many researchers as epidemic. Several studies showed that a child or adolescent who is overweight or obese has a high risk of being so at 35 years of age. The risk is increased with age while underweight six years old children were 3. 6 times are likely to remain at adolescence and overweight ones were 2. 8 times are likely to become overweight adolescents. The data for this study were collected from mothers of 200 children below four years of age who visited the primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. The PHCC were selected randomly from the five regional zones in the city (Two PHCC from each zone). The weight and height of the children were measured and the mothers were interviewed by well trained nutrition students using a pilot, tested and validated questionnaire concerning the duration of breast-feeding of their children. Data from fifteen children were excluded from the analysis as these were incomplete. The results of this study show that children who were breast-fed for more than six months are at a lower risk of being obese (27. 2 % vs., 42. 1 %; p < 0. 001) as compared with those who were breast-fed for less than six months, and there is a negative correlation between BMI and duration of breast-feeding. However, {{no significant difference between the}} two groups in relation to overweight was observed (9. 2 % vs., 10. 3 %; p < 0. 3). in conclusion, primarily {{prevention of}} overweight and obesity could be the key strategy for controlling the current epidemic of overweight and obesity among Saudis and these strategies seem to be more effective if action is initiated early in childhood rather than among adults. Therefore, breast-feeding promotion program should be one of the strategies to prevent overweight and obesity among adults and should well be designed to be effective. King saud universit...|$|R
