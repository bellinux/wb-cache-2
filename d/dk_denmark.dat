40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} uncovered hundreds of DNA changes associated with complex disease. The ultimate promise {{of these studies}} is the understanding of disease biology; this goal, however, is not easily achieved because each disease has yielded numerous associations, each one pointing to a region of the genome, rather than a specific causal mutation. Presumably, the causal variants affect components of common molecular processes, and {{a first step in}} understanding the disease biology perturbed in patients is to identify connections among regions associated to disease. Since it has been reported in numerous Mendelian diseases that protein products of causal genes tend to physically bind each other, we chose to approach this problem using known protein–protein interactions to test whether any of the products of genes in five complex trait-associated loci bind each other. We applied several permutation methods and find robustly significant connectivity within four of the traits. In Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, we are able to show that these genes are co-expressed and that other proteins emerging in the network are enriched for association to disease. These findings suggest that, for the complex traits studied here, associated loci contain variants that affect common molecular processes, rather than distinct mechanisms specific to each association.

Plants at Mediterranean sites (IT, SP) showed a higher root-surface phosphatase activity than plants at temperate sites (WL, NL, DK). We suggest it might be an adaptation of plant species evolved under Mediterranean climate that allows them a) to compensate in wet period for the decrease in phosphatase activity, and thus P uptake, during drought periods, and/or b) to benefit from soluble organic P flushes following the frequent drying-rewetting episodes experienced by soils in Mediterranean ecosystems...|$|R

Phytoplankton biomass increased with total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and decreased with submerged macrophyte cover across the three regions. Generic richness was significantly negatively related to submerged macrophyte cover and related environmental variables. Zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratios were positively related to submerged macrophyte cover and negatively to phytoplankton generic richness in DK and BNL, suggesting that the low generic richness in lakes with submerged macrophytes was due to a higher zooplankton grazing pressure in these regions. In SP, phytoplankton generic richness was not influenced by zooplankton grazing pressure but related to conductivity. We observed no relationship between phytoplankton generic richness and TP concentration {{in any of the}} three regions. The three regions differed significantly with respect to mean local and regional generic richness, with BNL being more diverse than the other two regions. Our observations suggest that phytoplankton diversity in European shallow lakes is influenced by submerged macrophyte cover indirectly by modulating zooplankton grazing.

Organic dairy farming is very developed within DK, whereas it is only just beginning in NZ. The Danish experiences are used to define scenarios for future development within NZ.

Assumptions on development within NZ's main trade partner countries – United States, European Union and Japan – are included in the modelling. The LTEM modelling shows how the NZ dairy sector could benefit overall from some conversion to organics. Even very conservative estimates of organic consumption and consumers' preference for organic dairy products result in increases in NZ organic and total producer returns.

Lakes were selected along four mutually independent gradients of total phosphorus (TP), vegetation cover (SUBMCOV), lake area (AREA), and connectedness (CONN). Principal-components analysis (PCA) indicated that taxon diversity at the ecosystem level is a multidimensional phenomenon. Different PCA axes showed associations with richness in different subsets of organism groups, and differences between eigenvalues were low. Redundancy analysis showed a unique significant contribution to total richness variation of SUBMCOV in all three regions, of TP in DK and SP, and of AREA in DK and BNL. In DK, several organism groups tended to show curvilinear responses to TP, but only one was significantly hump shaped. We postulate that the unimodal richness responses to TP that are frequently {{reported in the literature}} for many organism groups may be partly mediated by the unimodal response of macrophyte vegetation to lake productivity.

In The Netherlands (NL), restrictions on manure P application have been introduced, and since the mid- 1980 s, NL has focused intensively on research aimed at reducing P excretion. In <b>Denmark</b> (<b>DK),</b> such systematic research was not initiated until the beginning of the 1990 s. As a result, the P loss per pig produced is lower in NL than in France (F) or DK. The loss amounts to 1. 3, 1. 0 and 1. 2 kg per produced standard pig in NL and DK, respectively. Most of the P consumed is not retained in the pig's body, but is excreted with faeces and urine. The mean excretion amounts to 70, 52 and 64 % of the P intake in sows, weaners and growing pigs, respectively. The reasons for such low P utilisation can be related to two major causes. First, the dietary P digestibility is low, and second, the dietary P recommendations may be too high. The low P digestibility is the dominant problem and applies to all pig categories, whereas inaccurate recommendations are mainly an issue in sow feeding.

UA has large biomass-for-bioenergy potential, which can be leveraged to contribute to local/regional energy self-sufficiency, rural development and diversification, and environmental improvement via fossil fuel substitution with local and more sustainable biofuels. However, the manner in which biomass energy utilization is emerging is poorly documented and its organizational basis is not well understood. This work focuses on bioenergy from agricultural waste as an early emergent area. It applies cross-case analysis to nine straw-fired installations in UA. Analysis yields three straw-based frameworks for organization and action, including small-scale local heat production, small-scale local straw production for municipal fuel provision, and medium-scale straw combustion for district heating (DH). The UA context is then compared to more advanced agro-bioenergy sectors in Sweden (SE) and <b>Denmark</b> (<b>DK)</b> to delineate crucial factors for the growth of UA's embryonic sector. The study finds that evolution of individual business entrepreneurship qualities and knowledge dissemination are key parameters to move the sector forward at small to medium scale, while stable and targeted incentive based systems, national government support, and collective bioenergy stakeholder action are required for advance to medium and large scales.

The Ostomy Skin Tool (OST) is a new assessment instrument for the extent and severity of peristomal skin conditions. Formal tests of reliability and validity are necessary for its use in clinical practice, research, and education. Objectives To estimate inter- and intra nurse assessment variability of the OST and validity by comparison to a 'gold standard' (GS) defined by an expert panel. Methods Thirty photographs of peristomal skin were presented twice to 20 ostomy care nurses - 10 from <b>Denmark</b> (<b>DK)</b> and 10 from Spain (ES) - to determine intra- and inter nurse assessment variability.

We examine the impact of increasing the transmission capacity on electricity prices, trade and overall welfare gains using simulation modeling. Moreover, we explore the potential for further expansions. To address these issues, we first developed an empirical model for both market using hourly data set from 2004 to 2010. For the simulation part, we took different years and initial reservoir levels. Our findings show that the transmission capacity upgrade amplifies the power flows from low cost generation area (NO 1 in wet year and DK 1 in dry year) to high cost generation area (NO 1 in dry year and DK 1 in wet year). With regards to prices, following the path of export, NO 1 ’s price increases for high inflow and reservoir level as well as peak hours and it decreases for low inflow and reservoir level. In contrast, price in Dk 1 decreases when NO 1 has more water and during peak hours. During off-peak load hours, price increases as DK 1 increases its exports during these hours leading to price convergence. However, we still have price spikes during wet year. From net welfare point of view, the results show that upgrading the interconnection improves social welfare when NO 1 has high inflows. For a dry year, transmission capacity upgrade leads to a net welfare loss even if DK 1 ’s welfare improves when NO 1 has high initial reservoir level. Further upgrading the transmission capacity by 1400 MW has still a room for welfare improvement in wet year. However, upgrading the capacity by 2100 MW has no significant impact on net welfare...|$|R
40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} {{data from the}} Øresund Experiment, organized in the IOC general magnetic tape format (GF 3. 2). Reference to the format is the IOC Manuals and Guides no. 9, Annex 1, Parts 1, 2 and 3; including the consolidated list of addenda and corrigenda to the technical specification of GF 3, September 1985. The main objective of the Øresund Experiment (Gryning, 1985) was to obtain a comprehensive data set suitable for verifying mesoscale meteorological and dispersion models in a coastal environment. Furthermore, it was a project goal to make these data available for general use. Hence, {{the establishment of a}} data bank for the experiment was included in the project. The final version of the data bank was released in 1987 (Mortensen, 1987) and was the first version to be available to scientists and institutions 'outside' the Øresund experiment. It consists of a magnetic tape containing the full set of quality controlled and documented data of the experiment. The experiment took place in the period May 15 to June 14, 1984. A special intensive measuring program was carried out from June 4 - 10. The experiment was a joint effort of 15 institutions situated in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) as well as in Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands: Risø National Laboratory (DK); Air Pollution Laboratory, Nat. Agency of Environmental Protection (DK); Danish Meteorological Institute (DK); Finnish Meteorological Institute (FI); Institute of Marine Research (FI); Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NO); Department of Meteorology, University of Uppsala (SE); Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SE); Chalmers University of Technology (SE); National Defense Research Institute (SE); Studsvik Energiteknik AB (SE); Studiecentrum voor Kernenergie (BE); Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (DE); Vrije Universiteit (NL). In addition, the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University of <b>Denmark</b> (<b>DK)</b> contributed measurements to the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The SOAP track aims at {{bringing}} together researchers and practitioners having the common objective of transforming Service-Oriented Programming (SOP) into a mature discipline with both solid scientific foundations and mature software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated tools. From the foundational point of view, many attempts to use formal methods for specification and verification {{in this setting}} have been made. Session correlation, service types, contract theories, and communication patterns {{are only a few}} examples of the aspects that have been investigated. Moreover, several formal models based upon automata, Petri nets and algebraic approaches have been developed. However, most of these approaches concentrate only on a few features of service-oriented systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach is still lacking. From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many levels. Among others, at the system design level, both traditional approaches based on UML and approaches taking inspiration from Business Process Modelling, e. g. BPMN, are used. At the composition level, orchestration and choreography are continuously being improved both formally and practically, with an evident need for their integration in the development process. At the description and discovery level, there are two separate communities pushing respectively the semantic approach (like ontologies and OWL) and the syntactic one (like WSDL). In particular, the role of discovery engines and protocols is not clear. In this respect, adopted standards are still missing. UDDI looked to be a good candidate, but it is no longer pushed by the main corporations, and its wide adoption seems difficult. Furthermore, a recent implementation platform, the so-called REST services, is emerging and competing with classic Web Services. Finally, features like Quality of Service, security, and dependability need to be taken seriously into account. SOAP in particular encouraged submissions on what SOP still needs in order to achieve the above goals.
