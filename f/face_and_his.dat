5|$|His next {{opponent}} was unbeaten West Ham-based fighter Kevin Lear on 1 June 2002, {{again in}} Manchester, on the undercard of the Ricky Hatton vs. Eamonn Magee fight. Lear, a former Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp jab {{from the outset}} of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.|$|E
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|Texian {{survivors}} of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection {{was an act of}} piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a pyre.|$|E

5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot down near Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, Mölders asked {{to shake hands with}} the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been killed in action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|E
25|$|On 22 October 1944 Bellamy's troop {{was part}} of a screen for {{infantry}} advancing near Doornhoek in the south of the Netherlands when it came under small arms, mortar and artillery fire. He engaged the enemy posts, eventually taking out three, and assisted the infantry in getting forward. Machine gun bullets struck his tank and caused molten lead to splatter in his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> tank entered a minefield and nearly ran over a mine. A jerry can of petrol spilt and set his bedding on fire, but he managed to get his burning tank and crew to safety. His beret was later found to have two bullet holes in it. For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross, which was personally presented to him by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in a ceremony on 5 March 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} the jump was to revitalize his feud with Negro Casas. El Hijo del Santo lost a match to Casas at the CMLL 63rd Anniversary show on September 20, 1996 and took a brief hiatus. While gone, Negro Casas turned técnico (<b>face)</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> former allies, Scorpio, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje said they had a {{surprise}} for Casas. The set-up was a trios match with Negro Casas, El Dandy and Héctor Garza on the técnico side with Scorpio, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje on the rudo (or heel) side. El Hijo del Santo {{came down to the}} ring with Scorpio and Salvaje but was wearing a disguise and pretending to be El Felino, the brother of Negro Casas. During the match, Scorpio and Salvaje began attacking Casas and the fans, unaware of the ruse, expected El Felino to save his brother from the beating. Once he entered the ring, El Hijo del Santo removed the disguise and revealed himself as Scorpio and Salvaje's partner, thus turning rudo {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

500|$|Roper {{was asked}} to {{demonstrate}} his 'self propeller' at the Charles River velodrome, a banked concrete bicycle racing track, where he first paced the racing cyclists, then raced professional rider Nat Butler, easily outpacing the bicyclists with timed laps at around 30mph (120.2sec/mile on the 1/3mile track). He was then encouraged to give a demonstration of maximum speed, and was timed at over 40mph, when a 'sudden pallor' was seen on his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> machine wobbled to a stop, Roper falling off his cycle. [...] He died at the track-side with his son Charles, of 'natural causes', at age 72.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{depictions of}} the Battle of Issus are few. Battle of Issus, a fresco by Philoxenus of Eretria, is {{probably}} the first such. It was painted sometime around 310BC for Cassander (c. 350–297BC), {{who was one of}} Alexander the Great's successors. Alexander and Darius – each within a lance's length of the other – are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers. While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence, fear is etched in Darius' <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> charioteer has already turned to rein his horses and escape. Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder claimed that Philoxenus' portrayal of the battle was [...] "inferior to none". Some modern critics posit that Battle of Issus might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece, she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the Temple of Peace during the time of Vespasian.|$|E

Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood stated that Braeden [...] "is known in the industry as the biggest daytime leading man of all time". In 1993, Nancy Reichardt of The Los Angeles Times stated: [...] "Victor Newman is one of those characters. When Eric Braeden first came on the show in the role, Victor was a villain, and what a villain! His portrayal proved so dynamic that this [...] "minor" [...] plot point has been ignored over the years. Today, Braeden is one of the show's leading men.

500|$|The rioters removed Blakelock's {{protective}} helmet, {{which was}} never found. Rose {{writes that the}} pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in Blakelock's overalls, and 40 cutting or stabbing injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a machete, sword or axe-type instrument. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt. His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on. His hands and arms were badly cut, and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stab wounds on his back, one {{on the back of}} his right thigh, six on his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> jawbone had been smashed by a blow that left a six-inch gash across the right side of his head. Bowen said the force of this blow had been [...] "almost as if to sever his head," [...] which gave rise to a rumour that an attempt had been made to decapitate him (according to Rose, the autopsy photographs did not support this).|$|E
500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring it down to a [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E

"Your {{favourite}} Awkward Davies can {{be positively}} dogged, if crossed {{by a new}} hand: but in a boarding-party, or storming a shore-position, he is worth his weight in gold, heavy though he is. His huge bulk, his terrifying strength and activity, the awful pallor of his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> way of foaming at the mouth when he is stirred, all make him a most dreadful opponent. What Stephen calls his berserker rage fairly clears the enemy's decks before him. He also howls.

While Jay is fixing the broken doorbell (which repeatedly rings), Manny thinks it is a demon and gets his fencing sword. Jay promises Gloria (Sofía Vergara) his fear will only last a while, although he realizes {{they have to do}} something when Manny begins sleeping in their bed. He asks Ben to come for a visit to show Manny how likable he is so he will not be scared anymore. When Ben arrives, he knocks on the window since the doorbell does not work. Manny sees him, and when Ben sees him he says [...] "Are you Manny? I'm here for you." [...] Due to the lighting on his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> fake machete, Manny becomes especially frightened of him and rushes upstairs, much to Jay's disbelief.|$|E
