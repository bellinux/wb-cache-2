25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and <b>Emerging</b> <b>Diseases</b> at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that {{a huge number of}} badgers would have to be killed to make a difference and while it is cheap and easy to exterminate animals {{in the early days of}} a cull it gets harder and more expensive as time goes on.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{potential}} {{explanations for}} amphibian declines have been proposed. [...] Most {{or all of}} these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibian declines are well understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians. [...] These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introduced predators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, pesticide use, or over-harvesting. However, many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the above effects are not likely to occur. [...] The causes of these declines are complex, but many can be attributed to <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases,</b> climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, or long-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} H5N1 {{vaccines}} for {{several of the}} avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and <b>Emerging</b> <b>Diseases</b> graduate program at Georgetown University has made this point, [...] "There is no H5N1 pandemic so {{there can be no}} pandemic vaccine". However, [...] "pre-pandemic vaccines" [...] have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic. Vaccine manufacturing companies are being encouraged to increase capacity so that if a pandemic vaccine is needed, facilities will be available for rapid production of large amounts of a vaccine specific to a new pandemic strain.|$|E

40|$|Chytridiomycosis, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is an <b>emerging</b> infectious <b>disease</b> implicated in declines of amphibian populations around the globe. An <b>emerging</b> infectious <b>disease</b> {{is one that has}} recently been discovered; has recently increased in incidence, geography, or host range; or is newly evolved. For any given outbreak of an <b>emerging</b> <b>disease,</b> it is therefore possible to state two hypotheses regarding its origin. The novel pathogen hypothesis states that the disease has recently spread into new geographic areas, whereas the endemic pathogen hypothesis suggests that it has been present in the environment but recently has increased in host range or pathogenicity. Distinguishing between these hypotheses is important, because the conservation measures needed to slow or stop the spread of a novel pathogen are likely to differ from those needed to prevent outbreaks of an endemic pathogen. Population genetics may help discriminate among the possible origins of an <b>emerging</b> <b>disease.</b> Current evidence suggests chytridiomycosis may be a novel pathogen being spread worldwide by carriers; until we know how much genetic variation to expect in an endemic strain, however, we cannot yet conclude that B. dendrobatidis is a novel pathogen.
