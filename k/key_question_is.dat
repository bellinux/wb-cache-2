5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how closely related the parent species are.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{factor for}} {{classifying}} the par {{of a relatively}} straight, hazard-free hole is {{the distance from the}} tee to the green. A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225–434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over [...] These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway. However, other considerations must be taken into account; the <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> [...] "how many strokes would a scratch golfer take to make the green by playing along the fairway?". The grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground. Sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to [...] "lay up" [...] on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot. These design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole, irrespective of total distance from tee to green, and must be included in a determination of par. However, a par score never includes [...] "expected" [...] penalty strokes, as a scratch player is never [...] "expected" [...] to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation. So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the legal}} {{developments}} in the UK, the test for apparent bias in Singapore was extensively reconsidered by the High Court in the 2005 case Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board. On {{the facts of the}} case, it was unnecessary for Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang to have decided definitively whether the correct test was the reasonable suspicion or the real likelihood test. Nonetheless, he expressed the obiter view that the [...] "reasonable suspicion of bias" [...] test established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and Tang Liang Hong was not significantly different from the English [...] "real likelihood of bias" [...] test (also known as [...] "real possibility of bias" [...] test). According to him, [...] "he common substance of both tests appears, in a nutshell, to be this: The <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{whether or not there was}} a perception on the part of a reasonable person that there would be a real likelihood of bias". The concept of [...] "likelihood" [...] entails [...] "possibility" [...] and not [...] "probability". Phang opined that this is simply another way of stating that there is a [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] on the part of the person concerned, meaning that although the concept of [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] is supposed to be of a less stringent standard, this standard is reflected in the concept of [...] "possibility" [...] and thus there is essentially no substantial difference in the two tests. In addition, the word real in the term real likelihood of bias cannot mean [...] "actual", as the test after all pertains to apparent bias and not actual bias.|$|E
2500|$|A person coming {{before a}} {{domestic}} tribunal has no inherent right at common law {{to be allowed}} legal representation. If a person is permitted to engage legal counsel but chooses not to, he or she cannot subsequently allege that the rules of natural justice have been breached {{because he or she}} is unable to mount an effective defence. The <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether the individual concerned was given the opportunity to present his or her case and whether he or she suffered prejudice due to any unfairness in way the proceedings were conducted. In Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council (2008), the appellant, a doctor, appealed against the respondent's decision to fine and suspend him for professional misconduct. During the disciplinary proceedings against the appellant before the Council, he had not availed himself of legal counsel. One of the main issues raised was whether natural justice had been breached because the appellant had declined to cross-examine the respondent's key witness but the respondent's disciplinary committee had failed to warn him of the [...] "legal implications" [...] of this, and since the disciplinary committee had failed to ensure that the appellant appreciated the importance of making a mitigation plea. Legal commentators have rephrased the issue as whether the absence of cross-examination renders the decision unfair in all the circumstances. Judge of Appeal V.K. Rajah held that [...] "dditional duties are not foisted on a tribunal merely because the individual is unrepresented – advising a person who has been charged of his litigation strategies and options is the duty of an advocate and solicitor, not the adjudicator". Consequently, there had been no breach of the rules of natural justice as the appellant had been given the opportunity to present his case and cross-examine the witnesses, and had also been invited to make a mitigation plea.|$|E
