Guanidine Hydrochloride also has the ability to {{decrease}} enzyme activity and increase the solubility of hydrophobic molecules. At high concentrations of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> (e.g., 6 M), proteins lose their ordered structure, and they tend to become randomly coiled, i.e. they do not contain any residual structure. However, at concentrations in the millimolar range in vivo, <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> has been shown to [...] "cure" [...] prion positive cells (i.e. cells exhibiting a prion positive phenotype revert to a prion negative phenotype). This is the result of inhibition of the Hsp104 chaperone protein known {{to play an important role}} in prion fiber fragmentation and propagation.|$|E

Guanidinium thiocyanate is also used for its denaturing effect on various biological samples. Guanidine hydrochloride is used as an adjuvant in treatment of botulism, introduced in 1968, but now its role is considered controversial - because in some patients there was no improvement after this drug administration.|$|E
50|$|Proteinase K is also stable {{over a wide}} pH range (4-12), with a pH optimum of pH 8.0.An {{elevation}} of the reaction temperature from 37 °C to 50-60 °C may increase the activity several times, like the addition of 0.5-1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or <b>Guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> (3 M), Guanidinium thiocyanate (1 M) and urea (4 M). The above-mentioned conditions enhance proteinase K activity by making its substrate cleavage sites more accessible. Temperatures above 65 °C, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or the serine protease-inhibitors AEBSF, PMSF or DFP inhibit the activity. Proteinase K will not be inhibited by <b>Guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> Guanidinium thiocyanate, urea, Sarkosyl, Triton X-100, Tween 20, SDS, citrate, iodoacetic acid, EDTA or by other serine protease inhibitors like Nα-Tosyl-Lys Chloromethyl Ketone (TLCK) and Nα-Tosyl-Phe Chloromethyl Ketone (TPCK).|$|E

5000|$|Streptavidin [...] is a 52.8 kDa protein {{purified}} {{from the}} bacterium Streptomyces avidinii. Streptavidin homo-tetramers have an extraordinarily high affinity for biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H). With a dissociation constant (Kd) {{on the order}} of ≈10−14 mol/L, the binding of biotin to streptavidin is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known in nature. Streptavidin is used extensively in molecular biology and bionanotechnology due to the streptavidin-biotin complex's resistance to organic solvents, denaturants (e.g. <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride),</b> detergents (e.g. SDS, Triton), proteolytic enzymes, and extremes of temperature and pH.|$|E
50|$|DTT is {{frequently}} {{used to reduce}} the disulfide bonds of proteins and, more generally, to prevent intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds from forming between cysteine residues of proteins. However, even DTT cannot reduce buried (solvent-inaccessible) disulfide bonds, so reduction of disulfide bonds is sometimes carried out under denaturing conditions (e.g., at high temperatures, or {{in the presence of}} a strong denaturant such as 6 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> 8 M urea, or 1% sodium dodecylsulfate). DTT is oftentimes used along with sodium dodecylsulfate in SDS-PAGE to further denature proteins by reducing their disulfide bonds to allow for better separation of proteins during electrophoresis. Conversely, the solvent exposure of different disulfide bonds can be assayed by their rate of reduction in the presence of DTT.|$|E
50|$|In {{a two-state}} system, folding and {{unfolding}} rates dominate the observed relaxation rates below {{and above the}} denaturation midpoint (Cm). This {{gives rise to the}} terminology of folding and unfolding arms for the limbs of the chevron. A priori information on the Cm of a protein can be obtained from equilibrium experiments. In fitting to a two-state model, the logarithm of the folding and unfolding rates is assumed to depend linearly on the denaturant concentration, thus resulting in the slopes mf and mu, called the folding and unfolding m-values, respectively (also called the kinetic m-values). The sum of the two rates is the observed relaxation rate. An agreement between equilibrium m-value and the absolute sum of the kinetic m-values is typically seen as a signature for two-state behavior. Most of the reported denaturation experiments have been carried out at 298 K with either urea or <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> (GuHCl) as denaturants.|$|E
50|$|The far-UV (ultraviolet) CD {{spectrum}} of proteins can reveal important characteristics of their secondary structure. CD spectra {{can be readily}} used to estimate the fraction of a molecule {{that is in the}} alpha-helix conformation, the beta-sheet conformation, the beta-turn conformation, or some other (e.g. random coil) conformation. These fractional assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature or of the concentration of denaturing agents, e.g. <b>Guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> or urea. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Also, {{there are a number of}} other uses for CD spectroscopy in protein chemistry not related to alpha-helix fraction estimation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{unfolding}} and refolding of apohorseradish peroxidase, as {{a function}} of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration, were monitored by the intrinsic fluorescence intensity, polarization, and lifetime of the single tryptophan residue. The unfolding was reversible and characterized by at least three distinct stages—the intensity and lifetime data, for example, were both characterized by an initial increase followed by a decrease and then a plateau region. The lifetime data, in the absence and presence of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> were heterogeneous and fit best to a model consisting of a major Gaussian distribution component and a minor, short discrete component. The observed increase in intensity in the initial stage of the unfolding process is attributed to the conversion of this short component into the longer, distributed component as the <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration increases. Our results clarify and amplify previous studies on the unfolding of apohorseradish peroxidase by <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride...</b>|$|E
40|$|More than 30 years ago, Nozaki and Tanford {{reported}} that the pK values for several amino acids and simple substances in 6 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> differed little from the corresponding values in low salt (Nozaki, Y., and C. Tanford. 1967. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89 : 736 - 742). This puzzling and counter-intuitive result hinders attempts to understand and predict the proton uptake/release behavior of proteins in <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions, behavior which may determine whether the DeltaG(N-D) values obtained from guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation data can actually be interpreted as the Gibbs energy difference between the native and denatured states (Bolen, D. W., and M. Yang. 2000. Biochemistry. 39 : 15208 - 15216). We show in this work that the Nozaki-Tanford result {{can be traced back}} to the fact that glass-electrode pH meter readings in water/guanidinium chloride do not equal true pH values. We determine the correction factors required to convert pH meter readings in water/guanidinium chloride into true pH values and show that, when these corrections are applied, the effect of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> on the pK values of simple substances is found to be significant and similar to that of NaCl. The results reported here allow us to propose plausible <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration dependencies for the pK values of carboxylic acids in proteins and, on their basis, to reproduce qualitatively the proton uptake/release behavior for the native and denatured states of several proteins (ribonuclease A, alpha-chymotrypsin, staphylococcal nuclease) in <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions. Finally, the implications of the pH correction for the experimental characterization of protein folding energetics are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant pig {{growth hormone}} (rPGH) was solubilized from {{inclusion}} bodies {{by using the}} cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC). The solubilizing action of CTAC appeared {{to be dependent on}} the presence of a positively charged head group, as a non-charged variant was inactive. Relatively low concentrations of CTAC were required for rapid solubilization, and protein-bound CTAC was easily removed by ion-exchange chromatography. Compared with solubilization and recovery of rPGH from inclusion bodies with 7. 5 M-urea and 6 M-guanidinium chloride, the relative efficiency of solubilization was lower with CTAC. However, superior refolding efficiency resulted in final yields of purified rPGH being in the order of CTAC greater than urea {{greater than or equal to}} <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Detailed comparison of the different rPGH preparations as well as pituitary-derived growth hormone by h. p. l. c., native PAGE, c. d. spectral analysis and radioreceptor-binding assay showed that the CTAC-derived rPGH was essentially indistinguishable from the urea and <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> preparations. The CTAC-derived rPGH was of greater biopotency than pituitary-derived growth hormone. The advantages of CTAC over urea and <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> for increasing recovery of monomeric rPGH by minimizing aggregation during refolding in vitro were also found with recombinant sheep interleukin-I beta and a sheep insulin-like growth factor II fusion protein. In addition, the bioactivity of the CTAC-derived recombinant interleukin- 1 beta was approximately ten-fold greater than that of an equivalent amount obtained from urea and <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> preparations. It is concluded that CTAC represents, in general, an excellent additional approach or a superior alternative to urea and in particular <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> for solubilization and recovery of bioactive recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies...|$|E

Simultaneously, many collagen fibrils were disaggregated into component microfibrils (approximately 40 A thick). In contrast to the above solvents, exhaustive extraction with 0. 5 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> removed 20 % of the proteoglycan complex, and matrix granules were reduced in size but not in number.

To perturb the tetrameric structure of yeast phosphoglycerate mutase we have prepared a mutant enzyme in which Lys- 168 in the subunit-contact region {{has been replaced by}} proline. The K 168 P mutant enzyme undergoes dissociation to dimers at low concentrations; thus on lowering the concentration from 200 micrograms/ml to 5 micrograms/ml the proportion of tetramer falls from 85 % to 53 %.

40|$|In vitro {{refolding}} of pig mitochondrial {{malate dehydrogenase}} is investigated {{in the presence}} of Escherichia coli chaperonins cpn 60 (groEL) and cpn 10 (groES). When the enzyme is initially denatured with 3 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> chaperonin-assisted refolding is 100 % efficient. C. d. spectroscopy reveals that malate dehydrogenase is almost unfolded in 3 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> suggesting that a state with little or no residual secondary structure is the optimal 'substrate' for chaperonin-assisted refolding. Malate dehydrogenase denatured to more highly structured states proves to refold less efficiently with chaperonin assistance. The enzyme is shown not to aggregate under the refolding conditions, so that losses in refolding efficiency result from irreversible misfolding. Evidence is advanced to suggest that the chaperonins are unable to rescue irreversibly misfolded malate dehydrogenase. A novel use is made of 100 K Centricon concentrators to study the binding of [14 C]acetyl-labelled malate dehydrogenase to groEL by an ultrafiltration binding assay. Analysis of the data by Scatchard plot shows that acetyl-malate dehydrogenase, which has previously been extensively unfolded with <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> binds to groEL at a specific binding site(s).

The {{amounts of the}} 148 kDa cartilage protein in 4 M-guanidinium chloride extracts and in subsequent trypsin digests of the extraction residues were determined by radioimmunoassay. Surprisingly, the 148 kDa-protein antigenicity was not changed by tryptic digestion, even though the protein was extensively degraded. The amount of the 148 kDa protein increased dramatically with age, both in the <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> extract and in the subsequent tryptic digest, and reached maximal values at about 3 and 8 years respectively. The increase of the guanidinium chloride-soluble pool preceded that of the trypsin-digestible pool, possibly indicating a metabolic relationship.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interhelical salt bridges {{are common}} in leucine zippers and are thought to {{stabilize}} the coiled coil conformation. Here we present a detailed thermodynamic investigation of the designed, disulfide-linked leucine zipper ABSS whose high-resolution NMR structure shows six interhelical ion pairs between heptad positions g of one helix and e ′ of the other helix but no ion pairing within single helices. The average pKa value of the Glu side chain carboxyl groups of ABSS is slightly higher than the pKa of a freely accessible Glu in an unfolded peptide [Marti, D. N., Jelesarov, I., and Bosshard, H. R. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 12804 - 12818]. This indicates that the salt bridges are destabilizing, a prediction we now have confirmed by determining the pH-stability profile of ABSS. Circular dichroism-monitored unfolding by urea and by heating and differential scanning calorimetry show that the coiled coil conformation is 5 kJ/mol more stable when salt bridges are broken by protonation of the carboxyl side chains. Using <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> as the denaturant, {{the increase in the}} free energy of unfolding on protonation of the carboxyl side chains is larger, 17 kJ/mol.

In this work, a comparative study was carried out on refolding of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in the presence of different {{concentrations of}} urea, <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> or arginine. All three folding aids could inhibit the formation of insoluble aggregates of rhG-CSF but with different efficacies. A low concentration of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> was found to denature protein, so that rhG-CSF was not fully or correctly folded even if concentration was reduced to I M. Low concentration of urea (2 M) or arginine (0. 5 M) did not cause rhG-CSF denaturation, but urea was unable to suppress the formation of soluble oligomers, which persisted at a level of about 30 % in refolded soluble rhG-CSF. Arginine, in contrast, could inhibit formation of all soluble oligomers. Based on these phenomena, we tested rhG-CSF folding in a mixture of 2 M urea and 0. 5 M arginine. Kinetic analysis indicated that urea aided in suppressing insoluble precipitates, while arginine prevented formation of soluble oligomers produced by hydrophobic interaction. With this combination system, the refolding yield of rhG-CSF could be increased 2 -fold. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Betaine had practically {{no effect on the}} rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction up to a concentration of 1. 2 M. However, quantitatively the rate change per molar concentration of osmolyte (or Gdn. Cl) was significantly larger for AAPR that has a polar and cationic reactive site residue than the two substrates (AAPL and AAPF) that have non-polar reactive site residues. These results suggest that the chemical nature of the substrate (and presumably the active site of the enzyme) {{plays an important role in}} determining the effect of osmolytes in enzyme catalyzed reactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{refolding}} of Clostridium symbiosum {{glutamate dehydrogenase}} (GDH) involves {{the formation of}} an inactive structured monomeric intermediate prior to its concentration-dependent association. The structured monomer obtained after removal of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> was stable and competent for reconstitution into active hexamers. Site-directed mutagenesis of C. symbiosum gdh gene was performed to replace the residues Arg- 61 and Phe- 187 which are involved in subunit-subunit interactions, as determined by three- dimensional structure analysis. Heterologous over-expression in Escherichia coli of the double mutant (R 61 E/F 187 D) led to the production of a soluble protein with a molecular mass consistent with the monomeric form of clostridial GDH. This protein is catalytically inactive but cross-reacts with an anti-wild-type GDH antibody preparation. The double mutant R 61 E/F 187 D does not assemble into hexamers. The physical properties and the stability toward <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> and urea of R 61 E/F 187 D were studied and compared to those of the structured monomeric intermediate...|$|E
40|$|The zymogen of the vacuolar {{carboxypeptidase}} Y from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified and characterized {{with respect}} to activation as well as refolding in vitro. The purified procarboxypeptidase Y has no detectable activity but can be efficiently activated by proteinase K from Tritirachium album. We used this method of activation {{as a tool for}} the investigation of refolding procarboxypeptidase Y in vitro. The proenzyme, denatured in 6 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> is renatured efficiently after dilution of the denaturant, whereas the mature enzyme regains little activity in the same procedure. Changes in intrinsic fluorescence reveal the mature enzyme to be considerably more stable than the proenzyme toward denaturation with <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride.</b> This suggests that the propeptide induces a metastable structure important for overcoming energy barriers that might otherwise obstruct a productive folding pathway. The relatively large number of charged amino acid residues and a high theoretical potential for alpha-helix formation in the carboxypeptidase Y propeptide suggest a structural similarity to a number of other propeptides and heat shock proteins...|$|E
40|$|The far-ultraviolet region {{circular}} dichroic spectrumof serine hydroxymethyltransferase from monkey liver {{showed that}} the protein is in an α-helical conformation. The near ultraviolet circular dichoric spectrum revealed two negative bands originating from the tertiary conformational environment of the aromatic amino acid residues. Addition of urea or <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> perturbed the characteristic fluorescence and far ultraviolet circular dichroic spectrum of the enzyme. The decrease in (θ) 222 and enzyme activity followed identical patterns with increasing concentrations of urea, whereas with <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> the loss of enzyme activity preceded the loss of secondary structure. 2 -Chloroethanol, trifluoroethanol and sodium dodecyl sulphate enhanced the mean residue ellipticity values. In addition, sodium dodecyl sulphate also caused a perturbation of the fluorescence emission spectrum of the enzyme. Extremes of pH decreased the – (θ) 222 value. Plots of –(θ) 222 and enzyme activity {{as a function of}} pH showed maximal values at pH 7. 4 - 7. 5. These results suggested the prevalence of "conformational flexibility" in the structure of serine hydroxymethyltransferase...|$|E
40|$|Three cations {{of varying}} size and charge density, egg-white lysozyme, {{protamine}} and ruthenium red, {{were used to}} stain the extracellular matrix of epiphyseal cartilage growth plate. With these stains, {{it was possible to}} distinguish three types of proteoglycans or materials associated with them, which may well have as their major differences the type of cross linking to the tissue. One type was stained by ruthenium red and protamine but not by lysozyme, was extractable with 3 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> and was relatively uniformly dispersed throughout the matrix of the growth plate. The other two types were stained by all three cations, were not extractable with 3 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride</b> and were intimately associated with fibrils. One of these was found on the collagen fibrils, was relatively scanty in the resting zone near the articular surface, relatively restricted to the extralacunar area in the columnar zones and appeared to diminish in amount in the hypertrophic zone. This material often had a 640 -Å periodic array on the surface of collagen fibrils. The third type also was stained by all three cations and was not extractable with 3 M <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride.</b> It was distinguished from the other class of lysozyme-reactive matrix components by the larger volume of distribution occupied by the stained material. It also had a different distribution in that it was widely dispersed in the resting zone, was restricted to the lacuna in the columnar zone and was absent in the hypertrophic zone. Thus, cartilage matrix as well as the chondrocytes undergo differentiation in the epiphyseal growth plate...|$|E

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the eluate revealed the major peak to be a glycoprotein with a relative mass of 64, 000. This glycoprotein (HCMVgp 64) {{was characterized by}} amino acid analysis and a high-pressure liquid chromatographic map of its tryptic peptides...|$|E
40|$|Endoproteinase Glu-C (EPGIu-C, EC 3. 4. 21. 19), {{an enzyme}} {{isolated}} from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, {{has been found to}} cleave specifically at the carboxyl-terminal side of glutamyl and aspartyl peptide bonds. EPGIu-C has been reported to be stable and active in the presence of common denaturants such as <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate (Drapeau, G. R. (1977) Methods in Enzymology, 47 : 189 - 191). In order assess the denaturant stability and activity of EPGIu-C, the effect of three common protein denaturants, <b>guanidinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> urea, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on the proteolytic activity of EPGIu-C was studied. The kinetics of the hydrolyis reaction catalyzed by EPGIu-C was determined using the chromophoric substrate N-tBOC-L-glutamic acid-a-phenyl ester (BGPE). To compare theurea is significantly greater at the higher concentrations of urea. These results suggest that a complete cleavage of proteins substrate by EPGlu-C might occur more rapidly in 8. 0 M urea than in 6. 0 M GuCl, since EPGlu-C will be operating at a significantly higher catalytic efficiency in the urea solution.
