40|$|The RID assay {{is one of}} the {{in vitro}} methods used for in-process control in the {{production}} of rabies vaccines for veterinary use. It {{has been shown to be}} very useful for determining antigen concentration in the <b>final</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>product.</b> The work presented in this paper, including the production and standardization of candidate standard reagents for use in the Radial Immunodiffusion Assay (RID) was carried out at the Pan American Institute for Food Protection and Zoonoses (INPPAZ/PAHO/WHO). The study was completed with the cooperation of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, National University of La Plata (NULP), Argentina, where the validation of the proposed standards and the quality control of samples from 28 different batches of rabies vaccines produced with Pasteur strain rabies virus (PV) in BHK cells were performed. The activity of the vaccines was determined by in vivo (NIH) and in vitro (RID) assays. The results of the candidate reagents for the reagent standardization tests showed stability, sensitivity and reproducibility. The Relative Potency the 1. 2 between the problem vaccines and the reference vaccine was estimated by variance and regression analysis. The results of our validation study show that the INPPAZ (PAHO/WHO) is capable of producing and distributing the above-mentioned standard reagents, as well as of providing support for the incorporation of the RID technique (sensitive, rapid and inexpensive) to the laboratories that manufacture rabies vaccines in Latin America and the Caribbean.

40|$|In food {{processing}} plants, raw materials are {{fed into the}} system in different supply-lots of product, and are processed through different stages. In these stages, raw or intermediate materials are mixed or combined together, and physico-chemical and/or microbiological processes such as heating, concentration, pasteurisation etc. take place. In this setting, traceability consists {{of the ability to}} determine for each portion of intermediate or final product, in any part of the plant, its relative composition in terms of supply-lots fed into the system as well as of new lots generated during the production process. Traceability becomes particularly difficult in the very common case when <b>bulk</b> <b>products,</b> such as liquids or grains, are involved in the production chain. Current traceability practices are in most cases unable to directly deal with <b>bulk</b> <b>products,</b> and typically resort to the definition of very large lots to compensate the lack of knowledge about lot composition. As demonstrated in recent food crises, this over-bounding approach has weaknesses in clearly identifying, immediately after risk assessment, the affected product lots, leading to unavoidably wide, expensive and highly impacting recalls. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a novel approach to manage traceability of <b>bulk</b> <b>products</b> during production, storage and delivery. It provides a tight definition of lots in terms of their composition and size, thus allowing strict control of the production and supply chain...|$|R

30|$|Current {{harmonized}} guidance {{dictates that}} the hold times for drug substance intermediates, <b>product</b> intermediates, and <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> are systematically established, {{but does not}} fully address the specific requirements for the bulk hold time stability study. The reason for this lack of flexibility is that the guidance definition of the date of manufacture is “the date when active ingredients are combined with other ingredients” for shelf life derivation. However, alternative methods of shelf life can be derived using “the date of stable intermediate being further processed for downstream process” instead of the date of manufacture. To be able to establish an alternative shelf life, stability studies that can establish sequential bulk hold times for drug substance intermediates, product intermediates, as well as <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> are required. This can be achieved during the development phase encompassing Phase I-III IND/CTA and NDA/WMA filing and the derived alternative shelf life methodology made applicable for later bulk manufacturing process.|$|R
