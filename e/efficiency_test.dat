500|$|After riders {{board the}} sim-cars and the seat belts are fastened, {{the car that}} they {{designed}} will undergo four different tests: capability, efficiency, responsiveness, and power. In the capability test the car first connects to OnStar, then accelerates past a rain projection and skids out of control. Next, the continuing path disappears and the sim-car turns around to speed up again. A short time later, the sim-car makes a sharp left turn as a lighting bolt strikes. The car then passes by a futuristic city. Following the capability test, the results of which car designs scored {{the best in the}} test are displayed. The sim-car then begins the <b>efficiency</b> <b>test.</b> In the first part, the sim-cars are scanned for [...] "optimum eco-efficiency". The second test performs an aero-dynamic test on the vehicle. Finally, a [...] "hyper-spectrum imaging" [...] takes place. Again, after the test is complete, the best scores are displayed. The third test, responsiveness, is next. The sim-car accelerates around hairpin turns with laser-projected trees. It then enters a tunnel to encounter the 18-wheeler from the original version though it is now shown with lasers. When the vehicle exits the tunnel, the results for the responsiveness test are displayed and all of the test icons are displayed. The final test is power where the sim-car stops for a moment then accelerates through flashing purple arches to a wall with the ride's logo on it leading to the outside portion of the ride. Just after the ride exits the building, a picture of the guests is taken. As the sim-car's speed is increased, it makes a right turn, followed by a wide left, a straight section, and one final long left turn. When the test is complete, the vehicle returns to the loading station where the next riders board. Then, guests use their MagicBand, ticket, or design key that has their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle that they made in the Design Studio to play games and make an ad in the [...] "Chevrolet Showroom." [...] In the showroom, you can also check out some of the newest vehicles Chevrolet has created in their lineup. There is also a gift shop located at the exit like the original version of the ride.|$|E

50|$|The {{story was}} based on 45 letters stolen from Brown's office that spelled out Brown's {{collusion}} with Thomson-Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson-Houston {{on the topic of}} acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an <b>efficiency</b> <b>test.</b> They also showed that Brown had received $5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson-Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti-AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of Missouri (at the company's expense), Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, PA, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.|$|E
50|$|Also in March, Superintendent of Prisons Austin Lathrop asked Brown if {{he could}} supply the {{equipment}} needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment. The state would not pay up front and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson-Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind-the-scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently {{with the help of}} the Edison company and Westinghouses chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston. Thomson-Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson-Houston AC generators and Edison Electric probably put up the money to acquire them for Brown. Thomson-Houston president Charles Coffin had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his companys equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public <b>efficiency</b> <b>test</b> to show that Westinghouses sales claim of manufacturing 50% more efficient generators was false.|$|E

The P1 was originally created for a car maker company by the name of Jacob Lohner. Ludwig Lohner, the owner of Jacob Lohner became convinced after seeing Ferdinand Porsche that the age of horse and carriage was over, requested Ferdinand Porsche to create an electric drive train. On June 26, 1898, the P1 officially rolled out to the streets of Vienna, Austria. On September 28, 1899, Ferdinand Porsche entered the Berlin road race with the P1, where it won the gold medal and crossed the finish line 18 minutes before the second car did. With such shocking results from the P1, it had also won another title where the P1 came out on top in the <b>efficiency</b> <b>test,</b> where it is recorded as the lowest energy consumption vehicle in urban traffic.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of thermoelectrics (TE) for energy conversion {{is in the}} transition phase from laboratory research to device development. There is an increasing demand to accurately determine the module efficiency, especially for the power generation mode. For many TE, the figure of merit, ZT, of the material sometimes cannot be fully realized at the device level. Reliable <b>efficiency</b> <b>testing</b> of thermoelectric modules is important to assess the device ZT and provide end-users with realistic values for how much power can be generated under specific conditions. We conducted a general survey of <b>efficiency</b> <b>testing</b> devices and their performance. The results indicated a lack of industry standards and test procedures. This study included a commercial test system and several laboratory systems. Most systems {{are based on the}} heat flow meter method, and some are based on the Harman method. They are usually reproducible in evaluating thermoelectric modules. However, different systems often showed large differences that are likely caused by uncertain heat loss and thermal resistance. <b>Efficiency</b> <b>testing</b> is an important capability for the thermoelectric community to improve.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} exact likelihood-based {{mean-variance}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests</b> {{of the market}} portfolio {{in the context of}} Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), allowing for a wide class of error distributions which include normality as a special case. These tests are developed in the framework of multivariate linear regressions (MLR). It is well known, however, that despite their simple statistical structure, standard asymptotically justified MLR-based tests are unreliable. In financial econometrics, exact tests have been proposed for a few specific hypotheses [Jobson and Korkie (Journal of Financial Economics, 1982), MacKinlay (Journal of Financial Economics, 1987), Gibbons, Ross and Shanken (Econometrica, 1989), Zhou (Journal of Finance, 1993) ], most of which depend on normality. For the gaussian model, our tests correspond to Gibbons, Ross and Shanken's mean-variance <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests.</b> In non-gaussian contexts, we reconsider mean-variance <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests</b> allowing for multivariate Student-t and gaussian mixture errors. Our framework allows to cast more evidence on whether the normality assumption is too restrictive when testing the CAPM. We also propose exact multivariate diagnostic checks (including tests for multivariate GARCH and multivariate generalization of the well-known variance ratio tests) and goodness of fit tests as well as a set estimate for the intervening nuisance parameters. Our results [over five-year subperiods] show the following: (i) multivariate normality is rejected in most subperiods, (ii) residual checks reveal no significant departures from the multivariate i. i. d. assumption, and (iii) mean-variance <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests</b> of the market portfolio are not rejected as frequently once they are allowed for the possibility of non-normal errors. capital asset pricing model, CAPM, mean-variance efficiency, nonnormality, multivariate linear regression, uniform linear hypothesis, exact test, Monte Carlo test, bootstrap, nuisance parameters, specification test, diagnostics, GARCH, variance ratio test...|$|R
