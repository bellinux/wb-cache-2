5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress in this area <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> clinical studies that either do not report {{the gender of the}} subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences.

Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E

5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

5|$|Vmax is {{only one}} of several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate.

5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set.

If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E
