The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't bad <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me {{on the edge of my}} seat waiting for the next crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E

'Unfortunately we {{ran into}} a serious bit of {{corruption}} {{with one of the}} funders and the script was never transformed into film,' Perry told Chappell, 'I recall telling [...] Fred Schepisi about this. He just laughed and said that sort of thing happened to him {{a couple of times a}} year. But it was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> decide to write another dozen books before looking at film again. I ended up writing another 24 books before returning to film, which I am now doing, but still as a secondary interest.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reports a}} 88% {{approval}} rating, based on 16 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Unholy Night" [...] {{makes up for}} its transitional storyline and unanswered questions with a welcome return to the grotesque and a standout scary performance from new cast member Ian McShane." [...] Chris Harnick of The Huffington Post stated he [...] "was a little bit disappointed with this episode." [...] He added, [...] " [...] McShane's acting was exceptional, but I wanted a little more progression to the 3,000 plots that are currently going on." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called [...] "Unholy Night" [...] "just good, sick fun," [...] adding, [...] "It seems a bit slight to call this episode a fun romp, seeing as how bloody and unhinged it was, but watching McShane chew up the set and slash at people with glass tree-toppers was just gruesome <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> giddy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Langford of AfterElton.com was {{conflicted}} by the storyline's beginning. He deemed {{himself a}} fan of the [...] "compelling" [...] Malick, and approved of him for providing black representation. Langford opined that Akingbola and Astill had chemistry, that the characters' scenes were [...] "intense and combustible," [...] and that the fight and following kiss were [...] "terrifically done, full of passion and heat and rage". However, he expressed concern that the same type of storyline had been attempted in soap operas on multiple occasions. Langford concluded: [...] "If the usual template is followed from here there will be weeks of denials and more fighting. I suspect that Malick and Dan will eventually embark on a secret affair, Chrissie will find out, there will be more denials and fighting and at some point Dan will accept who he is. Still, despite the tired storyline, the characters are complex and appealing and the writing is solid <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> overlook that." [...] A writer from TV Buzz said that [...] "Malick has already got an ego the size of the UK, but with his new role as Clinical Skills tutor and one of his pupils treating him like a hero, it's about to go global." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the negativity {{focused on}} the overuse of special effects, {{thinness}} of plot, and excessive use of clichés. Roger Ebert {{went so far as}} to say, [...] "The movie Ed Wood, about the worst director of all time, was made to prepare us for Stargate". Ebert awarded the film one out of four stars; and, even over ten years later, Stargate remained on his list of most hated films. Mike DiBella from Allmovie said, [...] "There simply isn't enough spectacle in Stargate to make up for its many flaws." [...] The film peaked at number one on the Billboard chart Top Video Rentals on April 29, 1995. However, the positive reviews stated that it was an [...] "instant camp classic" [...] and praised the film for its special effects and entertainment value, with Chris Hicks of the Deseret News calling it [...] "Star Wars meets Ben Hur". Scott McKenzie from DVDactive said, [...] "It's a shame because the world created around the Stargate is compelling and detailed. It's almost <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> want to watch the TV series, but not quite." [...] After the release of the movie, Emmerich and Devlin were sued by an Egyptology student, claiming he had written the story and given them the idea. The suit was later settled out of court.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony D. Langford of gay media website AfterElton.com {{was left}} {{undecided}} in his view, by the storyline's beginning. He opined that Astill and Akingbola had chemistry, that the characters' scenes were [...] "intense and combustible," [...] {{and that the}} fight and following kiss were terrifically acting, due {{to the amount of}} [...] "passion and heat and rage". However, he expressed concern that the same type of storyline had been attempted in soap operas on multiple occasions. He predicted that Dan would be in denial for week and cause fights with Malick. Langford concluded: [...] "I suspect that Malick and Dan will eventually embark on a secret affair, Chrissie will find out, there will be more denials and fighting and at some point Dan will accept who he is. Still, despite the tired storyline, the characters are complex and appealing and the writing is solid <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> overlook that." [...] Langford later said [...] "Dan isn’t a very likable character" [...] and is a [...] "complete jerk" [...] because of his sexuality issues. He also questioned Dan's medical skills, bemoaning it unrealistic that his [...] "unethical behavior" [...] has not been noticed within the hospital. He also admitted his confusion to why a [...] "self-assured guy like Malick" [...] would get involved with Dan. Though he praised Dan's revelation of his backstory. D Langford later said Dan's behaviour needed to be addressed because there was a danger the story would [...] "lose its integrity." ...|$|E
