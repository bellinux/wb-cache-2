It was intended to provide an expeditious solution to the difficulties that WTO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement. The number of WTO Members that have accepted the Protocol since its adoption in December 2005 is far fewer than the total required for the amendment to enter into force.

This Convention entered into force on 15 April 2015. Since {{this is an}} important instrument relating to liability and compensation for damages caused by a nuclear accident, we are interested in the Western Balkans perspective. The majority of the 	Western Balkans countries (Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Bulgaria, Republic of Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia, and Republic of Macedonia) are part of the international regime of nuclear liability that was established with the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage from 1963. None of them has deposited an instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval for the Convention on supplementary compensation for nuclear damage yet. This paper will try to give argumentation why the Western Balkans should, in future, become part of this new international nuclear liability regime. The new nuclear liability regime is the path to a global regime for dealing with civil liability and compensation for nuclear damage and, for what is more important, it is the way to accomplish that the citizens of both generating States and non-generating States will receive meaningful compensation for nuclear damage promptly with a minimum of litigation and other burdens...|$|E

An attempt {{has been made}} to develop an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> of Internet technology known as Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) among faculty and Research scholars of National Institutes of Technology (NITs) in India using the original constructs i. e. Perceived Usefulness as â {{the degree to which a}} person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performanceâ, and Perceived Ease of Use as â the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effortâ. Thus, the Perceived Usefulness of Internet Technology, Perceived Ease of use, Experience of using Internet, attitude towards using Internet, Behavioral Intention to use Internet, Perceived Complexity and actual System use using the Internet has been determined and thereby reflecting the Learning Style, Per-ceptions and Emotions of the focus groups. Further the research study encompasses independent vari-ables mainly Designation, Age, Qualification, Teaching and Research Experience and Formal Training of respondents. In this paper, efforts were made to examine the relationship between the variables Use of Internet (UOI) and Level of Satisfaction (LOS), as a two major dependent variables of the research study. The various dimensions included are quantification of these two variables. To evaluate multiple effects, a set of four variables i. e. age, teaching and research experience and level of satisfaction were put to Regression Analysis to see the multiple effects on variable Use of Internet. The variable LOS has emerged as the most affecting the dependent variable that means affecting the dependent variables i. e. Use of Internet. Thus, there is very high correlation between variables, Use of Internet and Level of satis-faction. The co-efficient of correlation is also statistically significant showing high positive correlation, which implies that higher the level of satisfaction, higher will be the use of Internet. This has resulted in coming out with a mathematical â regression model in which the results of regression analysis shows that, the four variables age, teaching and research experience and level of satisfaction put together explains 39 per cent of variance in variable Use of Internet (UOI) ...|$|E

The UCH Convention, akin to the LOSC, is likewise a compromise package of solutions to a delicate issue of indisputable global significance. Hence, despite its flaws, it should be regarded no less as a monumental international instrument for providing a wider scope of protection for underwater cultural heritage. The fact that the UCH Convention was adopted was success enough. In accordance with its Article 27, the UCH Convention entered into force on 2 January 2009 for States which have deposited their respective <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> ratification, <b>acceptance,</b> approval or accession on or before 2 October 2008.

Applying these indicators to the South African case, the analysis demonstrates the crucial significance of institutional foreign policy instruments. But although the South African government is ready to pay the costs of co-operative hegemony (such as capacity building for regional institutions and peacekeeping), the regional <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> South Africa’s leadership is constrained by its historical legacy. Additionally, Pretoria’s foreign policy is based on ideational resources such as its reputation as an advocate of {{democracy and human rights}} and the legitimacy derived from its paradigmatic behaviour as a ‘good global citizen’. However, the Mbeki presidency is more successful in converting these resources into discursive <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> interest-assertion in global, rather than in regional bargains.

40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} {{questionnaire}} on attitudes to moral {{decision making in}} youth sport and describe the levels of ethical attitudes in young competitors. Design: One qualitative and 4 quantitative studies. Method: First, 11 focus group interviews with 50 competitors, aged 11 – 17 years, identified their attitudes to moral issues. Subsequently, exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses with samples of 435 and 218 competitors eliminated unsuitable items, to improve conceptual clarity and factorial validity, and reduced a 56 -item pilot questionnaire to a 3 -factor 18 -item <b>instrument</b> measuring. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Cheating, <b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Gamesmanship, and Keeping Winning in Proportion. Then exploratory modifications were made in a restricted framework to develop a 9 -item gender-invariant instrument using a sample of 1126 competitors.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis analyzes the introduction, development, evolution and {{impacts of the}} Multi-Year Accountability Agreements, which {{were introduced to the}} Ontario post-secondary sector in 2006. The analysis uses an eclectic theoretical framework that builds on the accountability literature, public policy implementation theory, organizational theory, principal-agent theory and the study <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> in the French tradition. This allows for analyzing the original object of study using multiple lenses. The field work was extensive and consisted of a documentary analysis including the agreements for Ontario’s twenty universities between 2006 - 07 and 2009 - 10, as well as thirty-seven semi-structured interviews undertaken in 2012 with representatives from Ontario universities, the Ontario government and other sector organizations. The thesis moves away from a speculative definition of accountability as it clarifies how this concept is interpreted and constructed by the actors involved in its implementation and how its dimensions evolve over time. Accountability is thus conceptualized as a “moving target” – a challenge that is not unique to the post-secondary sector, as these kinds of processes are observed {{in other areas of the}} public sector. Therefore, although accountability is often presented as a tool of “good governance” intended to reduce waste and increase trust, is actually operationalized in a highly symbolic fashion and the gaps between the public discourse, the perceptions of actors and the final implementation are demonstrated. This thesis also shows how the choice <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> facilitates <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a new requirement in the sector and helps balance the government’s need for control with the universities’ need for independence. On one hand, the type <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> is coherent with government discourse for increased accountability. On the other hand, the instrument, presented as an agreement embodies the negotiated character of the relationship, and conveys the idea to different actors that their needs are being met. However, when the objectives are ambiguous, uncertainty is pervasive, and negotiation is limited, the increase in control reduced and the changes in autonomy are negligible. Despite the promises <b>of</b> the <b>instrument,</b> symbolic and rhetorical compliance may be the sustainable equilibrium between governments and governed...|$|R
40|$|Instruments {{to assess}} chronic pain {{acceptance}} {{have been developed}} and used. However, whether {{and to what extent}} the content of the items reflects acceptance remain uninvestigated. A content analysis <b>of</b> 13 <b>instruments</b> that aim to measure <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> chronic pain was performed. A coding scheme was used that consisted of 3 categories representing the key components <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> that is, disengagement from pain control, pain willingness, and engagement in activities other than pain control. The coding scheme consisted of 5 additional categories in order to code items that do not represent acceptance, that is, controlling pain, pain costs, pain benefits, unclear, and no fit. Two coders rated to what extent the items <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>instruments</b> belonged to {{one or more of these}} categories.
