Breeding is relatively easy, especially in brackish water. Up to 1000 eggs are lain on a stone.

She never turned her back upon him once; and although when she passed him (as she was obliged to do in going to and from the cupboard) she gathered the skirts of her garment about her, as if even its touching his by chance were horrible to think of, still, in the midst of all this dread and terror, she kept her face towards his own, and watched his every movement.|$|R

It was proposed to remove the provisions and store them elsewhere, but our dear mother, always generous and hospitable, said it was better to endure the loss than risk exposure: if the ghosts were denied this trifling gratification they might set on foot an investigation, which would overthrow our scheme of the division of labor, by diverting the energies of the whole family into the single industry pursued by me--we might all decorate the cross-beams of gibbets.

60|$|As under {{favourable}} circumstances {{most of the}} bladders {{succeed in}} securing prey, in one case as many as ten crustaceans;--as the valve is so well fitted to [page 410] allow animals to enter and to prevent their escape;--and as {{the inside of the}} bladder presents so singular a structure, clothed with innumerable quadrifid and bifid processes, it is impossible to doubt that the plant has been specially adapted for securing prey. From the analogy of Pinguicula, belonging to the same family, I naturally expected that the bladders would have digested their prey; {{but this is not the}} case, and there are no glands fitted for secreting the proper fluid. Nevertheless, in order to test their power <b>of</b> digestion, minute <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> roast <b>meat,</b> three small cubes of albumen, and three of cartilage, were pushed through the orifice into the bladders of vigorous plants. They were left from one day to three days and a half within, and the bladders were then cut open; but none of the above substances exhibited the least signs of digestion or dissolution; the angles of the cubes being as sharp as ever. These observations were made subsequently to those on Drosera, Dionaea, Drosophyllum, and Pinguicula; so that I was familiar with the appearance of these substances when undergoing the early and final stages of digestion. We may therefore conclude that Utricularia cannot digest the animals which it habitually captures.|$|R
