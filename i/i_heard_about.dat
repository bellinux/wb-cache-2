Gaga {{is one of the}} most talented artists I have worked with in my life and I'm excited about doing more with her... There are a lot of levels to the song. There's {{something}} very vulnerable about it and something very defiant about it, especially the way [...] sings it. The first verse is vulnerable—'You tell me it's going to get better?'—and the second verse comes in and it builds. Really? It gets better? No. You don't know until it happens to you...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E

So when I told her my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town." [...] Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, country {{pop singer}} Taylor Swift used Bieber's [...] "One Time" [...] as {{background}} music and music {{that she and}} her friends were dancing to in a tour video diary that she posted on her official YouTube account. In response to Swift using his song, Bieber posted an acoustic rendition of the then never-before heard [...] "Favorite Girl" [...] on his YouTube. When asked about his learning of Swift using his song, Bieber stated, [...] "It was really funny because <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it from a fan. I watched it and it was hilarious!" [...] Bieber and Swift then met in person at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later invited him to be a special guest on her Fearless Tour when she returned to the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams {{returned}} to Cheltenham Town, signing on a one-month loan deal on 14 August 2008. On bringing Myrie-Williams back to the club, Cheltenham manager Keith Downing said [...] "Jennison is an exciting young player who will give us some different options. We've perhaps been lacking a bit of pace and he will give us that as well". He made his second debut for the club four days later, scoring with a header in the 80th minute to ensure Cheltenham picked up their first win of the 2008–09 season with a 2–0 win against Swindon Town. Myrie-Williams made five appearances for Cheltenham during his one-month loan spell, scoring one goal. He returned to Bristol City on 15 September 2008. Shortly after returning to his parent club, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to another League One club, this time in the form of Carlisle United. Myrie-Williams stated that the move appealed to him because of manager John Ward, who he had played under at Cheltenham Town— [...] "We have kept in contact since I was at Cheltenham. He's a good manager and I enjoyed playing for him. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> a possible move in pre-season which came to nothing but I'm delighted to finally be here". He made his Carlisle debut on 20 September 2008, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 2–0 home defeat to Leeds United, a result that ended Carlisle's 100% home record. His loan spell was extended for another month on 15 October 2008. His final appearance for Carlisle was in the club's FA Cup 1–1 draw with Grays Athletic, a game in which Myrie-Williams was substituted after 59 minutes. He made 10 appearances during his two months at Carlisle. Myrie-Williams was loaned out for a third time during the 2008–09 season, his fifth loan spell in total, when he joined Hereford United in January 2009. He scored his first goal for Hereford on 17 February 2009 in the club's 2–0 home victory against Leeds United, scoring with a low shot to give Hereford the lead just before half-time. He returned to Bristol City after Hereford's 1–0 home loss against Peterborough United on 21 February 2009. A month later, Myrie-Williams rejoined Hereford {{until the end of the}} season. Myrie-Williams scored his second goal for Hereford in an away draw with Yeovil Town in April 2009. He made 15 appearances over the period of the two loan spells, scoring twice, as Hereford were relegated back to League Two after finishing bottom of the table.|$|E
2500|$|While a Panamanian {{response}} to the flag raisings by the Zonians was expected, the crisis took most Americans by surprise. Several years later, Lyndon B.

2500|$|On December 7, 2015, The Daily Show made {{reference}} to the whole debacle. When former host Jon Stewart made a guest appearance on the show, current host Trevor Noah jokingly remarked [...] "Are you here to take the show back? Oh, man, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> this in American TV. Are you taking the show back?". Stewart replied, quietly, [...] "Trust me, a thousand times no".|$|E

It was my greatest wish to obtain just such a document; not for my own satisfaction, but for my father, to prove this reality and obtain genuine evidence.

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} capture, Oswald {{encountered}} reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, [...] "I didn't shoot anybody" [...] and, [...] "They've taken me in {{because of the}} fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!" [...] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, [...] "Did you kill the President?" [...] and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, [...] "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." [...] As he was led from the room the question was called out, [...] "What did you do in Russia?" [...] and, [...] "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, [...] "A policeman hit me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{retaliation}} {{to being}} thrown off the festival shows, Mr. Bungle parodied the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Pontiac, Michigan on Halloween of 1999. Patton introduced each Mr. Bungle band member {{with the name}} of one of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, before covering the songs [...] "Give It Away", [...] "Around the World", [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] and [...] "Scar Tissue", with Patton deliberately using incorrect lyrics. Mr. Bungle also satirized many of the mannerisms of the band, mocking heroin injections, deceased guitarist Hillel Slovak and on-stage antics. Kiedis responded by having them removed from the 2000 Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. Kiedis said of the festival shows [...] "I would not have given two fucks if they played there with us. But after <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> [...] Halloween show where they mocked us, fuck him and fuck the whole band." [...] Patton went on to claim that Kiedis' actions had [...] "ruined" [...] Mr. Bungle's career, while bassist Trevor Dunn remarked [...] "It really screwed us up.

2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it, and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about where I saw myself, like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E
2500|$|In retaliation, Mr. Bungle parodied the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Pontiac, Michigan on Halloween of 1999.

2500|$|A {{hatred of}} war, he argued in 1936, [...] "can be {{no reason for}} being false to ourselves, {{in the name of}} an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none." [...] And in 1937: [...] "We have not kept {{agreements}} we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I was trembling when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound. Lucas put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition.|$|E
