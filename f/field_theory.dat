5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> known as Liouville <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> called a conformal <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} to formulating M-theory and studying its properties {{is provided by}} the anti-de Sitter/conformal <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{depending}} on the method used to fix the worldsheet diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations in the original free string theory, the resulting string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> can be very different. Using light cone gauge, yields light-cone string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> whereas using BRST quantization, one finds covariant string <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> There are also hybrid string <b>field</b> <b>theories,</b> known as covariantized light-cone string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> which use elements of both light-cone and BRST gauge-fixed string <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} many {{well-known}} quantum <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> emerge as representations {{of a single}} ^∗-algebra. These include free quantum <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> in flat and curved space-times, lattice quantum <b>field</b> <b>theories,</b> Wightman quantum <b>field</b> <b>theories,</b> and string theories. We prove that such theories can be approximated on lattices, and we give a rigorous definition of the continuum limit of lattice quantum <b>field</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R
50|$|String <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> come in {{a number}} of {{varieties}} depending on which type of string is second quantized: Open string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> describe the scattering of open strings, closed string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> describe closed strings, while open-closed string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> include both open and closed strings.|$|R
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory,</b> string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E

5|$|Goldstone's theorem {{in quantum}} <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> states {{that in a}} system with broken {{continuous}} symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone bosons.

That is, we provide a map from the fibred category of smooth <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> to the Segal space of homotopy <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> In particular, along the way we present a definition of symmetric monoidal Segal space, and use this notion to complete the sketch of the defintion of homotopy bordism category employed in Lurie's work to prove the cobordism hypothesis...|$|R
5|$|In quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory,</b> one {{typically}} computes the {{probabilities of}} various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|Many of the representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are {{important}} in theoretical physics. Representations appear {{in the description of}} fields in classical <b>field</b> <b>theory,</b> most importantly the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin. The theory enters into general relativity in the sense that in small enough regions of spacetime, physics is that of special relativity.|$|E

40|$|Given two {{conformal}} <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> {{related to}} each other by a marginal perturbation, and string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> constructed around such backgrounds, we show how to construct explicit redefinition of string fields which relate these two string <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> The analysis is carried out completely for quadratic and cubic terms in the action. Although a general proof of existence of field redefinitions which relate higher point vertices is not given, specific examples are discussed. Equivalence of string <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> formulated around two conformal <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> which are not close to each other, but are {{related to each}} other by a series of marginal deformations, is also discussed.

5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} phase {{transition}} {{and the critical}} behavior of observables, termed critical phenomena, was a major field {{of interest in the}} 1960s.
