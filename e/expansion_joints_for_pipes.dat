40|$|This paper {{describes}} the practical experience with reliability-based design of new <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> <b>for</b> the Little Belt Suspension Bridge. The methodology {{is based on}} the concept that a bridge does not necessarily have to fulfil the specific requirements of a general code, as long as the overall level of safety defined by the code is satisfied. The purpose of this approach is to reduce the required displacement capacity of the new <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> compared with the existing ones and thereby to minimise the maintenance costs in the future without compromising the level of safety. The safety evaluations are based on probabilistic methods in which uncertainties can be taken into account consistently. In this present case, temperature load, bridge-specific traffic load and structural response (influence areas) are modelled as uncertain parameters. Further, proof-loading is used for calibration of the structural response from Finite Element calculations. Based on the above approach the capacity of the new <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are reduced up to 60 % of the previous capacity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} that femtosecond (fs) laser patterning of Cu can be exploited to realize seed-free deposition of large-area adhesive diamond films on Cu. Fs-laser-induced nanostructures promote diamond nucleation density {{and result in}} diamond film formation within a laser fluence window from 2. 6 to 3. 6 J cm− 2. Diamond films deposited on Cu surfaces prepared outside this window experience either complete film detachment or formation of low-quality ball-like diamond grains. Diamond/substrate interface roughness plays {{a critical role in}} controlling diamond quality and adhesion between substrates and diamond films. Large-area adhesive diamond films have been achieved on Cu substrate surfaces that were first modified with fs-laser irradiation and then scribed into grid patterns. The scribed channels function as <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> <b>for</b> stress relief. Strain-free diamond films have been achieved by optimizing the grid size. Using fs-laser processing for seed-free deposition of large-area diamond films on Cu is of great significance for diverse applications, such as thermal management and power electronic devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to investigate the stresses encountered <b>for</b> a semicircular <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> <b>for</b> a rocket motor. Information was desired to relate these stresses to the various parameters of the problem. The stresses involved in this design were found to approximate those indicated by the exact membrane theory. The specimen having the lesser thickness was found to agree more closely with the exact membrane theory, and gave the lowest value of stresses. An empirical method of membrane analysis, based on deformation profiles, was developed. This method is applicable for stresses slightly above the elastic limit and may be extrapolated for higher values. The design tested was found to be inherently unsatisfactory on the basis of tests and theoretical considerations. An alternative design was indicated which would have lower values of stress for a given value of deformation, and which could be designed strictly on the basis of theoretical calculations. ...|$|R

50|$|The axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> absorbs {{movement}} in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. Axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are often {{equipped with a}} guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints,</b> which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are suitable <b>for</b> internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints,</b> the <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|R
40|$|The analysis, and {{subsequent}} retrofit, of concrete arch bridges during {{recent years has}} relied heavily {{on the use of}} computational simulation. For seismic analysis in particular, computer simulation, typically utilizing linear approximations of structural behavior, has become standard practice. This report presents the results of a comprehensive study of the significance of model sophistication (i. e. linear vs. nonlinear) and pertinent modeling assumptions on the dynamic response of concrete arch bridges. The study uses the Bixby Creek Bridge, located in California, as a case study. In addition to presenting general recommendations for analysis of this class of structures, this report provides an independent evaluation of the proposed seismic retrofit for the Bixby Creek Bridge. Results from the study clearly illustrate a reduction of displacement drifts and redistribution of member forces brought on by the inclusion of material nonlinearity. The analyses demonstrate that accurate modeling of <b>expansion</b> <b>joints,</b> <b>for</b> the Bixby Creek Bridge in particular, is critical to achieve representative modal and transient behavior. The inclusion of near-field displacement pulses in ground motion records was shown to significantly increase demand on the relatively softer, longer period Bixby Creek Bridge arch.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{constitutive}} modelling and identification of parameters of the relevant model of plastic strain- induced martensitic transformation in austenitic stainless steels at low temperatures. The model {{used to describe the}} FCCrightward arrow BCC phase transformation in austenitic stainless steels {{is based on the assumption}} of linearization of the most intensive part of the transformation curve. The kinetics of phase transformation is described by three parameters: transformation threshold (p/sub xi/), slope (A) and saturation level (xi/sub L/). It is assumed that the phase transformation is driven by the accumulated plastic strain p. In addition, the intensity of plastic deformation is strongly coupled to the phase transformation via the description of mixed kinematic /isotropic linear plastic hardening based on the Mori-Tanaka homogenization. The theory of small strains is applied. Small strain fields, corresponding to phase transformation, are decomposed into the volumic and the shear parts. The grade AISI 316 L, stainless steel often used in cryogenic applications, has been chosen as a good example of the austenitic structure. The magnetic permeability of fine gauge stainless steel sheets (thickness 0. 15 - 0. 25 mm) subjected to monotonic straining was measured as a function of strain. The detailed methodology of relevant measurements is presented in the paper. Tuning of the constitutive model is described and the relevant parameters are identified.

This paper presents an ultrasonic techniques for detecting and monitoring flaws in the weld. For post welding application a phased array ultrasonic technique is described that indicates flaws at the weld joint {{and the size of the}} heat affected zone as a record of the applied heat.
