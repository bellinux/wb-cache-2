5|$|In 2010, a {{modernization}} program was announced. Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems {{was chosen to}} provide 3-axis <b>gyro-stabilization,</b> and most probably the L7A2 105 mm cannon will be replaced with a more powerful 120mm cannon, like the L44 120 mm Cannon. The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013.|$|E
25|$|While {{still an}} undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing {{a method for}} {{balancing}} aeroplanes using <b>gyro-stabilization.</b> He submitted the idea to Scientific American, which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal {{of a way to}} automatically stabilize aircraft in flight. His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional gyroscopes.|$|E
5000|$|... 23 ItK 95 - Finnish upgrade of the {{original}} 23 ItK 61, designed by Instrumentointi Oy and Vammas Oy. The upgrade adds <b>gyro-stabilization</b> to the gun, along with an APU and a laser range finder.|$|E
5000|$|... 1/16 {{scale is}} the more intimidating vehicle design scale. Tamiya produce {{some of the best}} of this scale, these usually include {{realistic}} features like flashing lights, engine sounds, main gun recoil and - on their Leopard 2A6 - an optional <b>gyro-stabilization</b> system for the gun.|$|E

5000|$|The various {{helicopter}} {{controls are}} effected {{by means of}} small servo motors, commonly known as servos. A solid-state gyroscope sensor is typically used on the tail rotor (yaw) control to counter wind- and torque-reaction-induced tail movement. [...] Most newer helicopters have <b>gyro-stabilization</b> on the other 2 axes of rotation (pitch and roll) as well. Such 3-axis gyro is typically called a flybarless controller, so-called because it {{eliminates the need for}} a mechanical flybar.|$|E
5000|$|The XRM-91 Blue Scout Junior (sometimes called Journeyman B) was {{a rocket}} of the U.S. Air Force's System 609A Blue Scout family. [...] Although the Blue Scout Junior had {{sufficient}} impulse to {{have put a}} small satellite in low-earth orbit, it was not used as an orbital launch vehicle. The XRM-91 did not resemble the other Scout variants externally, because the usual first Scout stage (an Aerojet General Algol) was not used. Instead, the four-stage Blue Scout Junior used Scout's 2nd and 3rd stages (Castor and Antares) as the first two stages, and added an Aerojet General Alcor and a spherical NOTS Cetus in a common nose fairing. The XRM-91 also lacked the <b>gyro-stabilization</b> and guidance system of the RM-89 Blue Scout I and RM-90 Blue Scout II, making it a completely unguided rocket. It relied on second-stage fins and two spin motors to achieve a stable flight trajectory.|$|E
