500|$|... "Everyone agreed {{he had the}} look," [...] Lydon later recalled, but musical skill {{was another}} matter. [...] "The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot". Marco Pirroni, who had {{performed}} with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, [...] "After that, it {{was nothing to do}} with music anymore. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story".|$|E
500|$|Emilie de Ravin, an Australian actress, {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Shannon, speaking her dialogue with an American accent. Instead, they offered her the part of Claire; she accepted without reading the script, assuming <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a recurring role. While de Ravin had never been pregnant, she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters. She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that [...] "in many ways, the filming is actually like the drama. You endure the muggiest weather in the rainforest... You're really exposed to the elements." [...] The actress admitted being [...] "creeped out" [...] by the premise of [...] "Raised by Another", in which a psychic tricks Claire by sending her to the island to raise her baby.|$|E
500|$|During the band's {{performance}} at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, in August 1988, two fans were crushed to death when many in the crowd of 107,000 began slam-dancing to [...] "It's So Easy". Rose had halted the show several times to calm the audience. From then on, he became known for personally addressing disruptive fans and giving instructions to security personnel from the stage, at times stopping concerts to deal with issues in the crowd. In 1992, Rose stated, [...] "Most performers {{would go to a}} security person in their organization, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> done very quietly. I'll confront the person, stop the song: 'Guess what: You wasted your money, you get to leave.'" [...] As a result of the deaths at Monsters of Rock, the festival was canceled the following year.|$|E

It wouldn't do for a Hummingbird and a Jay Jay {{to be in the}} same camp, <b>would</b> <b>it?</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> TOO funny!" ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2012, {{the venue}} was renamed the Copper Box from the Handball Arena, thus {{reflecting}} {{the look of}} the building and the fact that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>just</b> <b>be</b> used for Handball. English Handball campaigned for the rebrand to be reversed.|$|R

"Do you wonder," [...] {{he asked}} them, [...] "that M. de Lesdiguieres should {{administer}} the law {{so that it}} shall ever be favourable to our great nobles? <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>just,</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> reasonable that he should otherwise administer it?" [...] He paused dramatically to let his sarcasm sink in. It {{had the effect of}} reawakening Le Chapelier's doubts, and checking his dawning conviction in Andre-Louis' sincerity. Whither was he going now? ...|$|R
500|$|... 'Artpop' {{is really}} an inferno and it's the only song on the record that I didn't really wanna go {{anywhere}} or explode or orgasm. Because then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> like composing {{something that would be}} just like every other sort of orgasm that I've ever had. And because its really the center of the record, I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone, to this concept of Art+Pop, that we can put art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore. How can we the artist back our ideas and for our visions {{to be the most important}} thing. The thing that's driving culture, driving these corporations. I didn't wanted [...] to grow too much, I wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra.|$|E
500|$|Also {{made by the}} duo {{during the}} K Foundation's existence, {{reported}} by the NME as a K Foundation work, but officially attributed to [...] "The One World Orchestra featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards", was [...] "The Magnificent", their contribution to the charity album Help. The song, a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would [...] "never make any more records". Drummond said, [...] "What do you expect us to do, go and make a jungle record?"; Cauty added [...] "Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> sad wouldn't it? We're too old." [...] NME gleefully informed their readers, [...] "The K Foundation's contribution to the 'Help' LP is a jungle track." [...] Help was released on 9 September 1995.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E

500|$|Jon Snow {{was killed}} in the fifth-season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy", and in the lead up to the sixth season, actor Kit Harington, who portrays the character, stated {{that he would not be}} {{returning}} to the series except to play a corpse, and would not be resurrected despite rampant speculation. Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear was that people were not going to care. Or <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be,</b> 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even verbal communication of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E
2500|$|In {{speaking}} about the show in 2010, Bain reflected: [...] "We had some very good science fiction people as advisors who {{knew what they were}} talking about. For instance, they knew that sound up there wouldn't travel, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that. There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. For all I know now it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "With {{the winds}} that started blowing last week, I figured <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> {{a matter of}} time," [...] said Ken Thrasher, {{speaking}} for the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which opposes the flag's removal. [...] "Whatever the Legislature decides to do, we will accept it graciously." [...] A number of prominent Republicans who had previously appeared to struggle with the issue immediately endorsed Haley's call to remove the flag, including Kentucky Senator and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, and governors and presidential hopefuls Scott Walker and Rick Perry.|$|E

5000|$|Riders of the Purple Sage {{received}} generally poor reviews {{upon its}} theatrical release. The reviewer for The New York Times criticized the film's lack of entertainment quality, while acknowledging Tom Mix's appeal and attraction to his fans. The reviewer for Variety wrote: It {{is all right}} to understand Mix and know what his admirers want, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as well to recollect that adults watch Mix pictures also, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as well if some of these directorial absurdities were omitted or made to blend.|$|R
2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Veteran full-back Becky Easton {{had played}} in Cup final defeats with Everton in 2005, Liverpool in 1995 and 1996, as well as captaining Doncaster Belles in their 2002 defeat to Fulham. She had been with Liverpool's {{forerunners}} Knowsley United, but was cup-tied for their appearance in the 1994 final. Easton said: [...] "I've been trying {{for years and years}} and haven't been able to do it [...] before. It would obviously be great for the club, because we haven’t won it as 'Everton', but on a personal note <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> absolutely fantastic." [...] Rachel Brown had played for Liverpool as a 15-year-old schoolgirl in the 1996 final, but was injured in 2005 and had not played in the final again since. She told the Liverpool Echo: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm in the twilight of my career but it's been a long time since 1996, so I'm very determined to put things right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, {{and went on to}} university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E

2500|$|The sixth season, {{consisting}} of 18 episodes, begins with Fiona's arrest. Michael does contract {{work for the}} CIA agent who trained him, Tom Card (John C. McGinley), to gain visitation rights to Fiona and eventually have her released. He is also working with Pearce, {{trying to track down}} Anson. The team finally captures Anson with the help of Michael's brother Nate, but shortly after the CIA arrives, a gunshot from an unseen location kills both Anson and Nate. Fiona is released from prison and helps Michael in his search for the man who killed his brother. They eventually learn that the killer's name is Tyler Gray, and Card sanctions an off-the-books operation in Panama to take him down. However, when Michael finally captures him, Gray reveals that the operation is a sham: Card hired Gray to kill Anson and is planning a move that will kill Michael and his team. They escape, and Michael eventually confronts and kills Card, making every member of his team, as well as Maddie, targets in a CIA manhunt headed by Olivia Riley (Sonja Sohn). They consider escaping the country, but, while trying to gain leverage on Riley, they discover she has been working with a drug cartel in order to bring Michael down. Michael gets in contact with Bly to help get evidence for Riley's treason, but their mission fails and Bly is killed. Michael eventually forces a confession from Riley while on a boat under fire from the Coast Guard. Sam, Fiona, Jesse and Madeline spend about a month locked up, and when released, they find that Michael [...] "made a deal" [...] once more in return for his family and friends being freed from lifetime imprisonment. Fiona feels betrayed, reminding Michael he promised <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> the two of them after this was all over. She backs away and tells Michael to leave her alone.|$|E
