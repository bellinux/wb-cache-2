25|$|Evans & Treisman (2005) {{proposed}} a hypothesis that humans rapidly detect disjunctive sets of unbound features of target categories <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>manner,</b> {{and then use}} these features to discriminate between scenes that do or do not contain the target without necessarily fully identifying it. An {{example of such a}} feature would be outstretched wings {{that can be used to}} tell whether or not a bird is in a picture, even before the system has identified an object as a bird. Evans & Treisman propose that natural scene perception involves a first pass through the visual processing hierarchy up to the nodes in a visual identification network, and then optional revisiting of earlier levels for more detailed analysis. During the 'first pass' stage, the system forms a global representation of the natural scene that includes the layout of global boundaries and potential objects. During the 'revisiting' stage, focused attention is employed to select local objects of interest in a serial manner, and then bind their features to their representations.|$|E

2500|$|Focused {{attention}} {{played a}} partial role in early models of natural scene perception. Such models involved {{two stages of}} visual processing. [...] According to these models, the first stage is attention free and registers low level features such as brightness gradients, motion and orientation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>manner.</b> Meanwhile, the second stage requires focused attention. It registers high-level object descriptions, has limited capacity and operates serially. These models have been empirically informed by studies demonstrating change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink. Such studies show that when one's visual focused attention is engaged by a task, significant changes in one's environment that are not directly pertinent to the task can escape awareness. It was generally thought that natural scene perception was similarly susceptible to change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink, and that these psychological phenomena occurred because engaging in a task diverts attentional resources {{that would otherwise be}} used for natural scene perception.|$|E
