5|$|In 2011, Frusciante married Nicole Turley, drummer {{and lead}} vocalist of the {{experimental}} band Swahili Blonde. On May 8, 2015 {{it was announced that}} Turley had filed for divorce. On October 3, 2015, Turley announced that she was seeking $75,000 a month as part of their divorce settlement. According to court documents, Turley, who was already being paid $20,000 a month, needs a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. She claims her finances are down to only $30,000. Turley said that Frusciante was worth $14 million and she was entitled to more money saying that together the couple employed a team of personal assistants, and owned three homes and a private music studio. A week later Frusciante responded to Turley's demands saying that he refuses to pay her any more money and that she is also seeking $2,600 a month for gifts and expenses for her adult brother. He also said he was done footing the bill for her musical career saying “I don’t know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> her recording efforts a hobby or a past-time … but it seems improper to characterize Nicole as a professional musician.” On October 19, 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Turley saying Frusciante had to pay his former wife $53,000 a month. Frusciante was also forced to pay $71,000 for Turley's legal expenses.|$|E
2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E

Shortly before resigning, she tweeted, [...] "RT style guide Rule 1: It is ALWAYS * Ukraine's fault (* add name as applicable)". She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, {{in a situation like that}} where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." [...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you wind up with on air is outright misinformation." [...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove." [...] She also stated that [...] "The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason." ...|$|E

About the compositions from the war, he wrote: 'My work from this period has got a sort of gravity, a doggedness here and there, which makes it clearly to realize as grown amid disasters.

5000|$|The film's origins {{date back}} to 1992, when Pitt, who was not yet well-known, got a script from {{producer}} Lawrence Gordon; three years later, Pitt suggested Ford as Tom O'Meara, which {{at that time was}} more of a character role. Ford agreed, though that meant the script had to be rewritten to create a fuller role for Ford and a more complicated relationship between the characters played by the two men. It was Ford's suggestion to bring Pakula in as director. Principal photography started in February 1996, with the script [...] "still in flux"; according to The New York Times, [...] "ego clashes, budget overruns and long delays plagued the project." [...] Screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen was brought on board to provide rewrites to the script during filming. Pitt [...] "threatened to quit early in the shoot, complaining that the script was incomplete and incoherent" [...] and later [...] "denounced the movie as 'the most irresponsible bit of film making - <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> even <b>call</b> it that - that I've ever seen." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{this great}} sense Shaw has brought {{philosophy}} back into drama--philosophy {{in the sense}} of a certain freedom of the mind. This is not a freedom to think what one likes (which is absurd, for one can only think what one thinks); it is a freedom to think about what one likes, which is quite a different thing and the spring of all thought. Shakespeare (in a weak moment, I think) said that all the world is a stage. But Shakespeare acted on the much finer principle that a stage is all the world. So there are in all Bernard Shaw's plays patches of what people would call essentially undramatic stuff, which the dramatist puts in because he is honest and would rather prove his case than succeed with his play. Shaw has brought back into English drama that Shakespearian universality which, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> Shakespearian irrelevance. Perhaps a better definition than either is a habit of thinking the truth worth telling even when you meet it by accident. In Shaw's plays one meets an incredible number of truths by accident.|$|R
