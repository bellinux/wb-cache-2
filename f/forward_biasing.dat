40|$|Abstract. The {{current gain}} of 4 H-SiC BJTs has been modeled using {{interface}} traps between SiC and SiO 2 to describe surface recombination, by a positive temperature {{dependence of the}} carrier lifetime in the base region and by bandgap narrowing in the emitter region. The interface traps have been modeled by one single level at 1 eV above the valence band, with capture cross section of 1 × 10 - 15 cm 2 and concentration of 2 × 1012 cm- 2. The temperature behavior of SiC BJTs has been simulated and {{the results have been}} compared with measurements. An analysis of the carrier concentration has been performed in order to describe the mechanisms for fall-off of the current gain at high collector current. At room temperature high injection in the base and <b>forward</b> <b>biasing</b> of the base-collector junction occur simultaneously causing an abrupt drop of the current gain. At higher temperatures high injection in the base is alleviated by the higher ionization degree of the aluminum dopants, and then <b>forward</b> <b>biasing</b> of the base-collector junction is the only acting mechanism for the current gain fall-off at high collector current. This mechanism and the negative temperature dependence of the carrier mobility can also explain the reduction of the knee current for gain fall-off with increasing temperature. Simulations with different emitter widths have been also performed and analyzed to characterize the emitter size effect. Higher current density caused by reducing the emitter width introduces higher carrier recombination in the emitter region, leading to a reduction of the current gain...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of the LIBS technique – in particular its sensitivity, reproducibility and limit of detection – we studied the effect of applying a static electric field with different polarities on the emission spectra obtained in a typical LIBS set-up. The physical parameters of the laser-induced plasma, namely the electron density Ne and the plasma temperature Te, were studied under such circumstances. In addition to the spectroscopic analysis of the plasma plume emission, the laser-induced shock waves were exploited to monitor the probable changes in the plasma plume dynamics due to the application of the electric field. The study showed a pronounced enhancement in the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of different Al, neutral and ionic lines under <b>forward</b> <b>biasing</b> voltage (negative target and positive electrode). On the other hand, a clear deterioration of the emission line intensities was observed under conditions of reversed polarity. This negative effect may be attributed to the reduction in electron-ion recombinations due to the stretched plasma plume. The plasma temperature showed a constant value in the average with the increasing electric field in both directions. This effect {{may be due to the}} fact that the measured values of Te were averaged over the whole plasma emission volume. The electron density was observed to decrease slightly in the case of <b>forward</b> <b>biasing</b> while no significant effect was noticed in the case of reversed biasing. This slight decrease in Ne can be interpreted in view of the increase in the rate of electron–ion recombinations due to the presence of the electric field.
