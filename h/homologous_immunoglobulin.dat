40|$|IgGa, in {{contrast}} to IgE, antibodies mediated the antigen-induced release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells without a requirement for a latent period and without the capacity to bind firmly to the target cell. Nonetheless, IgGa anti-DNP antibody interfered with the capacity of rat anti-N. brasiliensis antiserum rich in IgE antibodies to prepare the target cells for histamine release by worm antigen. Further, interaction of IgE antibody-prepared cells with IgGa anti-DNP antibody and DNP-BSA at 0 °C so as to achieve sterile activation, or at 30 °C to permit histamine release, inactivated such cells {{as determined by the}} subsequent failure to release histamine upon challenge with worm antigen.

40|$|Treatment of mice with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or C parvum {{activates}} their peritoneal macrophages {{to release}} increased amounts of H 2 O 2, and thereby to lyse extracellular tumor cells, {{in response to}} a pharmacologic agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (1 - 3). In the present study, the same bacterial vaccines activated peritoneal cells to become cytolytic to lymphoma cells sensitized with alloantiserum, in the absence of PMA. Resident peritoneal cells, or those elicited with thioglycollate broth, were ineffective, not only in PMA-induced lysis, but also in antibody-dependent lysis of tumor cells. The cytolytic effect of BCG peritoneal cells toward sensitized tumor cells appeared to be mediated mostly by macrophages. Cytotoxicity was immunologically specific, contact dependent, rapid, and efficient. Phagocytosis of intact tumor cells was not involved. Alloantiserum-dependent cytolysis was specifically blocked by the Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody directed against the trypsin-resistant macrophage Fc receptor (FcR II).

40|$|A {{heat-stable}} DNA-binding protein with subunits {{of about}} 53 kilodaltons (kDal) was purified from two virally transformed human cell lines (Epstein-Barr virus-positive Raji and Namalwa) and two mouse tumor cell lines (methylcholanthrene-induced Meth A sarcoma and TA 3 mammary carcinoma). All four 53 kDal proteins showed closely related total amino acid compositions, similar peptide maps, and identical NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequences for 20 residues. These 53 -kDal proteins are therefore evolutionarily highly conserved, independent {{of whether they}} originate from virally or chemically transformed cells. The NH 2 -terminal sequence and the protein chain as a whole are not hydrophobic; however, some unexpected residue distributions were observed. Comparisons with other proteins reveal no clear sequence similarity with known tumor antigen structures, <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulins,</b> or some other proteins of known sequence. Epstein-Barr virus-determined nuclear antigen also {{appears to have a}} different NH 2 -terminal sequence. Thus, the results show that the 53 -kDal proteins represent a unique protein type with little species variation; this finding suggests that these proteins must perform an important common function in different transformation systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the individual antigenic specificity of myeloma proteins (1, 2) and of the idiotypy of antibodies (2 - 4) has opened fascinating ways to investigate the fundamental problems of immunology (5, 6). We and others (7 - 11) have shown that it is possible, using an idiotypic cascade (antibodies against antibodies against antibodies [...] .) to manipulate, in a specific way, the immune system towards a predetermined goal, i. e., the induction of a normally silent idiotype. These results and others (12) indicate that the potential repertoire of one individual {{is larger than the}} functional repertoire (the one which is selected after antigen immunization). It has been suggested (13) that available repertoires are strictly germline determined and are T cell independent. Although this may be the case in some systems, we show in this paper that in the arsonate (Ars) ~ system the selection of available repertoires depends on complex regulatory pathways.

40|$|Human pre-B cells, {{which produce}} {{immunoglobulin}} heavy chain {{but do not}} produce immunoglobulin light chain, are shown to contain a 1 -kilobase transcript <b>homologous</b> to <b>immunoglobulin</b> lambda light-chain genes. Detailed analysis of RNA and cDNA clones derived from these transcripts reveals that they originate from the distinct immunoglobulin lambda-like genes 14. 1 / 16. 1. Sequence analysis of these clones reveals a long open reading frame, beginning with an ATG, capable of encoding a protein of 214 amino acids with an unprocessed molecular weight of 22, 944. The C-terminal half of this predicted protein is highly <b>homologous</b> to <b>immunoglobulin</b> lambda light-chain joining and constant region protein sequence, while the amino-terminal end does not share homology with variable regions. Unlike immunoglobulin genes, these genes do not undergo rearrangement prior to expression. Analysis of a panel of 26 hematopoietic cell lines reveals that expression of 14. 1 / 16. 1 is limited to pre-B cells and one B-cell line, which, like the pre-B cells, is surface immunoglobulin negative. Antisera raised against a peptide whose sequence was predicted from the 14. 1 cDNA sequence identifies a 22 -kDa protein in human pre-B cells. Immunoprecipitation of immunoglobulin mu-chain from these pre-B cells with anti-immunoglobulin mu antibody coprecipitates a 22 -kDa protein, which {{is a candidate for}} the human immunoglobulin omega light-chain protein and may be the protein product of the 14. 1 / 16. 1 genes...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome pairing is {{involved}} in X chromosome inactivation, a classic instance of monoallelic gene expression. Antigen receptor genes are also monoallelically expressed (“allelically excluded”) by B and T lymphocytes, and we asked whether pairing contributed to the regulation of V(D) J recombination at these loci. We found that <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (Ig) alleles pair up during recombination. Homologous Ig pairing is substantially reduced {{in the absence of}} the RAG 1 /RAG 2 recombinase, but a transgene expressing an active site RAG 1 mutant (which binds but does not cleave DNA) rescues pairing in Rag 1 −/− developing B cells. RAG-mediated cleavage on one allele induces the other allele to relocate to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH), likely to ensure that only one allele is cut at a time. This relocation to PCH requires the DNA damage sensor ATM (ataxia telengiectasia mutated). In the absence of ATM, repositioning at PCH is diminished and the incidence of cleavage on both alleles is significantly increased. ATM appears to be activated by the introduction of a double-strand break on one allele to act in trans on the uncleaved allele, repositioning or maintaining it at PCH, to prevent bi-allelic recombination and chromosomal translocations...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether the neonatal mouse small intestine has the ability to be selective in the binding of <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> isotypes, mouse immunoglobulins were tested for their ability to bind to brush borders isolated from jejunal enterocytes of neonatal and adult mice. The binding of immunoglobulins to brush borders was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. The results showed that brush borders from 12 -day-old mice bound mouse immunoglobulins selectively, binding IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, IgG 3 and IgE but not IgG 1, IgM or IgA. Similarly, at 16 days, only IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, IgG 3 and IgE were bound significantly. The ability of jejunal brush borders to bind gamma-globulins declined with age and their selectivity was lost such that in mice of 18 days and over not one of the immunoglobulins tested was bound. It was concluded that neonatal mouse jejunal Fc gamma receptors bind IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b almost exclusively. The sudden drop in binding between 16 and 18 days coincides with the previously reported age at which immunoglobulin transmission across the gut in the neonatal mouse ceases (closure) ...|$|E
40|$|The serum disappearance, {{metabolic}} clearance and whole body catabolism of <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> fragments were studied in rats. The rapid disappearance of Fab fragments from serum in normal animals {{was no longer}} present after nephrectomy. In contrast, the serum disappearance curve of Fc fragments was not altered by nephrectomy. The results of three different experiments, however, indicated that similar to Fab fragments, some Fc fragments underwent filtration and degradation in the kidneys. First, the amount of intact Fc fragments excreted in the first day after injection increased from 6 % of the injected dose in normal rats to 17 % in rats pretreated with sodium maleate. Secondly, nephrectomy eliminated the rapid phase of whole body catabolism of inected Fc fragments. Thirdly, auto-radiographic studies showed localization of Fc fragments in the renal proximal tubule cells in the first 3 hr after injection. An identical localization was seen with Fab fragments. These results support the conclusion that removal from circulation by glomerular filtration and subsequent reabsorption and degradation in proximal tubule cells represent the major mechanism for catabolism of Fab fragments. Although some Fc fragments undergo the same fate, most injected Fc fragments equilibrate with unknown sites where they are possibly bound and made unavailable for filtration in the kidneys...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA major {{determinant}} of specific connectivity {{in the central}} nervous system is that synapses made by distinct afferent populations are restricted to particular laminae in their target area.

Sdk proteins are concentrated at synaptic sites, and Sdk-positive synapses are restricted to the 2 (of ≥ 10) sublaminae to which sdk-expressing cells project. Ectopic expression of Sdk in Sdk-negative cells redirects their processes to a Sdk-positive sublamina. These results implicate Sdks as determinants of lamina-specific synaptic connectivity...|$|R

Twenty-five of forty-four monkey antisera were active and stimulated 90 per cent of leucocyte (WBC) cultures to incorporate {{a small but}} significantly greater amount of tritiated thymidine (TdR 3 H) than that incorporated by controls. This stimulation of TdR 3 H uptake correlated with an increase from 2 to 8 per cent lymphoblasts in the cultures. Leucocytes washed free of serum immunoglobulins responded {{to a greater degree}} to the anti-immunoglobulin sera than when they were cultured in the presence of human serum. Prior absorption of antisera with either whole serum or <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> blocked antiserum stimulation completely. The anti-IgG and anti-IgM antisera were consistently more effective than anti-IgA, anti-κ and anti-λ chain antisera. Sequential stimulation by antisera against two different immunoglobulins was not significantly different from those stimulated by only one of the two. Lymphocytes from three asymptomatic subjects with low or absent serum IgA levels transformed as well with anti-IgA as did lymphocytes from subjects with normal serum IgA levels. Antisera were cytotoxic to the lymphocytes only in the presence of complement. Presumably the transformation of human lymphocytes was due to a reaction of anti-immunoglobulin antisera with specific immunoglobulin antigenic determinants present on or in the circulating lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L (PpL) is a multidomain, {{bacterial}} surface protein {{whose presence}} correlates with virulence. It consists {{of up to}} five <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> binding domains that interact with the variable (VL) regions of kappa light chains found on two thirds of mammalian antibodies. Results: We refined the crystal structure of the complex between a human antibody Fab fragment (2 A 2) and a single PpL domain (61 residues) to 2. 7 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two Fab molecules sandwiching a single PpL domain, which contacts similar VL framework regions of two light chains via independent interfaces. The residues contacted on VL are remote from the hypervariable loops. One PpL-Vκ interface agrees with previous biochemical data, while the second is novel. Site-directed mutagenesis and analytical-centrifugation {{studies suggest that the}} two PpL binding sites have markedly different affinities for VL. The PpL residues in both interactions are well conserved among different Peptostreptococcus magnus strains. The Fab contact positions identified in the complex explain the high specificity of PpL for antibodies with kappa rather than lambda chains. Conclusions: The PpL-Fab complex shows the first interaction of a bacterial virulence factor with a Fab light chain outside the conventional combining site. Structural comparison with two other bacterial proteins interacting with the Fab heavy chain shows that PpL, structurally homologous to streptococcal SpG domains, shares with the latter a similar binding mode. These two bacterial surface proteins interact with their respective immunoglobulin regions through a similar β zipper interaction...|$|E

In the present study, the antigenic relatedness of these two genotypes was determined {{for the first time}} to enable the development of tests to detect and differentiate between both genotypes. Two approaches were used. First, cross-reactivity was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) and convalescent-phase sera from calves infected with either Jena (genotype 1) or Newbury 2 (genotype 2). Second, cross-reactivity was examined between the two genotypes with a monoclonal antibody, CM 39, derived using Jena VLPs. The two genotypes, Jena and Newbury 2, were antigenically distinct with little or no cross-reactivity by ELISA to the heterologous VLPs using convalescent calf sera that had <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> G titers of log 10 3. 1 to 3. 3. CM 39 reacted with both Jena and heterologous Newbury 2 VLPs. The CM 39 epitope was mapped to nine amino acids (31 PTAGAQIAA 39) in the Jena capsid protein, which was not fully conserved for Newbury 2 (31 PTAGAPVAA 39). Molecular modeling showed that the CM 39 epitope was located within the NH 2 -terminal arm inside the virus capsid. Surprisingly, CM 39 also reacted with VLPs from two genogroup II/ 3 human noroviruses by ELISA and Western blotting. Thus, although the bovine noroviruses Jena and Newbury 2 corresponded to two distinct antigenic types or serotypes, they shared at least one cross-reactive epitope. These findings have relevance for epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence of bovine norovirus serotypes and to develop vaccines to bovine noroviruses...|$|E
40|$|The {{inheritance}} of germline immunoglobulin genes must ensure {{the recognition of}} prevalent pathogens {{and the ability to}} adapt to new pathogens. The current understanding of the generation of diversity of immunoglobulin binding sites involves the recombination of the B-lymphocyte germline genes during development. In general, the production of immunoglobulins proceeds with the help of T-lymphocytes through a process called "affinity maturation" involving mutations that increase antigen specificity. Carbohydrate epitopes, however, do not illicit such a response, and so are more dependent on the primary germline repertoire. Although anti-carbohydrate antibodies exhibit exquisite specificity, to date there have been few structural reports of complexes due to their low binding affinities. Here, high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of antigen-binding fragments from two highly <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> S 25 - 2 and S 45 - 18 in their unliganded forms and bound to several carbohydrate epitopes of 3 -deoxy- D-manno-oct- 2 -ulosonic acid (Kdo) found in Gram-negative bacteria including members of the family Chlamydiaceae. The combining sites of both immunoglobulins are similarly composed of a common germline-conserved "pocket" that binds a non-reducing terminal Kdo monosaccharide, and a "groove"-like remainder of the binding site that uses the same residues multiply in interactions with different epitopes {{in the case of the}} germline-conserved S 25 - 2, or that has undergone mutations that enhance the specificity for a single epitope in the case of S 45 - 18. The structural basis of this adaptability is accomplished firstly, by the combination of a specific set of germline VH and Vkappa genes that encodes a binding pocket that recognizes the non-reducing terminal Kdo; secondly, by a difference in the nature of the D and JH mini-genes between S 25 - 2 and S 45 - 18; and thirdly, by the contributions of conserved germline residues compared to regions of amino acid mutation. Furthermore, the strategy of coupling a strict binding pocket with a more adaptive region demonstrates how anti-carbohydrate immunoglobulins can bind a limited range of related epitopes without necessarily incurring the entropic penalty of immobilisation of flexible regions...|$|R
40|$|Invertebrates {{rely heavily}} on immune-like {{molecules}} with highly diversified variability so as to counteract infections. However, the mechanisms {{and the relationship between}} this variability and functionalities are not well understood. Here, we showed that the C-terminal domain of hemocyanin (HMC) from shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei contained an evolutionary conserved domain with highly variable genetic sequence, which is structurally <b>homologous</b> to <b>immunoglobulin</b> (Ig). This domain is responsible for recognizing and binding to bacteria or red blood cells, initiating agglutination and hemolysis. Furthermore, when HMC is separated into three fractions using anti-human IgM, IgG, or IgA, the subpopulation, which reacted with anti-human IgM (HMC-M), showed the most significant antimicrobial activity. The high potency of HMC-M is a consequence of glycosylation, as it contains high abundance of α-d-mannose relative to α-d-glucose and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine. Thus, the removal of these glycans abolished the antimicrobial activity of HMC-M. Our results present a comprehensive investigation of the role of HMC in fighting against infections through genetic variability and epigenetic modification...|$|R

30|$|I got {{acquainted with}} Ellis when I was a visiting scholar from China working in Stephen Harrison’s lab at Harvard for another high-profiled project: {{to solve the}} {{structure}} of CD 4. CD 4 had long been known as the co-receptor of TCR, playing {{a key role in}} the immune system since its description in 1979 (Reinherz et al., 1979). But in 1988 to determine the structure of CD 4 had a much more urgent goal behind. In the early 1980 s, HIV was discovered as the cause of the life-threatening acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and soon CD 4 was identified as the primary receptor of HIV. The virus uses CD 4 to open the door for invading the T cell, eventually destroying the whole immune system, hence the name of AIDS. Steve and the late Don Wiley initiated and directed this extremely important structure project with a clear goal in mind: To solve the structure of CD 4, which might be potentially the first step to ultimately stop the HIV pandemic. CD 4 as a transmembrane receptor has four immunoglobulin (Ig) like domains on the cell surface. Steve was seeking all possible sources to collect the protein sample with different domain constituents for crystallization. Ellis was one of the sources. Ellis’s lab was able to express protein composed of the N-terminal two domains of CD 4. By then it was already known that the very N-terminal domain of CD 4 is solely responsible for virus binding. We were hoping that a two-domain construct would be sufficient for this purpose. My wife was assigned to grow crystals. She often was handed over the protein sample by Ellis’s technician in Harvard Square, a few miles away from his lab near the downtown Boston! The protein Ellis produced did yield excellent crystals. It was a truly exciting moment when for the first time, I watched the high-resolution diffraction pattern of the CD 4 crystal on the detector using the home source X-ray machine. I knew the structure could be on the horizon. At that time, there was no fancy software capable of computing the phasing, electron density modification and automatic model building, poly-peptide tracing on the density map from the experimental phasing was always a challenge. After I obtained the multiple-isomorphous replacement map, it was quite difficult to interpret the noisy map. Using a <b>homologous</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> domain as a model, Steve himself did the N-terminal domain fitting on the graphics machine to make the breakthrough. We then successfully traced the second domain on a so-called mini-map, which was a stacked plastic sheet with electron density maps contoured in an old-fashion way to determine the proteins’ backbone structure. The international competition to determine this structure was unprecedented. My friend Jack Strominger, a veteran immunologist at Harvard, was once teasing me by saying that “Jia-huai, there are at least 15 labs in the world working on the same project!” In the end, two labs advanced far enough to reach the agreement of coordinating the publication together (Ryu et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1990). The other lab was led by Wayne Hendrickson at Columbia University. The news on the two Nature articles was in the New York Times in 1990. It is interesting to add that it was not until ten years later in 2001 when I was already on the faculty of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School that Ellis and I published another structure of CD 4 (Wang et al., 2001). This time it was in complex with the class II MHC molecule, in which we showed clearly how HIV uses a similar strategy to outcompete CD 4 ’s physiological binding partner MHC to grab CD 4 for the invasion. That effort complemented the first class II MHC-restricted TCR in complex with pMHCII to be described by us in 1999 (Reinherz et al., 1999). In those two structures, the complexes included the same pMHCII, allowing us to infer and create a molecular model of the TCR-pMHC-CD 4 tri-molecular complex solved by our colleague Roy Marriuzza a decade later (Yin et al., 2012).|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy {{as to whether}} or not the genes encoding the T cell antigen receptor are <b>homologous</b> to <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene segments. Results from a number of different experiments have been interpreted as evidence that T lymphocytes utilize heavy chain variable (VH) 1 regions to bind specifically to antigen. For example, some antiidiotypic and anti-VH framework sera interfere with T cell function and/or bind to antigen-specific factors secreted by T cells (1 - 3). In several cases, the gene encoding the cross-reactive determinant expressed by the T cells is linked to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster (4 - 9). Also, the genes encoding a series of T cell alloantigens have been mapped to chromosome 12, between the CH gene locus, Igh- 1, and the prealbumin gene (9, 10). Recently, these alloantigens have been detected on antigenbinding factors secreted by T cells (11 - 13). It has been proposed that the antigenic determinants encoded by CH-linked genes are T cell isotypes that may be expressed in conjunction with VH gene segments (10, 14). Furthermore, some T lymphocytes contain rearranged Jn gene segments or a C ~ transcript (15 - 23) ...|$|R

Using CARs, antitumor activity can be initiated in patients with no prior tumor specific immunity. Although CARs have shown promising clinical results, the technology remains limited by the availability of specific cognate cell target antigens. To increase the repertoire of targetable tumor cell antigens we utilized the immune system of the sea lamprey to generate directed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). VLRs serve as membrane bound and soluble immune effectors analogous but not <b>homologous</b> to <b>immunoglobulins.</b> They have a fundamentally different structure than immunoglobulin (Ig) -based antibodies while still demonstrating high degrees of specificity and affinity. To test the functionality of VLRs as the antigen recognition domain of CARs, two VLR-CARs were created. One contained a VLR specific for a murine B cell leukemia and the other contained a VLR specific for the human T cell surface antigen, CD 5. The CAR design consisted of the VLR sequence, myc-epitope tag, CD 28 transmembrane domain, and intracellular CD 3 ζ signaling domain. We demonstrate proof of concept, including gene transfer, biosynthesis, cell surface localization, and effector cell activation for multiple VLR-CAR designs. Therefore, VLRs provide an alternative means of CAR-based cancer recognition...|$|R

Reversion occurred {{by any of the}} following events: restoration of guanosines at nucleotide (nt) 5134 and nt 5140 within the adenovirus 5 E 1 A enhancer core AGGAAGTGACT; acquisition of an A [...] G mutation at nt 5258, which is the same mutation that enables polyomavirus to grow in embryonal carcinoma F 9 cells; duplication of mutated sequences between nt 5146 and 5292 (including sequences <b>homologous</b> with <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, simian virus 40, and bovine papillomavirus enhancer elements).

Revertants that acquired the F 9 mutation at nt 5258 grew at least 20 -fold better than the original mutant in whole mouse embryo cells, but replicated only marginally better than the original mutant in 3 T 6 cells. Viruses with a reversion of the mutation at nt 5140 replicated equally well in both types of cells. Since individual nucleotides in the polyomavirus enhancer simultaneously altered DNA replication and transcription in specific cell types, it is likely that these processes rely upon a common element, such as an enhancer-binding protein...|$|R
40|$|Work was {{completed}} during previous post-I joined DMU on January 2016 Patients with {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) assigned to stereotyped subset # 4 express highly <b>homologous</b> B-cell receptor <b>immunoglobulin</b> (BcR IG) sequences with intense intraclonal diversification (ID) {{in the context of}} ongoing somatic hypermutation (SHM). Their remarkable biological and clinical similarities strongly support derivation from a common ancestor. We here revisited ID in subset # 4 CLL to reconstruct their evolutionary history as a community of related clones. To this end, using specialized bioinformatics tools we assessed both IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements (n = 511) and IGKV-IGKJ rearrangements (n = 397) derived from eight subset # 4 cases. Due to high sequence relatedness, a number of subclonal clusters from different cases lay very close to one another, forming a core from which clusters exhibiting greater variation stemmed. Minor subclones from individual cases were mutated {{to such an extent that}} they now resembled the sequences of another patient. Viewing the entire subset # 4 data set as a single entity branching through diversification enabled inference of a common sequence representing the putative ancestral BcR IG expressed by their still elusive common progenitor. These results have implications for improved understanding of the ontogeny of CLL subset # 4, as well as the design of studies concerning the antigenic specificity of the clonotypic BcR IGs...|$|R
40|$|A 69 -kDa antigen of Trypanosoma congolense induces both IgM and IgG in {{experimentally}} infected cattle. Cloning and {{sequencing of}} the gene coding for this antigen revealed that {{it belongs to the}} heat shock protein 70 family (hsp 70) and is <b>homologous</b> to mammalian <b>immunoglobulin</b> binding protein (BiP). Due to its high antigenicity, the trypanosome BiP may be useful for developing an antibody-ELISA. Further-more, since defined regions of the molecule are conserved in different species of trypanosomes, while others are specific for T. congolense, {{it may be possible to}} develop both a test with broad specificity (pan-trypanosome) and a T. congolense-specific test. In order to assess the diagnostic potential of the trypanosome BiP, seven recombinant fragments were expressed in a bacterial expression system. Preliminary tests were carried out using a recombinant truncated protein (C- 25) as the antigen, with forty sera taken during T. congolense experimental infections. All 22 sera from infected cattle gave O. D. values above those given by sera from 18 non-infected cattle. Sera collected sequentially during experimental infections were then compared for their reactivity to a crude lysate or to C- 25. The C- 25 based assay was of low sensitivity in primary infections, but detected most positive samples during rechallenge infections. The disappearance of anti-C- 25 IgG after trypanocidal treatment was faster than that of IgG to a T. congolense crude extract. Although further evaluation of C- 25 is required, particularly as regards specificity, this antigen is one of the very few defined candidate antigens for the Development of a standardisable antibody-ELISA...|$|R
40|$|A {{standardised}} {{procedure was}} {{established for the}} laboratory maintenance of C. irritans in thick-lipped mullet. Nine isolates of C. irritans were obtained of which eight were successfully established for up to 48 weeks. Studies on individual life cycle stages with regards to longevity, viability, and susceptibility to a chemotherapeutic agent, revealed the difficulties in eradicating the cysts. Transmission of the parasite both {{to and from the}} host correlated with darkness. High infection levels resulted in the death of host fish within five days following exposure to theronts. An acquired protective immune response developed in host mullet within 14 days after exposure to sub-lethal infection. The degree of immunity appeared to relate to infection dose, and was not fully protective in all fish. Protection persisted for six months after infection and appeared specific to C. irritans. Specific antibodies to trophont antigen were identified in mullet serum but not epithelial mucus following either natural exposure to theronts or intraperitoneal immunisation with trophont antigens. Serum from intraperitoneally immunised fish caused theront immobilisation and agglutination in vitro; however no evidence was found for a protective role for specific antibody. Major polypeptides were identified and characterised by molecular weight for both trophont and theront stages using SDS-PAGE. Significant homology in major polypeptide profiles was found between C. irritans and I. multifiliis, in respect to trophonts and particularly theronts. Murine monoclonal antibodies raised to trophonts identified two polypeptide components of molecular weights 20 - 21 kDa and 68 - 69 kDa, the latter being <b>homologous</b> with host <b>immunoglobulin</b> heavy chain. These results are discussed in relation to future management and control strategies for cryptocaryosis in warmwater mariculture systems and aquaria...|$|R
40|$|The CD 8 {{molecule}} regulates T cell activation mediated via the CD 3 T {{cell receptor}} and the adhesion molecule CD 2. CD 8 mAbs {{have been found}} to inhibit early (Ca 2 + rise) as well as late events (cytotoxicity, proliferation, and lymphokine secretion) mediated via the CD 2 pathway. A panel of eight anti-human CD 8 mAbs was tested for inhibition of CD 2 -mediated Ca 2 + rise in a cytotoxic T cell clone. The inhibition ranged from 5 to 53 % independently of mAb isotype and affinity measured by half saturation binding. We then characterized these mAbs for their reactivity toward three mutants of the human CD 8 alpha carrying amino acid sequence changes in the surface-exposed loops <b>homologous</b> to the <b>immunoglobulin</b> CDR 1, 2, and 3. The mutations included replacement of the human CD 8 alpha CDR 1 - and CDR 2 -like loops by the homologous mouse sequences and the insertion of a glycine {{in the middle of the}} CDR 3 -like loop. Thus, five mAbs were found to be affected by the mutation in the CDR 2 -like loop but not by alterations in the other CDR-like loops. Conversely, the other two mAbs (8 E 1. 7 and B 9. 8) were affected only by mutations in the CDR 1 - and CDR 3 -like loops, respectively. Cross-inhibition experiments were essentially in agreement with these results. Interestingly, all the mAbs directed against the CDR 2 -like loop were potent inhibitors of CD 2 -mediated Ca 2 + rise, with one exception probably due to poor affinity. Thus, in addition to being a site of interaction with major histocompatibility complex Class I as recent data have indicated, this region of the CD 8 alpha subunit may play a role in regulating T cell activation...|$|R
