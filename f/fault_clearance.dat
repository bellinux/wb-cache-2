40|$|High voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) grid {{protection}} must clear dc faults within a time-frame of milliseconds to avoid damages to power electronic components due to fast rising dc fault currents. If the breaker {{associated with the}} primary protection fails, backup must be provided to clear the faults which would otherwise persist. Backup relaying algorithms originally developed for ac systems delay the detection of primary protection failure until the expected primary <b>fault</b> <b>clearance</b> instant. Application of similar algorithms to HVDC grids results in a long fault clearing time, which requires converters and breakers to withstand unrealistically large currents. To reduce the fault clearing time, this paper proposes two fast backup relaying algorithms which detect local and remote breaker failure before the expected primary <b>fault</b> <b>clearance</b> instant. The proposed algorithms use thresholds on the voltage and current measurements to detect breaker failure. They are evaluated using a four-terminal HVDC grid test system implemented in PSCAD.

40|$|Abstract—Doubly fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) {{technology is the}} dominant technology in the growing global market for wind power generation, due to the combination of variable-speed opera-tion and a cost-effective partially rated power converter. However, the DFIG is sensitive to dips in supply voltage and without specific protection to “ride-through ” grid faults, a DFIG risks damage to its power converter due to overcurrent and/or overvoltage. Conven-tional converter protection via a sustained period of rotor-crowbar closed circuit leads to poor power output and sustained suppression of the stator voltages. A new minimum-threshold rotor-crowbar method is presented in this paper, improving fault response by reducing crowbar application periods to 11 – 16 ms, successfully di-verting transient overcurrents, and restoring good power control within 45 ms of both <b>fault</b> initiation and <b>clearance,</b> thus enabling the DFIG to meet grid-code fault-ride-through requirements.

In addition, the spectra analysis to vibration signals obtained under the instable milling processes show that the presence of bearing clearance could introduce more frequency components to the vibration responses but, however, under both the stable and instable milling processes, the generated frequency components will not violate the ideal spectra structures of the vibration responses of the milling process, which are usually characterized by the tooth passing frequency and its associated higher harmonics for the stable milling process and by the complex coupling of the tooth passing frequency and the chatter frequency for the instable milling process.

Moreover, the wind farm generators are located in 6 rows, where each row consists of 10 generators and each row is simulated by one DFIG wind turbine with a rating of 20  MW. The proposed protection technique is designed using ANFIS approach to detect, classify and determine the location of different faults which occur in the grid-connected wind farm to protect the wind turbine generator components from dangerous effects. The proposed technique is investigated at different fault conditions such as fault types, fault location, fault duration, cascaded faults, permanent fault and external grid fault. Also, the impacts of internal and external faults in case of different transition resistances are studied. The fluctuations of active and reactive power are monitored at the PCC bus of wind farm for different fault conditions. The results show that, the measured active power for faulted row generators is fallen to zero MW due to isolation of faulted zone during fault occurrence. After <b>fault</b> <b>clearance</b> and reconnect the isolated zone, the generated active power has some fluctuation, then returns to steady state value. Also, the active power for all un-faulted rows is affected during different fault periods. The reduction of active power at PCC bus depends {{on the number of}} faulted rows and fault duration. The results show that, the proposed technique can detect, classify and determine the fault location, hence it isolates the faulted zone during fault occurrence and reconnect it after <b>fault</b> <b>clearance.</b> Also, the wind turbine generators which are located in un-faulted zones can remain in delivering their generated active power to the electrical grid. Moreover, the wind turbine generators in faulted zone return to deliver their active power to the grid after <b>fault</b> <b>clearance.</b> Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the applicability and confirm the robustness of proposed technique.|$|E

This thesis has synthesized a novel engineering methodology for developing highly reliable sensor fusion systems (SFS) of multi-sensori intelligent {{systems for the}} applications in the safety and mission critical environments. This methodology includes both the avoidance of faults during the development phase and the tolerance of sensor failures during the operation phase. Petri net based novel discrete event framework has been proposed to model SFS as discrete event dynamic system. This intuitive mathematical framework abstracts the SFS as a hierarchically finite state machine. The intuitive graphical nature of this framework {{has the potential to}} enhance the communication between the developer and the client to capture sensing requirements resulting in avoidance of requirement errors. The mathematical attribute enables the developer to analyze different attributes of the modeled SFS to ensure logical and temporal correctness of the performance of the system. This proposed discrete event framework has been verified by simulating the design of an example sensor fusion system. The reasoning basis of the architecture of the underlying computing system from this Petri net model of the SFS has also been developed to ensure the temporal correctness during the operation phase. The use of redundancy to tolerate failure of sensors has been experimentally verified. Overheads have been identified to incorporate hardware fault-tolerance in this proposed SFS framework to tolerate sensor faults during the operation phase. A novel scheme has been developed to manage these overheads in a predictable manner. A fault-tree based novel scheme has been proposed to measure the probability of failure of different levels of fusion due to the failure of different sensors. A computationally simple scheme to detect transients present on the sensor data stream has been proposed with extensive simulation results to enhance system performance in operation phase.
