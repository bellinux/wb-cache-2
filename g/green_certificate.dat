40|$|Abstract For {{the time}} being, {{the society is}} facing serious {{problems}} related to the environmental protection. These problems are closely linked {{with the needs of}} the human community, needs which are permanently growing as compared to the resources which are more and more limited. After the accession to the European Union, among the business entities appears the concept of corporate social responsibility. The large multinational company successfully enrol themselves in the development of this concept. The field of renewable energy is only a part of the whole. The need to study the field of renewable energy is given by the novelty and importance of this field at national and international level. The alignment to the European standards is the prerequisite for the start of this research. I followed the fiscal and accounting approach of <b>green</b> <b>certificates.</b> <b>Green</b> <b>certificates</b> are one of the instruments through which investors, business entities, corporations demonstrate their commitment to the protection of the environment.

40|$|Various {{approaches}} to promoting green electricity were analyzed through {{the cases of}} Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. How has green electricity market penetration evolved, and what were the main driving forces? The findings from the case studies are synthesized and analyzed {{with respect to their}} relevance for Norway, particularly in terms of energy resources, production, potential, relevant policies and barriers. Potential policy instruments for Norway include feed-in tariffs, <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> under quota obligations, and subsidies for research and development, and are discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The report argues that to assist technologies feasible today – such as wind power – a choice must be made between <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> based on obligatory quotas and a feed-in tariff system. Both effectively tax non-green electricity to subsidize green electricity. As shown by the German case study, feed-in tariffs have advantages in terms of effectiveness, providing a suitable investment climate, flexibility and ease of administration. Sweden has a system of <b>green</b> electricity <b>certificates,</b> and if EU also goes in this direction, this will provide an opposing argument, in favor of <b>green</b> <b>certificates.</b> The report concludes that a clear and consistent policy design is crucial, regardless of the particular instruments chosen.

In the worst case, the car isn't allowed on the road anymore, and has to be repaired immediately. Receiving a red card is not uncommon for older cars, so people often have to go two or more times to pass.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the combination of}} an equilibrium model for electricity- and certificate supply and demand of and real options valuation theory for evaluating the effectiveness of support schemes applied in the electricity market. We study how a <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> scheme affects investment behavior for a potential wind farm. The investor is assumed {{to take into account}} the micro-structural properties of supply and demand through explicitly considering a simultaneous equilibrium in the <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market and the electricity market. The source of uncertainty in the model lies in the investment cost, which is described as a mean reverting process. At any time the investor possesses an option to develop the wind farm or postpone the decision. Regarding future revenues as deterministic and the investment cost as a one-time expense at exercise, we derive a real options-based rule for the optimal investment timing. Using the Swedish/Norwegian <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market as foundation for calibration and focusing on support scheme efficiency, the resulting renewable power development rates are compared to the case where there are no subsidies, as well as the case of a feed-in tariff system. We highlight policy insights from investment aspects that interact with the simultaneous equilibrium in the electricity and <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> markets. We conclude that for the specific goal of boosting investment in production capacity for renewable energy, and within the framework constructed by the assumptions made in this model, the feed-in tariff will perform better than the <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> scheme. </p...|$|E

40|$|The European Union set ambitious goals {{regarding}} {{the production of}} electricity from renewable energy sources {{and the majority of}} European governments have implemented policies stimulating investments in such technologies. Support schemes differ in many aspects, not only in their effectivity and efficiency but also in the long-term incentives provided and in the financial risk involved for investors. This research compares the performance of different policy mechanisms analyzing the interaction between carbon reduction and renewable support policies. Using an agent-based model this research investigates how energy policy affects the investment decisions of generating companies by changing the profit and risk profiles of investment projects. Two econometric analyses are also presented which investigate the behavior of market participants in <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> markets. These studies analyze the impact of regulatory uncertainty on the volatility of <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> markets and the impact of regulatory frameworks on pricing behavior.

40|$|Increased {{competition}} and market integration into a wider geographical context are {{currently on the}} energy- and climate-policy agenda in Northern Europe. It is likely that several energy-and environment-related markets will coexist within a near future, for example markets for electricity and emission permits for CO 2. It is therefore important to increase the understanding of how this policy agenda may affect for example domestic policy-making and how the different energy-related markets interact. This thesis explores consequences of selected energy and climate strategies pursued jointly in the four Nordic countries Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. More specifically, common Nordic markets for electricity, natural gas, tradable CO 2 -emission permits, and tradable <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> have been examined. In analyzing these issues the energy systems in the four Nordic countries were modeled by using the energy systems models MARKAL and NELSON. It is shown in this thesis that increased cross-border cooperation and coordination are valuable under future climate-change mitigation policies. CO 2 -abatement costs may be significantly lowered if the emissions are reduced jointly among the Nordic countries instead of separately. Depending on the investment strategies for a trans-Nordic gas grid, this {{may also be a}} valuable option in a future that includes CO 2 -reduction targets. Correspondingly, a common Nordic market for tradable <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> is also more cost-efficient than if each country has separate markets. This is explained by differences in existing systems and comparative advantages of new renewable electricity production. The interaction between the markets for electricity, tradable emission permits, and tradable <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> is found to be substantial and complex. Even though increased cross-border energy-related trade and increased market integration in terms of extending the geographical boundary are cost-efficient under future climate-change mitigation policies, the importance of technological development is likely to be greater. This is indicated, for instance, in the case of wind power in a Nordic market for tradable <b>green</b> <b>certificates...</b>|$|R
