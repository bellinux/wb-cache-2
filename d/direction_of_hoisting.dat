40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> load on {{transverse}} vibrations <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> catenaries during lifting in {{coal mines}} {{was investigated in}} this study. Firstly, dynamic analyses <b>of</b> the vertical <b>hoisting</b> rope were performed. The results show that transverse vibration plays the dominating role in the coupled dynamics of the vertical rope subjected to external excitation induced by axial fluctuations of head sheave, and the rope tension can be approximated by the quasistatic tension. Secondly, employing dynamic simulations, the effect <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> load on the transverse vibrations <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> catenaries was discussed. The results show that, under the second-order excitation frequency, a discrepant large transverse amplitude will be excited when the hoisting load ranges from 0 to 5000 [*]kg, leading to collision between the two adjacent catenaries and accelerating the rupture of rope. To solve this problem, according to simulation curves, the self-weight of conveyance (preload) can be optimized from 39500 [*]kg to 49500 [*]kg. Eventually, on-site measurements were performed on the studied machine, validating {{the accuracy of the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> load on transverse vibrations <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> catenaries. This investigation will greatly support facility maintenance, machine design, and even engineering optimization for floor type multirope friction mine hoists...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> {{transmission system}} {{on a container}} crane is fundamental for accurate efficiency prediction, while the dynamic efficiency <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> transmission system has not been investigated sufficiently. This paper will focus on dynamic efficiency <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> transmission system under hoisting dynamic load. A power loss model of gearbox was built. Then the dynamic model of gear transmission was developed including time-varying mesh stiffness and hoisting dynamic load was studied. Power loss, dynamic efficiency, and equivalent static efficiency were conducted in hoisting and lowering working conditions. The result shows that dynamic efficiency which consists of the significant lower frequency component coincided with <b>hoisting</b> load torque <b>of</b> the higher frequency component which {{is directly related to}} dynamic mesh and bearing force. And in two processes, the equivalent static efficiency in constant speed stage is min, whereas maximum value occurs in different stage.
