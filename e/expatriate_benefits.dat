Notably, in one survey, a third of the single or divorced women coming to Hong Kong during this period reported previous study abroad experience. Not only were single women more willing to emigrate, but Japanese companies in Hong Kong proved more willing to hire and promote women than those in Japan, partially due to the costs of employing male staff, which typically included allowances for children's education and other such <b>expatriate</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E

They {{do so by}} relaying local information and identifying opportunities that meet internal needs of MNCs. To test hypotheses based on social capital and role theories, we surveyed 232 expatriates. The findings indicated that local experience and the diversity of social networks were conducive to the boundary spanning activities of expatriates, whereas environmental uncertainty and overseas experience had little effect. By engaging in boundary spanning activities, expatriates felt less role ambiguity and gained role benefits, and were more eager to use the resources that were found within different communities of the host country.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the reasons for international assignments ending in failure, using the current models of expatriates’ premature withdrawal decisions, so as develop solutions to those problems. Studies of expatriate failure and effects of expatriate satisfaction on organisational performance have been conducted but most of them in the overseas countries. These studies revealed that the practice of employing expatriates is a strategic move on the part of the multinational corporation to increase the international experience and knowledge base of present and future managers. Even though studies on strategies that companies can use have been done extensively, research still shows that a large number of overseas assignments end in failure. Failure being described as the premature return to the home country, not being able to adjust in the host company or country and immediately living the company upon return from the assignment. It is for this reason that in the researcher decided to investigate what could be the reasons that cause the expatriates to return home early. The research will be of importance to South Africa firstly, as organisations that are operating globally will copy the business systems and processes practiced in developed countries, and later bring knowledge, skills and expertise that will help in boosting the economy of the country. Secondly, the organisation's Human Resource Management will develop practices to ensure the successful and effective retention of expertise. Expatriate failure will be reduced and the process of repatriating expatriates will be meaningful. Individuals assigned will not find it difficult to adjust in the parent company, and later take the skills they have learnt to another company. Thirdly, managers generally will understand the challenges that accompany expatriation, and be able to meet those challenges. The research becomes an investigative research as one tries to establish if there is concurrence or deviation with the current models. A sample is drawn from a list of international companies that have operations overseas. The researcher has tried to get responses from companies in all provinces of South Africa so that the sample can be fully representative. The questionnaire is used as it is a common instrument for observing data beyond the physical reach of the researcher. The questions were selected to address each of the factors affecting decisions to withdraw from the country of assignment. Responses from the expatriates have helped to develop a new model that encompasses all the factors that cause the expatriates to leave the assignment early as well to develop solutions to the problems. This will not only help the multinational corporations to save on costs, but will also ensure that the company and the <b>expatriate</b> <b>benefit</b> from international assignment...|$|R
40|$|Although {{effective}} in improving socialization, development, and retention in the US domestic context, mentoring would likely <b>benefit</b> <b>expatriates</b> and their firms, {{but it remains}} theoretically underdeveloped in the international context. We develop a theory of international mentoring by integrating current perspectives on protean and boundaryless careers with the literature on mentoring and expatriates. Expatriates need multiple mentors to assist their adjustment and development during the pre-departure, expatriation, and repatriation stages of international assignments. We discuss both hierarchical and peer, and formal and informal, mentoring relationships to delineate which relationships best address specific expatriate needs. International mentoring may improve expatriate adjustment, development, and retention, and thus may affect outcomes of international strategy.

40|$|Since {{the first}} studies on {{expatriate}} gender diversity were conducted, men have comprised {{the majority of}} expatriates (Altman and Shortland, 2008). Although around one-quarter of expatriate roles are held by women today (Brookfield, 2016), the male-dominated picture of expatriate gender diversity looks set to continue. Gender diversity in expatriation is regarded as an asset to business given women’s success in their international assignments (Shortland, 2016) and, as such, various studies have explored why women’s expatriation remains low in comparison to men’s. Issues identified as having some bearing include: women’s choices and family constraints; organisational decision-making (for example in selection, and {{in relation to their}} human and social capital); societal cultural explanations; and institutional effects, such as gendered labour market structures (Shortland, 2014). Yet, currently there is little published research on the effects of international reward and how this might affect the gendered nature of expatriation (Shortland and Perkins, 2016). This chapter therefore sets out to address this issue. It examines which elements of international assignment reward policy and practice have the strongest influence on women’s acceptance of international assignments, and of different lengths and patterns of expatriation. Reflecting its exploratory nature, this research employs a case study design (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2009). It is set in the oil and gas exploration and production sector. This industry is selected because it uses large and increasing numbers of expatriates (Air Inc., 2016, 2017), is known for its relatively attractive provision of <b>expatriate</b> compensation and <b>benefits</b> (IDS, 2002), and yet has low expatriate gender diversity (ORC Worldwide, 2007). This study sets out to identify the main reward policy items that women regard as critical preconditions to assignment acceptance and to outline recommendations to employers where policy and practice improvements might make a difference to increasing expatriate gender diversity across a range of assignment types. In this way it contributes both to our knowledge of expatriate reward and to our understanding of women’s expatriate representation. The study sets out to address the following research question: to what extent and how do the elements of international assignment reward policy support women’s expatriation in different assignment lengths and patterns...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTTraffic Safety {{has been}} internationally {{recognized}} as a primary strategic goal in many societies. Traffic safety concept {{is not limited to}} the reduction of road accidents issue. It aims to initiate/create the right road safety behavior by setting all necessary educational, engineering and medical programs and plans, traffic regulations, and preventive measures. This would reduce or prevent accidents, ensure human and properties' safety, and preserve the human and economic wealth of the nation. Traffic safety issue should be considered as a national issue as it is strongly related to all aspects of life and has a close link with the protection and sustaining the natural environment. Road accidents are one of the most serious issues facing developed and developing countries. A report published in 2009 by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that some 1. 2 million people were killed, and between 20 and 50 million suffer non-fatal injuries in traffic collisions on the roads around the world each year. The report illustrated that these collisions were the leading cause of death among children between 10 and 19 years of age. It also noted that the problem was most severe in developing countries [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipates road accidents to be the third cause of death among the fifteen causes of death in 2020 [2]. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, rates of road accidents on the road networks have increased dramatically. It has become a phenomenon affecting negatively all sectors of the society. It causes human suffering to individuals, and huge financial losses to the state and public as a result of accidents and deaths, injuries and disabilities. More than 6, 000 people die and 35, 000 people get injured every year, and the economic losses exceed 13 billion Riyals annually. Therefore, the concerted efforts of the society and the governmental and private organizations are necessary to improve road safety system, reduce the number of, and minimize fatalities and injuries [3]. The aim of this special issue is to present a number of Saudi and international experiences concerning traffic safety issue. Through this special issue, we aim to collect multidisciplinary research outcomes that address the relation between traffic safety and various factors that impact safety such as: road networks' engineering, management and control of the traffic system, planning and strategies, transportation systems, citizens' education, knowledge and behavior. The authors in this special issue have suggested a number of solutions to improve traffic safety and reduce fatalities. Altwaijri, Quddus and Bristow emphasized the importance of adopting safety strategies that consider various segments of the society. They suggested that greater emphasis should be put on native (i. e. Saudis) residents; and further emphasis on older age groups [4]. Ali and Tayfour recommended the implementation of efficient speed control, mandatory use of safety belts, proper training of drivers, and rigorous licensing. Also, driver behavior should be controlled and pedestrian crossing should be carefully planned and implemented [5]. Reffat argued that the use of an intelligent real-time virtual environment system would help in improving crowd management and facilitating efficient and timely vehicle traffic movement [6]. Elhamy advocated the reduction of the speed limit of roads, the improvement of pedestrian access and mobility, monitoring the compliance with traffic law. This could help reduce potential behavior that leads to crashes [7]. Ebrahim and Nikraz highlighted the importance of knowing how road users think in terms of speed reduction. This would lead to in-depth understanding of some of the unsafe behaviour that relates to risky speed against pedestrians. It is essential to educate <b>expatriates</b> about the <b>benefit</b> of adopting a lower speed limit thus avoiding possible crashes [8]. Finally, the guest editors of this special issue would like to thank the chief editors of the International Journal of Transportation Science and Technology for giving them a chance to publish these papers through the journal...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Turizm sektörünün yön verdiği otel piyasası Türkiye’de ve İstanbul’da giderek önem kazanmakta; İstanbul’u diğer dünya metropolleri arasında önemli bir konuma taşımaktadır. 2010 yılında İstanbul Avrupa Kültür Başkenti seçilerek ilgi odağı olmaya devam etmiştir ve milyonlarca turiste ev sahipliği yapmıştır. Otel yatırım grupları ve uluslararası markalar İstanbul’un artan önemi sonucunda otel pazarından kendilerine düşen payı almak için rekabet etmektedirler. İstanbul’da ve bölgesel olarak Şişli Mecidiyeköy’de şehir oteli yatırımlarının doygunluğa ulaşmamış olması ve piyasaya yeni uluslararası zincir markaların girecek olması nedeni ile bölgenin otel yatırım potansiyeli artmaktadır. Otel pazarının ülkemizdeki gelişme sürecini gayrimenkul geliştirme boyutları ile inceleyen çalışma kapsamında, otel pazarına ilişkin genel kavramlar açıklanmış, otel sektörünün gelişim süreci incelenmiş, Şişli- Mecidiyeköy bölgesi için rekabet alanları belirlenerek gelecek yatırımlara ışık tutacak analizlere yer verilmiştir. Rekabet alanı içerisinde etkin şekilde yer alan oteller ile etkileşim alanı içinde kalan otellerin yatırım değerine etki eden işletme performansları değerlendirilmiştir. Bölge otel tesisleri açısından oldukça gelişmiş olmakla birlikte ağırlıklı olarak yerel markaların etkisi altındadır ve uluslararası çaptaki otel markalarının varlığından yoksun durumdadır. Bu yapısından dolayı Şişli-Mecidiyeköy bölgesi uluslar arası otel yatırım grupları tarafından cazip bir bölge konumundadır. Çalışmanın hazırlık aşamasında yapılan literatür araştırmaları sonucunda otel yatırımları için sektörel pazarın gelişimi ve gayrimenkul geliştirme ile ilgili kavramsal açıklamalara ulaşılmıştır. Otel işletmeleriyle ve yatırımcılarıyla yapılan görüşmeler, turizm sektöründe yer alan derneklerin ve kuruluşların görüşleri doğrultusunda Şişli Mecidiyeköy bölgesi için gelecek otellere yönelik analizlere yer verilmiştir. Yatırımcılar bir gayrimenkul projesine yatırım yapmadan önce bölgedeki pazarı iyi bilmek isterler. Çalışmanın son bölümünde Şişli- Mecidiyeköy Merkezi İş Alanı için otel pazarı rekabet analizlerine ve yeni otel yatırımları için bilgi kaynağı olacak yönetimsel verilere ulaşılmıştır. İstanbul Şişli Mecidiyeköy bölgesinin değerlendirilmesinde öne çıkan pazar analizinin önemine ve otel yatırım potansiyeline değinilmiştir. Bölgenin henüz istenen düzeyde yatırımı kendisine çekmemiş olması ve İstanbul’daki ziyaretçi sayısındaki artış ile yükselen talep miktarı bölgenin değerinin artmasına neden olmaktadır. Sonuç bölümünde ise kavramsal tanımlar, uygulanan örnekler ve çalışma alanı ile ilgili yapılan pazar analizleri doğrultusunda bölgede otel yatırım kararına yön verecek değerlendirmeler yapılmıştır. Hotel market which tourism {{industry}} leads, gain more importance in Turkey and İstanbul; promoting İstanbul {{to an important}} position in between world metropolitan cities. Hotel investor groups and international brands compete {{against each other in}} order to get located in İstanbul’s hotel market. İstanbul especially Şişli Mecidiyeköy district is not a mature market yet, therefore the hotel investment potential of the area is increasing due to entrance of new brands to the market. Within the context of the thesis study, hotel market is being analysed as part of real estate development process in Turkey. General notions related with hotel market are explained and the the competitive market of Şişli- Mecidiyeköy district is defined. According to these definitions; statistical analysis has been made which will direct to an investment in the specified market. Şişli Mecidiyeköy district is an obviously developed region whereas it is dominantly effected by local hotel brands and lack of international companies. Because of this structure and location the area is highly preferable for investment opportunities. In conclusion of literature analysis made during thesis study, general notions and development principles of hotel investments are explained. The interviews made by hotel managers, investors and estimation of tourism associations lead the analysis put out for Şişli Mecidiyeköy central business district. Investors need to know the market snapshot of investment area before they start a project. Therefore managerial informations and statistical analysis reached for the competitive market of Şişli Mecidiyeköy region in {{the last part of the}} study. In addition to all these analysis; the importance of market analyses on investment decisions has been revealed. The macroeconomic climate in which a hotel operates is an important consideration in forecasting hotel demand and income potential. Economic and demographic trends that reflect the amount of visitation provide a basis on which the demand for hotel accommodation can be projected. The market area for a hotel encompasses not only its immediate surroundings, but also the geographic regions where the sources of transient accommodation (demand) and the competitive supply are located. A lodging facility’s market area is generally defined as the geographical area of influence surrounding the property. In most instances, this area also encompasses the hotel’s demand generators and competitive lodging facilities. The purpose of the market area analysis is to review available economic and demographic data to determine whether the defined market area will undergo economic growth, stability or decline. In addition to a prediction of the direction of the economy, the rate of charge must be quantified. These trends are then correlated based on their propensity to reflect variations in hotel demand with the objective of forecasting the amount of growth or decline in transient by individual market segment. Despite the start of the global economic downturn, the Turkish {{tourism industry}} managed to grow in 2010 and record its best year. The outlook also appears very strong and the industry is expected to support Turkey’s future GDP growth by creating new jobs and improving the country’s balance of payments. Total tourist arrivals have increased from approximately 13 million in 2002 to over 28 million in 2010, achieving a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10. 1 %. International tourist arrivals reached an all-time record of 28. 6 million in 2010 and the total number of international visitors, crossing national borders of Turkey, has been increased by 5. 7 % compared to 2009 despite the unstable global economic environment. In total, international tourist arrivals have recorded a vigorous growth of 116 % over the last nine years. Turkey has seen a marked increase in foreign visitation during last few years and it has established a strong position as a business and holiday destination, providing a wide range of year-round tourism facilities. Although total visitation is highest during the summer months. The government has set policy to give priority to developing the infastructure, which will greatly aid the ongoing development of toursim in the country. Tourism now accounts for the second- largest source of foreign exchange earnings in Turkey. As a whole, İstanbul is expected to remain the hearth of the country when it comes to both leisure and business activities. By improving economic conditions, the increasing urbanisation rate, growth in the construction sector and increasing foreign residential investment provide a positive outlook in the area and future economic growth. From 1980 to 2007, the city’s popoulation has increased by more than four times (about 11 million inhabitants in 2007), largely driven by unemployment-related migration flows from the southeast of Turkey. The rate of population growth in the cityis at around 4 a year on average, mainly on account of the influx of people from the surrounding rural areas while it also benefits from influx related to the development of international companies and <b>expatriates.</b> The market <b>benefits</b> from a variety of tourist and leisure attractions in the area. İstanbul is one of the most important tourism destinations in Turkey. Apart from the sites that mostly attract leisure tourists the city is also attracting a big number of corporate travellers that visit the city for business purposes. The Sisli and Maslak line,financial districts,are home to the headquarters of Turkey’s largest companies and banks. Both Sisli and Maslak have a constantly growing and changing dynamic skyline with several new skyscraper projects being proposed, approved and initiated every year. To determine the effective relevance of the domestic market and the international source countries, an analysis of visitation to the region has been performed. In 2010, the city was chosen as European Capital of Culture in 2010, a sign of its integration into Europe and its growing importance on the international travel due to its vigorous economic growth the last decade, is also a convenient leisure destination owing to its continental weather with soft winters and warm summers. The existance of convention and congress spaces in a city plays a major role in attracting the so called MICE segment of tourists. Demand in this segment is generated primarily by local, regional and international companies holding training sessions, conferences, product launches and small meetings as well as by incentive and association meetings held at several venues. Currently, istanbul is quite strongly positioned as a particularly known destination for MICE business especially taking into consideration the country’s low ranking a decade ago. Most of the city’s upscale hotels offer numerous meeting and conference spaces whereas there are also several congress and exhibition centers that are able to attract world class conferences. The 2023 Tourism strategy, which touches on all key areas of travel and tourism in Turkey, is directly impacting city tourism to İstanbul. Solid growth of airport arrivals, and number of routes and airlines together with a series of improvements of the transportation system at city level, diversity of cultural and natural centers of interest; the city is suitable for diverse age segments and travel purposes. Growing presence of International hotel brands supporting the growth of international visitations, increasing investments and presence of international companies’ offices in İstanbul. Expansion of existing business parks on both European and Asian sides. An integral component of a market area’s supply and demand relationship that has a direct impact on the proposed hotel’s operating performance is the current and anticipated supply of competitive hotels. From an evaluation of the occupancy, rate structure, market orientation, chain affiliation, location, facilities, amenities, reputation and quality of the area’s hotels, as well as comments by management representatives of existing hotels, the primary location for the proposed area is Taksim. The current hotel product is high in quality and in service but they do not benefit any kind of international exposure because of their local character. Most probably the impact on new upcoming international brands will undermine the existing local brands with lower occupancies or lower average rates. Currently, the area of Sisli does not feature any significant international hotel brand. The area is quite developed in terms of hotel facilities but it lacks the extensive presence of hotels of international caliber. However, some local players could not be ignored when examining the competitive dynamics of the market due to their close proximity to the proposed area. What is more, there are some local players with a presence of two hotels in the city, a business model which is very successful in İstanbul. According to literature investigations, sample modeling and market analyses made on Şişli Mecidiyeköy central business district; the potential of investment area is evaluated which will lead to a new hotel investment in the region.
