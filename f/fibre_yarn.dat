40|$|Abstract We {{report that}} a {{prestressing}} technique {{similar to that}} traditionally used in prestressed concrete can improve the mechanical performance of flax fibre spun yarn reinforced polymer-matrix composites. Prestressing a low twist yarn not only introduces tension to the constituent fibres and compressive stress to the matrix similar as in prestressed concretes, but also causes changes to the yarn structure {{that lead to the}} rearrangement of fibres within the yarn. Prestressing increases the fibre packing density in yarn, causes fibre straightening, and reduces fibre obliquity in yarn (improved fibre alignment along yarn axis). All these changes contribute positively to the mechanical properties of the natural <b>fibre</b> <b>yarn</b> reinforced composites. Crow...|$|E
40|$|A {{calculation}} {{equation of}} the fibre {{number on the}} cross-section of ring-spun yarn was de-duced theoretically and verified with test data of 20 representative pure cotton ring spun yarns. The equation is practical and convenient to use by substituting the yarn count, <b>yarn</b> twist, and <b>fibre</b> decitex. On {{the basis of the}} above equation, a yarn strength predication model was established. The revising functions of yarn count and twist to yarn strength were deduced in practical tests of the strength of 20 commonly used ring-spun yarns, and were used to revise the yarn strength predication model obtained. Substituting the fibre decitex, <b>fibre</b> strength, <b>yarn</b> count, yarn twist and yarn strength can be precisely calculated with this model.

30|$|Most {{numerical}} attempts considering {{mechanical behaviour}} of braided composites are developed from previous FE schemes for laminates and, in some cases, woven textile composites. Such studies mainly focus on predicting effective elastic moduli and tensile strength of braided composites (Rawal et al. 2015). In order to study their mechanical response including final failure, an accurate model should {{account for the}} dominant damage mechanisms (e.g., fibre fracture, fibre kinking, matrix cracking and delamination) and complex interactions among them. Furthermore, it is preferred for damage models to capture the effects of interlacing and undulation of <b>fibre</b> <b>yarns</b> in meso-scale unit cells. This section introduces some recent predictive models developed by various authors to evaluate damage of braided composites under static loading.|$|R

40|$|A queuing {{model of}} staple yarn {{structure}} {{was presented in}} Part I of this work, where the migration behaviours of fibres were simulated by the movement of customers in a Markovian network of queuing systems. Part II of the series proposes (i) a multi-dimensional minimization method for estimating the migration probabilities of fibres based on {{the analysis of the}} distribution of number of <b>fibres</b> in <b>yarn</b> cross-sections; (ii) a yarn structure simulation algorithm which uses the migration probabilities of <b>fibres,</b> <b>yarn</b> technical specifications (e. g. linear density and twist) and colour composition to produce a realistic three-dimensional image of a melange yarn.
