50|$|This {{led to a}} tag team match, where The Beautiful People {{defeated}} Kim and Brittany on the May 29 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling. After the match, the storyline between Brittany and Madison developed into a lesbian angle with Brittany <b>enamoring</b> <b>of</b> Rayne which made her feel uncomfortable. Brittany made an appearance during Rayne's rematch for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship against Love on the June 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, which Rayne would lose after a distraction provided by Sky, and Brittany just standing there. On the July 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Brittany turned heel after attacking Rayne and vowing to destroy her. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, the evil Brittany once again challenged for the Knockouts Championship in a four-way match, losing to defending champion Gail Kim. The feud between Brittany and Rayne culminated in a No count-out, No Disqualification match on the July 17 episode of Impact Wrestling, which was won by Rayne, further continuing her losing streak since her debut match.|$|R
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs {{for a better life}} in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to the}} city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E
5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E

5|$|The odd {{relationship}} between Stratus and James continued into 2006, {{with the two}} Divas competing {{against each other in}} a title match at New Year's Revolution, where Stratus emerged victorious. Despite the defeat, James continued to be <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> Stratus which made her feel uncomfortable, and on March 6, Stratus confronted James, telling her that she needed space. The duo briefly reconciled on the March 18 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, teaming together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria; however, after the match, James turned on Stratus and attacked her. A match at WrestleMania 22 saw Stratus lose the Women's Championship to James, ending her 448-day reign. The match, at the time, was widely {{recognized as one of the}} best women's matches in the company. During a rematch at Backlash, Stratus suffered a legitimate dislocated shoulder after taking a bump to the outside of the ring. While she was rehabilitating for six weeks, she continued to appear on-screen.|$|E
5|$|Through 1971, it was {{uncertain}} if Agnew would be retained {{on the ticket}} as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid {{at the start of}} 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.|$|E

6000|$|I stood {{upon the}} spot consecrated by this memorable interview. Below me {{extended}} the [...] "living landscape," [...] once contemplated by the loving pair; the gentle valley of Newstead, diversified by woods and corn-fields, and village spires, and gleams of water, {{and the distant}} towers and pinnacles of the venerable Abbey. The diadem of trees, however, was gone. The attention drawn to it by the poet, and the romantic manner {{in which he had}} associated it with his early passion for Mary Chaworth, had nettled the irritable feelings of her husband, who but ill brooked the poetic celebrity conferred on his wife by the <b>enamored</b> verses <b>of</b> another. The celebrated grove stood on his estate, and in a fit of spleen he ordered it to be levelled with the dust. At the time of my visit the mere roots of the trees were visible; but the hand that laid them low is execrated by every poetical pilgrim.|$|R

5000|$|The {{early years}} of the 17th century saw Morton {{traveling}} between London and the Devonshire countryside as the legal champion of displaced countrymen [...] "whose economic straits filled new tent-cities, furnished prisons and gallows, and pushed Devon men to the Bristol sea-trades". He eventually settled into the service of Ferdinando Gorges, the governor of the English port of Plymouth and a major colonial entrepreneur. Gorges, who was an associate of Sir Walter Raleigh and had been part of Robert Devereux's Essex Conspiracy, was heavily involved in the [...] "permissive" [...] economy of the seas, and with many interests in New England was to become the founder of the colony of Maine. Morton initially served him in a legal capacity in England, but following failed marriage plans in 1618 (due to the influence of a Puritan stepson) he decided to become one of Gorges' [...] "landsmen" [...] to oversee his interests in the colonies.

40|$|The great {{conversion}} about America {{that took}} place in European letters throughout the nineteenth century was characterized by a marked tendency towards polarization and routinely cast the NewWorld either as a “dream” or a “nightmare” (Arendt). This polarization was due in part, especially {{in the first half of}} the century, to the relative scarcity of reliable information about the United States. Yet the main reason was that writers and intellectuals tended to approach America strictly in Eurocentric terms, perceiving this country, not in its own right, but as a foil for political and social issues within a European setting; those with a liberal outlook, for example, tended to extol America as a way of implicitly criticizing the prevailing conditions in Europe, whereas conservatives, for the opposite reason, often opted for a strongly dismissive attitude. In the absence of sustained, dispassionate enquiry, the European image of America, not least in the context of fictional literature, remained a battleground of opposing mythologies, pitting <b>enamored</b> accounts <b>of</b> American freedom and authenticity against glum visions of moral and cultural decay...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: N−N-linked dimeric indole {{alkaloids}} rep-resent an unexplored {{class of}} natural products for which chemical synthesis has no practical solution.

This method is also general for N−N dimerization of substituted carbazoles and β-carbolines, providing entry into seldom explored chemical space. Synthetic chemists have long been <b>enamored</b> by thestructures <b>of</b> oligomeric indole alkaloids. The myriad different C−C (e. g., 1, Figure 1 A) and C−N (e. g., 2) linkages have inspired the development of numerous elegant methods to enable their chemical production. 1 Recently, the atropisomeric indoloterpenoid natural products dixiamycins A and B were isolated independently by Zhang and Hertweck (3 a/b). 2 Thes...|$|R

Bryant's former players and fans have named their children Bryant, Paul, Bear and even Paula after Coach Bryant. Every September the Paul W. Bryant Museum hosts a namesake reunion and there are over 600 namesakes that have attended this annual event. The oldest namesake (besides Coach Bryant's son Paul Bryant, Jr.) is Bryant Darrell Brown, son of Junction Survivor Darrell Brown who, due to being academically ineligible to play in 1956, surprised even Coach Bryant when he came back to play his last year of eligibility on Texas A&M's 1957 team which was ranked #1 at the time Coach Bryant accepted Alabama's offer. Darrell was the only Junction Boy to also play in Coach Bryant's last season at Texas A&M. Darrell Brown's grandson, Bryant Andrew Brown is a second generation Bryant namesake.
