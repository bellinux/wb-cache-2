5000|$|Ideally, {{the primary}} and {{secondary}} currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees. [...] For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display {{the magnitude of the}} current. However, in wattmeters, <b>energy</b> <b>meters,</b> and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power factor, any indicated power is entirely due to the current transformer's phase error. [...] The introduction of electronic power and <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out.|$|E
