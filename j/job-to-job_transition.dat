The job-finding and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates are strongly procyclical and the separation rate is nearly acyclical, especially since 1985. The author develops a simple model in which unemployed workers search for jobs and employed workers search for better jobs.

30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> which are {{compared}} to movements {{into and out of}} the state of employment. The monthly rate of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> of   1.1 % (West) and   1.2 % (East) are in the same range for West Germany as those found by Bachmann (2005). These transition rates are the largest in West and East Germany. However, these <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> are lower than those found for the U.S. Most importantly, <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> tend to be more frequent than either transition to unemployment or to nonparticipation. Consequently, a  comprehensive analysis of German labor-market dynamics needs to take them into account. In the following subsections, we will look more closely at the anatomy of job-to-job flows with respect to age, gender and skills, job tenure, and over the economic cycle.|$|R
40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION The rate of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> {{is twice}} as large today as {{the rate at which}} work-ers move from {{employment}} to unemployment. I demonstrate that, under plausible specifications, the basic job-ladder model — the workhorse model of the literature on on-the-job search — has no chance of matching the extent of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions.</b> Moreover, it cannot account for the low search effort exerted by most employed work-ers and the observation that on-the-job search is a means to “escape ” unemployment: it is undertaken exactly by those workers who are facing the threat of becoming un-employed. I develop an alternative theoretical framework that can quantitatively match salient features of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions.</b> The model incorporates a stochastic process that causes the value of a job to the worker to decrease at times, predicting that workers with a lower job value have a higher probability of entering unemployment. This natural feature is not in standard models. A second important element of the model is endogenous search effort, explaining the low search effort exerted by many employed workers and the correlation between search effort and the probability of becoming unemployed observed in the data. Calculating the equilibrium of the model shows that it can successfully account for the stylized facts on <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions.</b> I also demonstrate that the model can account for observed differences in the extent of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> across demographic groups...|$|R

40|$|I {{develop a}} stylized partial on-the-job {{equilibrium}} search model which incorporate a spatial dimension. Workers reside on {{a circle and}} can move at a cost. Each point on the circle has a wage distribution. Implications about wages and job mobility are drawn from the model and tested on Danish matched employer-employee data. The model predictions hold true. I find that workers working farther away from their residence earn higher wages. When a worker is making a <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> where he changes workplace location he experiences a higher wage change than a worker making a <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> without changing workplace location. However, workers making a <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> which makes the workplace location closer to the residence experiences a wage drop. Furthermore, low wage workers and workers with high transportation costs {{are more likely to}} make job-to-job transitions, but also residential moves. ob mobility, residential mobility, wage dynamics, search...|$|E
30|$|These {{findings}} supplement {{findings for}} job-loss and re-employment rates. They also confirm {{the findings of}} earlier studies that re-employment rate and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates are large and procyclical. However, {{our findings suggest that}} young workers, old workers, and high-skilled workers are less sensitive to the cycle than the core group, while the <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates of unskilled and female workers are strongly procyclical. Thus, the search and matching models are more relevant for unskilled workers and women, searching actively for a  new job while they are employed, than for old workers. Women and unskilled workers are therefore more likely to realize low-quality matches than other worker groups.|$|E
30|$|We track each spell to {{the point}} of {{transition}} or {{to the end of the}} observation period. In the case of employment spells, each uncensored job spell is identified as either a layoff, a quit, a <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> to a permanent contract (hereafter JJ–PC) or a <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> to a temporary contract (hereafter JJ–TC). 13 We include transitions with an observed unemployment spell of 15 days or less within job-to-job transitions. To avoid odd behaviour in the estimated baseline hazard functions due to the scarcity of observations spanning longer durations, we right-censored any observed spells of unemployment longer than or equal to 36  months and any observed spell of employment longer than or equal to 120  months.|$|E

30|$|The {{estimated}} {{coefficients for}} the GDP growth {{in the analysis of}} <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> are insignificant for West and East Germany. This finding is in contrast with findings for the U.S. (e.g., Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001), which indicates that <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> are procyclical. However, this model only captures the influence of contemporaneous GDP growth and assumes symmetric and linear influence of GDP growth on the transition rates. Therefore, we apply the second model described above which is more flexible in modeling cyclical behavior.|$|R

The cyclical properties of worker flows between employment and unemployment {{differ from those of}} job flows, partly {{because of the presence of}} job-tojob transitions. We also show, however, that job flows measured by net employment changes differ significantly from total worker separation and accession rates, because separations also occur at firms with positive net employment changes, and similarly firms that are shrinking on net may hire workers to partially offset attritions. The presence of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> is the key to producing these differences...|$|R
3000|$|These {{findings}} supplement {{those of}} Kluve et  al. (2009) using the SOEP for job-loss and re-employment rates. They also confirm {{the findings of}} earlier studies (Bachmann 2005; Nagypál 2008) that [...] re-employment rate and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates are large and procyclical. However, {{our findings suggest that}} young workers, old workers, and high-skilled workers are less sensitive to the cycle than the core group, while the <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates of unskilled and female workers are strongly procyclical. Thus, the modified search and matching models of Hall (2005) and Shimer (2005) are more relevant for unskilled workers and women, searching actively for a  new job while they are employed, than for old workers. Women and unskilled workers are therefore more likely to realize low-quality matches than other worker groups.|$|E
30|$|Besides the {{transitions}} between unemployment and employment, {{the transitions}} between different jobs are also of interest {{since they have}} some influence on the wage distribution. Fitzenberger and Garloff (2007) find for Germany that job-to-job transitions lead to wage gains for most movers. Nagypál (2008) and Fallick and Fleischmann (2004) find, when using the Current Population Survey (CPS) in the U.S., these transitions to be quite frequent with   2.4 % and   2.6 % per month, respectively. <b>Job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> intensities in the U.S. are therefore {{more than twice as}} high as transitions from employment to unemployment. The findings for the yearly U.S. job-to-job rates differ across various studies. Royalty (1998) finds a  transition rate of   16 % for women and   20 % for men with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths. Blanchard and Diamond (1990) observe a  mean rate of   12 % for the years 1975 – 1985 using the CPS, while Stewart (2002) reports   8.6 % to   13.7 % for the years 1975 – 2000. In contrast, Bachmann (2005) observes a  monthly <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rate of only   0.82 % for West Germany using the IAB employment subsample (IABS). Using the same data, Fitzenberger and Garloff (2007) observe a  yearly <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rate of   7.72 %. This rate is lower than the findings for the U.S. but also higher than the corresponding transition intensity from employment to unemployment.|$|E
30|$|Table  14 {{also shows}} that, as expected, {{the number of}} job interruptions {{negatively}} affects future employment stability because the outflow from unemployment decreases and that the probabilities of being laid off or experiencing a <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> to a new temporary contract increase considerably. The largest effect is found for layoffs. For example, the monthly layoff probability increases from 4.35  % for one job interruption to 6.43  % for six job interruptions.|$|E
30|$|Besides {{the effect}} that workers with a  short job tenure {{are more likely to}} have <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions,</b> our results {{indicate}} that those workers are even more influenced by the cycle than workers with longer tenure.|$|R
30|$|In East Germany, {{there are}} no {{significant}} differences between the demographic groups except for women who experience a  more pronounced development in <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> than the core group. The fact that the estimated coefficients are mainly insignificant may be due to the short observation period for East Germany.|$|R
30|$|The {{attempt to}} realize a dynamic labor market implied a market with reduced {{individual}} dismissal rigidities and shortened school-to-work and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions,</b> again {{to be realized}} by more effective active policies, a better coordination between state and regional interventions and {{between public and private}} providers of employment services.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the job-to-job {{transitions}} in Bachmann (2005) differ between industries and sexes. Men experience higher job-to-job transitions than women. Similar to Bookmann and Steffes (2008), {{he finds that}} transition rates differ between education groups and that younger workers have the highest job-to-job transitions. In addition, Bookmann and Steffes (2008) show, by using linked employer–employee data, {{that the existence of}} a  works council and investment in further training reduce the <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rate.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, we {{emphasize}} {{the heterogeneity of}} cyclical influences for different subgroups of workers, defined by age, gender and skills, and focus on job-to-job transitions which are, in fact, {{found to be the}} largest flows in the German labor market. The findings suggest that job-to-job transitions are procyclical. The empirical framework employed here allows demographic groups to vary in their cyclical sensitivity. Female and unskilled workers experience more pronounced swings than the core group of medium-skilled, medium-aged men. By contrast, the <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates of high-skilled workers, old workers, as well as young workers are less influenced by cyclical behavior.|$|E
30|$|Next, {{we focus}} on the {{coefficient}} estimates for benefit entitlement duration. Table  6 shows that these coefficient estimates are statistically significant and have the expected sign for temporary contracts. In particular, these coefficient estimates show that lengthier benefit periods seem to favour employment stability, because outflows to unemployment decrease and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> flows increase. These results are consistent with the models of Marimon and Zilibotti (1999) and Acemoglu and Shimer (2000) and with the results presented in Belzil (2001), Centeno (2004) and Tatsiramos (2009). In contrast, coefficient estimates are not always statistically significant for the sample of permanent contracts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} data on job exits and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> from a new source [...] the 1986 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).

However, this detail also means that using the data is more complicated. The labor market content of the data set and major measurement issues involved in its use are discussed here. Thereafter, first-round findings from an ongoing study of job exits-and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> using SIPP are presented. of particular interest are findings on sensitivity to measurement decisions.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the above-mentioned studies which use the German Socioeconomic Panel, we use a  very large micro dataset provided by the research institute of the Federal Employment Agency, the IAB employment subsample (IABS). The data allows us to distinguish <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> on a  daily basis. Besides heterogeneity between demographic groups which is controlled for, we take job tenure into account since Jung and Kuhn (2009) show that   75 % of all quits are by workers with tenure of less than two years. In {{contrast to}} Schmidt (2000), the analysis pays {{particular attention to the}} question of whether the cyclical behavior of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> differs across demographic groups and tenure. Furthermore, the findings are compared to the sensitivity of other transition intensities. To compare the cyclical sensitivity between different transition rates, a  similar approach is undertaken for the job-finding and job-loss rate.|$|R
40|$|We use a large linked employer-employee {{data set}} {{to analyze the}} {{importance}} of relative wage positions {{in the context of}} individual quit decisions as an inverse measure of job satisfaction.

In addition, a 1 percent increase in the unemployment rate leads to 2 percent decrease in the <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> probability. Furthermore, despite the institutional differences between countries, there are remarkable similarities in individuals ’ mobility behaviour.

The results show that jobs preceded by unemployment tend to be shorter but also reveal {{a substantial amount of}} heterogeneity when the sample is split between those having comparative advantages in unemployed search and those with comparative advantages in employed search. However, even for those who have comparative advantages in unemployed search, choosing unemployment does not seem to raise subsequent job duration. ...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{cyclical}} {{aspects of}} worker reallocation are investigated in numerous studies, only scarce empirical evidence exists for Germany. Kluve, Schaffner, and Schmidt (2009) emphasize {{the heterogeneity of}} cyclical influences for different subgroups of workers, defined by age, gender and skills. This paper contributes to this literature by extending this analysis to job-to-job flows. In fact, <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> {{are found to be}} the largest flows in the German labor market. The findings suggest that job-finding rates and <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> are procyclical while separation rates are acyclical or even countercyclical. The empirical framework employed here allows demographic groups to vary in their cyclical sensitivity. In Germany, young workers have the highest transition rates into and out of employment and between different jobs. Additionally, these transitions are more volatile than those of medium- aged or old workers. By contrast, old workers experience low transition rates and less pronounced swings than the core group of medium-aged, medium- skilled men.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cyclical properties of employment rates {{in a search}} and matching model that features heterogeneous workers and jobs. I capture heterogeneity by postulating two skill levels: high and low. All low-skill workers can produce in only low-skill jobs, whereas some high-skill workers can produce in both high-and low-skill jobs. My analysis {{highlights the importance of}} a vertical type of transitory skill mismatch, in which workers accept jobs below their skill level to escape unemployment and upgrade by on-the-job search, in explaining why employment is typically lower and more procyclical at lower skill levels. The model is also consistent with other important features of the labor market, such as a procyclical rate of <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> and evidence on cyclical changes in the composition of job quality. In recessions outflows from unemployment shift the distribution of high-skill workers toward low-skill jobs, while expansions allow them to upgrade to high-skill jobs through <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} an overview of labor market transition rates and the wage structure of the German labor market. We use a comprehensive German register dataset that is representative for a vast majority of the German workforce. Motivated by search theory, we use this administrative dataset to explore descriptively labor market transitions and features of the wage structure. Equilibrium search theory suggests that the wage distribution in a cross section of workers is closely related to the dynamics of the labor market. Since <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> are central in this context, we examine them in detail. We find that the rate at which individuals change jobs varies substantially over the business cycle and with characteristics of the individuals. Further, we find that wage changes following <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> are considerable, that most individuals gain notably but also that a considerable amount of individuals incurs a remarkable loss. Other rates are shown to vary considerably over the business cycle and over demographic characteristics, too. Examining the wage structure, we look at determinants of changes in the position of the wage distribution and find that <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions,</b> age and education have strong effects on wage mobility. While we cannot detect structural parameters, we conclude from our analysis that indeed a close relationship exists between wages and labor market transitions as predicted by search theory. However, the share of losers following job-to-job changes seems to contradict a simple search theoretic perspective. For future work, this suggests to concentrate on more elaborated models in empirical analysis...|$|R
30|$|The {{cyclical}} {{relationship is}} modeled for the {{core group of}} male, medium-aged, medium-skilled workers. The sensitivity of all other groups is then modeled as the deviation from this core group. Our results indicate that women and unskilled workers are more influenced in their <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rate by the cycle than the core group. In contrast, high-skilled, young, or old workers are less influenced by the business cycle. However, the sensitivity is even reversed for women, young, and old workers regarding their job-loss rates (flows from employment to unemployment). Additionally allowing for differences in cyclical sensitivity depending on job tenure, {{the results indicate that}} workers with a  short job tenure are the most influenced by the cycle while workers with a  long job tenure experience less pronounced swings.|$|E
3000|$|Germany {{has been}} {{suffering}} from high unemployment rates {{for the last two}} decades, accompanied by a  low GDP growth. Especially in some regions of East Germany, the unemployment rate has persistently been higher than   20 %. In recent years, GDP growth has risen and unemployment has declined. Yet, people of different ages and different skill levels apparently benefit differently from this improved economic situation. This impression prompted Schmidt (2000) and, [...] subsequently, Kluve et  al. (2009) to examine, for different demographic groups, the heterogeneous [...] cyclical sensitivity of unemployment rates and of transition intensities across labor-market states. These previous papers document that the heterogeneity of labor-market dynamics is substantial. They have not considered job-to-job flows, however, when calculating intensities of job losses and re-employment, although <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rates are {{an important component of the}} German labor market.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic model of mismatch. Workers and jobs are {{randomly assigned to}} labor markets. Each labor market clears at each instant but some have more workers than jobs, hence unemployment, and some have more jobs than workers, hence vacancies. As workers and jobs move between labor markets, some unemployed workers find vacant jobs and some employed workers lose or leave their job and become unemployed. The model is quantitatively consistent with the business cycle frequency correlation between unemployment, job vacancies, and {{the rate at which}} unemployed workers find jobs and explains much of the cyclical volatility of these variables. The model can also address a variety of labor market phenomena, including cyclicality in the separation rate and the <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transition</b> rate and duration dependence in the job finding rate. The results are robust to having some non-random mobility...|$|E

40|$|I {{construct}} {{a theoretical framework}} in which firms offer wage-tenure contracts to direct the search by risk-averse workers. All workers can search, on or off the job. I characterize an equilibrium and prove its existence. The equilibrium generates a nondegenerate, continuous distribution of employed workers over the values of contracts, despite that all matches are identical and workers observe all offers. A striking property is that the equilibrium is block recursive; that is, individuals' optimal decisions and optimal contracts are independent {{of the distribution of}} workers. This property makes the equilibrium analysis tractable. Consistent with stylized facts, the equilibrium predicts that (i) wages increase with tenure, (ii) <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> decrease with tenure and wages, and (iii) wage mobility is limited {{in the sense that the}} lower the worker's wage, the lower the future wage a worker will move to in the next job transition. Moreover, block recursivity implies that changes in the unemployment benefit and the minimum wage have no effect on an employed worker's <b>job-to-job</b> <b>transitions</b> and contracts.
