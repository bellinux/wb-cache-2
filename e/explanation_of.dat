This paper is about <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> facts. Our aim is to analyse the role <b>of</b> unification in <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> this kind.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on scientific explanation, there is a classical distinction between <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> facts and <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> laws. This paper is about <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> laws, more specifically mechanistic <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> laws. We investigate whether providing unificatory information in mechanistic <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> laws has a surplus value. Unificatory information is information about how the mechanism that explains the law which is our target relates to other mechanisms (which explain other laws). We argue that providing unificatory information can lead to explanations with more explanatory power (we use Jim Woodward’s concept of explanatory power for that) and that it may lead to more strongly supported explanation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Explanations</b> <b>of</b> {{the growth}} of {{scientific}} knowledge can be characterized in terms of logical, cognitive, and social schemas. But cognitive and social schemas are complementary rather than competitive, and purely social <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> scientific change are as inadequate as purely cognitive explanations. For example, cognitive <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> the chemical revolution must be supplemented by and combined with social explanations, and social <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> {{the rise of the}} mechanical world view must be supplemented by and combined with cognitive <b>explanations.</b> Rational appraisal <b>of</b> cognitive and social strategies for improving knowledge should appreciate the interdependence of mind and society...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines four operationalizations {{of homicide}} clearances at two time points for 816 homicides in Columbus, Ohio.

(b) Do Time 1 <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> homicide clearances change when Time 2 homicide clearances {{are part of}} the analysis? The data show that how a homicide clearance is operationalized does not affect <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> homicide clearances, with one exception. The data also show that adding Time 2 clearances does not change <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> homicide clearances...|$|R

5|$|Jerry Fodor, Putnam, {{and others}} noted that, along with being an {{effective}} argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively {{in terms of}} causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore {{seemed to be a}} better <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E

5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4.

However, on legal advice this possible <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> the crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air to be drawn into the cross-feed pipe.|$|E

5|$|A {{complete}} <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into}} the realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
