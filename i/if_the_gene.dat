25|$|The {{stretch of}} DNA {{transcribed}} into an RNA molecule {{is called a}} transcription unit and encodes at least one gene. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> encodes a protein, the transcription produces messenger RNA (mRNA); the mRNA, in turn, serves as a template for the protein's synthesis through translation. Alternatively, the transcribed gene may encode for either non-coding RNA (such as microRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), or other enzymatic RNA molecules called ribozymes. Overall, RNA helps synthesize, regulate, and process proteins; it therefore plays {{a fundamental role in}} performing functions within a cell.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{clinical}} genetics assessment is commonly {{performed by the}} high-risk obstetrician or genetic counselor where they may ask for a blood sample from the fetus or will perform an amniocentesis. These samples are used to perform several tests, one {{of which may be}} to check for the proper number of chromosomes, called a karyotype, of the fetus. Some birth defects are known to be associated with missing a chromosome, having an extra chromosome, such as in Down syndrome, as well as by having a part of one chromosome break off and relocate to a portion of another chromosome (called a translocation). However, on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are thousands of different genes. While chromosomes are easy to visualize under a microscope and count, the genes on them are not. Genes are very small pieces of DNA when compared to the chromosomes they reside on. A gene contains a code for a protein and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is mutated (different from normal) the protein that is made from it may not function properly - if at all. Unfortunately, genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes. The only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genetic analysis of the mother, father, affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus. These analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant, and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents, it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not.|$|E

2500|$|A {{mechanistic}} way of modelling an HGT {{event on}} the reference tree is to first cut an internal branch—i.e., prune the tree—and then regraft it onto another edge, an operation {{referred to as}} subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> tree was topologically consistent with the original reference tree, the editing results in an inconsistency. Similarly, when the original gene tree is inconsistent with the reference tree, {{it is possible to}} obtain a consistent topology by a series of one or more prune and regraft operations applied to the reference tree. By interpreting the edit path of pruning and regrafting, HGT candidate nodes can be flagged and the host and donor genomes inferred. To avoid reporting false positive HGT events due to uncertain gene tree topologies, the optimal [...] "path" [...] of SPR operations can be chosen among multiple possible combinations by considering the branch support in the gene tree. Weakly supported gene tree edges can be ignored a priori or the support can be used to compute an optimality criterion.|$|E

50|$|Physicist Dave Thomas, the President of NMSR, {{has stated}} that gene {{duplication}} and frame-shift mutations were powerful sources of random mutation.

5000|$|More {{complicated}} crosses {{can be made}} {{by looking}} at two or more <b>genes.</b> <b>The</b> Punnett square works, however, only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> are independent of each other, which means that having a particular allele of gene [...] "A" [...] does not alter the probability of possessing an allele of gene [...] "B". This is equivalent to stating that <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> are not linked, so that <b>the</b> two <b>genes</b> do not tend to sort together during meiosis.|$|R
2500|$|Epistasis {{within the}} genomes of organisms occurs due to {{interactions}} between <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> within <b>the</b> genome. This interaction may be direct <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> encode proteins that, for example, are separate {{components of a}} multi-component protein (such as the ribosome), inhibit each other's activity, [...] or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> protein encoded by one <b>gene</b> modifies <b>the</b> other (such as by phosphorylation). Alternatively the interaction may be indirect, where <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> encode components of a metabolic pathway or network, developmental pathway, signalling pathway or transcription factor network. For example, <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> encoding <b>the</b> enzyme that synthesizes penicillin is of no use to a fungus without the enzymes that synthesize the necessary precursors in the metabolic pathway.|$|R

50|$|An {{amorphic allele}} is {{commonly}} recessive to its wildtype counterpart. It {{is possible for}} an amorph to be dominant <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> in question is required in two copies to elicit a normal phenotype (i.e. haploinsufficient).|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> TP53 <b>gene</b> is damaged, tumor {{suppression}} {{is severely}} compromised. People who inherit only one functional copy of <b>the</b> TP53 <b>gene</b> {{will most likely}} develop tumors in early adulthood, a disorder known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|... "Kin selection" [...] {{should not}} be {{confused}} with [...] "group selection" [...] according to which a genetic trait can become prevalent within a group because it benefits the group as a whole, regardless of any benefit to individual organisms. All known forms of group selection conform to the principle that an individual behaviour can be evolutionarily successful only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> responsible for this behaviour conform to Hamilton's Rule, and hence, on balance and in the aggregate, benefit from the behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Hemoglobin {{variants}} {{occur when}} there are genetic changes in specific genes, or globins, that cause changes or alterations in the amino acid. They could affect the structure, behavior, the production rate, and/or the stability of that specific gene. Usually there are four genes that code for alpha globin and two genes that code for beta globin. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> for alpha chains is mutated, the most common condition that occurs is alpha thalassemia, which causes a decrease in production of that <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> level of severity of alpha thalassemia is determined by <b>the</b> number of <b>genes</b> that are affected.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the child}} {{receives}} two (different) homologous chromosomes (inherited from both grandparents) from one parent, {{this is called}} an heterodisomic UPD. Heterodisomy (heterozygous) indicates a meiosis I error <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> loci in question didn't cross over.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the child}} {{receives}} two (identical) replica {{copies of a}} single homologue of a chromosome, this is called an isodisomic UPD. Isodisomy (homozygous) indicates either a meiosis II (<b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> loci in question didn't cross over) or postzygotic chromosomal duplication.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> {{encoding}} {{the protein}} is known, {{it is currently}} much easier to sequence the DNA and infer the protein sequence. Determining part of a protein's amino-acid sequence (often one end) {{by one of the}} above methods may be sufficient to identify a clone carrying this gene.|$|E
50|$|A {{concatemer}} {{is a long}} continuous DNA molecule {{that contains}} multiple copies of the same DNA sequences linked in series. These polymeric molecules are usually copies of an entire genome linked end to end and separated by cos sites (a protein binding nucleotide sequence that occurs once in each copy of the genome). Concatemers are frequently the result of rolling circle replication, and {{may be seen in}} the late stage of bacterial infection by phages. As an example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in <b>the</b> phage DNA are arranged ABC, then in a concatemer <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> would be ABCABCABCABC and so on. They are further broken by ribozymes.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} social {{interaction}} (see Social Interaction Models) among siblings to individual differences in behavior were first discussed by Eaves [3] and later by Carey [1] and others. In the context of behavior genetic research, social interaction effects reflect that alleles may cause variation {{in one or more}} traits of individuals carrying these alleles, but may also, through social interaction, influence the phenotypes of individuals who do not carry them [4]. Social interactions between siblings thus create an additional source of variance and generate genotypeenvironment covariance <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> causing <b>the</b> social interaction overlap with <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> that influence <b>the</b> phenotype under study.

40|$|One {{way to get}} {{an insight}} into the {{potential}} interaction between a pair of genes is to compare the phenotype of the double knockout organism to the phenotype we would expect <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> were independent. However, since gene knockouts are expensive and time-consuming, {{we would like to}} be able to predict gene interactions. We used a dataset consisting of 352 yeast genes for which only a few double knockout measurements were known, and applied regression algorithms to predict the unknown measurements. In this article, we describe the algorithms we used and compare their results. ...|$|R
5000|$|A meiosis I error {{can result}} in isodisomic UPD <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> loci in {{question}} crossed over, for example, a distal isodisomy would be due to duplicated gene loci from the maternal grandmother that crossed over and due to an error during Meiosis I, {{ended up in the}} same gamete [...]|$|E
50|$|This {{condition}} is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A {{condition is}} considered X-linked <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> {{that causes the}} disorder {{is located on the}} X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes). The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition.|$|E
50|$|Heterosis {{is defined}} as any {{advantages}} seen in hybrids. The effects of heterosis seem to follow a rather simple epigenetic premise in plants. In hybrids, lack of proper regulatory action, such as silencing by methylation, leads to uninhibited genes. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is involved in growth, such as photosynthesis, the plant will experience increased vitality (Ni et al. 2008).|$|E
50|$|Plants can be acclimated to low or even {{freezing}} temperatures. If a {{plant can}} go through a mild cold spell this activates <b>the</b> cold-responsive <b>genes</b> in <b>the</b> plant. Then <b>if</b> <b>the</b> temperature drops again, <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> will have conditioned the plant {{to cope with the}} low temperature. Even below freezing temperatures can be survived <b>if</b> <b>the</b> proper <b>genes</b> are activated (Suzuki & Mittler, 2006).|$|R
50|$|More recently, this {{birth order}} effect on {{sexuality}} in males has {{been attributed to}} a very specific biological occurrence. As the mother gives birth to more sons, she is thought to develop an immunity to certain male-specific antigens. This immunity then leads to an effect in the brain {{that has to do with}} sexual preference. Yet this biological effect is seen only in right-handed males. <b>If</b> not right-handed, <b>the</b> number of older brothers has been found to have no prediction on the sexuality of a younger brother. This has led researchers to consider <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> for sexuality and handedness are somehow related.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fascinating}} {{feature of}} pattern genetics {{is that the}} dramatic phenotypic changes are primarily due to small changes in <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> that determines <b>the</b> sizes and positions of pattern elements. [...] This discovery is {{in accord with the}} principal theory for the evolution of mimicry. The theory proposes that initial mimicry is achieved by a single mutation that has a large effect on the phenotype, which immediately gives the organism some protection, and is then refined by so-called modifier genes with lesser phenotypic effects. [...] Consequently, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> for wing pattern and color were normal functioning genes, a single mating would produce several phenyotypically different offspring, making the ability for mimicry to evolve very difficult.|$|R
5000|$|TCTP {{interacts with}} F-actin and mitotic spindle [...] and regulates cell shape by {{interacting}} with the cytoskeleton. Since most cellular processes, such as the cell cycle and cancer, involve changes in the cytoskeleton; it becomes apparent why TCTP is important. Moreover, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> encoding TCTP is knocked-out in mice, it becomes embryonic lethal, and they die in utero (in the womb).|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{the gene}} drive {{insertion}} in the genome will re-occur in each organism that inherits one {{copy of the}} modification and one copy of the wild-type gene. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> drive is already present in the egg cell (e.g. when received from one parent), all the gametes of the individual will carry the gene drive (instead of 50% {{in the case of}} a normal gene).|$|E
50|$|Primary and {{secondary}} HH {{can also be}} attributed to a genetic trait inherited from the biologic parents. For example, the male mutations of the GnRH coding gene could result in HH. Hormone replacement can be used to initiate puberty and continue <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> mutation occurs in the gene coding for the hormone. Chromosomal mutations tend to affect the androgen production rather than the HPG axis.|$|E
50|$|The hijack of an {{enhancer}} {{from another}} <b>gene</b> allows <b>the</b> {{analysis of the}} function of that enhancer. This, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> reporter <b>gene</b> is for a fluorescent protein, {{can be used to}} help map expression of <b>the</b> mutated <b>gene</b> through <b>the</b> organism, and is a very powerful tool.|$|R
