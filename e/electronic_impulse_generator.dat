Mostly the protection of electrical power depends {{on the performance of}} insulation systems under transient over voltage conditions arises due to lightening and switching applications. Transient over voltages in addition to the abrupt changes in the state of power systems, e. g. switching operations or faults are known as switching impulse voltages and that due to lightening are known as lightening impulse voltages. Very short pulse high-voltage or high-current surges can be produced by an electrical apparatus known as <b>impulse</b> <b>generator.</b> High <b>impulse</b> voltages are used to test the durability of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. The Marx <b>Impulse</b> <b>generator</b> is used to generate such high impulse voltages. A total of eight stages of both Standard as well as Improved Marx <b>Impulse</b> <b>generator</b> were designed and the impulse waves were recorded. These recorded impulse waves were compared with the standard impulse wave with front time of 1. 2 µ seconds and fall time of 50 µ seconds. The energy and efficiency of all the stages were calculated and the percentage of error in the rise time and fall time was also found out.

For producing high voltage pulses Marx generator is the most popular and is most widely used method. This thesis describes the creation of a simulation circuit to match the output of a Marx <b>Impulse</b> <b>Generator.</b> In this project eight stages of standard Marx <b>Impulse</b> Voltage <b>Generator</b> were simulated and resulted impulse waves were recorded. The objective was to calculate the stray capacitance using standard formulas and embed that capacitance into the simulation circuit to adequately deliver a yield like that of the <b>impulse</b> <b>generator.</b> A genuine multi-staged <b>impulse</b> <b>generator</b> was utilized as the base. Eight distinctive levels of impulse voltage were tried, and the output waveforms were recorded. The simulation circuit was then subjected to a few cycles, conforming the capacitance qualities to achieve a yield as close as could be expected under the circumstances to that of the real generator. Finishes of the examination demonstrate that a successful simulation circuit could be made to give a yield that is near, yet not precisely that of, the genuine generator. In the exploration, a few zones of error were distinguished in the simulation that were not introduce in the simulation circuit. The entire simulations have been examined in the NI Multisim software. The simulation circuit could be utilized to figure out the front time, tail time, and peak voltage...|$|R

40|$|Lightning {{characteristics}} and standard impulse waveform {{are related to}} each other. But the lack of realization about the relation between them would make the solution to produce better protection against lightning surge becomes harder. Natural lightning surge waveform {{has been compared to}} standard impulse waveform as evidence that there have similarity between them. The standard impulse waveform could be used to test the strength of electrical equipment against the lightning. Therefore designing and simulating the <b>impulse</b> <b>generator</b> are the purpose of this project beside to get better understanding about lightning characteristics. This project aims to develop an <b>impulse</b> <b>generator</b> circuit using OrCAD PSpice software to produce a lightning waveform according to IEC 61000 - 4 - 5 standard. For this reason, Marx generator has been used as the main principle of the design with some parameters and components modifications.

Conclusions of the research indicate that an effective simulation circuit can be created to give an output that is close to, but not exactly that of, the actual generator.
