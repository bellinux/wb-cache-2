5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a {{high-performance}} V8 {{version of the}} British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, designed in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on <b>every</b> <b>car</b> produced.|$|E
5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of <b>every</b> <b>car.</b> The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with <b>every</b> <b>car</b> equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and <b>every</b> <b>car</b> that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
25|$|The first DLC {{pack for}} Most Wanted was {{released}} {{on the same day}} as the game's launch.

25|$|While <b>every</b> <b>car</b> in an ICE train has its {{own unique}} {{registration}} number, the trains usually remain coupled as fixed trainsets for several years. For easier reference, each has been assigned a trainset number that is printed over each bogie of <b>every</b> <b>car.</b> These numbers usually correspond with the registration numbers of the powerheads or cab cars.|$|E
30|$|The {{energy costs}} (price without tax) used in all {{scenarios}} are 0.5 €/l for fossil gasoline and diesel, 0.8 €/l for renewable diesel and ethanol, 1 €/kg for biogas, 5 €/kg for hydrogen and 0.1 €/kWh for electricity. There are also infrastructure costs for electricity (private charging station for each electric or plug-in hybrid car at 2000 € per station and one public charging station for <b>every</b> 10 <b>cars</b> at 5000 € per public charging station), hydrogen (1 [*]M€ per station and one station for <b>every</b> 100 <b>cars)</b> and biogas (0.5 [*]M€ per station and one station for <b>every</b> 250 <b>cars).</b> These assumptions are made based on Nylund et al.

The inspection can be done at accredited vehicle inspectors.|$|R
25|$|The track {{usually has}} {{two to six}} lanes and slopes down to the ground, since the cars are powered by gravity. Tracks may be owned by the pack or rented. The race is run in heats, giving <b>every</b> <b>car</b> the chance to run on each lane. The racers can be grouped with others from the same rank (Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, etc.), or can compete against the pack as a whole.|$|E
25|$|In the past, ferries were {{equipped}} for vehicle transport, at {{a charge of}} $3 per automobile. A vehicle ban was approved in 1992, after the Whitehall Terminal was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt without vehicle loading areas, but the September 11 attacks ended vehicle crossings at the temporary terminal as well. It has been proposed to bring car boarding back due to rising tolls on the Verrazano Bridge, but the plan was seen as unlikely due {{to the amount of}} effort needed to screen <b>every</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Nottingham Corporation Act 1902 gave powers for the Forest Road {{line and}} {{for a number of}} short lengths of tramway, principally in the Market Place, to link up {{constructed}} or authorised tramways. It also gave powers for the Corporation to operate motor omnibuses in connection with any tramway either during a period when it was impracticable to operate tramcars or as extensions. The layout in the Market Place caused much argument, and one suggestion was for a gyratory system, single line, that <b>every</b> <b>car</b> would have to negotiate when passing through the Market Place.|$|E

30|$|The {{simulation}} {{was set to}} poll <b>cars</b> <b>every</b> 6 – 15 seconds; with 100 cars in total, {{experience with}} <b>every</b> other <b>car</b> would be gained quicklyo. In order to simulate environments with low experience-based trust, we introduce a variable called sparsity. For example, 80 % sparsity resembles having a lack of previous experience with 80 % of the agents. In the simulation, this variable effectively ignores updates of trust values, thus hindering experience-based trust.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} was significantly improved with remote central locking, heated & electrically adjustable mirrors, 2 front- and 2 sideairbags, power brakes with ABS and power windows being standard on <b>every</b> <b>car.</b> Trim levels varied for each market as did equipment {{levels of the}} most basic trims. In the United States, the badging denoted the engine variant and to some extent the equipment level, whereas in Europe engines and options could be chosen individually. In all markets more powerful versions received better or upgraded standard equipment. The T5 and R were the series high-performance models.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of a rebadged model named Dodge Monaco resulted from a contractual obligation to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. The Monaco sold poorly, and both it and the Premier were cancelled in 1992. There was little marketing support for the Premier by the Jeep-Eagle dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable Jeep models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with Chrysler-Plymouth dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand. There were 139,051 Premiers and Monacos built at Bramalea. Chrysler paid a penalty for <b>every</b> <b>car</b> not produced and V6 engine not purchased from Renault.|$|E
25|$|The TVR model {{series that}} {{would replace the}} Vixen-based cars {{was known as the}} M Series. Mike Bigland would design its chassis, which was {{superior}} in every way to the outgoing Vixen chassis; it was more rigid, would provide better safety for the car's occupants, and could be produced more economically. Over several months, the design was finalized and the factory prepared for production. The 2500M, 3000M, 1600M, Taimar and 3000S models (as well as turbocharged variants of the V6 cars) were all built for various spans of time between 1972 and 1980. This period saw significant improvements in both efficiency and quality, with Mike Penny performing a quality control inspection on <b>every</b> <b>car</b> that left the factory. Also during M Series production, both Jack Pickard and Stanley Kilcoyne returned to work at the company.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the third}} event to take place with {{electronic}} sensors monitoring <b>every</b> <b>car</b> for jump-starts, and {{at this stage of}} the race, six drivers (Barrichello, Brundle, Montermini, Frentzen, Morbidelli and Panis) were issued with ten-second stop-go penalties for this offence. All except Montermini came in promptly to serve their penaltiessome even having to form a queue in the penalty areabut the Pacific driver failed to pit within the stipulated three laps of receiving it, whereupon he was disqualified from the race, having climbed to 17thplace before belatedly serving his penalty. The penalised drivers dropped back through the field as a result of losing time, with the result that after 16laps completed, the race order was: Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Irvine, Blundell, Badoer, Katayama, Brundle, Martini, Barrichello, Panis, Frentzen, Boullion, Salo, Montermini (yet to serve his penalty), Gachot, Inoue, Diniz and Morbidelli.|$|E
25|$|Thursday's first {{qualifying}} session {{saw more}} stoppages for crashes. James Calado crashed his AF Corse Ferrari in the Porsche Curves, necessitating a half-hour red flag. This {{was followed by}} the No. 1 Audi, making some of its first laps since its accident on Wednesday, spinning at Indianapolis and damaging the car's bodywork. While driver di Grassi attempted to return to the pit lane he swerved in front of Leo Roussel's Pegasus Morgan, causing the LMP2 car to dart off the track and crash at the pit entrance. At the same time, Bret Curtis in the No. 79 Prospeed Porsche spun {{at the entrance to the}} Dunlop Chicane and impacted the wall, knocking Curtis unconscious. Following clean-up of the circuit qualifying resumed with fifteen minutes left in the session, and improvements were made by nearly <b>every</b> <b>car</b> in LMP1. Kazuki Nakajima improved provisional pole position with a three minutes and 22.589 seconds lap, followed by the Porsche entries of Romain Dumas and Bernhard. The fastest Audi was fourth after a lap from Oliver Jarvis. Tristan Gommendy gave the débuting Ligier of TDS Racing provisional pole in LMP2 after displacing the Murphy Oreca on the last lap of the session, setting a time of three minutes and 38.094 seconds. In LMGTE Pro, Corvette led the session but did not improve on AF Corse's lap time from the first qualification session. Similarly the No. 61 AF Corse Ferrari came within two tenths of a second of besting SMP's lead time in LMGTE Am.|$|E

500|$|The 1950s jump {{started an}} {{industry}} of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today. The oldest aftermarket wheel company, American Racing, started in 1956 and still builds [...] "mag wheels" [...] (alloy wheels) for almost <b>every</b> <b>car</b> made. [...] Holley introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford {{offered in the}} 1957 Ford Thunderbird, and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. Edelbrock started during the Great Depression and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats.

500|$|Dykstra {{said the}} biggest {{difficulty}} of creating Spider-Man was {{that as the}} character was masked, it immediately {{lost a lot of}} characterization.

Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, [...] "the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero." [...] Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being. When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts. In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced <b>every</b> <b>car</b> in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer generated.|$|E
