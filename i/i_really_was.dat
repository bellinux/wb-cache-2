500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E
500|$|Now {{wanting a}} [...] "bigger and stronger-looking" [...] Jason, {{one that was}} also [...] "more {{athletic}} and powerful", Steve Miner hired former British trapeze artist Richard Brooker. After a simple conversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to the country, Brooker believed that [...] "playing a psychopathic killer" [...] {{was the best way}} into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear Jason's now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, [...] "It felt great with the mask on. It just felt like <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> Jason because I didn't have anything to wear before that." [...] For The Final Chapter, Joseph Zito brought his own spin to the character, one that required a [...] "real hardcore stuntman"; Ted White was hired to perform the role. White, who only took the job for the money, did [...] "get into the Jason psychology" [...] when he arrived on the set. White {{went so far as to}} not speak to any of the other actors for long stretches. As filming continued, White's experience was not pleasant, and in one instance, he went to battle for co-star Judie Aronson, who played Samantha, when the director kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased with his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the credits. As with Friday the 13th Part 2, there was confusion over who performed the role in A New Beginning, partly because Jason is not the literal antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to return, Dick Wieand was cast. Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film's actual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked scenes. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his time in his trailer. By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and made sure he [...] "really got into the character".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{described}} the release as her most personal work, developed throughout her entire lifetime. She explained, [...] "I never looked deeply at the pain from my past, {{never tried to}} understand that pain and work it through. It was a journey I had avoided. But one I now had to face." [...] Robert Hilburn added, [...] "Jackson found a universal symbol to use in exploring issues of insecurity and self-worth. At some point, everyone is {{on the wrong side}} of the velvet rope, excluded because of race, social status, age or some other division." [...] Jackson regarded commercial success as a secondary consideration, commenting, [...] "I needed to express who I was and what I'd learned. I found out who <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was...</b> If that can inspire people who hear this album to do the same, I'd rather have that than the biggest selling album in the world." ...|$|E

Murray, described {{by one of}} the Hustle production team as [...] "that rare specimen – a stunningly beautiful actress who can actually act", and who auditioned in platform shoes to match her 5ft7in height with Stacie's description as having [...] "legs that go on for miles", was reportedly [...] "terrified" [...] to be working with the more famous actors Vaughn and Lester, saying [...] "when we were filming the first couple of episodes I was absolutely petrified and was convinced that it would be really obvious on screen. So when I watched some of it on tape I was totally amazed that you couldn't see how frightened <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> I kept thinking, 'Oh my God! I'm working with Adrian Lester and Robert Vaughn. Any time now someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to get my coat!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|A month {{prior to}} the album's release, MTV aired an inaugural special {{entitled}} , declaring Jackson the network's first musical icon while celebrating her career and influence in pop culture. Jackson was honored [...] "in recognition of her place {{as one of the}} most influential and beloved tastemakers in contemporary pop... The show will eloquently demonstrate the impact that Janet has had, not only on her worldwide audience, but also on a generation of performers who will pay tribute by covering her songs." [...] Jackson stated, [...] "When I heard that MTV wanted to honor me with the show [...] "Icon," [...] I was speechless. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> It is an awesome thing—I feel young. There's still so much more that I want to do, need to do, for myself in this business. And I was just so surprised. But a wonderful surprise." [...] Numerous artists paid tribute to Jackson and commemorated her success, including Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, Aaliyah, Tommy Lee, Michael Jackson, and producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. It featured performances by 'N Sync, Pink, Buckcherry, Usher, Outkast, Mýa, and Destiny's Child. Jackson performed [...] "All for You" [...] and [...] "You Ain't Right" [...] at the finale. The event was the highest rated television show of the night, ahead of all broadcast and cable programs among the youth demographic. Promotional ads for the special depicted Jackson's music, videos, and sexuality shocking conservative audiences and families, using the tagline [...] "The world wasn't always ready for Janet.

2500|$|In August 2013, Schoolboy Q {{called the}} album his [...] "best work yet." [...] He also {{called it a}} classic, but hoped his fans will have the final say: [...] "It's a classic album I would like to say, but I would like the people to say it's a classic. But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
