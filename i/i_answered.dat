25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some {{laughter}} from the audience. First, when speaking about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. I appreciate you asking me the question and I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the press}} conference in Hamburg, I was asked if Michael, Eve and Lucifer were {{historical}} figures {{of the past and}} <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation [...] "work of art" [...] to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.|$|E

[...] In an {{interview}} during this time, McCain would say of the rumor spreaders, [...] "I {{believe that there}} is a special place in hell for people like those," [...] and in another interview he called the rumor spreaders [...] "the ugly underside of politics." [...] McCain regretted some aspects of his own campaign there as well, in particular changing his stance on flying the Confederate flag at the state capitol from a [...] "very offensive" [...] "symbol of racism and slavery" [...] to [...] "a symbol of heritage". He would later write, [...] "I feared that if <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary. So I chose to compromise my principles." [...] He had done so woodenly, reading his revised statement from a piece of paper. According to one report, the South Carolina experience overall left McCain in a [...] "very dark place." ...|$|E
500|$|In the end, the Summit Series {{conclusively}} {{proved that}} {{the gap between the}} best Canadian NHL players and the top national teams of Europe (USSR, Czechoslovakia, Sweden) was much narrower than most observers {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic had anticipated. The Swedish national team coach Billy Harris (a former NHL pro with the Toronto Maple Leafs) later recalled that [...] "the (Swedish) media would ask me, 'do you see even one Swedish player who could possibly have a chance in the National Hockey League?' <b>I</b> <b>answered,</b> 'No, I see 14 of them!'" [...] The success of the 1972 Summit Series would lead to the development of the Canada Cup ice hockey world championship tournament open to both pros and amateurs, starting in 1976. It also led to regular series of games between Soviet and NHL clubs, known as the Super Series. By the 1980s, an increasing number of players were former members of the Swedish or Czechoslovak national teams. The top Soviet players were finally allowed to sign contracts with NHL clubs in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the USSR crumbled.|$|E
500|$|During a February 2010 {{television}} interview, Sestak {{said that}} in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if {{he dropped out of}} the race. During a February 18 taping of Larry Kane: Voice of Reason, a Philadelphia-area local news show, host Larry Kane asked Sestak whether such an offer had been made, to which Sestak responded, [...] "Yes", without elaborating beyond that it was a high-ranking assignment and that he did not plan to take it. In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if I got out." [...] Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, [...] "I was asked a direct question yesterday and <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." [...] Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were [...] "not problematic." ...|$|E
