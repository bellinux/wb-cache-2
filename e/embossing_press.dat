50|$|Both sets of {{artifacts}} initially passed through private ownership before ultimately entering museum collections. The dies now reside in Richmond's Museum of the Confederacy; and the <b>embossing</b> <b>press,</b> equipped with brass replica dies, is in a National Trust Museum in St. George's, Bermuda.|$|E
50|$|Since the company’s {{foundation}} {{the core}} {{business has been}} the production of vehicle license plates including manufacturing tools and production facilities. Already in 1965, Utsch launched its first mechanical <b>embossing</b> <b>press.</b> In 1975, the first “Automatic Embossing Press” was introduced to manufacture vehicle license plates in large quantities in a computer-controlled and fully automatic process.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the seal was {{finalized}} on April 30, 1863, {{and a set of}} embossing dies ordered from the London engraver Joseph S. Wyon.The seal dies eventually reached Richmond {{before the end of the}} war. However, due to the risks of running the Union naval blockade imposed upon the Confederacy, the accompanying <b>embossing</b> <b>press</b> was only shipped as far as Bermuda. The dies (crafted in silver) were thus unlikely to ever have been used in any official capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} of Montagna's {{personal}} life other than that he married Francesca Carcione and lived in a modest home in Elmont, Long Island with her and his three daughters. He started a small metalworking company called Matrix Steel Co., located at 50 Bogart Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, managed by his wife. Matrix Steel manufactures structural and rail mill products, gray and ductile iron foundry crucibles, foundry converters, casting machines, sizing or <b>embossing</b> <b>presses,</b> foundry mold machines and foundry dies and tooling. It was around this time that Montagna was given the nickname [...] "Sal the Iron Worker".|$|R
5000|$|A rotary {{printing}} press is a printing press {{in which the}} images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. Printing can be done on {{a large number of}} substrates, including paper, cardboard, and plastic. Substrates can be sheet feed or unwound on a continuous roll through the press to be printed and further modified if required (e.g. die cut, overprint varnished, <b>embossed).</b> Printing <b>presses</b> that use continuous rolls are sometimes referred to as [...] "web presses".|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{a square}} paprenjak is {{decorated}} with wooden <b>press,</b> <b>embossing</b> a pattern on the biscuit. These patterns were traditionally pagan and Christian symbols, such as fish, wheat or sun. Today paprenjak today takes on many shapes, such as gingerbread men, stars, trees, etc...|$|R
50|$|Often used in {{combination}} with foil stamping, embossing alters the surface of paper stock or other substrates by providing a three-dimensional or raised effect on selected areas. The procedure {{requires the use of}} two dies: one that is raised and one that is recessed. The dies fit into each other so that when the paper is pressed between them, the raised die forces the stock into the recessed die and creates the embossed impression. A specific level of pressure is applied to the dies in order to squeeze the fibers of the paper, which results in a permanently raised area in the paper.When the dies are produced, a die maker engraves the desired image into several metal plates, which are the embossing dies for use on an <b>embossing</b> <b>press.</b> A thorough understanding the process will enable a more successful result. Generally, embossing is the process most often employed to attract attention or convey a high quality textural contrast in relation to the surrounding area of the paper stock.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1936, Australian {{plates were}} to be uniform in size and {{embossing}} in standard Australian dies, beginning with NSW, FCT (now ACT) and Victoria. By 1956 the remaining states and territories moved into standard Australian <b>embossing</b> from either <b>pressed</b> or enamel, standardising in dimensions as [...] × [...]|$|R
50|$|Brandtjen and Kluge is a US {{manufacturer}} of platen foil stamping, <b>embossing</b> & diecutting <b>presses</b> along with modular folder-gluers. Together John and Henry Brandtjen and the Kluge brothers developed the world's first successful automatic feeder for open platen (Gordon) printing presses (such as those manufactured by Chandler & Price), and in November 1919, Brandtjen & Kluge {{was formed in}} St. Paul, Minnesota to manufacture and sell the feeder. Brandtjen & Kluge is currently located in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{upper floor}} of the {{historic}} section of the parish house is a single open space, and is in substantially original condition. [...] The walls and ceiling are covered with elaborate <b>embossed</b> and painted <b>pressed</b> metal panels. The metal panels form wainscoting and an upper rail, and transition to different patterns above the rail. An oak staircase connects the upper floor to the lower. The lower floor, which has been significantly modernized, houses a kitchen, dining and social space, bathroom, and a small office.|$|R
