5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-twentieth century, when Gode led the {{development}} of Interlingua, the ideals underlying Esperanto had come to seem naive. Influenced by Herder, Gode propounded a Romantic, anti-positivist view of language: languages are {{an aspect of the}} culture of a people, not an instrument to achieve a goal; an ideology cannot be attached to a language, except artificially. This implied, in his view, that a world language on the Esperanto model was either impossible or, worse, achievable only through totalitarian coercion. He was of the opinion that, unless imposed by force, a universal <b>global</b> <b>language</b> would presuppose a universal global culture, which does not currently exist and is not necessarily desirable.|$|E

During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements. In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories.

He appeared on a second consecutive Sports Illustrated cover, the first New York-based team athlete and the third NBA player in the magazine's history, after Jordan and Dirk Nowitzki. New York City restaurants introduced new food and bar items in honor of Lin, and sales of Yanjing Beer rose. The city has about 450,000 residents of Chinese or Taiwanese descent—larger than the entire populations of NBA cities like Miami, Atlanta or Cleveland—and viewing parties to watch Lin play flourished in Manhattan's Chinatown. An airline advertised [...] "Linsanely low prices", bids for his rookie card exceeded $21,000 on eBay, and the press circulated rumors—denied by Lin—that he was dating Kim Kardashian.

40|$|Abstract — Modular {{supervisory}} control of discrete-event systems (DES), where the global DES {{is composed of}} local components that run concurrently, is considered. For {{supervisory control}} of large-scale modular DES the possibility of performing control-related computations locally (in components) is of utmost importance to computational complexity. Recently we have treated the case, where the specification language is decomposable into local specification languages and {{is included in the}} (<b>global)</b> plant <b>language.</b> In this paper the case of general specification languages that are neither necessarily decomposable nor contained in the <b>global</b> plant <b>language</b> is studied. Sufficient conditions are found under which any manipulation with the global plant is avoided for the computation of supremal controllable sublanguages of (<b>global)</b> indecomposable specification <b>languages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Globalisation in its {{conventional}} usage {{refers to}} present-day movements in economy, encompassing global market links, worldwide communications and multinational corporations. The impact of globalisation is inevitably reflected {{in everyday life}} and language. The influence of globalisation on indigenous groups in Amazonia goes {{through a number of}} interrelated channels. The values and notions associated with the previously nonexistent market economy are gradually incorporated into discourse. This introduction of realities inevitably associated with white people's life promotes the intrusion of elements from <b>global</b> <b>languages</b> (as defined {{within the context of a}} particular place). l Within the context of Brazil, the <b>global</b> <b>languages</b> are Portuguese and, to a lesser extent, English. These intrusive languages influence the lexicon, the grammar and the organisation of discourse in the minority languages. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the newly emerging market economy on the discourse of an indigenous people of northwest Amazonia (Brazil), the Tariana. We also show the emergent changes in ethnic stereotypes and cultural values resulting from the spread of the economic influence of the dominant mainstream Brazilian society, as reflected in the Tariana narratives...|$|R
