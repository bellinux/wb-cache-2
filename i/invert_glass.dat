MgO-CaO-SrO-TiO 2 -P 2 O 5 invert glasses were prepared and their dissolution behavior and cell response were examined. MgO addition to the phosphate <b>invert</b> <b>glass</b> system improved glass formation, owing to the relatively large field strength of Mg 2 + ions. In osteoblastlike MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell culture tests, cell numbers on the invert glasses were significantly larger compared with the control, possibly caused by the release of Mg 2 + ions promoting enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity varied with glass composition, with higher strontium for calcium substitution (33 to 100 %) showing highest ALP activity.

40|$|This project aims {{to use the}} {{advantages}} of multinuclear ultra-high-field NMR to improve the structural characterisation {{of a variety of}} borate materials. Two publications have appeared in the literature based on work at this facility [1, 2], and other work has been presented at several conferences and is being prepared for publication. Significant findings are summarized below. Enhanced site resolution in 11 B MAS NMR. While differentiation between three- and four-coordinate borons in borates can generally be achieved at moderately high fields (e. g.,> 11. 7 T), the distinction between different three-coordinate borons requires very high fields. In the present case, 11 B MAS NMR of a lithium borate <b>invert</b> <b>glass</b> at 21. 1 T yielded unprecedented resolution of the various trigonal borons present and provided an opportunity to test speciation models in the high-alkali region. Surprisingly, these experiments also found significant differences between the network structure of lithium borates and those of the other alkali borate glasses, where lower-field NMR studies found none. Furthermore, the cation disorder and paramagnetic impurities often present in natural minerals can cause peak broadening which compromises site resolution and quantification in borosilicates. Using the ultrahigh-field NMR facility, well-resolved 11 B MAS NMR spectra could be obtained for tourmalines, allowing straightforward analysis of the total and fractional boron contents, quantities not easily accessible by conventional techniques such as x-ray diffraction and electron-microprobe analysis. Reduced quadrupolar broadening and amplified chemical shift dispersion at high field combine to produce excellent site resolution and quantification required to determine key aspects of short- and medium-range ordering in borates.

40|$|Four resorbable {{phosphate}} <b>invert</b> <b>glasses</b> {{for use as}} {{bone replacement}} were synthesized in the system P 2 O 5 CaO-MgO-Na 2 O. TiO 2 and SiO 2 were added at concentrations of 1 and 5. 5 mol % to control solubility and crystallization. Both bulk glasses and samples with an open porosity of 65 % and pore sizes of 150 to 400 mu m were produced using a salt sintering process. Addition of TiO 2 decreased the solubility in water and simulated body fluid, while the glass with addition of SiO 2 showed a higher dissolution rate than did the original glass. The hypothesis that dissolution rates of the glasses will affect cell proliferation of osteoblastlike cells was tested using a MC 3 T 3 -E 1. 4 murine preosteoblast cell line. Cells were cultured on nonporous polished and porous glasses with tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as control. Cell proliferation was studied over 24 and 72 h in culture. Cells proliferated on all polished glasses, but proliferation on porous glasses showed variations with glass composition. Cell proliferation increased with decreased solubility of the glass. It is suggested that resorbable implant materials require the adjustment of dissolution rate so as to facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation and thus a gradual transition from artificial implant to new bone structure.

40|$|We {{describe}} a neural network based robotic system. Unlike traditional robotic systems, our approach focussed on non-stationary problems. We indicate that self-organization capability {{is necessary for}} any system to operate successfully in a non-stationary environment. We suggest that self-organization {{should be based on}} an active exploration process. We investigated neural architectures having novelty sensitivity, selective attention, reinforcement learning, habit formation, flexible criteria categorization properties and analyzed the resulting behavior (consisting of an intelligent initiation of exploration) by computer simulations. While various computer vision researchers acknowledged recently the importance of active processes (Swain and Stricker, 1991), the proposed approaches within the new framework still suffer from a lack of self-organization (Aloimonos and Bandyopadhyay, 1987; Bajcsy, 1988). A self-organizing, neural network based robot (MAVIN) has been recently proposed (Baloch and Waxman, 1991). This robot has the capability of position, size rotation invariant pattern categorization, recognition and pavlovian conditioning. Our robot does not have initially invariant processing properties. The reason for this is the emphasis we put on active exploration. We maintain the point of view that such invariant properties emerge from an internalization of exploratory sensory-motor activity. Rather than coding the equilibria of such mental capabilities, we are seeking to capture its dynamics to understand on the one hand how the emergence of such invariances is possible {{and on the other hand}} the dynamics that lead to these invariances. The second point is crucial for an adaptive robot to acquire new invariances in non-stationary environments, as demonstrated by the <b>inverting</b> <b>glass</b> experiments of Helmholtz. We will introduce Pavlovian conditioning circuits in our future work for the precise objective of achieving the generation, coordination, and internalization of sequence of actions...|$|R
40|$|By using {{event-driven}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulation, we investigate effects of varying the area {{fraction of the}} smaller component on structure, compressibility factor and dynamics of the highly size-asymmetric binary hard-disk liquids. We find that the static pair correlations of the large disks are only weakly perturbed by adding small disks. The higher-order static correlations of the large disks, by contrast, can be strongly affected. The compressibility factor of the system first decreases and then increases upon increasing the area fraction of the small disks and separating different contributions to it allows to rationalize this non-monotonic phenomenon. Furthermore, adding small disks can influence dynamics of the system in quantitative and qualitative ways. For the large disks, the structural relaxation time increases monotonically with increasing the area fraction of the small disks at low and moderate area fractions of the large disks. In particular, "reentrant" behavior appears at sufficiently high area fractions of the large disks, strongly resembling the reentrant glass transition in short-ranged attractive colloids and the <b>inverted</b> <b>glass</b> transition in binary hard spheres with large size disparity. By tuning the area fraction of the small disks, relaxation process for the small disks shows concave-to-convex crossover and logarithmic decay behavior, as found in other binary mixtures with large size disparity. Moreover, diffusion of both species is suppressed by adding small disks. Long-time diffusion for the small disks shows power-law-like behavior at sufficiently high area fractions of the small disks, which implies precursors of a glass transition for the large disks and a localization transition for the small disks. Therefore, our results demonstrate the generic dynamic features in highly size-asymmetric binary mixtures. Comment: 9 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

Falling to a negative values - 0. 25 oC, the temperature sharply stabilized and did not changed further until the trap reached the surface. The decreasing of the temperature during the ascent is due to the cooling of gas as a result of the performing of the work against the forces of hydrostatic pressure.

50|$|Paul Preuss {{was born}} in the {{mountain}} town of Altaussee, Austria on August 19, 1886. His father, Eduard, a Hungarian of Jewish descent, taught music; his mother, Caroline Lauchheim, an Alsatian, had been a private tutor for a baron. They met when Eduard was engaged to give Caroline's wards music lessons. Based in Vienna, Eduard Preuss and family (including two older sisters, Sophie and Mina) spent summers in Altaussee, following the migratory patterns of the vacationing Viennese upper class that employed him. As a boy, Preuss would often accompany his father, an amateur botanist, on his rambles throughout the local mountains of Altaussee. Never a robust child, at the age of six, Preuss was struck with a polio-like virus that left him partially paralyzed and confined to a bed or a wheelchair throughout that winter and spring. Once sufficiently recovered, the boy practiced gymnastic exercises and took walks to increase his strength. Though his father died when Preuss was in his tenth year, the latter continued the tradition of their mountain rambles, sometimes accompanied by his sisters or friends but often alone. At the age of eleven, he began pursuing summits in earnest, inaugurating his career as a mountaineer. Later, as his interest in alpinism intensified, he would train by placing <b>inverted</b> <b>glasses</b> on top of a wardrobe and doing pull-ups on these unstable supports - excellent practice for loose rock. One-armed pull-ups also became part of his routine (though apparently not on a glass).Following in the footsteps of his father's avocation, after high school Preuss studied plant physiology at the University of Vienna and was awarded a doctoral degree at Munich University in 1911. After graduation he became an assistant at the Botanical Institute of Munich University.|$|R

Wheat heads were treated during grain filling using heat chambers in a greenhouse with 12 h at 38 ∘, 12 h at 25 ∘C for a total of 96 hours. Leaf tissues of seedlings and plants during grain filling were heat treated for membrane thermostability at 48 ∘C for 1 h. For field trials, the heads were inserted to <b>inverted</b> <b>glass</b> flasks. The temperature differential between inside and outside the flasks was about 10 - 15 ∘C. ^ Grain weight gains to maturity were different among genotypes following treatment. This significant genotype by heat treatment interaction indicated response to heat stress is under genetic control. Heat tolerance could be identified at the kernel level using heater boxes. However, the level of tolerance was small, indicating it might be difficult to breed for heat tolerance. ^ Though the results were consistent within an environment, the results of membrane themostability test from seedlings versus hardened greenhouse plants and field plants did not agree. Genotypes responded differently to heat in each environment. The membrane thermostability test for heat tolerance should be used with caution as a predictor of heat tolerant wheat genotypes. ^ The effect of heat stress treatment on the end-use quality was significant. There was significant genotype by treatment interaction for protein content and mixing tolerance mainly due to changes in magnitude. Hence, the effect of heat stress on the end-use quality is under both genetic and environmental control. ^ The fluctuating heat treatment was similar to actual ambient temperature fluctuation. Comparisons could be made among genotypes with the same anthesis date or among genotypes with different anthesis dates if the ambient temperatures and solar radiation were similar. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{analysis of}} a solar still with an <b>inverted</b> V-shaped <b>glass</b> condenser is presented. Results {{are based on a}} new mathematical model obtained from a lumped-parameter analysis of the still, with an approach that makes each glass plate of the condensing system sensitive to orientation and depicts its thermal differences. Numerical computations are made to evaluate productivity and temperature differences between the condensing plates as a function of condenser orientation, extinction coefficient and thickness. From this study it was found a significant influence of incident solar radiation on the thermal performance of each condensing plate. Large extinction coefficients and thick glass plates increase absorption losses that result in an appreciable temperature difference. An extinction coefficient of 40 m- 1 produces a temperature difference of 2. 5 °C between both condensers. A glass thickness of 10 mm may increase this temperature difference up to 3. 5 °C. With respect to the production, due to the still orientation, a difference of 8. 7 % was found for the condensing plates facing an east-west direction. The proposed model is able to reproduce the temperature and distillate production differences that arise between both condensers in good agreement with experimental data. The overall performance of the still, studied with this new approach, was also in accordance with the widely used traditional models for solar distillation. In addition, the condensing plates parameters of the still can be used to force a differential heating such that for the whole day the temperature of one condensing plate is always higher.

Using the presented line characteristics, a coupled line bandpass filter has been designed, fabricated, and characterized in the Ka-band.

Despite the sense of formlessness the mass of material itself sugests, these manuscripts bear striking similarities to his earlier works. The problems of reading and writing, of concealment and revelation, of searching for one's origins and being shaped by one's past, the figure of the storyteller whose manner and difficulties usurp the story itself in importance [...] these are materials Hawthorne returned to time after time as if unable to locate precisely or exhaust completely their implications. The majority of Hawthorne's tales and romances are fragmentary. For Hawthorne, reality is always beyond man's ability to perceive except as bits and fragments. Throughout his work he asserts his awareness that man can perceive and express only a minuscule part of the immense, inexhaustible reality within and outside of his own mind. Every expression is, therefore, incomplete, and the artistic process becomes one of piecing together, by retelling and reshaping, the fragments of both imagination and perception. To study {{the problem of}} closure in narratives that have grown out of this view of the relationship between human experience and its artistic expression is to consider not only the formalistic dimension of the problem (how stories end) but the relationship between the narrative's ending and the ending of human experience in death. It is to consider the relationship between the forms of closure and the formlessness and absence of death. In viewing Hawthorne's romances retrospectively one repeatedly encounters his ironic sense that death both gives meaning to life and renders it ridiculous and that death both generates narrative and demands its ending. Hawthorne's allegory causes him to place himself within his texts in a way that makes them expressive of the design of his own life artistically woven into the texts of his career. By thus <b>inverting</b> the <b>glass</b> and reversing the cycle as suggested in "The Dolliver Romance," the reader effects the reliving of the author's life through art.

6000|$|Qu. 18. If in {{two large}} tall {{cylindrical}} Vessels of <b>Glass</b> <b>inverted,</b> two little Thermometers be suspended {{so as not}} to touch the Vessels, and the Air be drawn out of one of these Vessels, and these Vessels thus prepared be carried out of a cold place into a warm one; the Thermometer in vacuo will grow warm as much, and almost as soon as the Thermometer which is not in vacuo. And when the Vessels are carried back into the cold place, the Thermometer in vacuo will grow cold almost as soon as the other Thermometer. Is not the Heat of the warm Room convey'd through the Vacuum by the Vibrations of a much subtiler Medium than Air, which after the Air was drawn out remained in the Vacuum? And is not this Medium the same with that Medium by which Light is refracted and reflected, and by whose Vibrations Light communicates Heat to Bodies, and is put into Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission? And do not the Vibrations of this Medium in hot Bodies contribute to the intenseness and duration of their Heat? And do not hot Bodies communicate their Heat to contiguous cold ones, by the Vibrations of this Medium propagated from them into the cold ones? And is not this Medium exceedingly more rare and subtile than the Air, and exceedingly more elastick and active? And doth it not readily pervade all Bodies? And is it not (by its elastick force) expanded through all the Heavens? ...|$|R
40|$|How heavy is {{the weight}} of air above your head? At first, this seems a ridiculous question. However, gases do {{actually}} have a weight and since the atmosphere consists of a mixture of gases (mainly nitrogen and oxygen), air has a weight. This weight is also described as pressure. In fact, the atmosphere is exerting about 5 tonnes of pressure on your head. A cubic metre of air typically weighs about 1. 2 kilograms (kg) at sea-level. Thus, {{the weight of}} air in a car or a large tea chest is about 1 kg, which is approximately {{the weight of a}} large bag of sugar. Fortunately, we do not experience this weight or pressure because our internal pressure acts as a counter-balance. However, we do feel rapid changes in pressure. For instance, if you dive into a swimming pool, the sudden increase in pressure is expressed particularly by compression on the head, especially the eardrums. This is because water is about 1000 times denser than air. Furthermore, we also sense changes in pressure during air travel. Aircraft are normally pressurized to the equivalent pressure at about 2000 metres. Therefore, on ascent and descent we can experience changes in pressure, this is usually noticeable by a slight discomfort in your eardrums, with the drums tending to ‘pop’. Large animals have difficulty in adjusting rapidly to pressure changes. For instance, there have been reports of cows exploding when hit by tornadoes (extremely violent whirlwinds). The inner core or ‘vortex’ of tornadoes is the lowest pressure system on Earth. When these extremely low-pressure systems hit cattle, they cannot rapidly adjust their internal pressure and they can therefore explode. For the same reason, people in tornado-vulnerable areas (such as ‘tornado alley’ in the central USA) are advised to open windows in advance of possible tornadoes, as this diminishes the chances of the house exploding when hit by a tornado (i. e. very low pressure outside and relatively high pressure inside). Evangelista Torricelli {{was one of the first}} scientists to experiment with pressure. In 1644, Torricelli inverted a tube of mercury into a vessel containing mercury (a liquid metal). In the upper part of the tube a vacuum was created when the mercury fell. This meant Torricelli was able to show that air pressure was capable of supporting a column of mercury. When the air pressure rose, the height of mercury increased. When the air pressure decreased, the height of the mercury decreased. To illustrate air pressure to yourself, simply place a drinking glass under the water level in a bowl. Raise the <b>inverted</b> full <b>glass</b> above the surface of the water, keeping the rim below the water level. Air pressure keeps the water in the glass, even though it is above water level...|$|R
30|$|The cell {{proliferation}} assay {{was designed to}} measure the growth of cells over a 7 -day period at the predetermined time points of days 1, 3, and 7. One extra sample of each type of the graphene and control surfaces was included for cell staining and imaging on day 7 to check the morphology of cells on each substrate. At {{each of the three}} time points, one plate was removed and samples were transferred to the wells of a fresh TCPS plate for MTT assay to measure the viability/number of adherent cells on each graphene sample. An MTT assay is a colorimetric assay used to measure cell viability, in which the yellow-colored 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl)- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) is converted into dark-blue water-insoluble formazan crystals by the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases in living cells. After transferring samples to fresh plates, 10  µL of Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide reagent (MTT; Sigma #M 5655) at a final concentration of 0.5  mg mL− 1 in fresh serum-free medium was added to each well of the plates, which were then returned to the incubator for 4  h. After the incubation in MTT, the medium in each well was replaced with 1  mL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and the plates were shaken for 10  min to dissolve the formazan product. A 100 -µL sample was then taken from each well and transferred to the wells of a 96 -well plate for spectrophotometric determination at 595  nm using a plate reader (SpectraMax, Molecular Devices, USA). At day 7, the extra samples included for cell morphology examination were rinsed in PBS, and the adherent cells were fixed in 4 % formol saline for 30  min at room temperature. After rinsing in PBS and staining with 0.4 % trypan blue for 15  min at room temperature, the cells were rinsed in PBS and <b>inverted</b> onto a <b>glass</b> microscope slide in glycerol:PBS (1 : 1). Samples were viewed using both phase contrast and fluorescence microscopes set on FITC wavelength, as the Thermanox™ material is autofluorescent at FITC wavelength, allowing darkly stained cells adhered to the opaque substrates to be visualized and imaged.|$|R
6000|$|The Instrument is this. I {{prepare a}} pretty capaceous Bolt-head AB, with [...] a small stem about two {{foot and a}} half long DC; upon the end of this D [...] I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen syphon DEF (open at D, E and [...] F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as {{occasion}} serves) whose [...] stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not [...] above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly [...] together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass [...] ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half [...] the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board [...] RS; then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first [...] figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that [...] posture, so as that the weight of the Mercury that is afterwards to [...] be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a [...] line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal [...] parts, or that it may pass, as 'twere, {{through the center of the}} ball. [...] I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into [...] inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be [...] above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I [...] subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or [...] soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the [...] Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole [...] Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my [...] finger, I oftentimes erect and <b>invert</b> the whole <b>Glass</b> and Frame, and [...] thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels [...] of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with [...] clear and well strain'd Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball [...] of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole [...] E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying [...] out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over [...] in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot: [...] Having thus softned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this [...] manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch [...] the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the [...] end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the [...] small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC: [...] Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it [...] perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small [...] Syphon I draw out the Mercury so long, till I find the surface of [...] it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I [...] immediately take away the Syphon, and if by chance it be run somewhat [...] below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little Mercury at F, I [...] raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all [...] the sensible rising and falling of the Mercury to be visible in the [...] surface of the Mercury in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB. [...] But because there really is some small change of the upper surface [...] also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and [...] falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an [...] inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the [...] Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the [...] Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having [...] thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost [...] limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by certain small [...] Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner exprest in the Figure.
