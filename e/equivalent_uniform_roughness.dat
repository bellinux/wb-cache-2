Materials and MethodsThe expression of biologically effective <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> dose was derived for non-uniform dose distribution in HDR implants using quality indices and voxel-based tumor control probability. ResultsThe results of this study show that high dose regions of the implant have higher tumor control probability. But these regions may also have a large number of normal cells and consequently may lead to severe normal tissue complications. If tumor coverage was not proper then the overall tumor control probability would be low and might result in tumor recurrence. Higher values of external volume index, dose non-uniformity ratio and overdose volume index were related to higher normal tissue complication rates outside and inside the implants. ConclusionThe present concept may provide an alternative approach to calculate tumor control probability for HDR implants...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} effect of the {{intensity}} modulated radiation therapy according to <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> dose optimization method on patients with lung cancer. Methods: A total of 82 cases of non-small cell lung cancer were divided into observation group and control group according to the random number table method. Patients in the control group received conventional radiotherapy while observation group received intensity modulated radiotherapy based on <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> dose optimization method. The treatment effects, survival times, blood vessel-related factors, blood coagulation function and the levels of inflammatory factors and so on were compared between the two groups of patients. Results: The effective rate of the observation group after treatment was higher than that of the control group. Progression free survival and median overall survival times were longer than those of patients in the control group (P< 0. 05). The serum VEGF and HIF-αα levels as well as D-D, TT, PT, APTT and FIB levels were lower in observation group patients after treatment than those in the control group(P< 0. 05). At the same time point, serum TNF-αα, CRP and PCT levels in the observation group after treatment were lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). Serum M 2 -PK, CA 125, CEA and SCC values of patients in the observation group after treatment were all significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05).

30|$|Currently, {{many aspects}} of {{fundamental}} radiobiology in radioembolization are unknown. For example, the group of Chiesa et al. was unexpectedly unable to show a clear increase in predictive power for outcome when using <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> dose-based measures, {{as opposed to the}} average absorbed dose to the tumor or healthy liver tissue [61]. This illustrates that radiobiological model parameters are not well established for this modality and that the precise relation between absorbed dose non-homogeneity at both the macro (voxel) level and sub-millimeter level and tissue response is not well understood. We expect that a better understanding of radiobiology on this level will aid the establishment of a coherent account on the efficacy of radioembolization and to enable further refinements in patient selection and/or personalized dose optimization. In that sense, the combination of statistical histological data with models that bridge between micro-distribution and clinically observable macroscopic features in reconstructed data (e.g., ‘mottled look’ in 90 Y PET) might provide additional insight into (deviations from) dose-response relationships in a wide population of patients and may result in a micro-scale <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> dose-metric.|$|R

40|$|Gravel-bed braided rivers are {{characterized}} by shallow, branching flow across low relief, complex and mobile bed topography. These conditions present a major challenge {{for the application of}} higher dimensional hydraulic models, the predictions of which are nevertheless vital to inform flood risk and ecosystem management. This paper demonstrates how high-resolution topographic survey and hydraulic monitoring at a density commensurate with model discretization can be used to advance hydrodynamic simulations in braided rivers. Specifically, we detail applications of the shallow water model, Delft 3 d, to the Rees River, New Zealand, at two nested scales: a 300 m braid bar unit and a 2. 5 km reach. In each case, terrestrial laser scanning was used to parameterize the topographic boundary condition at hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy. Dense observations of depth and velocity acquired from a mobile acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp), along with low-altitude aerial photography, were then used to create a data-rich framework for model calibration and testing at a range of discharges. Calibration focused on the estimation of spatially <b>uniform</b> <b>roughness</b> and horizontal eddy viscosity, ?H, through comparison of predictions with distributed hydraulic data. Results revealed strong sensitivity to ?H, which influenced cross-channel velocity and localization of high shear zones. The high resolution bed topography partially accounts for form resistance and the recovered roughness was found to scale by 1. 2 - 1. 4 D 84 grain diameter. Model performance was good for a range of flows, with minimal bias and tight error distributions, suggesting acceptable predictions can be achieved with spatially <b>uniform</b> <b>roughness</b> and ?H. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

Then silicon carbon (SiC) or diamond abrasive (DA) mixed with the silicone gel was utilized as abrasive medium to polish these holes, machining processes were finished when the surface roughness of the complex holes were decreased to the steady values in AFM.

40|$|A design {{methodology}} is advanced primarily {{to determine the}} tensile strength of annealed and tempered glass. The proposed approach consists of an analytical method to assess the tensile strength of glass, #sigma#_f, and a computer algorithm {{which is used to}} compute the applied <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> stress, #sigma#_p. The glass design approach put forward endeavours to ensure that the surface tensile strength of glass is not exceeded by the <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> stress. The analytical method, referred to as the General Crack Growth Model, is related to the fundamental properties of the glass surface and incorporates all factors that are known to significantly affect the strength of glass. The General Crack Growth Model is based on the comparison of recent fracture mechanics methods and empirical formulations proposed elsewhere. The proposed glass strength equation or the derived glass strength charts may be used to determine the maximum allowable surface tension, #sigma#_f. The performance of the proposed General Crack Growth Model is initially verified by ring-on-ring testing of annealed and tempered glass. The existing and proposed glass failure models rely on the summation of the stresses present on the glass surface to determine the structural suitability of the glass element. This makes these accurate models unattractive for everyday design. A computer algorithm, called Glasstress, has therefore developed to automatically summate the surface stresses and determine the <b>equivalent</b> <b>uniform</b> stress, #sigma#_p, from the results of finite element analyses. The proposed glass design approach and finite element analyses are used to optimise typical bolted connections in glass and to propose an alternative, stronger adhesive connection. These strength predictions are verified by experimental investigation. Finally, the glass design approach is also verified by comparing the failure predictions made for laterally loaded glass plates to results obtained from independent test data.
