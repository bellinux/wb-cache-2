5|$|Several {{otherwise}} unremarkable {{bodies in}} the outer belt show cometary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through capture of classical comets, {{it is thought that}} many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> source of the Earth's oceans, because the deuterium–hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor.|$|E
5|$|Achieving her {{objective}} was, however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared to accept}} reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations {{at the last minute}} as he was to be burned at the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E
5|$|Ebla derived its {{prosperity}} from trade; its wealth {{was equal}} to that of the most important Sumerian cities, and its main commercial rival was Mari. Ebla's main articles of trade were probably timber from the nearby mountains, and textiles. Handicrafts also appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> export, evidenced by the quantity of artifacts recovered from the palaces of the city. Ebla possessed a wide commercial network reaching as far as modern-day Afghanistan. It shipped textiles to Cyprus, possibly through the port of Ugarit, but most of its trade seems to have been directed by river-boat towards Mesopotamia—chiefly Kish. The main palace G was found to contain artifacts dating from Ancient Egypt bearing the names of Pharaohs Khafra and Pepi I.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{specific}} to his South Coast and Cape Cod–based district, such as maritime policy, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body {{to research and}} address fisheries management concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders. In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the Commerce Department to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.|$|E

5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E
5|$|After Italy's {{declaration}} of war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May, Admiral Anton Haus, the fleet commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy sortied his fleet to bombard the Italian coast {{on the night of}} 23/24 May in an attempt to disrupt the Italian mobilization. Of the many targets, Ancona was hardest hit, with disruptions to the town's gas, electric, and telephone service; the city's stockpiles of coal and oil were left in flames. All of the Austrian ships safely returned to port, making it seem that they had been able to attack with impunity, putting political pressure on the Regia Marina from Rome. When the Austrians resumed attacks on the Italian coast in mid-June, Italian Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel responded by sending Amalfi and the other armored cruisers at Brindisi—the navy's newest—to Venice to supplement the older ships already there. Historian Lawrence Sondhaus argues that the arrival of the four fast armored cruisers in Venice should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> deterrent against future Austrian coastal raids, but concedes that they ended up becoming more inviting targets for Austrian U-boats instead.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Lord Nelson class was {{involved}} in what could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> accident on 23 January 1930. This entailed the leading driving wheels jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a point. No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged {{that it was not}} returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed. No. 30854 Howard of Effingham was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at , Hampshire on 20 July 1952.|$|E

5|$|Wail al-Shehri and {{his younger}} brother Waleed were from Khamis Mushait in the Asir province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern Saudi Arabia, along the Yemeni border. Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar {{neighborhood}} in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of Shehri's brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> in the army and director of logistics. Shehri's father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the Red Sea. The family strictly adhered to the Wahabi school of Islam, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music or contact with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English; however, Wail knew little English.|$|E
