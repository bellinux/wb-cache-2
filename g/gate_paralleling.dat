40|$|We study {{variable}} range hopping in the quantum Hall effect {{regime in the}} presence of a metallic <b>gate</b> <b>parallel</b> to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas. Screening of the Coulomb interaction by the gate causes the partial ``filling'' of the Coulomb gap in the density of localized states. At low enough temperatures this leads to a substantial enhancement and a new temperature behavior of the hopping conductivity. As a result, the diagonal conductivity peaks become much wider. The power law dependence of the width of the peaks on the temperature changes: the corresponding exponent turns out to be twice as small as that for gateless structures. The width dependences on the current in non-ohmic regime and on the frequency for the absorption of the electromagnetic waves experience a similar modification. The experimental observation of the crossovers predicted may demonstrate the important role of the Coulomb interaction in the integer quantum Hall regime.

40|$|<b>Gated</b> <b>parallel</b> wire {{structures}} {{obtained from}} inverted-modulation-doped heterojunctions made of high-In-content metamorphic InGaAs/InAlAs were investigated. The narrowest wire width {{was found to}} be âˆ¼ 190 [*]nm made using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. Magneto-transport was measured at low temperatures. Weak anti-localization and suppression with applied negative gate voltages were observed in low-mobility wide wires (1360 [*]nm), which were considered for a two-dimensional system. The dependence on the gate voltage of spin-orbit coupling parameters was also obtained by fitting. The parameters decreased as the negative gate voltages increased. The trend might originate not from the electron system at the InGaAs/InAlAs interface but from the other electron system accumulated at the Al_ 2 O_ 3 /InGaAs interface, which can also contribute to conductivity. In high-mobility narrow wires (190 [*]nm), which are close to a one-dimensional system, weak anti-localization peaks were still observed, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition, the critical widths of wires corresponding to zero conductance were estimated to be < 100 [*]nm.

Electron {{interference effects}} have been studied in wet chemically etched ring structures with respect of temperature and ring dimensions. Periodic Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are superimposed on a non-periodic interference pattern due to universal conductance fluctuations in the quasi-ballistic regime. A new self-aligned gate-process has been developed to prepare Schottky <b>gates</b> <b>parallel</b> to the ring whereas in-plane gates were etched simultaneously with the ring structure.

A list of variables associated to each node guarantees that only the nodes inside a loop are conditioned on the variable which breaks it. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it computes the probability directly on the original network instead of building a cluster tree, and this can save time when debugging a model and when the sparsity of evidence allows a pruning of the network. The algorithm is also advantageous when some families in the network interact through AND/OR <b>gates.</b> A <b>parallel</b> implementation of the algorithm with a processor for each node is possible even in the case of multiply-connected networks...|$|R
