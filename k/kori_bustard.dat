50|$|English naturalist William John Burchell {{described}} the <b>kori</b> <b>bustard</b> in 1822. The specific epithet kori {{is derived from}} the Tswana name for this bird - Kgori.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kori</b> <b>bustard</b> is now {{generally}} uncommon outside major protected areas. Habitat {{destruction is}} a major problem for the species, compounded by bush encroachment due to overgrazing by livestock and agricultural development. Poisons used to control locusts may also effect and collisions with overhead power wires regularly claim kori bustards. One 10 km stretch of overhead powerlines in the Karoo killed 22 kori bustards during a five-month period. Kori bustards tend to avoid areas used heavily by humans.

50|$|The {{size and}} dark crest are {{generally}} diagnostic amongst the bustards {{found in the}} <b>kori</b> <b>bustard's</b> range. However, East Africa holds the greatest diversity of bustards anywhere, including some other quite large species, and these {{have the potential to}} cause confusion. <b>Kori</b> <b>bustards</b> are distinguished from Denham's bustard (Neotis denhamii) and Ludwig's bustard (Neotis luwigii), both of which they sometimes forage with, by their greyer appearance and by their lack of a tawny red hind-neck and upper mantle. In flight it can be distinguished from both of these somewhat smaller bustards by not displaying any white markings on the upperwing, which is uniformly grey here. Both Stanley's and Ludwig's <b>bustards</b> lack the <b>kori's</b> dark crest. More similar to, and nearly the same size as, the kori is the closely related Arabian bustard (Ardeotis arabs) (despite its name, the latter species ranges well into East Africa).

40|$|A {{review was}} {{conducted}} of 236 postmortem examinations of six species of captive and imported bustards in the United Arab Emirates {{for the period}} 1979 - 94. The most common causes of death in adult imported houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) were euthanasia due to Newcastle disease, aspergillosis, and post-transportation-related deaths. Helminth parasites were a common finding in imported houbara bustards, and large parasite burdens occasionally caused intestinal obstruction and death. The most common causes of death in adult captive houbara bustards were trauma- related deaths and euthanasia for or death following treatment for capture myopathy.

50|$|Their diet {{is made up}} {{primarily}} of bees and other flying insects, and their major hunting strategy involves hawking flying insects from perch.

50|$|Being a large, ground-dwelling bird species, the <b>kori</b> <b>bustard</b> is {{vulnerable}} to many of Africa's myriad of formidable terrestrial predators. Leopards (Panthera pardus), caracals (Caracal caracal), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), African rock pythons (Python sebae), jackals (Canis spp.), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), martial eagles (Polemaetus bellicosus), and Verreaux's eagle-owls (Bubo lacteus) are amongst their potential natural predators. Additionally, warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), Cape eagle-owls (Bubo capensis), mongooses and baboons (Papio spp.) may eat eggs, small chicks, {{and in the case}} of the tawny eagle and the Cape eagle-owl sometimes adults. When alarmed, kori bustards make barking calls and bend forward and spread their tail and wings to appear larger. Adults will growl when their young are threatened by predators. Chicks tend to be the most vulnerable to predators by far. Many, despite their cryptic camouflage and the mother's defenses, are regularly picked off by jackals and leopards at night. Up to 82% of <b>kori</b> <b>bustard</b> chicks die in their first year of life. When found with carmine bee-eaters, the smaller birds may incidentally provide some protection from predators due to their vigilance. The display of the adult male may make it more conspicuous to larger predators, such as hyenas or lions. A shock display may be performed when a bird is alarmed. While too large to be prey for most predatory birds, it is known that the martial eagle is a serious natural enemy even for adult bustards. In one documented attack by a martial eagle on an adult <b>kori</b> <b>bustard,</b> both birds ended up wounded, the eagle with a bleeding leg from the bustard's counterattack, but the bustard more seriously injured, with a broken wing and several open wounds. Although it walked away, the injured bustard in the confrontation was found dead the next morning, being fed on by a jackal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kori</b> <b>{{bustards}}</b> {{engage in}} lek mating. All bustards have polygynous breeding habits, {{in which one}} male displays to attract several females, and mates with them all. Males display at regularly used sites, each male utilizing several dispersed leks or display areas. These displays usually {{take place in the}} mornings and evenings. The courtship displays of the males are impressive and elaborate, successfully advertising their presence to potential mates. The males hold their heads backwards, with cheeks bulging, the crest is held erect, the bill open and they inflate their gular pouches, forming a white throat [...] "balloon". During this display the oesophagus inflates to as much as four times its normal size and resembles a balloon. They also puff out their frontal neck feathers which are splayed upwards showing their white underside. The white may be visible up to 1 km away during display. Their wings are drooped and their tails are raised upwards and forwards onto their backs like a turkey, the retrices being held vertically and their undertail coverts fluffed out. They enhance their performance with an exaggerated bouncing gait. When displaying they stride about with their necks puffed out, their tail fanned and their wings planed and pointed downward. They also emit a low-pitched booming noise when the neck is at maximum inflation and snap their bills open and shut. Several males dispersed over a wide area gather to display but usually one is dominant and the others do not display in his presence and move away. The displaying males are visited by the females who presumably select the male with the most impressive display. Occasionally fights between males can be serious during the mating season when display areas are being contested, with the two competitors smashing into each other's bodies and stabbing each other with their bills. They may stand chest-to-chest, tails erect, bills locked and 'push' one another for up to 30 minutes.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} bustards, the female makes no real nest. The female <b>kori</b> <b>bustard</b> lays her eggs {{on the ground}} in a shallow, unlined hollow, rather than the typical scrape. This nest is usually located within 4 m of a tree or shrub, termite mound or an outcrop of rocks. The hollow may measure 300 - 450 mm in {{diameter}} and be almost completely covered by the female when she's incubating. Due to their ground location, nests are often cryptic and difficult for a human to find, unless stumbled onto by chance. The same site is sometimes reused in successive years. The <b>kori</b> <b>bustard</b> is a solitary nester and {{there is no evidence of}} territoriality amongst the females. Usually two eggs are laid, though seldom 1 or 3 may be laid. Clutch size is likely correlated to food supply. They are cryptically colored with the ground color being dark buff, brown or olive and well marked and blotched with shades of brown, grey and pale purple. Eggs are somewhat glossy or waxy and have a pitted-looking surface. Egg size is 81 to 86 mm in height and 58 to 61 mm width. The eggs weigh individually about 149 g, with a range of 121 to 178 g.|$|E

5000|$|Trumpeter swans often mate for life, {{and both}} parents {{participate}} in raising their young, but primarily the female incubates the eggs. Most pair bonds are formed when swans are 5 to 7 years old, although some pairs do not form {{until they are}} nearly 20 years old. [...] "Divorces" [...] have been known between birds, {{in which case the}} mates will be serially monogamous, with mates in differing breeding seasons. Occasionally, if his mate dies, a male trumpeter swan may not pair again {{for the rest of his}} life. Most egg laying occurs between late April and May. The female lays 3-12 eggs, with 4 to 6 being average, in a mound of plant material on a small island, a beaver or muskrat lodge, or a floating platform on a clump of emergent vegetation. The same location may be used for several years and both members of the pair help build the nest. The nest consists of a large, open bowl of grasses, sedges and various aquatic vegetation and have ranged in diameter from 1.2 to 3.6 m, the latter after repeated uses. The eggs average 73 mm wide, 113.5 mm long, and weigh about 320 g. The eggs are quite possibly the largest of any flying bird alive today, in comparison they are about 20% larger in dimensions and mass than those of an Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), which attains similar average adult weights, and more than twice as heavy as those of <b>kori</b> <b>bustards</b> (Ardeotis <b>kori).</b> The incubation period is 32 to 37 days, handled mainly by the female, although occasionally by the male as well. The young are able to swim within two days and usually are capable of feeding themselves after, at most, two weeks. The fledging stage is reached at roughly 3 to 4 months. While nesting, trumpeter swans are territorial and harass other animals, including conspecifics, who enter the area of their nest.|$|R
50|$|The female, who {{alone does}} all the {{brooding}} behavior without male help, stays at the nest 98% of the time, rarely eating and never drinking. Occasionally she stretches her legs and raises her wings overhead. The female regularly turns the eggs with her bill. The female's plumage is drab and earth-colored, which makes her well camouflaged. She occasionally picks up pieces of vegetation and drops them on her back to render her camouflage more effective. If they need to feed briefly, the females go {{to and from the}} nest with a swift, silent crouching walk. If approached the incubating bird either slips unobtrusively from the nest or sits tight, only flying off at the last moment. The incubation period is 23 to 30 days, though is not known to exceed 25 days in wild specimens. The young are precocial and very well camouflaged. The lores are tawny, the crown tawny mottled black. A broad white supercilium bordered with black meets on the nape, extending down the centre of the nape. The neck is white with irregular black stripes from behind the eye and {{from the base of the}} lower mandibles. The upper parts are tawny and black with 3 black lines running along the back. The underparts are whitish. When the chicks hatch, the mother brings them a steady stream of food, most of it soft so the chicks can eat it easily. Captive hatchlings weigh 78 to 116 g on their first day but grow quickly. The precocial chicks are able to follow their mother around several hours after hatching. After a few weeks, the young actively forage closely with their mothers. They fledge at 4 to 5 weeks old, but are not self-assured fliers until 3 to 4 months. On average, around 67% of eggs successfully hatch (testimony to the effective camouflage of nests) and around one of the two young survive to adulthood. In Namibia and Tanzania, breeding success has been found to be greatly reduced during times of drought. Most young leave their mothers in their second year of life, but do not start breeding until they are fully mature at three to four years old in both sexes in studies conducted both of wild and captive bustards. The lifespan of wild <b>kori</b> <b>bustards</b> is not known but they may live to at least 26 or possibly 28 years old in captivity.|$|R

(10 mg/kg) > oral (10 mg/kg), but it was only higher than 8 : 1 for i. v and i. m. administrations of enrofloxacin at 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively, against a low MIC (0. 5 mu g/mL). A dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg repeated every 12 h, or 15 mg/kg repeated every 24 h, would be expected to give blood concentrations above 0. 5 mu g/mL and hence provide therapeutic response in the bustard against a wide range of bacterial infections...|$|R
