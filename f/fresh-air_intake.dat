40|$|The {{topic of}} {{environmental}} pollution is of special {{significance in the}} atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) especially in urban areas as {{it is one of}} the significant sources of poor indoor air quality due to contamination of fresh-air intakes. In city centres where external air pollution levels are relatively high, it is usually assumed that natural ventilation may not be able to provide adequate indoor air quality. Therefore mechanical ventilation and air-conditioning systems are thus being solicited to "clean" the incoming air (Kukadia and Palmer, 1998). There is evidence that such systems do not always provide clean fresh-air to the occupants of the building since several contaminants from nearby outside sources exist (e. g. vehicle exhaust, rooftop stack exhaust, wind-blown dust). Control of the pollutant sources and understanding the dispersion mechanisms, therefore, shall be considered as the first alternative to evaluate better these harmful phenomena. This thesis focuses on dispersion and transportation of pollutant emissions from a building rooftop stack situated in the wake of a neighbouring tower using numerical simulation approach. The main objective of this work is to contribute to the "best-practice" of numerical modelling for dispersion studies. For that, wind tunnel tests as well as full-scale experiments are numerically reproduced to shed light on the uncertainties related to the complex dispersion phenomenon when using CFD simulations. In the first study of this thesis, the behaviour of the flow and pollutant concentration fields around the two-building configuration are investigated by means of various k − �e turbulence models (i. e. standard, re-normalization group (RNG) and realizable k −� e models). The results show that the realizable k − �e model yields the best agreement with wind tunnel experimental data for lower stack height and smaller momentum ratio, while the RNG k −� e model performs best for taller stacks. Despite an overestimation of concentrations using the realizable k − e �model, it remains the only model that provides the correct trend of concentration distribution in the lower region between the two buildings. Based on this finding, the second study deals with the ability of CFD to simulate controlled (wind tunnel scale) and non-controlled (fullscale) environments using realizable k − e � model. This study details also the main steps for conducting consistent and reliable numerical simulations for dispersion studies. Additionally, CFD is shown to simulate better controlled environments than non-controlled environments. The third study investigates the influence of two important parameters related to the pollutant exhaust source, i. e. stack height and pollutant exhaust velocity, on the concentration fields measured in the wind tunnel. The results show that increasing the stack height has an effect that is similar to increasing the pollutant exhaust velocity on the concentration distributions and that such effect depends upon the wall of the building under consideration. In addition,recommendations on <b>fresh-air</b> <b>intake</b> locations for the two buildings are provided. In the final study, an unsteady turbulence model (i. e. detached-eddy simulation) is tested to evaluate the flow-field and the dispersion field around the two-building configuration. The results show that the flow fluctuation capture is crucial to address better the dispersion in the wake of buildings. Consequently, the strengths of using an unsteady approach are compared to RANS methodology which provides however good results far from the exhaust source. The results of this extensive research support the use of an unsteady methodology in future works...|$|E
40|$|The {{dispersion}} of pollutants exhausted from a building roof stack {{located in the}} wake of a tower is investigated by means of the realizable k–ɛ turbulence model. Variations in stack height and pollutant exhaust velocity are considered to assess their influence on the distribution of pollutant concentrations in the neighbourhood of the emitting building. In order to determine optimum locations for <b>fresh-air</b> <b>intakes,</b> the worst case is considered, namely when the wind originates directly upstream of the tower and places the emitting building in its wake. Special attention is given to the evolution of the plume and distribution of pollutant concentrations on the roof and windward wall of the emitting building, as well as on the leeward wall of the upwind tower. Simulation results are compared to wind tunnel experiments conducted in a boundary layer wind tunnel. For this particular configuration, the paper shows that increasing the stack height has an effect similar to that obtained by increasing the momentum ratio, but with some differences, depending upon which wall of the two buildings is considered. On the emitting building, the leeward wall has the lowest concentration values for all stack heights and momentum ratios considered; thus this is the best location for <b>fresh-air</b> <b>intakes.</b> However, for the tower, <b>fresh-air</b> <b>intakes</b> should not be located on the leeward wall due to high pollutant concentrations. The results show completely different pollutant dispersion patterns from those for an isolated building. This highlights the importance of accounting for structures that lie in close proximity to the emitting building...|$|R
