Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E
2500|$|In {{real estate}} {{investment}} trusts and royalty trusts, the distributions paid often will be consistently greater than the company earnings. This can be sustainable because the accounting earnings do not recognize any increasing value of real estate holdings and resource reserves. If there is no economic increase {{in the value of the}} company's assets then the excess distribution (or dividend) will be a return of capital and the book value of the company will have shrunk by an equal amount.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that the shapes (particularly around zero) <b>of</b> the frequency <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> metrics examined in the extant earnings management literature are affected by (1) deflation (using, for example, price or market capitalization), (2) sample selection criteria that lead to differential inclusion/exclusion of observations {{to the left of}} zero versus observations to the right of zero (implicit in studies focusing on firms followed by I/B/E/S and explicit in studies partitioning on a variable differing between loss observations and profit observations), (3) differences between the characteristics of observations to the left of zero and observations to the right of zero (such as market pricing and analyst optimism/pessimism), or (4) a combination of these factors.

50|$|Roy (1951) {{recognized}} {{that a major}} mechanism guiding assignment {{in the labor market}} is David Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage. A worker choosing an occupation will compare the income from one occupation with the income from another occupation. To use the example provided by Roy in his 1951 paper, a person who chose trout fishing would have a comparative advantage at that activity compared to a person who chose rabbit catching. A second consequence of the choice of occupations is that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> is built up from the distributions of earnings in individual occupations. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> within an occupation is affected by the selection of workers into that occupation, as determined by ‘the association existing between any individual’s performance in the two occupations’ (Roy, 1951, p. 494). Roy considers both positive and negative correlation between performances. As a result of the selection, the aggregate <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> depends on the occupations available to workers and their performances in different occupations.|$|E

The larger and persistent cross-national variation in the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> work-related <b>earnings</b> and disposable income is attributable to the role of political actors (such as unions and political parties) as well as economic institutions.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> reports exhibits kinks. Managers manage earnings as if to meet exogenously pre-specified targets, such as avoiding losses and avoiding a decrease in earnings. This is puzzling because the compensation to managers at these pre-specified targets seems to be smooth. We propose a game theoretic model explaining this phenomenon. In our model, investors form expectations of such a manipulative behaviour by the manager. Given these expectations, the best response of the manager is to fulfill the investors’ expectations, resulting in a discontinuity in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> reports.
