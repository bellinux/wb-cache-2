5|$|Buffalo Creek has {{a higher}} level of {{bacterial}} contamination than the nearby Penns Creek and White Deer Creek. There is a possibility of <b>fecal</b> contamination in the creek.|$|E
5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond {{for a long period}} of time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project <b>Fecal</b> Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the <b>Fecal</b> Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's <b>Fecal</b> Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
5|$|Unilateral pudendal nerve {{neuropathy}} inconsistently causes <b>fecal</b> incontinence in some, but not others. This {{is because}} crossover innervation {{of the external}} anal sphincter occurs in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>fecal</b> pellet {{counts and}} {{resident}} surveys, {{the number of}} rabbits is estimated at 2000–4800 left on Amami Island and 120–300 left on Tokuno Island.|$|E
5|$|Ectoparasites {{are seven}} species of mites, five ticks, five fleas, a louse, and the subdermal botfly larva, Cuterebra. Known endoparasites are three species of protozoans found in <b>fecal</b> smears, one trematode, four cestodes, seven nematodes, and nymphal pentastomids found in various {{internal}} organs.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to monitor the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill, led by Vassar College's Environmental Research Institute and the Cornell University Cooperative Extension Dutchess County Environment Program. Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. Benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and <b>fecal</b> coliform counts are also run.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fecal</b> {{lead content}} that is {{measured}} {{over the course}} of a few days may also be an accurate way to estimate the overall amount of childhood lead intake. This form of measurement may serve as a useful way to see the extent of oral lead exposure from all the diet and environmental sources of lead.|$|E
5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form <b>fecal</b> pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these <b>fecal</b> pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, {{the average number of}} <b>fecal</b> {{coliform}} colonies per 100 milliliters of water in the upper reaches of Buffalo Creek ranged from 291 to over 600. The average number of enterococcus colonies per 100 milliliters ranged from 1 to 257. The average number of bacteroides in the lower reaches of the creek per 100 milliliters ranged from 2193 to 13,708. In the upper reaches, the range was 668 to 5893. The average number of <b>fecal</b> coliform colonies per 100 milliliters in the lower reaches of the creek ranged from 330 to over 600. The average number of enterococcus colonies per 100 milliliters in the lower reaches of the creek ranged from 91 to 418.|$|E
5|$|On Twomile Run {{above the}} acid mine drainage, {{a total of}} 19 macroinvertebrate taxa {{including}} 5 members of the orders Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera were observed in 1998. Below the acid mine drainage, {{there were only two}} taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Above the acid mine drainage on Middle Branch, ten macroinvertebrate taxa were observed, of which five belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Below the acid mine drainage, there were two taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. In 1999, the macroinvertebrate density ranged from 197 to 1916 individuals per square meter. The concentration of <b>fecal</b> coliform in the water at Cross Fork is 2000 individuals per liter and the concentration of <b>fecal</b> streptococcus is 2400 individuals per liter.|$|E
5|$|The EPA {{approved}} temperature TMDLs {{for three}} Rogue River tributaries: Upper Sucker Creek in 1999, Lower Sucker Creek in 2002, and Lobster Creek in 2002. It approved temperature, sedimentation, and biological criteria TMDLs for the Applegate River basin in 2004, and temperature, sedimentation, <b>fecal</b> coliform, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed in 2007. In 1992 it had approved pH, aquatic weeds and algae, and dissolved oxygen TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed. In December 2008, DEQ developed two TMDLs for the Rogue River basin (except the tributaries {{with their own}} TMDLs); a temperature TMDL was meant to protect salmon and trout from elevated water temperatures, and a <b>fecal</b> contamination TMDL was intended to safeguard people using surface waters for recreation.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} bog turtles {{in the wild}} is a {{significant}} aid {{to the development of}} a conservation strategy. Radio telemetry has been used to track the turtles' movements in their natural habitat. Blood samples, <b>fecal</b> samples, and cloacal swabs are also commonly collected from wild populations and tested for signs of disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or <b>fecal</b> incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} mainly consist {{of different types of}} <b>fecal</b> coliforms, {{with a high level of}} E. coli bacteria. This comes from pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared safe under California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm events, as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for <b>fecal</b> contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of <b>fecal</b> matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and manholes {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth. An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 and DEC staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to absorb the oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E
5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through <b>fecal</b> sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's <b>fecal</b> incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} <b>fecal</b> matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or <b>fecal</b> incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of <b>fecal</b> contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of <b>fecal</b> {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A <b>fecal</b> plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from <b>fecal</b> incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took <b>fecal</b> samples for DNA testing to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and <b>fecal</b> incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|The clear-cutting {{of forests}} in the 19th century {{adversely}} affected {{the ecology of the}} Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while <b>fecal</b> coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including <b>fecal</b> and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
25|$|In {{waters of}} the U.S., Canada and other countries, water quality is {{monitored}} to protect {{the health of the}} general public. Bacteria contamination is one monitored pollutant. In the U.S., <b>fecal</b> coliform testing is one of the nine tests of water quality that form the overall water-quality rating in a process used by U.S. EPA. The <b>fecal</b> coliform assay should only be used to assess the presence of <b>fecal</b> matter in situations where <b>fecal</b> coliforms of non-fecal origin are not commonly encountered. EPA has approved a number of different methods to analyze samples for bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Originally, <b>fecal</b> {{contamination}} {{was determined}} {{with the presence}} of coliform bacteria, a convenient marker for a class of harmful <b>fecal</b> pathogens. The presence of <b>fecal</b> coliforms (like E. Coli) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage. Additional contaminants include protozoan oocysts such as Cryptosporidium sp., Giardia lamblia, Legionella, and viruses (enteric). Microbial pathogenic parameters are typically of greatest concern because of their immediate health risk.|$|E
25|$|Untreated {{organic matter}} that {{contains}} <b>fecal</b> coliform can {{be harmful to}} the environment. Aerobic decomposition of this material can reduce dissolved oxygen levels if discharged into rivers or waterways. This may reduce the oxygen level enough to kill fish and other aquatic life. Reduction of <b>fecal</b> coliform in wastewater may {{require the use of}} chlorine and other disinfectant chemicals, or UV disinfection treatment. Such materials may kill the <b>fecal</b> coliform and disease bacteria. They also kill bacteria essential to the proper balance of the aquatic environment, endangering the survival of species dependent on those bacteria. So higher levels of <b>fecal</b> coliform require higher levels of chlorine, threatening those aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{antibiotics}} can reduce <b>fecal</b> excretion.|$|E
25|$|Wheat bran is {{minimally}} fermented and binds {{water and}} when {{added to the}} diet increases <b>fecal</b> weight in a predictable linear manner and decreases intestinal transit time. The particle size of the fiber is all-important, coarse wheat bran being more effective than fine wheat bran. The greater the water-holding capacity of the bran, the greater the effect on <b>fecal</b> weight. For most healthy individuals, an increase in wet <b>fecal</b> weight, depending on the particle size of the bran, is generally {{of the order of}} 3–5 g/g fiber.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of leaf beetles {{from the}} subfamilies of e.g., Criocerinae and Galerucinae often employ <b>fecal</b> shields, masses of feces that they carry {{on their bodies}} to repel predators. More than just a {{physical}} barrier, the <b>fecal</b> shield contains excreted plant volatiles that can serve as potent predator deterrents.|$|E
25|$|Vertical ciliary tracts in {{the grooves}} between {{adjacent}} abdominal segments move particles toward the abdominal <b>fecal</b> groove. Once in the abdominal <b>fecal</b> groove, further ciliary currents transport particulate matter (feces, gametes, etc.) {{from the depths of}} the tube, through the thoracic segment to the aperture where it can be released to the sea.|$|E
25|$|Of dietary constituents, only {{dietary fiber}} {{increases}} <b>fecal</b> weight.|$|E
