40|$|Indentation {{is used as}} a {{technique}} for mechanical characterization of materials for a long time. In the last few decades, new techniques of mechanical characterization at micro and nano level using indentation have been developed. Mechanical character-ization of thin films has become an important area of research because of their crucial role in modern technological applications. Theoretical and computational models of indentation are less time consuming,cost effective, and flexible. Many researchers have investigated mechanical properties of thin films using theoretical and computational models. In this study, an indentation model for a thin layer-substrate geometry with the possibility of nonhomogeneous or homogeneous interface of finite thickness between layer and substrate has been developed. The layer and substrate can be nonhomogeneous or homogeneous. Three types of indenters are modeled: 1) Uniform pressure <b>indenter</b> <b>2)</b> Flat <b>indenter</b> 3) Smooth indenter. Contact depth, maximum interfacial normal stress and maximum interfacial shear stress {{play an important role in}} design and mechanical characterization of thin films using indentation and the effect of modeling the interface as homogeneous and nonhomogeneous on these parameters is studied. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to find the effect of indentation area, substrate to layer Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus ratio, layer to interface thickness ratio on contact depth and critical interfacial stresses...|$|R

Two characteristic timescales are identified, respectively associated with the crack tip and the contact zone. Their asymmetric roles in the growing and receding contact phases is evidenced.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using nano-indentation to measure residual stress in glasses was studied. Indents {{were placed on}} the side of flexure specimens at four different distances from the neutral axis while the specimens were under load in four-point-bending. Three different glasses (soda-lime, boro-silicate, and fused silica) were indented with a cube-corner <b>indenter</b> using <b>2</b> to 30 mN indentation loads. A high resolution scanning electron microscope was used to measure the length of the cracks emanating from the corners of the indents while the specimen remained under load. The measured crack lengths were correlated to the local stress using indentation theory. For the correlation, elastic beam theory was used to calculate the magnitude of the local stress at the indentation sites. Results derived from crack lengths were in good agreement with local stress within experimental scatter. However, this scatter was found to be rather large {{as a result of the}} stochastic nature of crack formation. It can be concluded from this study that nano-indentation can be used to measure residual surface stresses with high spatial resolution provided that a sufficient number of indents are used to assure good statistical accuracy...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to introduce some surface treatment methods to control the flaws of ceramic restorations external surface and improve their strength.   Materials and Methods: 40 feldspathic discs were prepared and divided into 4 groups (n= 10) : not indented (group 1) and others indented by vickers with 29. 4 N and received different treatments: no treatment (group 2), polished (group 3) and polished-silane-resin (group 4). Biaxial flexural strength of discs was tested after water storage. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.   Results: The mean flexural strength of specimens in group 1 (134. 49 ± 12. 60), 2 (94. 81 ± 15. 41), 3 (89. 20 ± 16. 22) and 4 (80. 67 ± 12. 01) were measured.

Using DNase-gold conjugates, and biotinylated genomic DNA probes, DNA {{was found to}} occur in both C 1 and C 2 regions. The morphogenesis of the spermatozoon nucleus was investigated using ultrastructural and cytochemical studies. Spermiogenesis was divided into 15 steps. By step 10, condensation of the C 1 region was complete, and at the caudal extremity of the spermatid nucleus, the nuclear envelope enclosed an electron-lucent space. This space and the surrounding nuclear envelope became very enlarged at step 11. At this stage, a plate of approximately 70 nm in thickness was present along the caudal segment of the C 1 region; this "nuclear mantle" did not bind DNase-gold conjugates but stained for lysine-rich proteins using alcoholic phosphotungstic acid. Chromatin condensation resumed at step 12 {{with the appearance of}} spherical chromatin structures peripheral to the C 1 chromatin. These structures then partially coalesced and the indentations of the C 2 region were observed. The expanded nuclear envelope at the caudal extremity persisted in caput epididymal spermatozoa. Spherical inclusions within it did not bind to DNase-gold conjugates but stained for lysine-rich proteins.

At large coating thicknesses (> 300 mm), the first damage takes the form of surface-initiated transverse cone cracks outside the contact. At small coating thicknesses (< 300 mm), the first damage occurs as yield in the substrate, with attendant formation of subsurface transverse median cracks in the coating. At high loads and thin coatings, both forms of transverse cracking occur, along with subsequent delamination of the ceramic/metal interface, signalling impending failure. Conditions for avoiding such transverse cracking are considered in terms of minimum coating thicknesses and maximum sustainable contact loads. General implications concerning the design of brittle coating systems for optimum damage resistance are considered, with special reference to dental crowns. I...|$|R

Therefore, a measure of its transport properties is vital in assessing its long term performance in a given exposure condition. In new structures the rate of ingress of the deleterious substances could be monitored using array of electrical sensors that are embedded in the cover concrete. For structures that are currently in service, tests can be performed by removing cores from the structure (lab based tests) or by using tests that can be performed on the surface (in situ tests). Results relating to few of the most commonly used lab based test methods are presented here along with two in situ permeability apparatuses, viz. Autoclam Permeability System (for measuring gas/water permeability and water absorption) and Permit Ion Migration Test (for determining rate of ionic ingress). Data from these test methods are further exploited using numerical models to predict the long term behaviour of structures exposed to chloride environment. The results from a long term study conducted at a marine exposure site presented in this document suggests that a combined approach of testing and modelling can be used to successfully to predict the long term behaviour of concrete structures.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of hardness and surface studies carried out on electrodeposited tin-nickel and tin-copper alloys using optical and interferometric methods. The importance of hardness testing of electrodeposits is surveyed with a brief account giving the main reasons for choosing tin-nickel and tin-copper alloys for hardness study. The various methods used to study the hardness of electrodeposits are reviewed. The structure and hardness values of the tin-nickel alloy deposits are found to be affected by each of the operating conditions of electrolysis, such as current density, pH of the solution, temperature of deposition, etc. There appears to be a close relationship between the structure and the hardness properties of these deposits. Thus the brighter and smoother the deposit, the harder it is. Conversely, as the grain size in the deposit increases with a consequent fall in reflectivity, it is found that the deposit becomes softer. Though the change in any of the operating conditions affects the structure as well as the hardness properties of the deposit, the deposits of tin-nickel are still found to be compact, homogeneous and isotropic. The isotropic nature of the deposits is revealed by the phenomenon of Ring cracking and further supplemented by the observations with the double-cone indenter. As a result of this study it has now "been possible to determine the optimum conditions for the electrodeposition of tin-nickel alloy for maximum hardness. These are: current density 2 k amp. per sq. ft.; temperature of bath 70 - 80 °C., pH 2. 5. Under these conditions the deposit is hardest (710 D. P. H.) and has a high reflectivity with very fine grain. Furthermore, the present study has shown that the hardness of tin-nickel deposits is largely independent of the thickness of the coating, except possibly for very thin coatings. The hardness properties of tin-copper alloy deposits of various compositions (in the range 10 - 86 Sn) have been studied. It is found that the deposit composition has a marked effect on the hardness value of the deposit. Amongst the different tin-copper alloy deposits studied, speculum is found to possess the highest hardness (D. P. H. 520 +/- 9). Moreover, these deposits, like tin-nickel, are found to be compact, homogeneous and isotropic. The influence of the base metal on the measurement of hardness of both tin-nickel said tin-copper alloy coatings has been investigated in detail. For thinner coatings, the depth of the indentation and hence the apparent hardness may be affected by the hardness of the underlying metal. A minimum thickness of coating is necessary to give the true hardness figure of the coating independent {{of the nature of the}} base metal. The important results obtained may be summarised as follows: (1) If the deposit has the same hardness as the base, then its hardness value is completely unaffected "by the "base whatever is the depth of penetration of the <b>indenter,</b> (<b>2)</b> if it is softer than the base, its indicated hardness remains relatively unaffected by the base until the indenter has penetrated almost the whole thickness of the plating and then gradually rises towards the hardness value of the base and (3) if. the hardness of the deposit is greater than that of the base metal, its true hardness is not measured if the indenter penetrates beyond a characteristic depth, as for example, in the case of tin-nickel alloy deposits, this is l/l 6 th of the thickness of the deposit and in the case of tin-copper alloy deposits it is l/ 8 th of the thickness. If, however, the diamond pyramid penetration exceeds the characteristic depth in the respective deposit, then the indicated hardness in general decreases with load initially rapidly and then gradually, finally approaching the value of the base metal. <p...|$|R

Cavidades padronizadas foram preparadas e restauradas aleatoriamente com (a) Chelon-Fil (Espe) ou (b) Z 100 /SingleBond (3 M). Valores iniciais (KHNi) de microdureza superficial Knoop da dentina foram obtidos a 100, 200 e 300 mim da margem oclusal das restaurações. Uma área de 2, 0 mm ao redor da restauração foi delimitada e submetida à indução de cárie artificial. Obtiveram-se, então, os valores finais (KHNf) de microdureza, nas mesmas condições e localizações da leitura inicial. As diferenças entre KHNi e KHNf foram consideradas para a análise estatística. As medianas de KHNi - KHNf nas distâncias de 100, 200 e 300 mim foram para (a) : - 3, 8; - 0, 3; - 1, 0; e para (b) : 3, 3; 2, 5; 1, 7. O teste de Kruskal-Wallis não evidenciou diferença significativa entre as distâncias dentro de cada grupo. Às distâncias de 200 e 300 mim, não houve diferença significativa entre os materiais avaliados. À distância de 100 mim, (a) diferiu significativamente de (b) (p Dental {{materials that}} release fluoride {{have been shown}} to be effective in caries inhibition around restorations. Adhesive materials would also be effective in caries inhibition by sealing and protecting cavity margins from acidic demineralization. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis that composite restorations with a dentin adhesive system have a caries preventive effect similar to that of an adhesive material with fluoride - glass-ionomer cement - on root surfaces. Twenty roots from extracted sound third molars were embedded in polystyrene resin and ground flat. Standardized cavities were prepared in leveled root surfaces and randomly restored with (a) Chelon-Fil (Espe) or (b) Z 100 /SingleBond (3 M). Baseline indentations were measured at 100, 200 and 300 mum from the occlusal margins of each restoration and the surface microhardness values were obtained using a Knoop diamond <b>indenter.</b> A <b>2.</b> 0 mm wide margin around the restorations was submitted to a pH-cycling model, at 37 ºC. After that, surface microhardness was measured again, as it was before. The differences between baseline and final surface microhardness were considered for statistical analysis. The median values of differences were (a) : - 3. 8; - 0. 3; - 1. 0; and (b) : 3. 3; 2. 5; 1. 7, for the distances of 100, 200 and 300 mum, respectively. The Kruskal-Wallis test did not show statistically significant difference between 100, 200 and 300 mum distances in each tested group. There was no difference between the studied materials at the distances of 200 and 300 mum. Chelon-Fil was statistically different from Z 100 /SingleBond, at 100 mum (p< 0. 05). Under the studied conditions, the glass-ionomer cement had a higher caries preventive effect than the composite/dentin adhesive restorations...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a part of a European {{research}} project named “Prolonging life time of old steel and steel-concrete bridges” or simply “PROLIFE”. As the name indicates the purpose is to strengthen existing bridges. The part of the project that this thesis deals with is developing and testing a new innovative friction grip connection being used to connect a truss with the bottom flanges of beams in order to make two or more beams to act like a steel box girder. The thesis also evaluates the friction grip connection experimentally at the research facility Complab, the largest laboratory at Luleå University of Technology. By increasing the effective friction coefficient the entire friction connection can withstand larger shear forces. The hypothesis is to increase the friction coefficient between the plates in a lap connection by inserting small indenters between the plates. In this thesis three types of indenters have been used, aluminium oxide, stainless steel and tungsten carbide. All types of indenters have been tested in a compression test between two plates. The aluminium oxide and stainless steel indenter types have also been loaded in shear in a friction connection after compression of the two plates. The necessary pre-load to impress an <b>indenter</b> of <b>2.</b> 5 mm in diameter 2. 3 mm into two plates is 11 kN. The remaining 0. 2 mm gap between the plates is due to the crater developed at an impression point. The protruding edges of craters on opposite plates are brought into contact with each other at 2. 3 mm indentation. The aluminium oxide increases friction but the effect is inconsistent and uncertain, since the indenters are crushed and indenting is not identical between different tests. With small indenters made of stainless steel the effective friction coefficient (µ) of the friction connection can also be improved. How much (µ) can be increased by small indenters in a friction connection depends on the existing surface condition or treatment of the plates in a joint. The tests indicate that the effect of the indenters almost equals that of a shot or grit blasted surface with loose rust removed and no pitting. A connection with indenters provides further a certain safety against overloading and the definition of the procedure is unambiguous. In a reference test with just as rolled surface conditions and no indenters, the slip resistance was 54. 5 kN and the effective friction coefficient μ= 0. 09. With 58 indenters and an M 30 bolt with a pre-loading force of 320 kN the slip resistance can be expected to slightly exceed 250 kN and the effective friction coefficient to be somewhat smaller than μ= 0. 40, at the acceptable slip of 0. 15 mm, according to the current Eurocode standard. The slip resistance from the tests with different number of indenters and without indenters is shown in Figure 36 and Figure 37. Without the slip criterion the expected slip resistance for the same configuration can be 310 kN and the effective friction coefficient somewhat smaller than μ= 0. 50. See Figure 39.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We tested {{whether the}} CardioClasp device (CardioClasp, Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio), a non-blood contact device, would improve left {{ventricular}} contractility by acutely reshaping the left ventricle and reducing left ventricular wall stress. Methods: In dogs (n = 6) 4 weeks of ventricular pacing (210 - 240 ppm) induced severe heart failure. Left ventricular function was evaluated {{before and after}} placement of the CardioClasp device, which uses <b>2</b> <b>indenting</b> bars to reshape the left ventricle. Hemodynamics, echocardiography, and Sonometrics crystals dimension (Sonometrics Corporation, London, Ontario, Canada) were measured at steady state and during inferior vena caval occlusion. Results: The CardioClasp device decreased the left ventricular end-diastolic anterior-posterior dimension by 22. 8 % ± 1. 9 %, decreased left ventricular wall stress from 97. 3 ± 22. 8 to 67. 2 ± 7. 7 g/cm 2 (P =. 003), and increased the fractional area of contraction from 21. 3 % ± 10. 5 % to 31. 3 % ± 18. 1 % (P =. 002). The clasp did not alter left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular pressure, left ventricular dP/dt, or cardiac output. With the CardioClasp device, {{the slope of the}} end-systolic pressure-volume relationship was increased from 1. 87 ± 0. 47 to 3. 22 ± 1. 55 mm Hg/mL (P =. 02), the slope of preload recruitable stroke work versus end-diastolic volume was increased from 28. 4 ± 11. 0 to 44. 1 ± 23. 5 mm Hg (P =. 02), and the slope of maximum dP/dt versus end-diastolic volume was increased from 10. 6 ± 4. 6 to 18. 6 ± 7. 4 mm Hg×s− 1 ×mL− 1 (P =. 01). The CardioClasp device increased the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship by 68. 0 % ± 21. 7 %, the slope of preload recruitable stroke work versus end-diastolic volume by 50. 7 % ± 18. 1 %, and the slope of maximum dP/dt versus end-diastolic volume by 85. 7 % ± 28. 9 %. Conclusions: The CardioClasp device decreased left ventricular wall stress and increased the fractional area of contraction by reshaping the left ventricle. The CardioClasp device was able to maintain cardiac output and arterial pressure. The clasp increased global left ventricular contractility by increasing the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, the slope of preload recruitable stroke work versus end-diastolic volume, and the slope of maximum dP/dt versus end-diastolic volume. In patients with heart failure, the CardioClasp device might be effective for clinical application. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 125 : 391 -...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo {{in vitro}} avaliou o efeito da adição de rodamina B dissolvida em etanol nas concentrações de 0, 02 mg/mL e 0, 10 mg/mL, nas propriedades mecânicas dos sistemas adesivos não simplificados considerados padrão-ouro. 96 coroas de terceiros molares humanos hígidos foram seccionadas transversalmente no terço oclusal para remoção do esmalte e exposição da dentina. Os espécimes foram divididos de acordo com os sistemas adesivos Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (MP) - convencional de três passos ou Clearfil SE Bond (SE) - autocondicionante de dois passos: MP-C e SE-C (MP e SE controles); MP-C 1 e SE-C 1 (MP e SE com rodamina B 0, 02 mg/mL); MP-C 2 e SE-C 2 : (MP e SE com rodamina B 0, 10 mg/mL). Para o teste de RU, os espécimes (n= 10) foram submetidos ao desgaste com lixas de granulação 320 e 600. A dentina foi tratada de acordo com as instruções de cada fabricante dos sistemas adesivos e restaurada com resina composta FiltekTM Z 250. Após o armazenamento em saliva {{artificial}} (7 dias/ 37 oC), os espécimes foram seccionados para obtenção de palitos com 0, 64 mm 2 de área média e submetidos ao teste de microtração em máquina de teste universal a 0, 5 mm/min, que foram analisados após 7 dias e 6 meses. O modo de fratura dos espécimes foi analisado com estereomicroscópio digital (x 200) e classificado em: adesiva, coesiva em dentina, coesiva em resina e mista. Para o teste de MS, as coroas seccionadas (n= 6) foram planificadas com lixa de granulação 600. A dentina foi tratada de acordo com as instruções de cada fabricante dos sistemas adesivos e os espécimes foram mantidos secos em estufa a 37 oC durante 48 horas. O teste de MS foi realizado utilizando ponta Knoop (Microdurômetro Shimadzu HMV- 2), a 10 x e carga estática de 25 gF por 10 segundos. Os resultados obtidos foram analisados por análise de variância (ANOVA- 2 critérios) e teste de Bonferroni para comparações múltiplas (p< 0, 05). A análise de acordo com o tempo foi realizada com o teste de t-student. Os valores médios de RU e desvio padrão (MPa±dp; 7 dias / 6 meses) foram: MP-C (41, 95 ± 2, 38 / 22, 76 ± 3, 66); MP-C 1 (28, 02 ± 5, 12 / 17, 93 ± 5, 70); MP-C 2 (26, 28 ± 5, 55 / 14, 30 ± 5, 68); SE-C (46, 07 ± 1, 43 / 19, 07 ± 6, 75); SE-C 1 (37, 49 ± 13, 31 / 18, 54 ± 6, 71); SE-C 2 (34, 16 ± 7, 71 / 17, 89 ± 4, 87). No tempo de 7 dias, os fatores sistema adesivo e concentração de rodamina B foram significantes. Após 6 meses, apenas o fator concentração de rodamina B foi significante. A falha de fratura predominante em todos os grupos foi adesiva. Os valores de MS (KHN) e desvio padrão foram: MP-C (8, 97 ± 3, 85); MP-C 1 (7, 33 ± 0, 99); MP-C 2 (7, 17 ± 2, 45); SE-C (4, 71 ± 4, 42); SE-C 1 (4, 42 ± 0, 56); SE-C 2 (3, 27 ± 0, 30). Na comparação entre os sistemas adesivos, eles diferiram entre si na condição controle e de 0, 10 mg/mL. Para cada adesivo, não houve diferença entre as distintas condições de acordo com a adição de rodamina B. Em função dos resultados apresentados, a adição de rodamina B nos sistemas adesivos não simplificados MP e SE, nas concentrações de 0, 02 mg/mL e 0, 10 mg/mL, deve ser incorporada com cautela para que não influencie nas propriedades mecânicas do material. This in vitro study evaluated {{the effect of}} addition of rhodamine B dissolved in ethanol in concentrations of 0. 02 mg/mL and 0. 10 mg/mL, the mechanical properties of non-simplified adhesive systems. 96 crowns of human third molars were transversely sectioned on the oclusal third to remove the enamel and exposure the dentin. The specimens were divided according to the adhesive systems Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (MP) 3 -step-etch-andrinse or Clearfil SE Bond (SE) 2 -step-self-ecthing: MP-C and SE-C (MP and SE controls); MP-C 1 and SE-C 1 (MP and SE with 0. 02 mg/mL rhodamine B); MP-C 2 and SE-C 2 : (MP and SE with 0. 10 mg/mL rhodamine B). For the &#x 3 BC;TBS test, the specimens (n= 10) were ground with 320 - to 600 -grit silicon carbide paper. The dentin was treated according to the instructions of each manufacturer and restored with composite resin FiltekTM Z 250. The specimens were stored in artificial saliva (7 days/ 37 oC), and then sectioned to obtain sticks {{with an average of}} 0. 64 mm 2 area and submitted to &#x 3 BC;TBS test at a universal testing machine at 0. 5 mm/min, which were analyzed immediately after 7 days and 6 months. The mode of fracture of the specimens was analyzed with digital stereomicroscope (x 200) and classified as: adhesive, cohesive in dentine, cohesive in resin and mixed. For the SM test, the sectioned crowns (n= 6) were flattened with 600 -grit silicon carbide paper. The dentin was treated according to the manufacturers instructions for each adhesive system and the specimens were stored in dry condition at 37 oC during 48 hours. The SM test was performed with Knoop <b>indenter</b> (Shimadzu HMV- <b>2</b> hardness tester), at 10 x and 25 gF of load for 10 seconds. The results were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance tests and the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons (p< 0. 05). The analysis regarding time was checked with t-student test. The mean &#x 3 BC;TBS and standard deviation (MPa±dp; 7 days / 6 months) were: MP-C (41. 95 ± 2. 38 / 22. 76 ± 3. 66); MP-C 1 (28. 02 ± 5. 12 / 17. 93 ± 5. 70); MP-C 2 (26. 28 ± 5. 55 / 14. 30 ± 5. 68); SE-C (46. 07 ± 1. 43 / 19. 07 ± 6. 75); SE-C 1 (37. 49 ± 13. 31 / 18. 54 ± 6. 71); SE-C 2 (34. 16 ± 7. 71 / 17. 89 ± 4. 87). In the immediate time, the adhesive system and rhodamine B concentration factors were significant. After 6 months, only the rhodamine B concentration was a significant factor. The predominant failure in all groups was adhesive. The values of SM and standard deviation were: MP-C (8. 97 ± 3. 85); MP-C 1 (7. 33 ± 0. 99); MP-C 2 (7. 17 ± 2. 45); SE-C (4. 71 ± 4. 42); SE-C 1 (4. 42 ± 0. 56); SE-C 2 (3. 27 ± 0. 30). In the comparison between the adhesive systems, they were significantly different for the conditions control and 0. 10 mg/mL. For each adhesive systems, {{there was no difference between}} the different conditions according to the addition of rhodamine B. Regarding the shown results, addition of rodhamine B in non-simplified adhesives MP and SE, in the concentrations of 0. 02 mg/mL e 0. 10 mg/mL must be carefully added to avoid implications to the mechanical properties of the materials...|$|R
