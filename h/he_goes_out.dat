5|$|Having {{become the}} Goblin, he {{generally}} views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> {{of his way}} to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, {{despite the fact that he}} always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.|$|E
5|$|At a {{bachelor}} auction, the available bachelors on display are deemed undesirable, and the auction generates no money at all. Marge then nominates Apu, who is deemed a success {{by the women}} at the auction. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> on dates {{with many of the}} town's women, and begins to enjoy his bachelor lifestyle. However, he receives a letter from his mother in India, reminding him of his arranged marriage to Manjula, the daughter of a family friend. Not wanting to get married, Apu asks Homer for advice, who suggests Apu tell his mother that he is already married. Days later, Apu thinks that he has escaped the marriage until he sees his mother walking towards the Kwik-E-Mart. To cover him, Homer tells Apu to pretend that Marge is his wife.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|Pooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, {{his closest}} friend is Piglet, and he most often chooses {{to spend his}} time with {{one or both of}} them. But he also habitually visits the other animals, often looking for a snack or an {{audience}} for his poetry as much as for companionship. His kind-heartedness means <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> of his way to be friendly to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return.|$|E
25|$|His {{portraits of}} such Tory {{politicians}} as Lord Eldon are unrelenting, {{as might be}} expected. But elsewhere his characterisations are more balanced, more even-tempered, than similar accounts in past years. Notably, there are portraits of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, which are, to an extent, essences of his former thoughts about these poets—and those thoughts had been profuse. He had earlier directed {{some of his most}} vitriolic attacks against them for having replaced the humanistic and revolutionary ideas of their earlier years with staunch support of the Establishment. Now <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> of his way to qualify his earlier assessments.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{takes on}} the Fremen name Muad'Dib, and emerges as the leader for whom the Fremen have been waiting. He teaches the Fremen to build and use Weirding Modules—sonic weapons {{developed}} by House Atreides—and begins to target spice mining production, which is back {{in control of the}} Harkonnen, overseen by Rabban. Over the next two years, spice production is effectively halted, a fact Rabban tries to keep hidden from the empire. The Spacing Guild returns to the Emperor to warn him of the deteriorating situation on Arrakis. They also fear that Paul will consume the Water of Life, a powerful poison used by the Bene Gesserit to help induce their abilities. The meeting is revealed to Paul in a prophetic dream, but then the dreams suddenly stop. Shaken by the absence of his visions, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> into the desert, drinks the Water of Life and enters into a trance. Upon awakening, he is transformed, obtaining powerful psychic abilities and the ability to control the sandworms. Paul has also regained his ability to see into space and the future, and learns the Emperor is amassing a huge invasion fleet above Arrakis to wipe out the Fremen and to regain absolute control of the planet.|$|E

His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what is he doing here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ...

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else {{is he going to do}} after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

The {{grandson}} of the First Tsuchikage, Ishikawa, and a protege of the Second, Mu, he presides {{over one of}} the longest reigns of a Kage, having personally met many figures long dead in the present, including Madara Uchiha. He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty, and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki. He defended his action, stating that the use of Akatsuki was necessary to protect themselves while still demilitarizing, but this and his advanced age still lead Mifune to deny him leadership of the forces to lead against Akatsuki. When Sasuke intrudes on the meeting room chasing after Danzo, he refuses {{to take part in the}} fight. Due to Gaara's actions and words during the meeting, Onoki reverts back to the noble man he once was before he became hard-headed. Later, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de-facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. He is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the Japanese anime, while in the English adaptation, he is voiced by Steven Blum.|$|E

After a few misunderstandings (including mistaking Rosie for a lesbian when Rosie says [...] "it was between me and another girl"), Sam leaves, and comes back in again to start afresh. After further confusions, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> and comes back in again, and this time introduces himself, tells Rosie {{that she is the}} most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and asks to take her out for dinner. Rosie, having already warmed to his magic tricks and stories of visiting sick children in hospital, accepts immediately. The only problem is that Sam assumes that Rosie is Joanna Rupelford.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Phinehas, the priest, son of Rabbi Hama, {{interpreted}} God's hardening of Pharaoh's {{heart in}} light of [...] "But they who are godless in heart lay up anger; they cry not for help when He binds them." [...] Rabbi Phinehas taught that if the godless, for whose repentance God waits, do not do so, then later on, {{even when they do}} think of it, God distracts their hearts from penitence. Rabbi Phinehas interpreted the words of [...] "And they who are godless in heart," [...] to teach that those who begin by being godless in heart end up bringing upon themselves God's anger. And Rabbi Phinehas interpreted the words of [...] "They cry not for help when He binds them," [...] to teach that though the godless wish later to return to God and to pray to God, they are no longer able, because God binds them and bars their way. Thus after several plagues, Pharaoh wished to pray to God, but God told Moses in [...] "Before <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> , stand before Pharaoh." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, Henry develops a friendship with a mature girl named Eleanor, and goes to see her one more time before they leave. She manipulates him into thinking Adele and Frank are going to abandon him and he accidentally reveals Frank's past. Adele assures Henry she would never leave him. [...] The morning they are going to leave, Henry takes a note to his father's house and leaves it in his mailbox. While he is walking home, a policeman offers to drive him home, and Henry accepts. The policeman is suspicious of the packed car and nearly-empty house, but eventually leaves. Adele goes to the bank to get all the money out of her account, and the bank staff, too, are suspicious. [...] While Adele is gone, the neighbor comes over and speaks to Frank. She, too, is suspicious of who he may be. Henry's father finds the note that Henry left, and calls the house. Before Adele, Frank, and Henry can escape, they hear police sirens approaching. [...] Frank ties Henry and Adele up before <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to surrender, so that they won't be charged with harboring a fugitive. [...] It is not revealed who called the police to report Frank's presence at the house. Adele wants to plead in Frank's case but is warned by the prosecutor himself that if she does, Henry might be taken away from her.

2500|$|After Ben's departure, Phil {{bonds with}} Dennis. When Billy's great-granddaughter, Lexi Pearce, is taken into care, Lexi's mother Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) tells Phil that Ben is Lexi's father and Phil is her grandfather. Lola agrees for Phil to have [...] {{residence}} of Lexi and he suggests to Sharon that they {{pretend to be}} in a relationship to increase the chances of success, even though she is in a relationship with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). They tell social workers that they are engaged but Shirley threatens to tell the truth, so Phil tells them the engagement is over. Phil is appointed Lexi's foster carer and ordered to arrange for Lola to visit Lexi three times a week but he immediately takes over, angering Lola by calling Lexi his baby, refusing to take presents that Lola buys for her and having her christened with the name Mitchell instead of Pearce. Phil and Jack become rivals when Phil tells Jack that he will be with Sharon {{by the end of the}} year, and Phil even proposes to Sharon, though she accepts Jack's proposal of marriage instead. When Phil offers Sharon an increase of her salary, and a 19% stake in club, Jack is not pleased and punches Phil, who falls into the vehicle pit in the garage. Jack thinks he has killed Phil, but Phil later arrives at the pub and announces Jack's guilt. Jack is arrested but Phil does not press charges after Sharon convinces him for her and Lexi's sake. At the court hearing to determine Lexi's future, Phil exposes Lola's lateness and temper during her scheduled meetings with Lexi, sabotaging her chances of winning Lexi back. He later tells Billy that Lola will never get Lexi back, which Lola overhears. She snatches Lexi from his house. Lola evades Phil, Billy and Sharon, until eventually they find her. Phil tells Social Services it is his fault for being too relaxed with Lola, but then allows Lola to look after Lexi while <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out.</b> When Lexi is unwell, Phil praises Lola's actions, and decides to tell Social Services that Lola may be ready to have Lexi back.|$|E
2500|$|The Lords of the ma'amad, having {{long known}} of the evil {{opinions}} and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and borne witness to this effect {{in the presence of}} the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated {{in the presence of the}} honourable chachamin , they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel.
