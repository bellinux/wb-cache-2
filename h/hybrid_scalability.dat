One of the key novelties introduced by SHVC is that it enables <b>hybrid</b> codec <b>scalability.</b> This basically means that the video layers can be encoded with different video standards providing backward compatibility between codecs. In this paper, we propose a software parallel SHVC decoder in <b>hybrid</b> codec <b>scalability</b> configuration. The proposed design consists of an Advanced Video Coding (AVC) decoder for the Base Layer (BL) and a HEVC decoder for the Enhanced Layer (EL). In order to perform Inter Layer Prediction (ILP), a communication of decoding states and outputs is established between the two decoders. While the native frame based parallelism is still allowed within the two decoders, the proposed design also {{enables the use of}} frame based parallelism between the two decoders. The proposed software design enables a real time decoding of the HEVC EL at 2160 p 60 while the AVC base layer is decoded at 1080 p 60 for x 2 spatial scalability...|$|R

Due to the wide variation of available bandwidth over Internet sessions, {{there is a need}} for scalable video coding methods and (corresponding) flexible streaming approaches that are capable of adapting to changing network conditions in real time. In this paper, we describe a new scalable video-coding framework that has been adopted recently by the MPEG- 4 video standard. This new MPEG- 4 video approach, which is known as Fine-Granular-Scalability (FGS), consists of a rich set of video coding tools that support quality (i. e., SNR), temporal, and <b>hybrid</b> temporal-SNR <b>scalabilities.</b> Moreover, one of the desired features of the MPEG- 4 FGS method is its simplicity and flexibility in supporting unicast and multicast streaming applications over IP...|$|R

SCP inherits excellent modelling abilities and filtering algorithms from CP, but so far it has not been applied to large problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) extends Dynamic Programming to large stochastic problems, but is problem-specific and has no generic solvers. We propose a <b>hybrid</b> combining the <b>scalability</b> of RL with the modelling and constraint filtering methods of CP. We implement a prototype in a CP system and demonstrate its usefulness on SCP problems...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{end-to-end}} TCP {{performance of a}} hybrid network composed of multiple Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) in the access segment connected to the same edge node of a core network is evaluated. Three possible core network paradigms are considered: Optical Circuit Switching (OCS), Optical Burst Switching (OBS) and Optical Packet Switching (OPS). TCP performance is evaluated through simulations with ns- 2. The <b>hybrid</b> network <b>scalability</b> is assessed by varying the number of EPONs connected to the same edge node {{and the number of}} Optical Network Units (ONUs) per EPON. Interoperability issues between access and core are investigated and the impact of the most important network parameters is highlighted. The three transfer modes considered for the core network are properly compared under different input conditions, discussing the related trade-offs that may lead to the most suitable choice based on the specific application scenario. Finally, some design issues are investigated with reference to emerging Long-Range EPON (LR-EPON) solutions...|$|R

The AVC BL was previously encoded with the Joint test Model (JM) reference software and the Scalable HEVC test Model (SHM) reference software was then used to generate the HEVC EL. The AVC BL and the SHVC EL were encapsulated into MPEG- 4 Part 14 (MP 4) format using GPAC multimedia framework (GPAC). On the server side, an instance of the GPAC software broadcasts the MP 4 content in MPEG-Transport Stream (MPEG-TS). On the client side, the GPAC player receives SHVC packets and feeds the SHVC hybrid codec decoder. The hybrid codec SHVC decoder consists of an AVC BL decoder and a HEVC EL decoder used under GPAC player through the FFmpeg library. The decoder enables real time decoding of both AVC BL and 4 Kp 60 HEVC EL which can then be rendered by the GPAC playe...|$|R

40|$|Third-party {{software}} is often distributed only in binary form. For software engineering or security considerations, {{it is important}} to be able to analyze binaries. One fundamental obstacle to perform binary analysis is the lack of precise control flow information. Existing techniques to construct control flow of binaries are either static or dynamic. Traditional static techniques usually disassemble a program’s binary image statically and build the control flow graph (CFG) from the assembly-level representation of the program. They are limited in precision because of difficulty in statically resolving indirect branches. Dynamic techniques, on the other hand, suffer from poor coverage and <b>scalability.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> techniques based on combined dynamic and symbolic path exploration can be used to improve code coverage, but still suffer from poor coverage and scalability because they rely on expensive constraint solving to generat...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a flexible and efficient architecture for scalable video coding, namely, the macroblock (MB) -based progressive fine granularity scalable video coding with temporal-SNR scalabilities (PFGST in short). The {{proposed a}}rchitecture can provide not only much improved coding efficiency but also simultaneous SNR scalability and temporal scalability. Building upon the original frame-based progressive fine granularity scalable (PFGS) coding approach, the MB-based PFGS scheme is first proposed. Three INTER modes and the corresponding mode selection mechanism are presented for coding the SNR enhancement MBs {{in order to make}} a good trade-off between low drifting errors and high compression efficiency. Furthermore, temporal scalability is introduced into the MB-based PFGS, which forms the MB-based PFGST scheme. Two coding modes are proposed for coding the temporal enhancement MBs. Since it would not cause any error propagation if using the high quality reference in the temporal enhancement MB coding, the coding efficiency of the PFGST is highly improved by always choosing the most suitable reference for the temporal scalable coding. Experimental results show that the MB-based PFGST video coding scheme can significantly improve the coding efficiency up to 2. 8 dB compared with the FGST scheme adopted in MPEG- 4, while supporting full SNR, full temporal, and <b>hybrid</b> SNR-temporal <b>scalabilities</b> according to the different requirements from the channels, the clients or the servers. 1...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a joint routing and {{scheduling}} (JRS) architecture in a capillary M 2 M network {{that seeks to}} address all the aforementioned issues. The contributions of our work are twofold. First, we designed the JRS architecture with the following attractive features: (1) The CSMA-TDMA hybrid MAC approach combines the strengths of both types of MAC protocols while offsetting their shortcomings. CSMA-TDMA <b>hybrid</b> MAC features <b>scalability</b> and robustness using CSMA/collision avoidance and provides considerable guaranteed and collision-free transmission of critical data using TDMA. (2) Integrated routing and MAC scheduling minimizes the protocol overhead. JRS organizes the multi-hop tree network through a route management procedure and assigns the subframe to each end device in a distributed manner. (3) Multi-channel communication extends the number of subframes and enhances network performance. Second, we provide an actual implementation and build a prototype employing the proposed framework, for the proof-of-concept and performance evaluations. Most of the aforementioned network protocols for capillary M 2 M networks have been evaluated only through simulation experiments. To validate the practicality and feasibility of the proposed framework, we implemented JRS in the TinyOS 2.0 operating system [31] and compared it with the ZigBee solution using self-developed hardware prototype devices. We show that JRS outperforms ZigBee {{in terms of the}} average packet reception rate, average per-hop latency, and energy efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Autonomous robots {{typically}} rely {{on internal}} {{representations of the}} environment, or maps, to plan and execute their tasks. Several types of maps have been proposed in the literature, and there is general consensus that different types have different advantages and limitations, and that each type is more suited to certain tasks and less to others. Because of these reasons, it is becoming common wisdom {{in the field of}} mobile robotics to use hybrid maps that integrate several representations, usually of different types. <b>Hybrid</b> maps provide <b>scalability</b> and multiple views, allowing for instance to combine robot-centered and human-centered representations. There is, however, little understanding of the general principles {{that can be used to}} combine different maps into a hybrid one, and to make it something more than the sum of its parts. There is no systematic analysis of the different ways in which different maps can be combined, and how they can be made to cooperate. This makes it difficult to evaluate and compare different systems, and precludes us from getting a clear understanding of how a hybrid map can be designed or improved. The investigation presented in this thesis aims to contribute to fill this foundational gap, and to get a clearer understanding of the nature of hybrid maps. To help in this investigation, we develop two tools: The first one is a conceptual tool, an analytical framework in which the main ingredients of a hybrid map are described; the second one is an empirical tool, a new hybrid map that allows us to experimentally verify our claims and hypotheses. While these tools are themselves important contributions of this thesis, our investigation has resulted in the following additional outcomes: • A set of concepts that allow us to better understand the structure and operation of hybrid maps, and that help us to design them, compare them, identify their problems, and possibly improve them; • The identification of the notion of synergy as the fundamental way in which component maps inside a hybrid map cooperate. To assess the significance of these outcomes, we make and validate the following claims: 1. Our framework allows us to classify and describe existing maps in a uniform way. This claim is validated constructively by making a thorough classification of the hybrid maps reported in the literature. 2. Our framework also allows us to enhance an existing hybrid map by identifying spots for improvement. This claim is verified experimentally by modifying an existing map and evaluating its performance against the original one. 3. The notion of synergy plays an important role in hybrid maps. This claim is verified experimentally by testing the performance of a hybrid map with and without synergy...|$|R
