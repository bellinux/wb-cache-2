5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

Aged rice is preferred by processors, and there are attempts to develop accelerated aging process using various heat sources. In this study, the effects of various <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> and their influence on the milling, pasting, thermal, and cooking properties of two long-grain rice cultivars during storage were investigated using a full-factorial experimental design. Two long-grain rice cultivars, Wells and XP 723, was treated with 8 different <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> including one control and stored {{at room temperature for}} 180 days. <b>Heat</b> <b>treatments</b> included 2 levels of UV irradiation, 2 levels of autoclaving and 3 levels of convection oven. The <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> significantly influenced head rice yield and thermal properties. The surface lipid content and cooked rice hardness and stickiness were impacted by cultivars, <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> and storage with different extent showing 3 -way interactions. Severe autoclaving resulted in different protein composition from the other treatments. Peak pasting viscosity significantly increased at the first 3 months and gradually leveled off regardless of cultivar and <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> Leached solid contents were decreased gradually during storage. Autoclaving (especially severe autoclaving) samples showed more distinct characteristics on HRY, leached solids and cooking properties.

40|$|Abstract. The Plasma {{transferred}} {{arc welding}} (PTAW) {{is widely used}} for hardfacing components exposed to severe conditions. Without post welding <b>heat</b> <b>treatments,</b> large tensile residual stresses remain in the hardfacing coating, which is detrimental. In this paper, a set of post welding <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> was evaluated for the heat-resistant steel substrate – Co-based alloy hardfacing coating system. Microstructural and mechanical properties, including the chemical phases of coating surface, the microstructure of coating surface, the Vickers hardness and the residual welding stress, were investigated {{before and after the}} <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> Results revealed that during the <b>heat</b> <b>treatments,</b> some elements reprecipitated and the secondary carbide Cr 23 C 6 was formed.
