The {{debut on}} Sky Atlantic was {{originally}} set for 5 April 2016 but was put off until {{a week later}} in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brussels terrorist attacks on 22 March 2016. Series 2 premiered in the UK on 12 April 2016 and made available via Sky's On Demand service.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, after {{pressure}} from the returned soldiers, a second competition was announced. Once again the budget was set at £25,000. As per the first competition, all entrants had to be South Australian British subjects, and all entries were to be judged anonymously, but {{this time there was}} to be only one assessor: John Smith Murdoch, the chief architect for the Commonwealth of Australia. In <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous competition, the top five entrants from 1924 were each given £75 upon the submission of a new design, and all of the designs were insured by the government for £100 each.|$|E

50|$|Many wrestlers at this stable take ring {{names or}} shikona {{that include the}} {{character}} 大 (read: ō or dai), which {{is used in the}} first character of the stable's name and also is in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> two <b>the</b> owners, whose former shikona also included this character.|$|R
50|$|Probably in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> Italic, <b>the</b> nomen gentile {{could also}} be formed with -ie for males or -i and -a for females, perhaps from Italic -ios or its later form -ius, which can be made feminine: -ia. Typically of Etruscan both suffices can be used together: -na-ie.|$|R
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> executive {{results in a}} clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal state.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 {{women were}} allowed <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> choir. In <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> traditionalists, however, <b>the</b> choir was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organ loft, {{so that the}} women would be less visible.|$|R

5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} strict Confucian orthodoxy. Upon {{toppling}} the Tây Sơn, he repealed their reforms and reimposed a classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi in the north to Huế in central Vietnam to reflect the southward migration of the population over the preceding centuries. The emperor built new fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, Gia Long modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Catholic missionaries, something that was increasingly restricted by his successors. Under Gia Long's rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siam from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal. Despite this, he was relatively isolationist in outlook towards European powers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decision of my brethren.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} {{to report to}} prison on March 18, Farmer was granted a one-week delay by Van Tatenhove to watch his son, Trey, play for Clay County High School in the KHSAA basketball tournament. Clay County lost that game to Covington Catholic High School 80-78 {{in the first round}} of the tournament. Covington Catholic went on to win the KHSAA State Championship. Van Tatenhove insisted that he granted the delay in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Farmer family, not as a special favor for Farmer himself. On March 25, 2014, Farmer reported to the satellite camp of the Hazelton prison to begin serving his sentence. He was imprisoned for almost 20 months, transitioned to a halfway house in Lexington on December 18, 2015, and was released on January 21, 2016.|$|E
50|$|One of Laverdure's major {{accomplishments in}} his various roles at Interior was {{shepherding}} new leasing regulations through the regulatory reform process.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been {{alternately}} neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing {{its status as a}} congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The Vandal {{state was}} unique {{in many respects}} among the Germanic kingdoms that succeeded the Western Roman Empire: instead of {{respecting}} and continuing the established Roman socio-political order, they completely replaced it with their own. Whereas the kings of Western Europe continued to pay <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emperors and minted coinage with their portraits, the Vandal kings portrayed themselves as fully independent rulers. The Vandals also consciously differentiated themselves from the native Romano-African population through their continued use of their native language and peculiar dress, which served to emphasize their distinct social position as the elite of the kingdom. In addition, the Vandals—like most Germanics, adherents of Arianism—persecuted the Catholic majority of the local population, especially in the reigns of Huneric (r. 477–484) and Gunthamund (r. 484–496). The emperors at Constantinople protested at this, but the peace held for almost sixty years, and relations were often friendly, especially between Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) and Thrasamund (r. 496–523), who largely ceased the persecutions.|$|E
5|$|With the Ottoman {{annexation}} of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight {{to control the}} city engendered, the Turks showed great <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased. Sultan Selim I, the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar, but rarely provided subsidies {{for the maintenance of}} the mosque, though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers. In contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman walīs (governors) restored al-Azhar in the early Ottoman period.|$|E
50|$|Although no {{precedent}} revokes {{the power}} of nullification, courts have since the 19th century tended to restrain juries from considering it, and to insist on their <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> court-given law. <b>The</b> first major decision in this direction was Games v. Stiles ex dem Dunn which held that the bench could override the verdict of the jury on a point of law.|$|R
50|$|The Book of Nepos was {{so popular}} within the villages around Alexandria that Dionysius went there in person to refute it. In <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> Nepos and <b>the</b> prior orthodoxy of strict literalism, he did so politely, {{entering}} a respectful dialogue with those from the village and contesting each of the arguments they took from the Book of Nepos in turn.|$|R
50|$|Rev. James Bain (1828-1911) was a {{minister}} of the established Church of Scotland and a noted controversialist who, though conservative in theology, sought to oppose a culture of <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> landlords in <b>the</b> Scottish Highlands and especially {{the influence of the}} Seafield Estates. In general, he defended the cause of the poor and of the ‘masses’ against the ‘classes’, utilising a slogan popularised by William Ewart Gladstone.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. Monti Fest {{is one of the}} major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of Novem (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda. Attur Jatre or Attur Fest (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history of miracles. Evkaristik Purshanv (Eucharistic Procession) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings for the new year.|$|E
25|$|Those past cases, O'Connor continued, {{had shown}} <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government's opinion of what speech acts by {{employees}} in the workplace would be disruptive to the government's interest in providing public services efficiently, again in ways the Court had not with cases concerning speech in general.|$|E
25|$|While {{the courts}} are obligated in theory to give <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NLRB's {{interpretation}} of the Act, they do not always do so. The court may direct the NLRB to reconsider its decision or reverse it outright if it {{is convinced that the}} Board is in error. The court may also reverse Board actions that it considers to be an abuse of the NLRB's discretion, typically in the choice of remedies to be applied.|$|E
25|$|Failure of captains {{and other}} {{officers}} to condescend to seamen {{could result in}} the desire for <b>the</b> crew <b>to</b> mutiny, thus challenging <b>the</b> officers' right <b>to</b> <b>deference.</b> <b>The</b> late 18th century's challenges to monarchical and aristocratic power structures bled over into shipboard life.|$|R
40|$|In affirming {{convictions}} {{pursuant to}} a Texas statute implementing common law recidivist procedure, the Supreme Court attenuated {{the efficacy of}} allegations of jury prejudice and of alternative means as constitutional determinants in the consideration of criminal procedures absent potential frustration of specific constitutional provisions. Based upon pragmatic considerations of judicial efficiency and <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> state prerogative, <b>the</b> decision may extend beyond its unique factual situation <b>to</b> narrow significantly <b>the</b> role of due process in defining the range of permissible state criminal procedures...|$|R
40|$|While the {{ethnography}} {{of contemporary}} courtrooms {{has been dominated}} by a concern with speech, this article considers how a silent, validating public is constructed within court complexes. Drawing on fieldwork at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (Arusha, Tanzania), I explore how the court’s threshold practices form validating witnesses whose embodied <b>deference</b> contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> constitution of the courtroom as a space of privileged speech. I suggest, therefore, that court spectators are not incidental, but are integral to juridical spectacle and the authority of law...|$|R
25|$|In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet {{approved}} {{a plan to}} designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision, but the plan faced opposition from other factions, including some ultra-Orthodox members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition, who threatened to withdraw over the government's plan to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the Western Wall in <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Women of the Wall.|$|E
25|$|Belief {{that the}} Oral Torah was {{transmitted}} orally from God to Moses on Mount Sinai during the Exodus from Egypt {{is a fundamental}} tenet of faith of Orthodox Judaism, and was {{recognized as one of}} the Thirteen Principles of Faith by Maimonides. However, not all branches of Rabbinic Judaism accept the divine provenance of the Oral Torah, such that Conservative and (to a greater extent) Reform Jews give <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Talmudic sages while empowering themselves to formulate and adopt their own rulings and interpretations.|$|E
25|$|Costa Deliziosa was christened at Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates on 23 February, {{during her}} inaugural voyage, which started from Savona on 5 February; the first cruise {{ship in the}} world to be christened in an Arabian city. In <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Muslim faith of Dubai a bottle of special date juice was used rather than the {{traditional}} sparkling wine, champagne, or prosecco usually used to christen ships.

50|$|Kumasi was annexed {{into the}} British empire; however, the Ashanti still largely governed themselves. They gave {{little or no}} <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> colonial authorities. <b>The</b> Ashanti were {{successful}} in their pre-war goal <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> Golden Stool. But, the following year, the British arrested numerous chiefs, including the Queen Mother of Ejisu, Yaa Asantewaa, and exiled them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Seychelles, for 25 years. By that time many had died, including Yaa Asantewaa. Kumasi City retains a memorial to this war and several large colonial residences. Ashanti and the former Gold Coast, eventually became part of Ghana.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} informational model of {{judicial}} decision-making in which <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> precedent {{is useful to}} policy-oriented appellate judges because it improves the accuracy with which they can communicate legal rules to trial judges. Our simple model yields new implications and hypotheses regarding conditions under which judges will maintain or break with precedent, the constraining effect that precedent has on judicial decision-making, the voting behavior of Supreme Court Justices, {{the relationship between a}} precedent’s age and its authority, the effect of legal complexity on <b>the</b> level of <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> precedent, <b>the</b> relative stability of rules and standards, and long-term patterns of legal evolution. Perhaps most importantly, we demonstrate that “legalist ” features of judicial decision-making are consistent with an assumption of policy-oriented judges. Political scientists have long recognized the importance of courts as political actors. However, while an extensive literature examines the judiciary’s strategic interaction with the other branches of government (e. g., Ferejohn and Weingast 1992; Gely and Spiller 1992), less attention has been paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect...|$|R
