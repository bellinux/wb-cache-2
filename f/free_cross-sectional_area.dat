40|$|The use of {{pressure}} relief shafts {{has often been}} proposed {{as a means of}} reducing pressure fluctuations and of improving passenger comfort on board high-speed trains in tunnels. The recently opened rail-link between Mattstetten-Rothrist in Switzerland {{is one of the first}} rail projects where such shafts became an integral part of the project right from the design stage. The effectiveness {{of pressure}} relief shafts has been proven during the commissioning phase of this 45 km long new rail-link. Several aerodynamic measurements were conducted in different tunnels with and without pressure relief shafts and with different train types. One example is the double-track Emmequerung tunnel with a <b>free</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of Atunnel = 76 m 2 with two pressure relief shafts (Ashaft = 12. 25 m 2). The same tunnel without any pressure relief shafts would have required a larger <b>free</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of Atunnel = 105 m 2 in order to satisfy the project specific comfort criteria for various train types (∆ptrain < 1. 5 kPa within 4 s). In general, smaller tunnel cross-sections lead to reduced construction costs. Furthermore pressure relief shafts can be combined with additional functions (egress path, smoke extraction, climate improvement, etc.). These advantages must be balanced with possible disadvantages (noise emissions, increased local air flows in the tunnel, etc.) and the limitations (ground overburden). The experience gained from the new Swiss rail-link shows that under certain conditions pressure relief shafts are effective and reasonable. 1...|$|E

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of in vivo Achilles tendon (AT) conditioning {{is limited to}} two-dimensional ultrasound measures of longitudinal deformation of the whole tendon. This study investigated the regional three-dimensional (3 D) deformation of the AT during conditioning. Eighteen ATs were scanned using 3 D freehand ultrasound during 10 successive 25 s submaximal (50 %) voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions. Longitudinal strain was assessed for the whole AT, aponeurosis, and free AT and transverse strain was assessed for the proximal-, mid-, and distal-portions of the free AT. Longitudinal conditioning of the whole AT was primarily driven by creep response of the free AT and transverse conditioning was greatest for the mid-portion of the free AT. Whole and free AT longitudinal strain increased up to the third contraction and were accompanied by a corresponding reduction in <b>free</b> AT <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> (CSA) strain in proximal-, mid-, and distal-portions. No significant changes in aponeurosis strain or tendon volume were detected between contractions. These findings suggest that conditioning alters free AT shape, with increased tendon length attained {{at the expense of}} reduction in free AT CSA. Although AT experiences different amounts of strain in different regions, the number of contractions required to reach steady-state strain during conditioning is uniform throughout the tendon.

The critical Casimir forces between the film's boundary planes B_j, j= 1, 2, are investigated as functions of film thickness L for generic symmetry-preserving boundary conditions ∂_nϕ=c_jϕ. The L-dependent {{part of the}} reduced excess <b>free</b> energy per <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> takes the scaling form f_res≈ D(c_ 1 L^Φ/ν,c_ 2 L^Φ/ν) /L^d- 1 when d< 4, where c_i are scaling fields associated with the variables c_i, and Φ is a surface crossover exponent. Explicit two-loop renormalization group results for the function D(c_ 1,c_ 2) at d= 4 -ϵ dimensions are presented.

In this cross-sectional study, data from 802 participants (247 men, 555 women; mean age, 63. 5 years) were analyzed. The measurement of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the dural sac from the level of L 1 / 2 to L 4 / 5 was taken using axial T 2 -weighted images. The minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> was defined as the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the dural sac at the most constricted level in the examined spine. Participants were divided into three groups according to minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> measurement quartiles (less than the first quartile, between the first and third quartiles, and greater than the third quartile). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> and the prevalence of low back pain. The mean minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> was 117. 3 mm 2 (men: 114. 4 mm 2; women: 118. 6 mm 2). A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and other confounding factors, including disc degeneration, showed that a narrow minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> (smaller than the first quartile) was significantly associated with low back pain (odds ratio, 1. 78; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 13 - 2. 80 compared to the wide minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> group: minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> greater than the third quartile measured). This study showed that a narrow dural sac <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> was significantly associated with the presence of low back pain after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index.

Design. This study quantified trunk muscle <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of male and female spine loading muscles. Background. There is a lack of comprehensive data regarding the female spine loading muscle size. Although biomechanical models often assume females are the same as males, little is known regarding gender dierences in terms of trunk muscle areas and no data exist regarding the prediction of trunk muscle physiological <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> from commonly used external anthro-pometric measures.

This study is aimed to evaluate the correlation between umbilical cord <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> with birth weight and to compare large <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of umbilical cord with macrosomia. AIM: To correlate fetal umbilical cord <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> with birth weight. To compare large <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the umbilical cord with macrosomia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Umbilical cord <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of 250 antenatal women was evaluated from 34 weeks of gestational age. The outcome measured was birth weight. Weight of newborn was measured immediately after birth. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight > 90 th percentile in the study group.

The maximum voluntary knee extension force which could be produced by the untrained subjects was 742 +/- 100 N (mean +/- SD). The trained subjects could produce a significantly (p less than 0. 001) greater force (992 +/- 162 N). <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the knee-extensor muscle group was 81. 6 +/- 11. 8 cm 2 in the untrained subjects and 104. 1 +/- 12. 3 cm 2 in the trained subjects (p less than 0. 001). In the untrained subjects, a significant correlation existed between strength and muscle <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> (r = 0. 56, p less than 0. 001).

The circumvent geometric assumptions about the shape of the stenosis after PTCA, a videodensitometric analysis technique was used for the assessment of vascular <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas.</b> Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the largest balloon used at the highest pressure and minimal luminal <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> after PTCA.

40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i. e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the workpiece while the roll gap changed. To predict the amount of roll gap adjustment that compensates wear, a model for roll gap adjustment is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent roll gap adjustment, which reduces the increased exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> owing to wear up to a base exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> calculated by the roll gap adjustment model is in good agreement with the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> measured.
