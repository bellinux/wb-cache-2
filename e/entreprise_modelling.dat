The talk also introduces {{issues related to the}} use of ontologies and semantic annotations for semantic interoperability purposes. The main topics that are addressed concerns: - The basics of interoperability: problem statement and approaches - Ontology and Semantic Annotations - Location and Roles of Semantics in the Interoperability Process - <b>Entreprise</b> <b>Modelling</b> and Large Scale Semantic Interoperability - Supporting Environments for Semantic Interoperabilit...|$|E

April: The limited edition CX 20 Leader is launched. 700 examples are produced {{and the model}} has the same technical characteristics to the 5-speed CX 20. October: The CX 25 GTi Turbo is introduced — the first genuinely fast CX model.|$|R

40|$|IS Strategic Planning and Enterprise Architecture are {{two major}} {{disciplines}} in IT Architecture and Governance. They pursue the same objectives and have much in common. While ISSP has benefited from business strategic planning methods and techniques, it has not evolved much since the 90 s and lacks from formal, tooled and standard methodology. In the other hand, Enterprise Architecture has known a very fast progression {{in the last years}} helped in that by market's needs and research in the domain of <b>Entreprise</b> <b>Modeling.</b> The basic component underlying both fields is the content framework and metamodel necessary to describe existing and future state. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a new EA content framework and metamodel taking into consideration ISSP concerns and bridges the gap between these two fields...|$|R

Risk Analysis involve nira harvested, nira processed, palm sugar production, and palm sugar prices received by producers. Twostages cluster sampling method is used to determine research areas, i. e, subdistrict of Sindang Kelingi and Selupu Rejang based on the numbers of firms. Using similar critirea, two villages are selected, i. e, Air Meles Atas and Sindang Jati. From those villages, then, 86 palm sugar producers are selected using Simple Random Sampling. Descriptive analysis is applied to describe <b>entreprises</b> <b>model</b> of palm sugar industries while risks is analysed using its varians, standard deviation, and minimum level of production as proposed by Maryam and Suprapti (2008). The research shows that all palm sugar industries in this regency can be categories as home industries with average production scale of 11. 58 kg per process in rainy season and 11. 54 kg in dry season. Palm sugar producers use their own capital to produce palm sugar and borrowed to palm sugar village merchants when they need. From risk analysis, the study finds that palm sugar producers will face higher risk in term of nira harvested and processed, and production in dry season, except in term of price received which is higher in rainy season. Over all, palm sugar producers will not face risk significantly both in dry and rainy season...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the skill}} {{management}} {{is an important}} factor in the new forms of the work organization. Man’s unlimited capacities are the main driving forces behind the evolution and the success of the <b>Entreprise.</b> the organization <b>models</b> have long been ignored, the human resources were considered as a secondary resources in the strategy of the company. Over the last years, however, the requirement to develop more complex skills began to be felt, to better confront the world economic changes. Hence, the skill management regarding the market needs leads to the modelling of the learning system. In this paper, We specify, first of all, the concept of skills, the specifications of the service production systems and the skill production systems. Finally, after a study of the main models proposed in this area, we suggest the modelling of the learningprocess...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the need}} of an institutional change of the universities in order {{to adapt to the}} current requirements of networked and knowledge economy. The e-Learning phenomenon and the ICT driven global educational reform are analysed as well in parallel with the needs of implementing new pedagogy models. Some university models are briefly described, such as: Research University, Enterpreneurial University, eUniversity and Corporate University. The paper puts its attention also on the Web 2. 0 technologies and their influence on the new business models. The emergence of the <b>Entreprise</b> 2. 0 <b>model</b> is briefly described. University 2. 0 is defined as a research and entrepreneurial university which integrates Web 2. 0 technologies and applications in all university activities, including ones with all knowledge intensive stakeholders, and implements the features of the Enterprise 2. 0. The role of the community of practice and the open innovation is analysed. The case of Sofia University that has developed a new computing curricula and strives to implement the European e-Competence Framework by applying the University 2. 0 model has been analyzed and presented as well...|$|R
