40|$|John Hershberger ? and Subhash Suri ?? Abstract. Breakout routing is a {{single-layer}} wire-routing {{problem in}} which each {{of a set of}} pins must be connected to one of a set of vias, but no matching is prespecified. We propose a network-flow approach to breakout routing in which the wiring grid is modeled by a more compact graph. Our graph is a factor of Θ(2) smaller than the wiring grid, where is the ratio of via spacing to pin spacing, which improves both the space and run time efficiency of the flow computation. A flow in the compact graph can be transformed into a <b>wire</b> <b>layout,</b> and vice versa. 1 Introduction Breakout routing is a crucial problem in routing printed circuit boards (PCBs) and multichip modules (MCMs). The problem arises because a typical PCB or MCM has multiple layers available for routing, but electronic components are often connected to only a single layer of the board. Completing the routing requires that these surface-mounted components be connected to [...] ...|$|R

By using the structural information of the <b>wiring</b> <b>layout,</b> the test length can be reduced. Both one-step and two-step diagnosis algorithms are given. They guarantee the complete diagnosis of multiple interconnect faults with no aliasing or confounding. The algorithms have been evaluated by simulation on several benchmark layouts and randomly generated layouts. Simulation results show that more than 50 % {{reduction in the number of}} tests can be achieved for two-step diagnosis when the fault rate is very small, such as in a matured product line.

40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond wires and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the bond <b>wire</b> reliability in <b>general</b> CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of bond wires on bond pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the bond wire reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the bond wire reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application. The proposed layout method for bond pad design is fully process-compatible to general CMOS processes.

The new setup combines a mixture experiment of 40 K and 87 Rb with one-dimensional trapping geometries that are accessible in the miniaturized wire traps of an atom chip. By additionally coupling the internal states of magnetically trapped atoms with radio-frequency (rf) fields, versatile state-selective and species-selective potentials can be created. One special case is the deformation of the static one-dimensional trap to a novel two-dimensional geometry in which the atoms are confined to {{the walls of a}} straight tube. An extensive numerical and experimental analysis of this trapping geometry with the aim of minimizing the variations in the trapping potential was performed. This leads to a new improved spatial arrangement for the wires that create the rf fields. The optimized <b>wire</b> <b>layout</b> was implemented in the new experimental setup and will allow the first realization of such a two-dimensional trap configuration with periodic boundary conditions.

40|$|Abstract — Many current {{parallel}} computers are {{built around a}} torus interconnection network. Machines from Cray, HP and IBM, among others, make use of this topology. In terms of topological advantages, square (2 D) or cubic (3 D) tori would be the topologies of choice. However, for different practical reasons, 2 D and 3 D tori with different number of nodes per dimension have been used. These mixed-radix topologies are not edge-symmetric, which translates into poor performance due to an unbalanced use of network resources. In this work, we analyze twisted 2 D and 3 D mixed-radix tori that remove the network bottlenecks present in non-twisted ones. Such topologies recover edge-symmetry and, consequently, balance the utilization of their links. The distance-related properties of twisted tori together with a full characterization of their bisection bandwidth are described in this paper. A simulation-based performance evaluation {{has been carried out}} to asses the network performance under synthetic and trace-driven workloads.

40|$|In Nb 3 Sn CIC conductors, the superconducting {{compound}} {{is distributed}} into fine filaments and {{embedded in a}} resistive matrix for electrical and thermal stability. Nb 3 Sn formation requires a solid state diffusion reaction at high temperature, which causes an Sn gradient inside the filaments. It {{is well known that}} the critical parameters vary with composition (Sn content) and strain state. In this work the complete 3 D strain field is computed for different <b>wire</b> <b>layouts.</b> First, the relation between the grade of filament reaction and strain is investigated: superconducting wires are studied, taking into consideration non-homogeneous Nb 3 Sn filaments, i. e. considering an unreacted core of pure Nb. Furthermore, the case when the filaments agglomerate together to give a ‘macrofilament’ is also taken into consideration (internal tin wires). A finite element discretization fine enough to take into consideration non-homogeneous filaments would result in a very high number of unknowns, which could be beyond the capacity of today’s computers. Therefore a thermo-mechanical model is formulated, based on the generalized self-consistent method, suitably developed to deal with the material nonlinearity and the coupling between the thermal and mechanical fields. In this way, equivalent homogeneous properties are obtained and the analysis of the wires becomes feasible. An appropriate unsmearing technique finally gives the strain state in the real, not homogenized, materials...|$|R
