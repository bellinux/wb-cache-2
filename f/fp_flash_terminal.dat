50|$|Although the Square shutter {{improved}} the FP shutter in most ways, it still limited maximum flash X-sync speed to 1/125 s (unless using special long-burn <b>FP</b> <b>flash</b> bulbs that burn throughout the slit wipe, making slit width irrelevant.). Any quality leaf shutter of the 1960s could achieve at least 1/500 s <b>flash</b> sync. Greater <b>FP</b> shutter X-sync speed would require further strengthening the curtains, by using exotic materials, {{allowing them to}} move even faster and widen the slits.|$|R

40|$|Background and aims. Bruxism {{is defined}} as a {{habitual}} nonfunctional forceful contact between occlusal tooth surfaces. In younger children bruxism may be a consequence of the masticatory neuromuscular system immaturity. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of bruxism and investigate the relationship between occlusal factors and bruxism among preschool children. Materials and methods. In this cross-sectional survey, 400 3 - 6 -year-old children were selected randomly from different preschools in Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were divided into two groups of bruxers and non-bruxers as determined by the clinical examination and their parents’ reports. The examiner recorded the primary canines (Class I, Class II, and Class III) and molars (mesial step, distal step, <b>flash</b> <b>terminal</b> plane) relationship, existence of anterior and posterior crossbite, open and deep bite. Also, rotated teeth, food impaction, sharp tooth edges, high restorations, extensive tooth caries, and painful teeth (categorized as irritating tooth conditions) were evaluated. The relationship between bruxism and occlusal factors and irritating tooth conditions was evaluated with chi-square test. Results. Bruxism was seen in 12. 75...|$|R
5000|$|FP sync {{was used}} with <b>FP</b> (flat-peak) <b>flash</b> bulbs {{designed}} specifically for use with focal-plane shutters. In these shutters, although {{each part of the}} film is exposed for the rated exposure time, the film is exposed by a slit which moves across the film in a time (the [...] "X-sync speed") of the order of 1/100"; although the exposure of each part of the film may be 1/2000", {{the last part of the}} film is exposed later by the X-sync time than the first part, and a brief flash will illuminate only a strip of film. FP bulbs burned close to full brightness for the full X-sync time, exposing the whole frame even at high shutter speeds.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya 6 is a medium-format {{rangefinder}} system camera {{manufactured by}} Mamiya. It {{was introduced in}} 1989, and the line was discontinued in 1995. The coupled viewfinder windows displays frame lines appropriate to the lens mounted. The lens mount partially collapses when the camera is not in use, making it more compact. The camera has a built-in dark slide that allows the electronic leaf shutter lenses to be changed with film in the camera. It can operate in auto exposure, auto exposure lock, and manual modes. It captures twelve 6 cm × 6 cm images on 120 film rolls and 24 on 220 film. The camera also features a self-timer, hot shoe, and <b>flash</b> synchronization <b>terminal.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony <b>flash</b> sync <b>terminal</b> and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya 7 has a coupled {{viewfinder}} window which displays frame lines {{appropriate to}} the lens mounted, but only for the 65 mm, 80 mm, and 150 mm lenses. The 43 mm and 50 mm lenses require an external viewfinder to be inserted into the hot shoe for composition. There is no composition aid for the 210 mm lens. The camera has a built-in dark slide that allows the manual-focusing electronic leaf shutter lenses to be changed with film in the camera. It can operate in auto exposure, auto exposure lock, and manual modes. It captures ten 6 cm × 7 cm images on 120 film rolls, and 20 on 220 film. The camera also features a self-timer, hot shoe, and <b>flash</b> synchronization <b>terminal.</b> An optional panoramic adapter allows 24×65 mm images to be captured on 35 mm film.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya Press {{is a line}} of medium-format {{rangefinder}} system camera {{manufactured by}} Mamiya. The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and {{a wide array of}} accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm × 9 cm, but images can be taken {{in a number of different}} formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in release cable. The lenses also have <b>flash</b> sync <b>terminals.</b> The camera lacks an internal dark slide, so one has to be inserted into the film holder before changing the lens.|$|R

50|$|The {{frame rate}} for motion picture film cameras was {{typically}} 24 {{frames per second}} (<b>fps)</b> with multiple <b>flashes</b> on each frame during projection to prevent flicker. Analog television and video employed interlacing where {{only half of the}} image (known as a video field) was recorded and played back/refreshed at once but at twice the rate of what would be allowed for progressive video of the same bandwidth, resulting in smoother playback, as opposed to progressive video which is more similar to how celluloid works. The field rate of analog television and video systems was typically 50 or 60 fields per second. Usage of frame rates higher than 24 FPS for feature motion pictures and higher than 30 FPS for other applications are emerging trends in the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A <b>flash</b> sync <b>terminal</b> is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|R
