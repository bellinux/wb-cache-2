5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable,</b> albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of multivariate {{analysis}} of variance (MANOVA) is to determine whether multiple levels of independent variables on their own or in combination with one another {{have an effect on the}} <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> MANOVA requires that the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> meet parametric requirements. When do you need MANOVA? MANOVA is used under the same circumstances as ANOVA but when there are multiple <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> as well as independent variables within the model which the researcher wishes to test. MANOVA is also considered a valid alternative to the repeated measures ANOVA when sphericity is violated. What kinds of data are necessary? The <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> in MANOVA need to conform to the parametric assumptions. Generally, it is better not to place highly correlated <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> in the same model for two main reasons. First, it does not make scientific sense to place into a model two or three <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> which the researcher knows measure the same aspect of 2 - Manova 4. 3. 05 2...|$|R
50|$|If the modeled {{variables}} {{have not}} been standardized, an additional rule allows the expected covariances to be calculated as long as no paths exist connecting <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> to other <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|R

25|$|N.B. The reader {{should be}} warned {{here that the}} order of the {{variables}} are reversed! y is the independent variable and x is the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable,</b> e.g., x = sin(y).|$|E
25|$|The set {{must contain}} {{a finite number}} of alternatives. This third {{requirement}} distinguishes discrete choice analysis from forms of regression analysis in which the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> can (theoretically) take an infinite number of values.|$|E
30|$|Since two <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> namely, women {{decision}} making and income/employment generation activity are qualitative variable, logistic regressiona model has been employed for analysis of impact of some socio-economic factors on two <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|R
50|$|In log-linear {{analysis}} {{there is}} no clear distinction between what variables are the independent or <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> The variables are treated the same. However, often the theoretical background of the variables will lead the variables to be interpreted as either the independent or <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|R
30|$|Formally {{define the}} <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> A {{rigorous}} formalization of the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables,</b> especially the behavioral similarity, is another work that {{can contribute to}} facilitate the evaluation of each subject’s response as right or wrong or in-between.|$|R
25|$|A complex {{function}} {{is one in}} which the independent variable and the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> are both complex numbers. More precisely, a complex {{function is}} a function whose domain and range are subsets of the complex plane.|$|E
25|$|In {{this form}} R2 is {{expressed}} as {{the ratio of}} the explained variance (variance of the model's predictions, which is SSreg / n) to the total variance (sample variance of the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable,</b> which is SStot / n).|$|E
25|$|Computations where {{a number}} of similar, and often nested, models are {{considered}} for the same data-set.

30|$|If {{the linear}} {{correlation}} coefficient between two <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> was equal to + 1, {{we assumed that}} there was binding co-linearity between the two <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> In such cases, {{only one of the}} two was included in the model.|$|R
30|$|This is a tree based {{learning}} algorithm which constructs classification or regression tree {{based on}} the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> [46]. If the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> are categorical, it constructs the classification tree; if the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> are numerical, it constructs the regression tree. CART creates rules for splitting the data at a node based on one variable. After splitting the data, recursion is applied in the child node until stopping rules are found. Finally, the leaf nodes generate the final prediction.|$|R
50|$|MPC {{uses the}} current plant measurements, the current dynamic {{state of the}} process, the MPC models, and the process {{variable}} targets and limits to calculate future changes in the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> These changes are calculated to hold the <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> close to target while honoring constraints on both independent and <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> The MPC typically sends out only the first change in each independent variable to be implemented, and repeats the calculation when the next change is required.|$|R
25|$|The {{differential}} equation F(x) = (x) {{has a special}} form: the right-hand side contains only the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> (here x) and not the independent variable (here F). This simplifies the theory and algorithms considerably. The problem of evaluating integrals is thus best studied in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Computations where {{a number}} of similar, and often nested, models are {{considered}} for the same data set.

25|$|In calculating income {{based on}} wage and hours worked (income equals wage multiplied by hours worked), it is {{typically}} {{assumed that the}} number of hours worked is easily changed, but the wage is more static. This makes wage a parameter, hours worked an independent variable, and income a <b>dependent</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Brushing <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> and {{watching}} the connection to other <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> is called multivariate analysis.

30|$|All GLM {{analyses}} were performed using SPSS version 22 with 0.05 significance level (α). However, if a main effect {{was found to be}} statistically significant (using Pillai’s trace), <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> showing significant difference across groups were checked if their p values were less than α/number of <b>dependent</b> <b>variables,</b> as per the procedure recommended by Raykov and Marcoulides (2012). Although this correction might be seen as too conservative, it is recommended when fewer than 10 <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> are being tested (Johnson & Wichern, 1992).|$|R
25|$|The theorem {{can be used}} to {{establish}} a number of theoretical results. For example, having a regression with a constant and another regressor is equivalent to subtracting the means from the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> and the regressor and then running the regression for the demeaned variables but without the constant term.|$|E
25|$|A {{common goal}} for a {{statistical}} research {{project is to}} investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion {{on the effect of}} changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.|$|E
25|$|This {{assumption}} {{is not needed}} for {{the validity of the}} OLS method, although certain additional finite-sample properties can be established in case when it does (especially in the area of hypotheses testing). Also when the errors are normal, the OLS estimator is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and therefore it is asymptotically efficient in the class of all regular estimators. Importantly, the normality assumption applies only to the error terms; contrary to a popular misconception, the response (<b>dependent)</b> <b>variable</b> is not required to be normally distributed.|$|E
30|$|The {{composite}} <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> had excellent reliability: α = . 918 (competency) and α = . 944 (sexualizing traits).

It helps to answer ...|$|R
25|$|Regression {{analysis}} {{and in particular}} ordinary least squares specifies that a <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> depends according to some function upon one or more independent variables, with an additive error term. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption can be justified by assuming that the error term is actually the sum {{of a large number}} of independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be well approximated by a normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|Reeves and Nass {{established}} two rules {{before the}} test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected {{people to be}} less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.|$|E
25|$|Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on {{controlled}} experimentation. Controlled experiments {{require the}} manipulation {{of one or more}} independent variables in order to examine the effect on a <b>dependent</b> <b>variable.</b> Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in internal validity, meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in external validity, or {{the degree to which the}} results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control (internal validity) and being able to generalize to the population (external validity).|$|E
