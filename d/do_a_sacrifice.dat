That in like manner I was bound to the reduction and abolition of the income-tax. 3. That even if there arose in the system of our expenditure a great change, involving an increase of ten or fifteen millions of money over 1853, I was still in consistency bound to hold over the first chance of reduction for income-tax, tea and sugar. 4. That consequently until these duties were remitted I could not propose to prosecute any commercial reforms involving, as nearly all of them <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of revenue for a time. 5. It is because I have departed from these positions by proposing a multitude of reductions and abolitions of duty, other than the three mentioned, and partly or wholly in preference to them, that you have lost confidence in my judgment on these matters (a confidence to which I do not pretend that I had ever any claim).|$|E
60|$|Mr. Knight {{never married}} again. Matrimony {{was not a}} state which appealed to his {{somewhat}} shrunken nature. Although he admitted its necessity to the human race, of it in his heart he did not approve, nor would he ever have undertaken it at all {{had it not been}} for a sense of obligation. This attitude, because it made for virtue as he understood it, he set down to virtue, as we are all apt to <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of the things of earth and of the flesh to the things of heaven, and of the spirit. In fact, it was nothing of the sort, but only the outcome of individual physical and mental conditions. Towards female society, however hallowed and approved its form, he had no leanings. Also the child was a difficulty, so great indeed that at times almost he regretted that a wise Providence had not thought fit to take it straight to the joys of heaven with its mother, though afterwards, as the boy's intelligence unfolded, he developed interest in him. This, however, he was careful to keep in check, lest he should fall into the sin of inordinate affection, denounced by St. Paul in common with other errors.|$|E

Grandma Lor spits a betel nut {{she had been}} chewing to show contempt for Walt Kowalski, even though the Hmong do not chew betel nuts. The Hmong shaman reads Walt's personal character, when in real life he would communicate with the spirit world.

While Thao himself cleans dishes, Schein and Thoj add that he would not do this alone because he is in a house with other female family members. Schein and Thoj also add that there is [...] "inconsistent use of the two Hmong dialects within one family."

40|$|Monte Carlo {{analysis}} {{has so far}} been the corner stone for analog statistical simulations. Fast and accurate sim-ulations are necessary for stringent time-to-market, design for manufacturability and yield concerns in the analog do-main.

In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate probabilistic simula-tion method alternative to Monte Carlo using deterministic sampling and weight propagation. We furthermore propose accuracy improvement algorithms and a fast yield calcu-lation method. The proposed method shows accuracy im-provement combined with a 100 -fold reduction in run-time with respect to a 1000 -sample Monte Carlo analysis. ...|$|R

One's tax {{liability}} evidently becomes a function of one's income and one's position in the distribution in such a case, but not much else appears to be known. (Menahem Yaari touched upon the issue in his paper "A controversial proposal concerning inequality measurement", Journal of Economic Theory 1988, but focused only on a poll tax). In this paper, we determine the properties of the equal <b>sacrifice</b> tax for <b>a</b> wide class of rank-dependent social welfare functions, and integrate the theory with that already available for the class of utilitarian social welfare functions. In an additional step, we analyze the equal <b>sacrifice</b> tax for <b>a</b> class of mixed utilitarian and rank-dependent social welfare functions, and finally we review what this synthesis has achieved. equal sacrifice, income tax, equity. ...|$|R
