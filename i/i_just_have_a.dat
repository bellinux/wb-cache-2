500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E

In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by The Daily Telegraph {{he argued that}} the War on Drugs had been lost [...] "many, many years ago", stating that [...] "I hate drugs, I've never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society." [...] He argued in favour of a Royal Commission on drugs exploring all avenues as how to most effectively legislate on drugs and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their legalisation.|$|E
2500|$|Radke {{discussed}} {{his relationship with}} Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that {{they have tried to}} reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E

The women threw themselves away on anything inside a uniform. Make {{the world safe for}} democracy--down the Hun--save France and England--ideals, freedom, God's country, and all that! Well, the first few soldiers to return from France got a grand reception, were made heroes of. They were lucky to get back while the sentiment was hot. But that didn't last.... Now, a year and more after the war, where does the soldier get off? Lane, there're over six hundred thousand of you disabled veterans, and for all I can read and find out {{the government}} has done next to nothing. New York is full of begging soldiers--on the streets. Think of it! And the poor devils are dying everywhere. My God! think of what's in the mind of one crippled soldier, let alone over half a million. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dim idea of what I'd felt. You must know, or you will know, Lane, for you seem a thoughtful, lofty sort of chap. Just the kind to make a good soldier, because you had ideals and nerve!... Well, a selfish and weak administration could hardly be expected to keep extravagant promises to patriots. But that the American public, as a body, should now be sick of the sight of a crippled soldier--and that his sweetheart should turn him down!--this is the hideous blot, the ineradicable shame, the stinking truth, the damned mystery!" ...|$|E

[...] "I'm a classic example of a person who keeps their mouth shut. I just ran away from it going, 'I’m fine, I'm totally grand'.

From the age of four he was schooled in traditional learning by his father, beginning with the Sanskrit grammar of Panini.

At the time, Scotti Brothers had insisted on putting out a new album by Yankovic in order to meet monetary projections for the fiscal quarter, despite the fact that no new album was ready; Alapalooza would not be released until later in the year. The original concept was to release a record entitled Al Unplugged, which would have featured a cover depicting Yankovic holding the cords for unplugged kitchen appliances, but instead of being a live album featuring live performances, it would have featured studio remixes of previously released material, with the electronic instruments missing. Yankovic convinced them to release The Food Album instead—"a concept he hated only slightly less"—but would later describe it as a [...] "cheesy compilation" [...] put out [...] "against his better wishes and judgement." ...|$|E
