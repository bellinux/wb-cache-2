Richard Maibaum's original script from 1961 was used as the basis of the script, which he then re-drafted, with further revisions by John Hopkins. Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965, and moved to Nassau on 22 March, before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to know how it feels to be an ornament. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry. But he {{made me feel like}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> offer, like I knew shit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} Community {{was based on}} Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, north of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though they {{had nothing to do with}} the film industry and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> gain from them and nothing to offer them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E
500|$|Crews began hanging {{the sign}} in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune {{architecture}} critic Kamin warned Trump that {{his review of}} the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded [...] "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign", but architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying [...] "Just for the record, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with this sign!". The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, [...] "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted {{that part of the}} problem is the architectural traditions of the city: [...] "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was via Twitter. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future.|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and I can look at it like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president.

2500|$|Lawyers {{convinced}} LAPD {{to allow}} Simpson to turn himself in at 11a.m. on June 17, 1994, although the double murder charge meant that no bail {{would be set}} and a first-degree murder conviction {{could result in a}} death penalty. More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive. At 2p.m., LAPD issued an all-points bulletin. At 5p.m., Robert Kardashian, a friend of Simpson's and one of his defense lawyers, read a letter by Simpson to the media. In the letter Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, [...] "First everyone understand <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with Nicole's murder ... Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life." [...] Some interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother Eunice collapsed after hearing it, and reporters joined the search for Simpson. Simpson's lawyer Robert Shapiro was present at Kardashian's press conference and said that Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation. Over the television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{original}} industry hostility, critical favour towards Orange Man {{has increased in}} later times and {{has gone on to}} become considered one of the greatest television advertisements of all time by numerous sources; [...] in 2000, Orange Man was ranked at number 3 in Channel 4 and The Sunday Times poll of the [...] "100 Greatest TV Ads Ever."

In the commentary for the latter list, Orange Man is credited as a humorous precursor to happy slapping. Sarah McCartney referred to the advertisement in her 2011 book 100 Great Branding Ideas: From Leading Companies Around the World, where she comments that despite the controversy surrounding its slogan, [...] "the phrase had captured the public's imagination." [...] In 2016, Ben Priest, Founding Partner and Chief Creative Officer at communications agency adam, included the advert in his list of [...] "3 Great Ads <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> Do With", part of a series for Campaign Live, where he said [...] "the hype it created and the fondness with which people remember the ad makes {{it one of the most}} successful of its time." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the tour}} ended in April 1973, Yes took {{a short break}} and regrouped in London and {{proceeded}} to rehearse and develop Anderson and Howe's material at Manticore Studios in Fulham, then owned by fellow progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Wakeman thought the musical direction the band had begun to take ventured into [...] "avant-garde jazz rock, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> offer there". Squire recognised [...] "a lot of substance" [...] to the four tracks, but at times there was not as much which made the album become [...] "too varied and too scattered". Despite their opinions, Anderson wrote in the liner notes that Squire, Wakeman and White made [...] "important contributions of their own" [...] to the music. He believed the entire group were [...] "on the same page" [...] and supported the concept and material at the time, but realised Wakeman's criticisms ended a period of [...] "elusive harmony" [...] that had existed within the band for their successful albums Fragile (1971) and Close to the Edge. Howe recalled that despite the lengthy arrangements, no one [...] "bottled it" [...] and thought a single album would be more appropriate. White contributed some lengthy sections of music that bridged between the main sections of tracks, but did not receive a writing credit which bothered him at first, but later allowed it as the album was mostly Anderson and Howe's idea.|$|E

He was soon housed {{with a series of}} cell mates, and after five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was. In his new cell, [...] "I sat in my armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I saw that I had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them.
