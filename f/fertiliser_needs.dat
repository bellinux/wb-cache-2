40|$|Biodiesel is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} fuel in transportation. It is generally considered an environmentally friendly alternative for diesel from fossil oil, because of lower emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO 2). However, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions during the growth of energy crops can be considerable. N 2 O is emitted {{as a result of}} fertiliser use, needed to cultivate the energy crops. Fertiliser use not only increases the direct agricultural soil emissions, but also the indirect N 2 O emissions from aquatic systems, after leaching and runoff of nitrogen from fertilised soils. The aim {{of this study is to}} quantify future N 2 O emissions associated with the cultivation of energy crops in European river basins. We analyse three future scenarios for biodiesel production in Europe, and the associated N 2 O emissions from fertilised fields. Our focus is on biodiesel produced from first generation energy crops. The scenarios assume that by the year 2050, 15 – 30 % of the demand for fossil diesel is replaced by biodiesel. This would change the European <b>fertiliser</b> <b>needs</b> and, as a result, N 2 O emissions from fertilised soils. Our results indicate that increased biodiesel production may increase N 2 O emissions in Europe by about 25 – 45 % relative to a scenario without a growth in biodiesel production, but not equally in all regions and all scenarios. The rate of change depends on where energy crops are grown, and whether or not they replace agricultural crops, or natural vegetation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although {{coffee is}} the world's largest-traded {{agricultural}} commodity, {{it has received}} less attention in print than other commodities, with no comprehensive textbook dealing with all its different aspects. This book, containing contributions from 13 coffee specialists, fills that gap. Subject areas covered are: a history of coffee, its botanical classification, coffee selection and breedinq. Climate and soil, physiology of the coffee crop, mineral nutrition and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>needs,</b> cultural methods, pest control, control of coffee diseases, green coffee processing, world trade, the microscopic structure of the coffee bean, chemical and physical aspects of green coffee and coffee products, the technology of converting beans into beverage and finally the physiological effects of coffee consumption. The chapters on pest and disease control {{are likely to be}} of particular interest in view of the damage that can be caused to the growing coffee plant. R. Bardner points out that over 900 species of pest are known to infest the crop. Coffee pests are best dealt with by integrated pest management which seeks to utilise and coordinate appropriate methods of chemical, cultural and biological control to keep pest populations in check. Different methods of control are considered, together with suggestions for the best approach to take when faced with particular problems. Most coffee beans are roasted or turned into instant granules or powder in western countries, although Brazil is one producing country that has stepped up its own manufacture and so increased the economic contribution that coffee makes to the economy.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} requirement {{varies depending on}} variety and usage. The conventional fertilisation amounts to 120 kg of N per ha in table potatoes and potatoes for processing. Early potatoes and seed potatoes require slightly less nitrogen at about 100 kg of N per ha. The nitrogen supply strongly depends on the conditions for N mineralisation (weather, humus content of the soil, preceding crop residues). Thus, optimising the N supply is complex. Nitrogen from the preceding crop: Grain legumes or cereals in combination with green manure are favourable preceding crops. Field peas may leave behind up to 50 kg net weight of available nitrogen, a mixture of grain legumes and barley up to 30 kg. Depending on the preceding crop and the soil, the nitrogen left behind may amount to zero. Using grass-clover ley as a preceding crop {{is not an option}} due to the high risk of wireworm infestation. Manure as basic fertiliser: A dosage of 15 to maximum 30 tonnes of manure per ha (1 - 2 kg of available N per t) in autumn during the preceding crop serves as basic nitrogen fertilisation. Mineralisation occurs slowly during the entire growth period. A dosage of manure also covers the high potassium demand of potatoes. Farms without livestock need to cover the K supply by using approved mineral fertilisers. Due to the risk of Rhizoctonia, only well-rotted or composted manure should be used. Manure compost has, like other composts, a low N effect. Undiluted cattle slurry: Depending on the slurry’s N content (1 - 3 kg of available N/m 3), 30 - 90 m 3 of slurry {{can be applied to the}} preceding crop or at a plant height of 10 - 20 cm the latest (i. e. before creating the ridges) and worked into the soil. Later applications of slurry only promoted haulm growth and delay the maturation of the tubers. Commercial fertiliser: An additional dosage of fertiliser of about 30 - 60 kg of N per ha with a granulated, quickly mineralising commercial N fertiliser can complement the missing nitrogen supply. It should be applied during spring at planting or at the first round of hoeing the latest. In case of lacking farm manure, up to 90 kg of total N can be applied per ha. The coarser the grains, the earlier the commercial <b>fertiliser</b> <b>needs</b> to be applied. In Swiss trials, the yield of potatoes was increased by up to 30...|$|E

To maintain the production of organic transplants, alternative <b>fertilisers</b> <b>needed</b> to be tested. Eleven alternatives to horn powder (standard fertiliser) were selected based on the organic standards of the European Union, including feather powder (as an animal based product without BSE risk). The products were mixed with a standard growing media for organic transplants in a concentration of 300 mg nitrogen L- 1 growing media. Different experiments where set up with head lettuce (Lactuca sativa), Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. pekinensis) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), at two different planting times: immediately after mixing the growing media and six weeks after mixing, in heated and cold greenhouses. Beside weight per plant, we assessed phytotoxic effects 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after mixing the media, and mineralised nitrogen in the growing media. When planting immediately after mixing, potato protein, vinasse (wastes of food processing), and feather powder resulted in the highest weight per plant. Plants fertilised with horn powder, sunflower oil cake and ground field beans had the lowest weight per plant (40 % less). Horn powder, ground malt sprouts, vinasse, potato protein and feather powder with stored growing media produced the strongest transplants. Phytotoxicity tests (four different methods) showed significant differences between horn powder (slight damage) and field beans (seriously harmed). Horn powder is still the best fertiliser for organic transplant production followed by feather powder. Horn powder causes little phytotoxicity to the crop even under extreme conditions.

Crop residues (fodder/stover) are important feed resources for ruminants. This review was undertaken with the objective of improving understanding of the role of various crop management factors in affecting the productivity and quality of crop residues. Variability in productivity and quality of residues can be of both genetic and non-genetic origin. Recommended agronomic practices vary according to crop and cultivar and can release the maximum genetic potential determining quantity and quality of residues. Planting method and planting rate recommendations should be followed to maximise productivity. Although low density planting improved fodder quality, fodder yield declined. Time of sowing affected fodder yield in most of the crops, but fodder quality was not generally affected. It was common to observe that application of nitrogen (up to 120 kg ha- 1) in cereals and application of phosphorus (up to 60 kg ha- 1) in legumes improved the green and dry fodder yields, as well as crude protein (CP), crude fibre (CF) and other quality parameters.

Hand weeding resulted in better weed control efficiency and stover yield than application of herbicides. However, application of herbicides resulted in the greatest benefit:cost ratio. Manual harvesting resulted in lower losses than mechanical harvesting, and may affect quality depending on the extent of loss of different fodder components. Drought stress yielded more digestible organic matter due to increases in the proportion of leaves compared to stems. Saline conditions affected seed germination and crop yields.

30|$|Therefore, {{in modern}} {{agricultural}} systems, mineral P <b>fertilisers</b> <b>need</b> to be regularly applied. Most mineral P fertilisers {{are derived from}} rock phosphate, which is a non-renewable resource becoming increasingly depleted and consequently will also eventually become scarce and expensive [2]. The most common mineral fertiliser is triple superphosphate (TSP) derived by acidification of rock P. An alternative to mineral P fertilisers is the waste product sewage sludge, which represents an important P source with around 2 – 4  % of P depending on the wastewater source and the treatment methods [3], around 70 – 90  % of the total P is inorganic P and considered potentially equivalent to inorganic fertilisers [4, 5]. Depending on the chemicals used to precipitate P and the amount used in the wastewater treatment facilities, the immediate availability of P to plants from sewage sludge can be very different [6]. Furthermore, specific soil properties, such as soil pH, soil P absorption capacity or P content, can also influence plant P availability in relation to sludge [7 – 9].|$|R

However, the factors that control {{resource use}} efficiency in agro-ecosystems are only partly understood. We investigated the influence of soil biota on nutrient leaching, nutrient-use efficiency and plant performance in outdoor, open-top lysimeters comprising a volume of 230 L. The lysimeters were filled with sterilized soil in two horizons and inoculated with a reduced soil-life inoculum (soil biota 11 m, microbially dominated) and an enriched soil-life inoculum [soil organisms 2 mm, also containing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) ]. A crop rotation was planted, and nutrient leaching losses, plant biomass and nutrient contents were assessed {{over a period of}} almost 2 years. In {{the first year of the}} experiment, enriched soil life increased crop yield (+ 22 %), N uptake (+ 29 %) and P uptake (+ 110 %) of maize and strongly reduced leaching losses of N (- 51 %, corresponding to a reduction of 76 kg N ha(- 1)). In the second year, wheat biomass (+ 17 %) and P contents (+ 80 %) were significantly increased by enriched soil life, but the differences were lower than in the first year. Enriched soil life also increased P mobilization from soil (+ 112 %) and significantly reduced relative P leaching losses (- 25 %), defined as g P leached per kg P plant uptake, as well as relative N leaching losses (- 36 %), defined as kg N leached per kg N plant uptake, demonstrating that nutrient-use efficiency was increased in the enriched soil-life treatment. Synthesis and applications. Soil biota are a key factor determining resource efficiency in agriculture. The results suggest that applying farming practices, which favour a rich and abundant soil life (e. g. reduced tillage, organic farming, crop rotation), can reduce environmental impacts, enhance crop yield and result in a more sustainable agricultural system. However, this needs to be confirmed in field situations. Enhanced nutrient-use efficiency obtained through farming practices which exert positive effects on soil biota could result in reduced amounts of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>needed</b> for agricultural production and reduced nutrient losses to the environment, providing benefits of such practices beyond positive effects on biodiversity.

40|$|Experimental {{testing and}} {{calibration}} of new machines and fertiliser {{can be costly}} and time consuming. Standard centrifugal fertiliser spreaders are designed to achieve a uniform distribution across the entire field. Fruit trees, however, are planted in rows {{and it would be}} advantageous to concentrate the fertiliser closer to the tree trunk and hence the root system. This could reduce the amount of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>needed</b> and will also reduce the negative environmental impact. A discrete element method (DEM) model of a centrifugal fertiliser spreader was developed. A sensitivity study was used to determine the DEM parameters by comparing the results to experimental results. The effects of the disc speed, feed position, feed rate and vane angle on the spread pattern were investigated experimentally and compared to the DEM results. A deflector plate was designed to separate the flow into two paths along the tree lines. The DEM results of the deflector were compared to the experimental results. It was shown that the DEM model {{can be used to make}} both qualitative and quantitative predictions of the spread pattern under different spreader settings. The model could also accurately predict the effect of the deflector on the spread pattern. This indicates that DEM can be a powerful tool in the development of new spreader concepts. © 2011 IAgrE.

40|$|International audienceThe {{negative}} effects of soil fertility depletion on food security, especially among smallholder farmers in Africa, is of economic importance, and may be worsened by climate change and rising global fertiliser prices. Substantial efforts and investment have gone into development of alternative soil fertility management options. These include vigorous {{research and development of}} N-fixing plants or "fertiliser trees", that has been on-going {{in the last two decades}} in East and Southern Africa. In this paper, we review several studies conducted both on-station and on-farm and synthesise the results in terms of improvements in soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and crop yield in response to fertiliser trees. Our major findings are that (1) fertiliser trees add more than 60 kg N ha− 1 per year through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF); (2) nutrient contributions from fertiliser tree biomass can reduce the requirement for mineral N fertiliser by 75 %, translating to huge savings on mineral fertilisers; (3) fertiliser trees were also shown to substantially increase crop yield. A meta-analysis has further provided conclusive evidence that with good management, fertiliser trees can double maize yields compared with local farmer practices of maize cultivation without addition of external fertilisation. (4) Financial analyses showed that fertiliser tree systems are profitable and also have higher net returns than the farmers' de facto practice, i. e. continuous maize cropping without fertiliser. We conclude that widespread adoption and scaling up of fertiliser trees can reduce the amount of mineral <b>fertiliser</b> <b>needed,</b> maintain the soil ecosystem, and positively impact on the livelihoods of farm households in southern Africa...|$|R

Based on the results of the LUCAS Topsoil survey we performed an assessment of plant available P status of European croplands. Higher P levels can be observed in regions where higher crop yields can be expected and where high fertiliser P inputs are reported. Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems; one from Hungary and one from the United Kingdom. The fertiliser recommendation system of the UK does not recommend additional fertiliser use on croplands with highest P supply, which covers regions mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands.

In this study, we bypass all of these barriers by using a different approach towards cutting energy and fertiliser costs in the production of biofuels from microalgae-rather than growing the algae in the presence of fertilisers such as N and P, followed by harvesting the whole algae cells, and the energetically costly drying of cells and extraction of the fuel from the cells, this process makes use of the natural tendency of the green alga, Botryococcus braunii to release oils from the cell into the extracellular matrix during and after growth. Here, we non-destructively and repeatedly harvest the external oil (hydrocarbons) from B. braunii CCAP 807 / 2. Extraction with several solvents showed that hexane was not compatible with B. braunii, but that heptane in contact with B. braunii for less than 20 min did not negatively affect this alga. As an alternative, solvent-free method, we tested physical methods of extracting the extracellular oil. Light and temperature did not affect the extraction of the external oil from Botryococcus, but gentle pressure (i. e. 'blotting') was an effective method for external oil recovery. Less than 1 h of blotting also did not affect the physiology of Botryococcus. Both the heptane extraction and the non-destructive 'blotting' methods had no significant effect on growth and photosynthesis (Fv/Fm, ETRmax) of B. braunii.

From there, it is a short step to advising farmers on {{what needs to be}} done and where. Lack of soil fertility and the inability of extension agents to provide farmers with reliable and cost-effective recommendations about how to improve their soils is one of the principal factors limiting African food production. Scientists at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) in Nairobi have spent 5 years adapting IR technology to farm conditions in Africa and linking it with GPS for even more effective results. The technology is currently being used in Western Kenya as part of a major project designed to halt land degradation and restore thousands of hectares of degraded farmland to productive use. It has already been used to identify which soil properties were lacking in 2, 500 Kenyan farms. Infrared spectroscopy soil analysis is a simple and easy-to-use technique which reduces the cost of soil analysis by 99 %. An infrared light shined onto a soil sample produces a rapid identification of the type and composition of the soil, enabling advisors to assess the type and amount of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>needed</b> to raise its productivity. Researchers associated with the ICRAF project believe that the potential for widespread adoption of IR by public and private sector providers of on-farm advisory services is now considerable. Dr Keith Shepherd, the project s lead scientist, says that with one IR instrument, laboratories in rural areas will be able to analyse not just soils and crops, but also a wide range of agricultural inputs and products, including manure, fertiliser, animal feed, grain, and milk. We can tell from a cow s poop whether it is well or poorly fed, or even about its level of tick infestation, he said.

The temporal variation of N 2 O fluxes showed only low emissions over the vegetable cropping phases, but significantly higher emissions were observed post-harvest accounting for 50 - 70 % of the annual emissions. NIs reduced N 2 O emissions by 20 - 60 % over the vegetable cropping phases; however, this mitigation was offset by elevated N 2 O emissions from the NIs treatments over the post-harvest fallow period.

The long-term impact of Zn and Cu on soil microorganisms and phosphatase enzyme activity was investigated at four field sites from the Defra ‘Long-Term Sludge Experiment’ {{in order to determine the}} overall impact on organic phosphorus mineralisation. Following the final applications of sludge in 1997, the total concentrations of Zn and Cu at each site were comparable to the UK statutory limits for sludge amended soils. Almost 20 years later 63 - 91 % of the applied metal loadings still remained and total concentrations of Zn and Cu were found to be significantly higher in contaminated soils, in comparison to untreated soil, and soils receiving uncontaminated sewage sludge. A significant correlation between exchangeable and total metal concentration could still be seen in soils contaminated with Zn, whereas the solubility of Cu was found to be very low (< 1 %); though a significant percent remained bound to soil organic matter. No long-term decrease in microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) could be detected in the contaminated soils at any of the sites. However analysis of ergosterol showed an increase in the proportion of microbial biomass carbon derived from fungi. Significant changes were also observed in the PLFA profiles of microbial communities within contaminated soils, indicating the microbial community has adapted and become tolerant to the heavy metal contamination. Combining results using meta-analysis indicated that Zn and Cu caused an increase in fungal biomass carbon of approximately 25 - 35 % in comparison to soil receiving uncontaminated sludge. Whereas overall decreases of 16 and 8 % were seen for Cmic in soils contaminated with Zn and Cu, respectively, indicating a loss of bacterial biomass from the contaminated soils. Hence, the current UK statutory limits may not be sufficient to prevent changes in soil microbial community and a reduction in the limits set for sludge amended soils is recommended in order to protect microbial diversity. No long-term decrease in the activity of phosphomonoesterase was detectable in the contaminated soils. However combining the results using meta-analysis indicated phosphomonoesterase activity per milligram of biomass carbon was greater in soils contaminated with Cu. This may be an indication that Cu is inhibiting extracellular phosphatase enzyme activity within the soil environment, though this remains undetermined. Orthophosphate, phosphomonoesters, and pyrophosphate were the predominant forms of phosphorus within the applied sludge treatments; a broad phosphodiester signal was also present. Overall, the greatest range of organic phosphorus forms was seen in the uncontaminated sewage sludge. However, no difference in the range of organic phosphorus compounds was observed between the untreated and sludge amended soils at the field sites investigated. It was therefore concluded that the organic phosphorus content of sludge amended soils is returning to that of untreated soil, with no long-term interference caused by the presence of Zn and Cu...|$|R

In agricultural animal farms is produced a big quantity of animal manure, which must be adequate managed, mainly as fertiliser. The most advantageous solution of using animal manure and slurry is using it in biogas plants, where, due to degradation of organic matter, digestate is easier to pump and easier to apply as <b>fertiliser,</b> with reduced <b>need</b> of stirring, compared to untreated slurry. The researches made showes that digestate has lower C/N ratio, compared to raw manure. This property means that digestate has a better effect in fertilisation with Nitrogen on short term.

40|$|One {{possible}} management {{option for}} farmers {{to improve the}} soil nitrogen (N) supply for rice production is the cultivation of a prior legume. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the value of such an option in the lowland of the north-east of Thailand. Two experiments were established in 2 typical locations in a split-plot design with 4 replicates. The main plots included 3 nitrogen levels (0, 30, and 60 kg N/ha) and the subplots, 4 pre-rice managements: (i) fallow with weeds removed (FW-); (ii) with weeds incorporated before the rice crop (FW+); (iii) mungbean incorporated at flowering as green manure (MGM); or (iv) incorporated after grains harvest (MR+). In both experiments the difference in rice yield between MGM and MR+ was not significant. In Expt 1, in contrast to Expt 2, the rice yield increase due to MR+ was significant and significantly higher than that due to application of 60 kg N/ha. Moreover, significantly higher apparent recovery of N (ANR(m), kg N uptake increase/kg N supplied by residues), probably due to the continuous flooding of the soil surface, was achieved in this experiment. The low values of internal efficiency of N (IEN, kg total grains/kg total N uptake), ANR(f) (Delta kg N uptake/kg N supplied by fertiliser), and of ANUE(f) (Delta kg grains/kg applied N fertiliser) recorded in the MR+ treatment of Expt 1, suggest that no application of N <b>fertiliser</b> is <b>needed</b> where the soil water conditions allow high recovery of the N supplied by a preceding mungbean crop...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of N source and rate, and timing of N application on dry matter yield (DMY), N responses, N uptake and N use efficiency (NUE) in a grass crop. The experiment used three fertiliser treatments: CAN, urea and nBTPT-coated urea (nBTPT-U), three N rates (0 - control, 25, 50 and 75 kg ha- 1), and 18 fertiliser application timings. The agronomic performance of urea was lower than CAN in early spring. This included relatively lower N responses, lower relative DMY (90 %) and N uptake (85 %) which translated in lower NUE (0. 45 vs. 0. 70 kg kg- 1). For N applications later in the spring both urea and nBTPT-U showed relative DMY and NUE which were within ± 5 % compared with CAN (100 %). nBTPT enhanced the overall performance of urea which was shown with increased temperature towards the summer or increased N rates. In the summer, the efficiency of urea was lower than CAN or nBTPT-U in all measured parameters. The variability of urea and nBTPT-U as N-sources for grass was comparable to CAN but DMY with urea was ≤ 95 % that of CAN (100 %) at 8 out of the 19 application timings. Increasing the application rate of urea-N to offset its relatively lower efficiency may not be recommended since DMY of urea-N relative to CAN decreased with increased N fertilisation levels. However, {{with the use of}} nBTPT this may be possible, but <b>fertiliser</b> choice <b>needs</b> {{to be based on the}} relative costs per unit N. ...|$|R
40|$|Application {{of poultry}} litter (PL) to soil {{can lead to}} {{substantial}} nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions due to the co-application of labile carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Slow pyrolysis of PL to produce biochar may mitigate N 2 O emissions from this source, whilst still providing agronomic benefits. In a corn crop on ferrosol with similarly matched available N inputs of ca. 116 kg N/ha, PL-biochar plus urea emitted significantly less N 2 O (1. 5 kg N 2 O-N/ha) compared to raw PL at 4. 9 kg N 2 O-N/ha. Urea amendment without the PL-biochar emitted 1. 2 kg N 2 O-N/ha, and the PL-biochar alone emitted only 0. 35 kg N 2 O-N/ha. Both PL and PL-biochar resulted in similar corn yields and total N uptake which was significantly greater than for urea alone. Using stable isotope methodology, the majority (~ 80 %) of N 2 O emissions were shown to be from non-urea sources. Amendment with raw PL significantly increased C mineralisation and the quantity of permanganate oxidisable organic C. The low molar H/C (0. 49) and O/C (0. 16) ratios of the PL-biochar suggest its higher stability in soil than raw PL. The PL-biochar also had higher P and K fertiliser value than raw PL. This study suggests that PL-biochar is a valuable soil amendment {{with the potential to}} significantly reduce emissions of soil greenhouse gases compared to the raw product. Contrary to other studies, PL-biochar incorporated to 100 mm did not reduce N 2 O emissions from surface applied urea, which suggests that further field evaluation of biochar impacts, and methods of application of both biochar and <b>fertiliser,</b> are <b>needed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{supplemental}} {{parameters for}} estimat-ing phosphorus in soils obtained with static and kinetic methods {{are often used}} (Macháček 1999). Evaluating phosphorus dynamics in soils is impor-tant for obtaining deeper insight into phosphorus transformations in soils in dependence on their properties. Different methods {{can be used for}} a long-term characterisation of phosphates releas-ing processes from soil matrix to the soil solution (McGechan 2002). Evaluating dynamic indices is an ideal variant for estimating <b>fertiliser</b> amounts <b>needed</b> (e. g. sewage sludge) (Barry et al. 1995). For the realization of these methods we start from several basic parameters: intensity – I – level of instantaneous phosphorus availability to the plants. Extraction with 0. 01 M CaCl 2 or solution of other weak salts are most commonly used. Furthermore, electroultrafiltration is sometimes used (Self-Davis et al. 2000). The intensity can be only calculated {{on the basis of the}} phosphorus buffering capacity (BC). The phosphorus buffering capacity is also termed differential, phosphate and equilibrium capac-ity. It can be defined as the capability of a soil to compensate concentration changes of differ-ent phosphorus forms (Hartikainen 1991). These data are commonly used to evaluate phosphorus amount that is desorbed by dilution of solution, but not phosphate, which is bound through slow and strong sorption (McGechan and Lewis 2002). Total BC is calculated from adsorption-desorption dependence as a portion of change of quantity (∆Q) and intensity (∆I). The advantage when us-ing these relations is that it is possible to predict the sorption and mobilisation of phosphorus in soils (Morel et al. 1996) and to more accurately Evaluating of phosphorus quantity/intensity parameters in soil with different systems of organic fertilisin...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{debate is}} currently under way among researchers {{and policy makers}} about {{the relative merits of}} using organic versus inorganic fertilisers to improve soil fertility in semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Environmentalists argue that use of inorganic fertiliser contributes to natural resource degradation and recommend use of organic fertilisers as a means of promoting sustainable agriculture. Opponents of this view maintain that a more rapid introduction of inorganic fertilisers is required in sub-Saharan Africa where current levels of use are extremely low, even when compared with other developing countries. This debate has important implications for agricultural intensification and sustainable development in the Sudanian and Sahelo-Sudanian agro-ecological zones of semi-arid West Africa. This paper assesses the profitability of using inorganic fertiliser and constraints posed on its use in the semi-arid farming systems of West Africa. It argues that under current conditions in these regions, organic and inorganic fertilisers are complements and not substitutes. The critical requirement for improving food production in these regions is to increase the use of inorganic <b>fertiliser.</b> Government policies <b>need</b> to support <b>fertiliser</b> importation and diffusion with conductive policies...|$|R

Phosphorus (P) deficiency {{has in the past}} been strongly implicated as causing such interaction (Johnson and Burdon 1990 and references therein), but it is something that can be and generally is corrected readily enough. Other studies, generally conducted in contexts of using <b>fertilisers</b> where <b>needed,</b> have pointed to some different site variables as drivers of such interaction. Wu and Matheson (2005) pointed to altitude (elevation), as did Raymond (2011), whereas Gapare et al. (2015) pointed to temperature with a secondary role of humidity, Ivković et al. (2015) and Dutkowski et al. (2016) to rainfall and temperature, and Li et al. (2015) to mean annual temperature along with soil levels of nitrogen and total P. However, given the different sets of sites, and the auto correlations between site variables within those studies, there were probably no real inconsistencies among the findings. Also of interest would be interactions involving the 300 index (Kimberley et al. 2005) which is a measure of whole-crop productivity as distinct from individual-tree growth rate. However, while there is significant understanding of the site factors influencing the index (Watt et al. 2010 and references therein), there is little practical scope for studying RC interaction for the index at the level of individual genotypes. Competitive interactions among genotypes will make it very difficult to obtain reliable empirical information on interaction, except with blocks (simulating actual stands) of clonally replicated genotypes. That approach, however, will face difficulties in obtaining an adequate sample population of clones to give reliable information.|$|R

Even if more fertilisers were used, {{they may not be}} enough to sustain production on the fragile soils of many humid, lowland areas. Alley farming?an alternative low-input farming system that has been researched and promoted in Africa?has been found to have the best potential in the humid and subhumid zones. In this agroforestry system, food crops are grown in alleys formed by hedgerows of trees and shrubs. The hedgerows are cut back at planting and periodically pruned during crop growth to reduce shading and competition with crops for light, nutrients, and moisture. When there are no crops, the hedgerows are allowed to grow freely to cover the land. Their foliage can also be used for animal feed. This latest addition to The Tropical Agriculturalist series provides practical guidelines for establishing and managing an alley farming system. It describes its benefits to crop and livestock production, as well as its limitations. It also discusses economic aspects and addresses the issues of social acceptance and adoption. Alley farming.

40|$|Uniform {{phosphorous}} fertilisation has economical, {{ecological and}} agronomical shortcomings. This study was undertaken to optimise the variable rate (VR) elemental P application using a previously developed on-the-go visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) soil sensor. This VIS-NIR sensor {{consists of a}} chisel unit, to which the optical unit to detect soil extractable phosphorous (P-ext) was attached. A mobile, fibre-type VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 45 visnir, Germany) with a measurement range between 305 and 1711 nm {{was used to measure}} soil spectra in reflectance mode. On-the-go measurement of soil spectra was carried out in two fields (A and B) situated near Leuven in Belgium. From the spectra, P-ext was calculated in soil and subsequently the required elemental P was determined. Different averaging windows (AW) of the predicted P-ext from successive spectra (2 - 22) and five recommendation classification intervals (RCI) of elemental P of 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 kg ha(- 1) were assigned and tested. The VR of elemental P was compared with uniform rate (UR) application. Results showed that among the five RCIs, the minimum elemental P application rate was for interval of 5 kg ha(- 1), with small differences of among the different RCIs. In the fields under study, the amount of elemental P fertiliser according to the VR approach was higher than the UR application with an extra elemental P of 4 and 2. 38 kg ha(- 1) for fields A and B, respectively. However, this higher elemental P fertiliser recommendation of VR is only valid when an equal number of samples (1200 in field A and 660 in field 13) is considered for both VR and UR methods. Larger amounts of elemental P <b>fertiliser</b> were <b>needed</b> for plots and/or fields having higher variation in measured P-ext. The results also showed that in both fields the application rate decreased with larger AWs. Averaging of less than five P-ext successive values was not a proper choice with any RCIs due to the large deviation between the target and classified elemental P into the different RCIs. The combination of RCI 5 and AW between 10 and 15 is recommended to provide a good matching between uniform and applied elemental P at low cost. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Addition of lime to {{ameliorate}} soil acidity {{has been observed}} to induce zinc (Zn) deficiency for wheat in sandy soils of south-western Australia, reducing grain yields. The implications of widespread use of lime to treat acid soils for the residual value of Zn in these soils are not known. In a glasshouse experiment, using a Zn-deficient sand from south-western Australia, 3 levels of finely powdered calcium carbonate were added and incubated in moist soil for 6 weeks at 22 °C to produce three different pH values (1 : 5 soil : 0. 01 m CaCl 2) : 4. 9 (original soil not treated with calcium carbonate), 5. 8, and 7. 4. Five amounts of Zn, as solutions of Zn sulfate, were then incubated in moist soil for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 days before sowing spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The residual value of the applied Zn was determined using yield of dried shoots, Zn content in dried shoots, and soil test Zn (DTPA extraction). This was done by calculating {{the effectiveness of the}} incubated Zn for all 3 soils relative to the effectiveness of Zn applied just before sowing wheat (0 day incubation, freshly applied Zn) for the soil not treated with calcium carbonate. As measured using yield of dried shoots, Zn content of dried shoots, or soil test Zn, the residual value of the incubated Zn decreased with increasing soil pH and with increasing period of incubation of Zn with moist soil before sowing wheat. The critical Zn concentration, associated with 90 % of the total yield of dried wheat shoots, was (mg Zn/kg) 13 in the youngest mature growth (apex and youngest emerged leaf), and 20 for rest of dried shoots. These values were similar to current critical values for unlimed soils. The relationship between yield of dried shoots and DTPA soil test Zn was similar for unlimed and limed soils, so similar critical soil test Zn was applicable on the sandy soil regardless of soil pH. Critical DTPA soil test Zn, the soil test Zn that was related to 90 % of the maximum yield of dried shoots, was 0. 14 mg Zn/mg soil.

40|$|The use of {{nitrification}} inhibitors, {{in combination}} with ammonium based fertilisers, has been promoted recently as an effective method to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from fertilised agricultural fields, whilst increasing yield and nitrogen use efficiency. Vegetable cropping systems are often characterised by high inputs of nitrogen fertiliser and consequently elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) can be expected. However, to date only limited data {{is available on the}} use of nitrification inhibitors in sub-tropical vegetable systems. A field experiment investigated the effect of the nitrification inhibitors (DMPP & 3 MP+TZ) on N 2 O emissions and yield from a typical vegetable production system in sub-tropical Australia. Soil N 2 O fluxes were monitored continuously over an entire year with a fully automated system. Measurements were taken from three subplots for each treatment within a randomized complete blocks design. There was a significant inhibition effect of DMPP and 3 MP+TZ on N 2 O emissions and soil mineral N content directly following the application of the fertiliser over the vegetable cropping phase. However this mitigation was offset by elevated N 2 O emissions from the inhibitor treatments over the post-harvest fallow period. Cumulative annual N 2 O emissions amounted to 1. 22 kg-N/ha, 1. 16 kg-N/ha, 1. 50 kg-N/ha and 0. 86 kg-N/ha in the conventional fertiliser (CONV), the DMPP treatment, the 3 MP+TZ treatment and the zero fertiliser (0 N) respectively. Corresponding fertiliser induced emission factors (EFs) were low with only 0. 09 - 0. 20 % of the total applied fertiliser lost as N 2 O. There was no significant effect of the nitrification inhibitors on yield compared to the CONV treatment for the three vegetable crops (green beans, broccoli, lettuce) grown over the experimental period. This study highlights that N 2 O emissions from such vegetable cropping system are primarily controlled by post-harvest emissions following the incorporation of vegetable crop residues into the soil. It also shows that the use of nitrification inhibitors can lead to elevated N 2 O emissions by storing N in the soil profile that is available to soil microbes during the decomposition of the vegetable residues over the post-harvest phase. Hence the use of nitrification inhibitors in vegetable systems has to be treated carefully and <b>fertiliser</b> rates <b>need</b> to be adjusted to avoid excess soil nitrogen during the postharvest phase...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{sugarcane}} cropping has low nitrogen (N) use efficiencies, {{largely due}} to a mismatch of earlyseason N fertiliser application and later season peak crop N demand, in combination with poor soils and wet climate. To {{address the problem of}} N losses via run-off, leaching and N 2 O emissions, the sugarcane industry is evaluating several avenues. One approach is to improve N use efficiency (NUE) by reducing the use of vulnerable-to-loss N <b>fertiliser,</b> supplementing crop <b>needs</b> with biologically fixed N via sugarcane-legume intercropping. In an optimised system, decomposing legumes would deliver N to sugarcane, synchronised with sugarcane’s long N accumulation phase. We hypothesised that legume intercropping in combination with lower N fertiliser rates will reduce N losses (N 2 O emissions were quantified here) but not sugar yields. Here we report on one of several field trials with sugarcane grown as monoculture or intercropped with legumes at full N fertiliser or lowered rates (67 or 41 % of full N). In the second year of implementation and compared to full N fertiliser, N 2 O emissions were reduced by 50 to 70 % in the 67 % N treatments irrespective of legume presence. Highest sugarcane biomass was achieved with full-N rate, 67 % N, and 67 % N + soybean intercropping. Sugarcane production was reduced in 67 % N + mung bean intercropping, 41 % N and zero N treatments. Sugar yield was variable but statistically similar across all treatments.

It was decided to run a cultivation experiment to find practical information for producers and growers when using liquid organic fertilisers in cultivation. The objective was to compare crop production between plants grown with liquid organic fertilisers and plants grown with conventional de novo fertilisers. Cucumbers were propagated in coir and peat and planted on slabs of respectively coir and peat. The plants on the two rooting media received either liquid organic or chemical fertilisers, resulting in four treatments in total. Plants fed with liquid chemical fertilisers were shown to initially produce 10 - 20 % more fresh weight per unit time than plants fed with liquid organic fertilisers. When organic fertiliser was used during cultivation, ammonium accumulated to levels of 10 - 20 mmol L- 1, while nitrate levels dropped to below 1 mmol L- 1. To explain the results, the conversion of nitrogen was studied. Conversion of organic nitrogen into nitrate requires enzymatic hydrolysis to ammonium, followed by bacterial oxidation to nitrate. This microbiological process depends on two physiological groups of naturally occurring aerobic soil bacteria; ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). In conclusion nitrate concentration rather than the concentrations of organic nitrogen or ammonium, were growth rate determining. The low conversion rate of ammonium into nitrate by bacteria present in substrate limited the leaf area growth of cucumbers. Suggestions to overcome the problem are made...|$|R
