40|$|How {{tax reform}} affects {{corporate}} financial decisions helps determine whether reform will increase capital formation and simplify the tax system. This paper describes {{the effects of}} fundamental tax reform on corporate tax planning and summarizes economists' knowledge {{of the magnitude of}} these effects. We analyze income tax reform, consisting of integrating corporate and personal income taxes, and moving to a broad-based consumption tax. As prototypes of reform, we use the U. S. Treasury's Comprehensive Business Income Tax proposal for income tax reform and the Flat Tax for consumption tax reform. The critical difference between these reforms is that the consumption tax gives firms <b>immediate</b> <b>deductions</b> for capital outlays instead of the depreciation allowances of the income tax. Tax reform can affect organizational form, capital structure, and timing decisions. Our major theme is that the two types of reform will have similar effects on business financial decisions because they both integrate corporate and personal income taxes. Both reforms eliminate the tax differentials between corporate and noncorporate businesses and between debt and equity financing. Since both reforms eliminate investor-level taxes on financial assets, they reduce the effects of taxes on timing decisions associated with financial assets, such as the timing of corporate dividends. How taxes affect these financial decisions have important implications for the incidence of the corporate tax. These reforms also greatly alter the current incentives for tax-motivated financial planning. ...|$|E

H.R. 4457 also indexes the limitations for inflation and expands the definition of property that qualifies for that <b>immediate</b> <b>deduction.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{court also}} {{considered}} {{the question of}} whether Welch's expenses were current expenses or investments which should have been capitalized. Although the case was eventually decided on other grounds, the idea that the expenses should have increased the basis of the business as capital expenses, with no <b>immediate</b> <b>deduction</b> but the potential for depreciation losses over time may also have influenced the court.|$|R

The Wings were given 14 weeks to pay the outstanding debt to the HMRC, and thanks almost entirely to the supporters were able to raise £60,000 to clear all monies owed. During this period, in a Football Conference Hearing on 16 September 2010, Welling United admitted to a misconduct charge {{in connection with the}} outstanding HMRC debt.

40|$|The tax law {{governing}} corporate philanthropy {{is stuck}} in an archaic notion of corporate charity that does not necessarily benefit either charities or corporate stakeholders. Four developments {{in the last few}} years provoked this reexamination of the Internal Revenue Code and its awkward dichotomy between business expenses and charitable contributions. They offer new reasons for replacing the charitable contribution deduction for corporations with a business expense deduction: (1) a statutory reduction in the rate of tax on dividends received by individual shareholders, (2) empirical evidence showing very low effective tax rates paid by corporations, (3) death of the preeminent model of corporate philanthropy - Berkshire Hathaway 2 ̆ 7 s shareholder-designation program, and (4) adoption of final capitalization regulations that significantly weaken the capitalization requirement and no longer pose much of an obstacle to <b>immediate</b> <b>deduction</b> of corporate payments to charities. This seemingly small legal change offers many benefits in today 2 ̆ 7 s climate: it would increase the coherence of a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s tax treatment, help to minimize the agency costs in corporate philanthropy, and change the way that corporations define their charitable endeavors, encouraging greater overall corporate commitment to charitable and community needs, both within and outside their business operations...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{situation}} of companies costs for investing in computer software in {{an income tax}} law perspective is described by a tax law guidance that generelly acount these costs according the principles of research and development. If there is any reason to classify the costs differently, it could mean that <b>immediate</b> <b>deduction</b> not will be allowed. For this reason {{it is important to}} establish what the {{legal situation}} would be in a more nuanced tax law classification. The tax law categories that will be analysed in the thesis are research and development, inventories, intangible assets, stocks and ongoing projects. The purpose of this thesis is mainly to give examples of what such an income tax law classification can look like. While dealing with the problems of classifying the costs some situations of competition will occure. My conclusion is {{that it is important to}} bring out the multiplicity and the comlpexity that marks the legal situation in question. In each specific case yet some situations can occure that I haven’t been close to border on.

5000|$|Whether {{seeking new}} employment, {{and the costs}} {{associated}} therewith, can be deemed as [...] "carrying on" [...] a prior business or trade is fact- and context-specific. However, the IRS, with approval of the courts, has insisted on {{a high degree of}} sameness between the new position sought and the previous means of employment. [...] This means that if substantial differences exist between the duties, tasks, and activities of the taxpayer's prior job and those of the job he now seeks, then the expenses incurred will be deemed to be start-up costs, and not subject to <b>immediate</b> <b>deduction.</b> [...] Similarly, if the taxpayer has undergone a significant hiatus between the prior position of employment and the one now sought, expenses will not be considered [...] "carrying on" [...] the business or trade. [...] Again, whether a hiatus would be considered significant is highly fact- and context-specific. The relevant inquiry here should be whether there is a [...] "substantial lack of continuity." [...] If the taxpayer terminated his previous employment with little indication of seeking a new position in the same profession, it is likely that time spent unemployed or employed in a different field would prevent the taxpayer from claiming that he was [...] "carrying on" [...] his prior business or trade.|$|R
50|$|On 23 April 2009, The Football League {{announced}} that Southampton {{had been placed}} into administration. The ruling occurred after the deadline for <b>immediate</b> points <b>deduction</b> application, so the ten-point deduction would have to await whether or not Southampton, in 22nd place {{at the time of}} the announcement, were relegated. If they had finished above the relegation zone, then the points would have been deducted from their total for the current year to thereby relegate them. However, since their relegation was confirmed following their penultimate match, their point penalty would be applied the next season in League One.|$|R
50|$|Conceptually, {{amortization}} is {{a mechanism}} that allows taxpayers {{to recover the}} cost of property {{over the life of}} an asset when they are precluded from taking an <b>immediate</b> and full <b>deduction.</b> Practically, this means that taxpayers may recover the cost in small amounts over time. There are two forms of such recovery: depreciation and amortization. Selig deals with amortization. The general rule for amortization is set forth in Section 197 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Selig case demonstrates some of the practical problems in cost allocation prior to the enactment of Section 197.|$|R
40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{businesses}} are driving jobs growth in Australia and {{must continue to}} do so. That is why last year, we announced: 	A 1. 5 percentage point tax cut for incorporated small businesses with a turnover of less than $ 2 million per year; 	A 5 % tax discount for unincorporated small businesses; 	<b>Immediate</b> tax <b>deductions</b> for each and every asset purchased up to $ 20, 000; and 	Immediate deductibility of professional expenses when establishing new small businesses. The Coalition Government’s Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan will support growth, higher wages and jobs by lowering the tax rate for companies over time to an internationally competitive level. We will: 	Cut the small business company tax rate to 27. 5 per cent for small businesses with a turnover less than $ 10 million. 	Increase the unincorporated tax discount from 5 per cent to 8 per cent, capped at $ 1, 000 for small businesses with a turnover less than $ 5 million. 	Extend access to the instant asset write off so that small businesses with a turnover less than $ 10 million can instantly deduct each and every asset under $ 20, 000. 	Make life easier by simplifying Business Activity Statements (BAS), reducing reporting labels from seven to three. The company tax rate will be progressively lowered to 25 per cent by 2026 - 27 for all companies. We are also supporting small business by: 	Cutting red tape by $ 4. 5 billion, including simplifying the process for establishing an employee share scheme and removing almost 450, 000 small businesses from the PAYG system; 	Opening new markets by signing export trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan; 	Extending protections against unfair contract terms to small businesses; and 	Appointing the first ever Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The Coalition is also fixing Australia’s competition laws to help small to medium companies compete with larger established ones and to ensure they’re not shut out of markets unfairly by the big players. Adopting {{the recommendations of the}} Harper Review, the Coalition will repeal the current Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act {{and replace it with a}} new provision that prevents firms with substantial market power from engaging in conduct that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This will prevent the misuse of market power and benefit small businesses. It will enhance competition, support innovation, benefit consumers and boost jobs and growth.

6000|$|Of {{which the}} <b>immediate</b> and evident <b>deduction</b> is that tyrants {{are as much}} the sons of God as Garibaldis; and that King Bomba of Naples having, with the utmost success, [...] "found himself" [...] is {{identical}} with the ultimate good in all things. The {{truth is that the}} western energy that dethrones tyrants has been directly due to the western theology that says [...] "I am I, thou art thou." [...] The same spiritual separation which looked up and saw a good king in the universe looked up and saw a bad king in Naples. The worshippers of Bomba's god dethroned Bomba. The worshippers of Swinburne's god have covered Asia for centuries and have never dethroned a tyrant. The Indian saint may reasonably shut his eyes because he is looking at that which is I and Thou and We and They and It. It is a rational occupation: but it is not true in theory and not true in fact that it helps the Indian {{to keep an eye on}} Lord Curzon. That external vigilance which has always been the mark of Christianity (the command that we should WATCH and pray) has expressed itself both in typical western orthodoxy and in typical western politics: but both depend on the idea of a divinity transcendent, different from ourselves, a deity that disappears. Certainly the most sagacious creeds may suggest that we should pursue God into deeper and deeper rings of the labyrinth of our own ego. But only we of Christendom have said that we should hunt God like an eagle upon the mountains: and we have killed all monsters in the chase.|$|R
40|$|Gail Coleman of Alexandria, Virginia {{spent three}} decades as an {{attorney}} with the U. S. Department of Labor. Now retired, she enjoys traveling, volunteer activities, and taking history classes at George Mason University. And she still utilizes the analytical skills of an attorney. Indeed, before recommending a 100, 000 grant to Jefferson (see “Changing Lives Through Research” on p. 3), Gail educated herself on the landscape of pancreatic cancer research, met with several institutions and evaluated a number of potential projects. Gail’s initial decision to support pancreatic cancer research was not analytical, but deeply personal: The disease took her mother in 1989, her father in 2002 and her husband, Ken Bruntel, in 2009. Ken, with whom Gail spent 30 years, received the diagnosis the day they were supposed to leave for a trip to Germany. When he died exactly four months later, Ken had just celebrated his 60 th birthday, surrounded by friends. As noted in his Washington Post obituary, Ken was a senior partner in the Washington law firm of Crowell 2 ̆ 6 Moring, which he had helped to found in 1979. He was an expert in government contracts law, including healthcare law. He also provided pro bono legal services – receiving his firm’s George Bailey Public Service Award for his efforts in helping low-income elderly citizens to navigate the complexity of new Medicare benefits. Recognizing that her husband’s estate would exceed her needs, Gail chose to create a donor-advised charitable gift fund as a way of honoring his memory and supporting research into one of the deadliest cancers. The fund allows her to take an <b>immediate</b> tax <b>deduction</b> when she makes contributions, and then gives her the leisure to investigate how this money can best be used to support cancer research. In the meantime she advises as to how her contributions are invested and makes recommendations for future grants. Early on, Gail says, she focused on cancer institutes but was later introduced to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. In fact, it was at a national PanCAN meeting that Gail first met Jonathan R. Brody, PhD, Jefferson’s Director of Surgical Research and a 2010 PanCAN Career Development Award recipient, who was presenting on his leading-edge work. The potential for a direct relationship with an organization such as Jefferson emerged as an attractive opportunity for Gail because of the high level of engagement it would offer. “It appealed to me because I value the closer connection to the projects and direct relationships with the doctors,” she says. Twice a year, Gail comes to Philadelphia to meet with the team and receives reports on the two projects she is supporting. “From my first interaction with Gail, it was obvious that she would be a very active, intelligent donor. She is eager and capable of understanding the science and knows the critical questions to ask,” Dr. Brody notes. “She is a new brand of donor that I would call a ‘donor-collaborator. ’” Gail adds, “It is important to me to support translational research into treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, especially innovative work that would otherwise go unfunded. ” For information about making a contribution to the Department of Surgery, please contact Lara Goldstein in the Jefferson Foundation at 215 - 955 - 8797 or lara. goldstein@jefferson. edu...|$|R
