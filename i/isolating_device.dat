As an example, it was considered the European Lead-cooled System (ELSY) international project response under a reference design basis earthquake (Safe Shutdown Earthquake-SSE) excitation, taking into account also the main <b>isolating</b> <b>device</b> effects {{in order to increase}} the reactor safety. This study is intended to analyze the structural effects of a reference SSE by means of an appropriate dynamic FEM code, for possible geometries of both not isolated and isolated ELSY containment building foundation cases. A great attention should be focused too on the arisen hydrodynamic forces and coupling effects between fluid and structures (sloshing phenomenon) that may impair the structures resistance and/or operating capabilities. The obtained numerical results were critically analysed with the intent also to contribute to a step of the safety optimization of the mentioned systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical comparison between a static-CMOS and a hybrid-RERL design of an inverter. The measurements {{taken into account}} are the total power dissipation, the performance in terms of propagation delay, {{and the size of}} each design. The hybrid-RERL architecture uses the RERL format except it reduces the 6 -phase clock presented in earlier papers to a 5 -phase clock by replacing the isolation switch on the output of the logic function with a non-gated, <b>isolating</b> <b>device</b> (i. e. a diode). Still, the hybrid-RERL logic makes further use of reversible logic. Although, the idea behind reversible logic (and adiabatic circuits) is to eliminate all non-adiabatic losses, this paper places a secondary goal of simplifying the hybrid-RERL inverter, which results in some non-adiabatic loss. Overall, the hybrid-RERL inverter significantly reduces power consumption at the cost of complexity and performance. As personal computers become more compact and portable (e. g. laptops, PDA’s, cell phones, etc.), power consumption becomes a larger factor. Although the energy dissipation from digital devices has declined over the last 50 years, it is expected that this tread line will slow down and/or stop within the next decade or two [3]. The reason, as mentioned by a number of paper...|$|E
40|$|Appliance' digital {{devices such}} as {{handheld}} cameras, scanners, and microphones generate data {{that people want to}} put on Web pages. Unfortunately, numerous complex steps are required. Contrast this with Web output: handheld Web browsers enjoy increasing infrastructural support such as user-transparent transformation proxies, allowing unmodified Web pages to be conveniently viewed on devices not originally designed for the task. We hypothesize that the utility of input appliances will be greatly increased if they too were `infrastructure enabled'. Appliance Data Services attempts to systematically describe the task domain of providing seamless and graceful interoperability between input appliances and the Web. We offer an application architecture and a validating prototype that we hope will `open up the playing field' and motivate further work. Our initial efforts have identified two main design challenges: dealing with device heterogeneity, and providing a `no-futz' out-of-the-box user experience for novices without sacrificing expressive power for advanced users. We address heterogeneity by <b>isolating</b> <b>device</b> and protocol heterogeneity considerations into a single extensible architectural component, allowing most of the application logic to deal exclusively with Web-friendly protocols and formats. We address the user interface issue in two ways: first, by specifying how to tag input with commands that specify how data are to be manipulated once injected into the infrastructure; second, by describing a late-binding mechanism for these command-tags, which allows `natural' extensions of the device's UI for application selection and minimizes the amount of configuration required before end-users benefit from Appliance Data Services. Finally, we describe how to leverage exist [...] ...|$|E

There have been myriad attempts to protect the kernel, but most of them either required driver modifications or incur substantial performance overhead. This paper describes an <b>isolated</b> <b>device</b> driver execution system called SIDE (Streamlined Isolated Driver Execution), which focuses specifically on unmodified device drivers and strives to avoid changing the existing kernel code as much as possible. SIDE exploits virtual memory hardware to set up a device driver execution environment that is compatible with existing device drivers and yet is fully isolated from the kernel. SIDE is able to run an unmodified device driver for a Gigabit Ethernet NIC and the latency and throughput penalty is kept under 1 % when augmented with a set of performance optimizations designed {{to reduce the number of}} protection domain crossings between an <b>isolated</b> <b>device</b> driver and the kernel.
