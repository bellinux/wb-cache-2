2500|$|During the {{recording}} of Muse's fifth studio album The Resistance, Wolstenholme checked into rehab {{to deal with his}} alcoholism, which was threatening the band's future. Howard said: [...] "I've always believed in band integrity and sticking together. There's something about the fact we all grew up together.

[...] According to the Georgian commander, the United States would transport the troops to Georgia and initially 1,000 troops would leave; U.S. officials only said that they were studying options for transportation.|$|E

2500|$|Hart linked American {{energy policy}} with {{national}} security {{in an essay}} published in November 2007. [...] Hart wrote, [...] "In fact, we do have an energy policy: It’s to continue to import more than <b>half</b> <b>our</b> oil and sacrifice American lives so we can drive our Humvees. This is our current policy, and it is massively immoral." [...] Hart currently sits {{on the board of}} directors for the Energy Literacy Advocates.

2500|$|The {{offensive}} {{was undertaken}} {{in the hope of}} triggering a general uprising, but urban Vietnamese did not respond as the Việt Cộng anticipated. About 75,000 communist soldiers were killed or wounded, according to Trần Văn Trà, commander of the [...] "B-2" [...] district, which consisted of southern South Vietnam. [...] "We did not base ourselves on scientific calculation or a careful weighing of all factors, but...on an illusion based on our subjective desires", Trà concluded. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Tet resulted in 40,000 communist dead (compared to about 10,600 U.S. and South Vietnamese dead). [...] "It is a major irony of the Vietnam War that our propaganda transformed this debacle into a brilliant victory. The truth was that Tet cost us <b>half</b> <b>our</b> forces. Our losses were so immense that we were unable to replace them with new recruits", said PRG Justice Minister Trương Như Tảng. Tet had a profound psychological impact because South Vietnamese cities were otherwise safe areas during the war. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Westmoreland argued that panicky news coverage gave the public the unfair perception that America had been defeated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album was notably {{different}} than Forever as the female vocals and violins had disappeared and the band's focus had shifted away from melody towards more technicality and progressiveness, featuring more complex song structures and time signature changes. Remy Beauchamp elaborated, [...] "Basically, it was over three years between the recordings of both albums so within that time, the music we listen to has changed. Also, we all improved on our instruments... The female vocals are just something we tried a long time ago. The song was actually written in 1994, and then every band started doing it {{so we decided to}} drop it. The violin is not out definitely though, we might be putting some on our next album but for 'Day Into Night', we wanted to have a good heavy album, no extras." [...] Bart said that [...] "the production is much better; we spent 3 months in the studio as opposed to a week and a <b>half...</b> <b>Our</b> budget helped as well - we basically spent ten times the amount that we spent on Forever..." [...] He also said, [...] "One thing that many fans asked about... was why there was no violin. At the time we wanted to distance ourselves from all the bands that filled space in their music with different instruments as opposed to writing good music that stood on its own. We did the violin thing five years ago when the idea was a new concept so we wanted to move in. In face, we did record a violin piece for the album but chose not to include it for the reason above. Too many bands with violins. We wanted Day into Night to be heavy and kick ass and not diluted by association." ...|$|E
