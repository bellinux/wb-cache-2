5000|$|The revised Waste Framework Directive [...] (rWFD) is {{the primary}} {{legislative}} framework for the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste across Europe. It uses a waste hierarchy to define a priority order for waste prevention, legislation and policy. WM2 follows the European wide definition of hazardous waste defined by the rWFD as a waste which displays {{one or more of}} the fifteen hazard properties listed <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>III</b> of the rWFD.|$|E
50|$|Hence, {{the laws}} in force are in {{hierarchical}} order are The Hong Kong Basic Law; {{legislation in force}} before 1 July 1997 that was adopted as laws of the HKSAR by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; laws enacted by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong after 1997; and PRC laws listed <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>III</b> to the Basic Law and applied by way of promulgation or legislation; Common law and Equity; Subordinate legislation; Customary law.|$|E
5000|$|The ELD {{has been}} amended three times through Directive 2006/21/EC on the {{management}} of waste from extractive industries, through Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide, and through the Offshore Safety Directive 2013/30/EU, on safety of offshore oil and gas operations.

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk of}} introduction of listed viruses and virus-like agents through the import of pollen for pollination of eight plant genera. Because {{of the absence of}} an identified pollen trade for Fragaria, Rubus, Ribes, Vitis and Cydonia, the risk of introduction of viruses listed in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC was assessed to be negligible, with low uncertainty. For Prunus, Malus and Pyrus, trade was identified and the risk evaluated in detail. For 12 viruses and one viroid the probability of entry was rated unlikely to moderately likely and the probability of establishment very unlikely to unlikely. In the case of the two remaining agents, Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) and Apple fruit crinkle viroid (AFCVd), the probability of entry was rated as very unlikely with a moderately likely to likely (ALSV) or very unlikely to unlikely (AFCVd) probability of establishment. Therefore, for all agents, significant limitations to their introduction were identified. Almost all ratings are, however, associated with high uncertainty because of the absence of information on many important aspects. As a consequence, the risk of introduction of listed viruses and viroids by pollen for pollination of the genera Prunus, Malus and Pyrus is considered negligible to low, with high uncertainty. The current legislation provides a substantial level of risk reduction but risks could be further reduced by addressing specifically pollen <b>in</b> <b>Annexes</b> <b>III</b> and IV. The two risk reduction options identified with high or very high effectiveness and feasibility to further reduce the risk of introduction are the extension to all non-EU countries of the existing prohibition on Prunus, Malus and Pyrus pollen imports and a request for the individual testing of all imported pollen shipments. The uncertainty on the effectiveness and feasibility of these measures was assessed as low and low to medium, respectivel...|$|R

40|$|Obstructive Sleep Apnoea {{syndrome}} (OSAS) is a prevalent chronic sleeprelated disease inducing {{among other}} consequences {{an increased risk}} of Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs). The disease has been well characterized in the last two decades, but the effects of the disease on road traffic accidents have only been thoroughly confirmed in recent years. OSAS has not been included up to now in the list of diseases linked to driving risks, as listed <b>in</b> the <b>Annex</b> <b>III</b> of the Directive 2006 / 126 /EC. According to the growing evidence, the driving licence committee established in 2012 a Working Group on OSA. This group has developed three main aspects of the problem, with the aim of making it possible to introduce OSA <b>in</b> the <b>Annex</b> <b>III</b> <b>in</b> the near future. The Working Group has identified the population at risk, and has proposed to address all applicants for a driving licence, at the start and at each renewal period. A screening strategy has been devised, composed of simply available objective data, mainly anthropometric, complemented by questions on the presence of recent MVAs, of symptoms and complaints frequently associated with OSAS, and a questionnaire assessment of daytime sleepiness. This provides a simple semi-quantitative analysis of the probability of the applicant being afflicted by OSAS, thus needing a complementary medical advice procedure before an unrestricted licence can be delivered. A series of different decisions on the delivery of the driving licence has been proposed according to the individual situation of the applicant, whether a diagnosis of OSAS is established, or a simple suspicion that the disease might be present, whether a treatment is available and complied with, whether disabling symptoms are controlled or not. The proposal also includes recommendations on the appropriate diagnostic expertise and technology required to offer sound guidance to the administrative authorities. The Working Group has identified present information and education gaps that should worth be filled in order to enhance the awareness on the relation between OSAS and MVAs, and contribute to the preventive efforts to reduce the rate of MVAs. These efforts should address professional drivers and their employers, as well as police officers in charge of filling in the official forms required in case of MVAs with property damage or personal injuries. The aim in this context is to better assess the possibility of accidents being due to the driver having fallen asleep at the wheel, in order to improve the statistical information on accidents and sleepiness. ...|$|R
