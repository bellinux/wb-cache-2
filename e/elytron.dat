60|$|Chitine.--The chitinous {{coats of}} insects {{naturally}} {{captured by the}} leaves do {{not appear in the}} least corroded. Small square pieces of the delicate wing and of the <b>elytron</b> of a Staphylinus [page 125] were placed on some leaves, and after these had re-expanded, the pieces were carefully examined. Their angles were as sharp as ever, and they did not differ in appearance from the other wing and <b>elytron</b> of the same insect which had been left in water. The <b>elytron,</b> however, had evidently yielded some nutritious matter, for the leaf remained clasped over it for four days; whereas the leaves with bits of the true wing re-expanded on the second day. Any one who will examine the excrement of insect-eating animals will see how powerless their gastric juice is on chitine.|$|E
50|$|Adult beetles are 7 - 12 mm in length. <b>Elytron</b> is rounded {{completely}} on top. Hind femur reaching apex of <b>elytron,</b> which have no teeth. <b>Elytron</b> have no indentations. Antenna and legs are reddish-colored, {{the top is}} bronze-green.|$|E
50|$|At length {{the beetle}} reaches 7.4 mm. Epipleuron <b>elytron</b> flat, {{with a number}} of points at the inner edge. <b>Elytron</b> females have long lateral keel. The top edaegus have a short process.|$|E
50|$|There are {{typically}} five black {{spots on the}} <b>elytron.</b> Four of those are arranged on the dorso-lateral part of the <b>elytron.</b> The two anterior spots form an roughly half-moon shaped oval with the convexity directed towards the suture of the <b>elytron.</b> The two posterior ones make a more irregular shape, formed by the intersection of two circular spots. Finally, the fifth spot covers {{the length of the}} elytron's suture, englarging towards the posterior stretch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elytron</b> {{have a few}} erect hairs.|$|E
50|$|H. guttatopustulata is 7-9 mm in length, {{with the}} {{distinct}} rounded elytra or fore wings typical of ladybirds. Apart from their coloured spots, the elytra and pronotum are black, while the propleura, {{the sides of}} the prothorax, are yellow or yellowish brown. Each <b>elytron</b> bears three spots. The spot {{on the top of the}} midline is reddish brown, as is the spot on the rear of the <b>elytron.</b> Another spot on the lower front part of the <b>elytron</b> also is yellow or yellowish brown.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{also used}} in the {{discussion}} of phasmids and in such case refers to:A network of non-directional veins in the costal region of the wing or in the <b>elytron.</b> It is these veins which make the <b>elytron</b> and costal region of the hindwing thicker and stiffer than the anal region of the hindwing.|$|E
50|$|It is 3.4 - 4.4 mm {{long with}} black head and straw {{coloured}} <b>elytron.</b> Its <b>elytron</b> is elongate {{and have a}} transverse band that is dark in colour.

5000|$|An <b>elytron</b> ( [...] ; from Greek ἔλυτρον [...] "sheath, cover"; plural: elytra, [...] ) is a modified, {{hardened}} forewing {{of certain}} insect orders, notably beetles (Coleoptera) {{and a few}} of the true bugs (Hemiptera); in most true bugs, the forewings are instead called hemelytra (sometimes misspelled as [...] "hemielytra"), as only the basal half is thickened while the apex is membranous. An <b>elytron</b> is sometimes also referred to as a shard.|$|E
50|$|The colour of {{head and}} pronotum is black while elytra are red, with three black spots on each <b>elytron.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the adults is 8.5 - 11.5 mm. The bands on the <b>elytron</b> have {{conspicuous}} points in the basal half.|$|E
50|$|Description: Female's {{total length}} about 22 mm, pronotum 4 mm x 4 mm, <b>elytron</b> 18 mm long, dilated laterally, {{narrowing}} towards apical lobe.|$|E
50|$|Adult beetles are greenish-yellow {{with six}} large black spots on each <b>elytron.</b> They are about 0.5 cm long. The larvae are {{yellowish}} and wormlike.|$|E
50|$|Its {{head and}} pronotum are yellow-brown, with 12 whitish spots, six on each <b>elytron</b> (hence the Latin word , meaning twelve-spotted {{as if by}} drops).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} North American species {{belongs to the}} genus Collops (C. quadrimaculatus) and is reddish, with two bluish black spots on each <b>elytron.</b>|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{the more}} {{well-known}} Rodolia cardinalis, koebelei has much more strongly confluent markings. This often creates a large concurrent red patch on each <b>elytron,</b> though some individuals may be entirely uniform red.|$|E
