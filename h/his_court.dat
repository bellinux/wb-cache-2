5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed <b>his</b> <b>court</b> physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to reconcile the Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc Dávid <b>his</b> <b>court</b> preacher.|$|E
5|$|Theseus, {{eager to}} please his fiancee, Hippolyta, {{and the rest of}} <b>his</b> <b>court,</b> chooses Pyramus and Thisbe despite Philostrate's efforts. Because of its amateurishness, the play turns out to be humorous.|$|E

5|$|Asser (died c. 909) was a Welsh monk from St David's, Dyfed, {{who became}} Bishop of Sherborne in the 890s. About 885 {{he was asked}} by Alfred the Great to leave St David's and join the circle of learned men whom Alfred was {{recruiting}} for <b>his</b> <b>court.</b> After spending a year at Caerwent because of illness, Asser accepted.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{gave his}} {{permission}} for the document to be published, and he, {{his family and}} the remnants of <b>his</b> <b>Court</b> departed for the Royal shooting lodge at Eckartsau, close to the borders with Hungary and Slovakia.

5|$|Henry {{cultivated}} {{the image}} of a Renaissance man, and <b>his</b> <b>court</b> was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo.|$|E
5|$|Khafaja was {{succeeded by}} his son Muhammad, elected by the Sicilian army and {{confirmed}} by the Aghlabid emir. In contrast to his previous energy, Muhammad was a sedentary governor, preferring to remain in his capital rather than campaign in person. His tenure was furthermore cut short when he was assassinated by <b>his</b> <b>court</b> eunuchs on 27 May 871.|$|E
5|$|Parker's health {{deteriorated}} in the 1890s and {{the jurisdiction}} {{and power of}} <b>his</b> <b>court</b> were reduced by Congress. In September 1896, Congress effectively closed the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas by removing its jurisdiction. Shortly after, on November 17, 1896, Parker died of complications due to Bright's disease. He is buried in Fort Smith.|$|E

50|$|Albert Achilles {{tried to}} expand the {{jurisdiction}} of <b>his</b> <b>courts,</b> {{as part of his}} attempt to extend his influence over neighbouring areas. For this purpose, he tried to raise <b>his</b> Burgraviate <b>Court</b> at Nuremberg to an Imperial Court. This would have given him jurisdiction over the neighbouring principalities and the possibility to override decisions of subordinate courts. He also had in mind a plan to re-establish the Duchy of Franconia, with himself as Duke. The Bishopric of Würzburg had similar plans; neither party managed to implement them.|$|R
5|$|Sigismund's cousins, Balthasar and Stephen Báthory, {{returned}} from Poland to Transylvania. Balthasar {{wanted to take}} charge of the government, making <b>his</b> <b>court</b> at Fogaras (present-day Făgăraș in Romania) the center of those who opposed Ghyczy's rule. Kovacsóczy, the chancellor of Transylvania, remained neutral in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It {{is easy to see}} why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based <b>his</b> <b>court</b> in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla kept <b>his</b> <b>court</b> in Shiraz. He visited Baghdad {{frequently}} and kept {{some of his}} viziers there, one of them being a Christian named Nasir ibn Harun. Furthermore, he had several Zoroastrian statesmen who served him, such as Abu Sahl Sa'id ibn Fadl al-Majusi, who served as his representative of Baghdad before his conquest of Iraq; Abu'l-Faraj Mansur ibn Sahl al-Majusi, who served as his financial minister; and Bahram ibn Ardashir al-Majusi, {{who served as a}} Buyid official. Adud al-Dawla seems to have greatly respected their religion.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} mention of grape-based wines in India {{is from the}} late 4th-century BC {{writings}} of Chanakya, the chief minister of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. In his writings, Chanakya condemns the use of alcohol while chronicling the emperor and <b>his</b> <b>court's</b> frequent indulgence of a style of wine known as madhu.|$|R
5|$|After Austerlitz, Napoleon {{established}} the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection of German states intended {{to serve as}} a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of <b>his</b> <b>court,</b> especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E
5|$|After {{questioning}} during 96 {{hours of}} detention, Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 {{with the murder}} of Joanna Yeates. He made a brief appearance at Bristol's Magistrates' Court on 24 January and was remanded in custody. Tabak, legally represented by Paul Cook, declined to request bail during a hearing the following day. Tabak was moved from Bristol Prison because of fears for his safety, and was placed under suicide watch at Long Lartin Prison near Evesham. Tabak's family and friends in the Netherlands started to raise funds for <b>his</b> <b>court</b> defence.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters {{and worked as}} a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, he had moved back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In January 2005, police charged Taylor with misdemeanor child abuse for allegedly leaving four of his children (ages from 2 to 11) alone for more than eight hours. He did not show up for <b>his</b> <b>court</b> date, and at one point there were four outstanding warrants for his arrest.|$|E

5|$|Andronicus II {{took a deep}} {{interest}} in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous training of the army. The Byzantine Emperor ordered that <b>his</b> <b>court</b> be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General Alexios Philanthropenos to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son Michael IX and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at Magnesia and Bapheus in 1302.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at <b>his</b> <b>court,</b> and by her Medici ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular and beloved kings of England, known as the Merry Monarch, in {{reference}} to both the liveliness and hedonism of <b>his</b> <b>court</b> and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.|$|E
