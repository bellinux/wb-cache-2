The {{purpose was to}} identify if investigations of vitrifi ed rock in hill forts might be warranted for assessing the long-term integrity of vitrifi ed waste in natural environments. Wastes that are being vitrifi ed include ash from incineration of domestic waste, contaminated soil and fi ssion products from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. It was found that vitrifi ed materials in at least 200 hill forts constitute good anthropogenic analogues to vitri-fi ed waste. The compositions vary considerably from site to site and even within one site and may correspond relatively well to the spans of parameters in the various vitrifi ed wastes. Glasses in vitrifi <b>ed</b> <b>forts</b> compare favourably to archaeological artefacts which are soda- and potash-based and consequently have different cor-rosion behaviours and may weather too quickly. Natural glasses might be too limited in composition variation and are perhaps also too durable. Combustion technology considerations based on quality of heat analyses indicate {{that at least some}} of the vitrifi cations of hill forts were carried out with the specifi c purpose of achiev-ing strong and durable constructions. This makes it considerably easier to envisage how the vitrifi cations might have been carried out, and this, in turn, facilitates comparisons between anthropogenic analogues and modern vitrifi ed wastes...|$|R

He had later signed a legal document giving up all subsequent rights of enclosure within the manor.

This threatened their commons rights and livelihoods, as they depended on the fens for pasturage and for peat for burning as fuel.

5000|$|Munich {{was under}} the control of the Habsburg family for some years after Maximilian II Emanuel had made a pact with France in 1705 during the War of the Spanish Succession.

The city's first academic institution, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, was founded in 1759 by Maximilian III Joseph, who abandoned his forefather's imperial ambitions and made peace. From 1789 onwards, when the old medieval fortification was demolished, the English Garden was laid out - it is one of the world's largest urban public parks. By that time, the city was growing very quickly and was one of the largest cities in continental Europe.|$|R

This area of research has been developing rapidly {{in the past few}} years, and in these proceedings we present some results based on the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, thus highlighting what can be achieved with current data sets. We present results on the measurement of virial masses as a function of luminosity and the extent of dark matter halos. Much larger surveys are underway or planned, which will result in an impressive improvement in the accuracy of the measurements.

50|$|In 1968 a large bone was {{discovered}} during {{the installation of}} a farm pond near Angola, Indiana, about 40 miles (65 km) north of <b>Fort</b> Wayne. The <b>farmer</b> contacted professors in the IPFW geology department, who identified his discovery as the leg bone of a mastodon. Faculty and students from the geology department excavated {{the greater part of}} an adult mastodon, including the skull and tusks. The bones were cleaned, preserved, and placed on permanent display at IPFW. In 1970 members of the geology club, led by professors who oversaw the excavation, successfully lobbied the student government committee charged with choosing a name for the university mascot to select the mastodon. And thus, the IPFW Mastodons were born 9. In addition to serving as a mascot, “Mastodon” is used as the athletic moniker for team members and school-spirited references to the student body. The selection of the mastodon as mascot—as well as a tongue-in-cheek borrowing of the term “Don” from its academic British English use—lends itself to be a suffix to refer to the athletics teams as well, such as Volleydons for the volleyball teams. In a related reference, the Mastodon STOMP pep band instills school spirit among the fans during home matches and games.|$|R
5000|$|Essex {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{counties}} to be settled in Upper Canada, later to become Ontario, mostly by French people in the mid-18th century. Around 1749, the first permanent settlements began to appear on what is now the Canadian side of the Detroit River which despite its name is not a river as such, but a strait connecting Lake Huron and the smaller Lake Saint Clair in the north to Lake Erie in the south, as part of the Great Lakes system in the middle of the North American continent. Lower down the river, lands were occupied by native people known as Wyandots or Hurons, around the Mission of Bois Blanc (French for White Wood) as its centre, opposite the island of the same name. The Mission was eventually abandoned and re-established closer to what became Sandwich Township, and was closer to the safety of the British fortified <b>Fort</b> Detroit. When <b>farmers</b> first arrived, they encountered difficulty in trying to clear the extremely thick forests that covered Essex County. The farmers grew to [...] "hate" [...] the trees, and chopped them down, starved them from nourishment by cutting deep gashes in the bark, and burned them to clear the way to get to the fertile soils underneath. The fires were so intense, that the reddish glow could be seen from Fort Chicago, 300 miles (500 km) away, as millions of cords of wood burned.|$|R
40|$|The SPI {{spectrometer}} aboard of the INTEGRAL satellite {{has released}} {{a map of}} the e+e- annihilation emission line of unprecedented quality, showing that most of the photons arise from a region coinciding with the stellar bulge of the Milky Way. The impressive intensity (10 ^- 3 photon/cm^ 2 /s) and morphology (round and wide) of the emission is begging an explanation. Different classes of astrophysical objects could inject positrons in the interstellar medium of the bulge, but the only acceptable ones should inject them at energies low enough to avoid excessive bremsstrahlung emission in the soft gamma ray regime. Among the ~ MeV injectors, none seems generous enough to sustain the high level of annihilation observed. Even the most profuse candidate, namely the beta+ radioactivity of 56 Co nuclei created and expelled in the interstellar medium by explosive nucleosynthesis of type Ia supernovae, falls short explaining the phenomenon due to the small fraction of positrons leaking out from the ejecta (3 %), together with the low SNIa rate in the bulge (0. 03 per century). It is therefore worth exploring alternative solutions, as for instance, the idea that the source of the positrons is the annihilation of light dark matter (LDM) particles of the kind recently proposed, totally independently, by Boehm and Fayet. Assuming that LDM is the culprit, crucial constraints on the characteristics (mass and annihilation cross-section) of the associated particle may be discussed, combining direct gamma ray observations and models of the early Universe. In particular, the mass of the LDM particles should be significantly less than 100 MeV, so that the e+ and e- resulting from their annihilations do not radiate exceedingly through bremsstrahlung in the interstellar gas of the galactic bulge.

40|$|Idaho 2 ̆ 7 s Shoshone and Bannock Indians {{have long}} relied upon the Snake River. The {{waterway}} provides salmon and waters the vast Camas Prairie. On the prairie grows the Camas plant, {{the roots of}} which Shoshones and Bannocks harvest as a staple of their diet. Grass also grows on the prairie and the surrounding plains, which fed huge herds of bison that Shoshones and Bannocks also relied upon for food and skins to wear and trade. As a result of integration into the globalizing economy initiated by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, indigenous peoples of the area and Euroamericans overhunted bison populations, driving them to near extinction. Equestrian Bannock culture centered on the bison hunt as the primary means to accumulate wealth and prestige. As bison numbers declined, American cattlemen drove their herds onto the Camas Prairie, consuming and trampling the plants and roots that Shoshones and Bannocks gathered. The combination {{of the decline of}} bison numbers, the severe degradation of the Camas Prairie and the failure of the federal government to provide Shoshones and Bannocks on the Fort Hall Reservation with treaty promised food rations and cash annuities drove a coalition of Bannocks, Shoshones and Paiutes to war in 1878, led by a Bannock named Buffalo Horn. The Bannocks quickly lost the war, but the conflict marked a significant transition period {{in the history of the}} Northwest in which indigenous armed resistance to colonization and the reservation system became no longer viable.
