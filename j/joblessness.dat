25|$|The Negev Bedouin {{suffer from}} extreme rates of <b>joblessness</b> {{and the highest}} poverty rate in Israel. A 2007 Van Leer Institute study found that 66 percent of Negev Bedouin lived {{below the poverty line}} (in unrecognized villages, the figure reached 80 percent), {{compared}} 25 percent in the Israeli population.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the city}} boasts {{a large and}} diverse {{economic}} base and is not dependent on any single industry and/or company, its unemployment rate has historically been relatively low – only 3.75% over 2005–2008. Indeed, even as the rate of <b>joblessness</b> jumped to 7.1% in 2009, it remained far {{below the national average}} of 9.6%. The average monthly net salary in Kiev reached €300 as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Naples is Italy's fourth-largest economy after Milan, Rome and Turin, {{and is the}} world's 103rd-largest urban {{economy by}} {{purchasing}} power, with an estimated 2011 GDP of US$83.6 billion, equivalent to $28,749 per capita. Naples is a major cargo terminal, and the port of Naples {{is one of the}} Mediterranean's largest and busiest. The city has experienced significant economic growth since World War II, but <b>joblessness</b> remains a major problem, and the city is characterised by high levels of political corruption and organised crime.|$|E
25|$|The South African {{government}} has introduced the Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP) {{to overcome the}} extremely high unemployment and accompanying poverty in that country. The programs run against the full employability tide because they recognise that the solution to <b>joblessness</b> and the poverty that this brings is {{in the provision of}} employment opportunities rather than a focus on the victims. They also recognise that the state (whether at the level of national or local government) has a major role to play in providing for employment guarantees.|$|E
25|$|Evidently, {{this trend}} of falling {{unemployment}} rates {{is a positive}} one. <b>Joblessness</b> {{has long been a}} cause for serious concern in North Africa. Morocco has a lower rate than its Maghreb neighbours—Tunisia has a rate of around 13.9%, and in Algeria it is around 12.3%—but the issue is still a pressing one, both for economic and for social reasons. A 2006 government report suggested that the country needed a net increase of 400,000 jobs annually for the next two decades in order to provide enough employment for its people, given the underlying demographic dynamic.|$|E
25|$|Critics of MINUSTAH's goal of {{providing}} security {{say that the}} provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the <b>joblessness</b> and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton as the UN Special Envoy, there is hope that the international donor community will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, {{there are signs of}} a desire for political independence that the international community would rather ignore.|$|E
25|$|GDP, long {{stuck at}} its 1973 level {{even with a}} growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. Fixed investment, {{depressed}} since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994. The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted <b>joblessness</b> to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).|$|E
25|$|Homelessness {{became a}} serious problem during the 1980s, {{specifically}} {{in the last two}} of Edward Koch's three terms as mayor (1978–1990). The city outlawed discrimination against gay and lesbian people in such matters as employment and housing in 1986. In 1989, Koch was defeated by David Dinkins in the Democratic Party primary in his bid for a fourth term, and then Dinkins narrowly defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the general election to become the city's first-ever black mayor. Crime began a 15-year decline in 1990 during Dinkins's administration, but a combination of continued racial strife (such as that in the Crown Heights Riot in 1991), and an extremely weak economy (in January 1993 the city's unemployment rate reached 13.4 percent, the highest level of <b>joblessness</b> seen there since the Great Depression) caused Dinkins' popularity to seriously decline (including a threat by residents of Staten Island to secede from the city, where in a 1993 referendum, 65% voted to secede, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly).|$|E

A large number of unskilled and skilled workers have moved to Southern India and other nations because of the unavailability of jobs locally. The technology boom that occurred in the past three decades in Southern India has helped many Indians from the north to find jobs and live prosperous lives in Southern cities.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1967, at {{the peak}} of Elyria's population, Midway Mall was opened. It changed the local economy by {{attracting}} local businesses from the town center or causing so much competition they went out of business. Industrial restructuring meant that good jobs left the area, and poverty increased. Three major car plant closings in the area lead to economic stagnation and <b>joblessness</b> in the 1970s and 1980s that affected numerous communities. The region was nicknamed [...] "the Rustbelt," [...] suggesting the decline of its former industries.|$|E

Nonetheless, the vital necessity of providing for those without work should not be used as an excuse to ignore the very real problems of our unemployment system. In this, as in so many other arenas of government policy, unemployment insurance has many unintended effects.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ben Gurion University's Negev Center for Regional Development, {{the towns}} were built without an urban policy framework, {{business}} districts or industrial zones; as Harvey Lithwick of the Negev Center for Regional Development explains: [...] "...the major failure {{was a lack}} of an economic rationale for the towns..." [...] According to Lithwick, and Ismael and Kathleen Abu Saad of Ben Gurion University, the towns quickly became among the most deprived towns in Israel, severely lacking in services such as public transport and banks. The urban townships were plagued by endemic <b>joblessness</b> and resulting cycles of crime and drug trafficking.|$|E
2500|$|A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin began {{planning}} the march in December 1961. They envisioned {{two days of}} protest, including sit-ins and lobbying followed by a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. They wanted to focus on <b>joblessness</b> and {{to call for a}} public works program that would employ blacks. In early 1963 they called publicly for [...] "a massive March on Washington for jobs". They received help from Amalgamated Clothing Workers unionist Stanley Aronowitz, who gathered support from radical organizers who could be trusted not to report their plans to the Kennedy administration. The unionists offered tentative support for a march that would be focused on jobs.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, {{and the two}} {{decided to}} unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle {{neighboring}} street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams discounted the sometimes cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption. Gang activity in South Central Los Angeles {{has its roots in}} a variety of factors dating back to the 1950s and '60s, including post-World War II economic decline leading to <b>joblessness</b> and poverty, racial segregation leading to the formation of black [...] "street clubs" [...] by young African American men who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement.|$|E
2500|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt came {{to office}} in 1933 amid the {{economic}} calamity of the Great Depression, offering the nation a New Deal intended to alleviate economic desperation and <b>joblessness,</b> provide greater opportunities, and restore prosperity. His presidency (which lasted from 1933 to 1945, the longest in U.S. history) was marked by an increased role {{for the federal government}} in addressing the nation's economic and social problems. Work relief programs provided jobs, ambitious projects such as the Tennessee Valley Authority were created to promote economic development, and a social security system was established. The Roosevelt Administration was assisted in its endeavors by progressives in Congress, with the congressional midterm elections of 1934 returning a more radical House of Representatives that was prepared to support progressive, [...] "new liberal" [...] measures.

2500|$|... – A {{representative}} of the African National Congress offered his condolences and presented a wreath at the embassy of the DPRK. Another wreath was sent to Pyongyang. The African National Congress Youth League issued a statement sending its condolences, and stating [...] "As we remember this revolutionary we call upon the Korean people to forge ahead with the struggle to reunify their country, to free it completely of a legacy of Colonialism left to its people by imperialists represented by the United States of America. May the undying spirit of Comrade Kim Jong Il continue to inspire the Korean people to defend the Songhun, {{the idea that it}} is possible for the people of Korea, Asia and the world to live well alongside each other in an egalitarian society, free from poverty, <b>joblessness,</b> hatred of each other and the oppression of one country by another".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, {{economic}} progress by many African Americans and ethnic Americans became unraveled {{in the massive}} job losses caused by restructuring of railroad and meatpacking industries. By the mid-1960s, North Omaha had much more poverty than before and increasing social problems. On July 4, 1966, tensions broke out in a riot {{after a day of}} blistering 103 degree weather. [...] Refusing a police order to disperse, African Americans demolished police cars and attacked the North 24th Street business corridor, throwing firebombs and demolishing storefronts. [...] Businesses in the Near North Side suffered millions of dollars in damages. The riot lasted three days. The National Guard was called in to disperse the rioters. Less than a month later, on August 1, 1966, riots erupted after a 19-year-old was shot by a white off-duty policeman during a burglary. rioters firebombed three buildings and 180 riot police were required to quell the crowds. [...] Leaders in the community criticized the Omaha World-Herald and local television stations for blaming African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods, when the problems of <b>joblessness</b> and decreased maintenance were beyond city and regional control. [...] That same year, 1966, A Time for Burning, a documentary featuring North Omaha and the social problems, was filmed. Later it was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary.|$|E
2500|$|Papen was authoritarian by inclination. Richard J. Evans {{described}} his philosophy as [...] "utopian conservatism" [...] {{due to his}} long-term goal of restoring a modern version of the Ancien Régime. He imposed increasingly stringent censorship on the press and repealed his predecessor's ban on the Sturmabteilung (SA) {{as a way to}} appease the Nazis, whom he hoped to lure into supporting his government. [...] Papen's economic policies, which were all passed by Article 48, were to sharply cut the payments offered by the unemployment insurance fund, subject all jobless Germans seeking unemployment insurance to a very strict means test, had wages drastically lowered (including those reached by collective bargaining) while bringing in very generous tax cuts to corporations and the rich. Papen argued that lowering taxes on the well off and corporations would encourage them to spend and create jobs; that lowering wages would encourage businesses to hire and reducing unemployment insurance would force the jobless (whom Papen often implied were just lazy people who didn't want to work) to find work; and thus alleviate the effects of the Great Depression. As 1932 was the worst year of the Great Depression with <b>joblessness</b> at an all-time high, Papen's economic policies of favoring the rich while punishing the poor enraged ordinary Germans, making him into Germany's most hated man. Papen reveled in his unpopularity and took a great deal of pleasure in taunting and baiting his critics as he enjoyed provoking people. Papen's thesis that lowering wages would make employers more likely to hire and less likely to fire employees was not a popular one as he was widely viewed as engaging in [...] "one-sided catering" [...] to big business.|$|E
