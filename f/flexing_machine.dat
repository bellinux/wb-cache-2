5000|$|Alan Kay, a {{graduate}} student at the University of UTAH, proposes the FLEX language. The <b>FLEX</b> <b>Machine,</b> a computer running the FLEX language is the first attempt to develop an object-oriented programming-based personal computer.|$|R
25|$|<b>Flex</b> <b>machine</b> â€“ The {{hardware}} was {{custom and}} microprogrammable, with an operating system, (modular) compiler, editor, garbage collector and filing system all written in ALGOL 68RS. The command shell Curt {{was designed to}} access typed data similar to Algol-68 modes.|$|R
50|$|RSRE {{also used}} the ALGOL 68RS {{compiler}} for internal projects, including the <b>Flex</b> <b>machine</b> and the ELLA hardware design language. When {{it was decided to}} make ELLA freely available Praxis was commissioned to write an ALGOL 68 to C translator, ctrans, based on the ALGOL 68RS compiler.|$|R
50|$|Ten15 is an algebraically {{specified}} abstract machine. It {{was developed}} by Foster, Currie et al. at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern, Worcestershire, during the 1980s. It arose from earlier work on the <b>Flex</b> <b>machine,</b> which was a capability computer implemented via microcode. Ten15 was intended to offer an intermediate language common to all implementations of the Flex architecture for portability purposes. It had the side effect of making the benefits of that work available on modern processors lacking a microcode facility.|$|R
50|$|Alan Kay, {{a student}} of Evans, {{developed}} object-oriented programming technology, a foundation of current programming systems. At Utah, Kay learned to think of computers as dynamic, interactive personal devices to support creative thought - the founding principle of his work. Kay's Ph.D. thesis (1969) described {{the design of the}} <b>FLEX</b> <b>machine,</b> a flexible, extensible programming language developed in collaboration with Ed Cheadle. Kay dreamed of a device called the Dynabook, a portable electronic device the size of a three-ring notebook with a touch-sensitive liquid crystal screen and a keyboard - precursor to the Apple iPad.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2009, U.S. Ordnance {{was awarded}} a one-time, 20 percent, small {{business}} set-aside, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contract with four ordering periods, under which orders will be placed for the M2 [...]50 caliber <b>Flex</b> <b>machine</b> gun, NSN: 1005-00-322-9715, Part Number: 8401485. The contract number is W52H0909D0249 and delivery order 0001 obligates the one-time, 20 percent small business set-aside guaranteed minimum quantity of (548) M2 machine guns. The grand total maximum ordering quantity over the four ordering periods against all awarded contracts is 40,000 each. Contract Expiration Date is August 31, 2012.|$|R
50|$|One novel {{approach}} to solving this problem {{involves the use}} of an orthogonally persistent operating system. (This was realised in the <b>Flex</b> <b>machine.</b> See Ten15). In such a system, {{there is no need for}} entities to be discarded and their capabilities be invalidated, and hence require an ACL-like mechanism to restore those capabilities at a later time. The operating system maintains the integrity and security of the capabilities contained within all storage, both volatile and nonvolatile, at all times; in part by performing all serialization tasks by itself, rather than requiring user programs to do so, as is the case in most operating systems. Because user programs are relieved of this responsibility, there is no need to trust them to reproduce only legal capabilities, nor to validate requests for access using an access control mechanism.|$|R
2500|$|Pull type chisel plows {{are made}} in working widths from about 2.5 m [...] up to 13.7 m , they are tractor mounted and working depth is {{hydraulically}} controlled. Those more than about 4 m [...] wide may be equipped with folding wings to reduce transport width. Wider machines may have the wings supported by individual wheels and have hinge joints to allow <b>flexing</b> of the <b>machine</b> over uneven ground. The wider models usually have a wheel at each side to control working depth. Three-point hitch mounted units {{are made in}} widths from about 1.5 m [...] to 9 m [...]|$|R
