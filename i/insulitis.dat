We have previously reported that bisphenol A accelerates spontaneous diabetes development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and observed {{in the present study}} that perfluoroundecanoic acid, PFUnDA, increased <b>insulitis</b> development, a prerequisite for diabetes development in NOD mice. We exposed NOD mice to PFUnDA in drinking water (3, 30 and 300  μg/l) at mating, during gestation and lactation and until 30 weeks of age. After 300  μg/l PFUnDA exposure, we report (i) increased pancreatic <b>insulitis,</b> (ii) increased number of apoptotic cells in pancreatic islets prior to <b>insulitis</b> and (iii) decreased phagocytosis in peritoneal macrophages.

Pancreas samples removed post-mortem from 29 patients (mean age 11 · 7 years) with recent-onset T 1 D were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The cell types constituting the inflammatory infiltrate within islets (<b>insulitis)</b> were determined in parallel with islet insulin content. CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells were the most abundant population during <b>insulitis.</b> Macrophages (CD 68 +) were also present during both early and later <b>insulitis,</b> although in fewer numbers. CD 20 + cells were present in only small numbers in early <b>insulitis</b> but were recruited to islets as beta cell death progressed.

Forkhead box protein P 3 + regulatory T cells were detected in the islets of only a single patient. Natural killer cells were detected rarely, even in heavily inflamed islets. The results suggest a defined sequence of immune cell recruitment in human T 1 D. They imply that both CD 8 + cytotoxic cells and macrophages may contribute to beta cell death during early <b>insulitis.</b> CD 20 + cells are recruited in greatest numbers during late <b>insulitis,</b> suggesting an increasing role for these cells as <b>insulitis</b> develops.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{contributing to}} the development of autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have been analyzed in allophenic mouse chimeras of the NOD in equilibrium with C 57 BL/ 6 strain combination (where NOD is nonobese diabetic). Occurrence of lymphoid cell infiltration (<b>insulitis)</b> in pancreatic islets was observed in the majority of such chimeras. The development of <b>insulitis</b> was found to correlate with major histocompatibility complex chimerism in lymphoid cells and in thymus cortical regions. Chimeras with more than 50 % of C 57 BL/ 6 lymphoid cells rarely developed <b>insulitis.</b> Our data suggest that the correlation with the thymic cortical region is absolute. Thus, all individuals displaying NOD or NOD/C 57 BL/ 6 thymic cortical regions developed <b>insulitis,</b> whereas we have not observed <b>insulitis</b> in chimeras with only C 57 BL/ 6 thymic cortical regions.

40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{of the development of}} diabetes and <b>insulitis</b> has been performed in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain, a model of insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus. (NOD X C 57 BL/ 10) F 1, F 2, and (F 1 X NOD) first-, second-, and third-backcross generations were studied. The data obtained were consistent with the hypothesis that diabetes is controlled by at least three functionally recessive diabetogenic genes, or gene complexes, one of which is linked to the MHC of the NOD. In contrast, pancreatic inflammation leading to <b>insulitis</b> was found to be controlled by a single incompletely dominant gene. One of the two diabetogenic loci that is not linked to the MHC appears to be essential for the development of severe <b>insulitis.</b> This diabetogenic gene may be identical to the gene that controls the initiation of the autoimmune response that progresses to <b>insulitis.</b> Although this gene appears to be functionally recessive in its control of diabetes, it is incompletely dominant in its control of <b>insulitis.</b> The MHC-linked diabetogenic gene, although not required for the development of <b>insulitis,</b> apparently influences the progression of the autoimmune response since NOD MHC homozygotes in the backcross generations displayed the highest incidence and most severe cases of <b>insulitis.</b> Interestingly, we have found two MHC heterozygous backcross females that have become diabetic, suggesting that either the MHC- linked diabetogenic gene is not strictly recessive or that a recombination event has occurred between the diabetogenic gene and the K or I-A regions of the MHC. The third diabetogenic locus appears to influence the progression of severe <b>insulitis</b> to overt diabetes.

40|$|Insulin-dependent (type 1) {{diabetes}} mellitus is a metabolic disease with a complex multifactorial etiology and a poorly understood pathogenesis.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that an insulin 2 gene knockout, when bred onto nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, accelerates diabetes. We produced insulin 1 gene knockout congenic NOD mice. In contrast to insulin 2, diabetes and <b>insulitis</b> were markedly reduced in insulin 1 knockout mice, with decreased and delayed diabetes in heterozygous females and no <b>insulitis</b> and diabetes in most homozygous female mice. Lack of <b>insulitis</b> was found for insulin 1 female homozygous knockout mice at 8, 12, and 37 weeks of age. Despite a lack of <b>insulitis,</b> insulin 1 homozygous knockout mice spontaneously expressed insulin autoantibodies. Administration of insulin peptide B: 9 - 23 of both insulin 1 and 2 to NOD mice induced insulin autoantibodies. Insulin 1 is not the only lymphocytic target of NOD mice. Insulin 1 homozygous knockout islets, when transplanted into recently diabetic wild-type NOD mice, became infiltrated with lymphocytes and only transiently reversed diabetes. These observations indicate that loss of either insulin gene can influence progression to diabetes of NOD mice and suggest that the preproinsulin 1 gene is crucial for the spontaneous development of NOD <b>insulitis</b> and diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class II genes {{are important in}} the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) both in the mouse and in man. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, {{which is a good}} model for human IDDM, has a particular MHC class II with an A complex consisting of A alpha d and the unique A beta g 7 chain, as well as an absent E molecule due to a deletion in the Ea promoter region. Transgenic insertion of a functional Ea gene protects against <b>insulitis</b> and diabetes, but when the transgene expression is restricted to certain compartments of the immune system by deleting parts of the promoter region, the protection against <b>insulitis</b> is disrupted. We have analysed three promoter-mutated lines where one lacks expression on B cells and has a reduced expression on approximately 1 / 3 of the dendritic cells and macrophages (Sma), one lacks thymic cortical expression and has a slightly reduced B-cell expression (delta X), and one lacks expression in the thymic medulla, on macrophages, dendritic cells and about half of the B cells (delta Y). None of these lines is protected against <b>insulitis,</b> but Sma and delta X display a reduced intensity of <b>insulitis,</b> with an average of 10 - 15 % of the islets infiltrated in each mouse, while delta Y resembles non-transgenic mice with 30 - 35 % infiltrated islets. Bone-marrow chimeras between Sma and delta Y mice demonstrate that peripheral cells of Sma origin reduce <b>insulitis</b> significantly when developed in the delta Y host, while <b>insulitis</b> is enhanced when delta Y bone marrow is given to Sma mice.

40|$|The BioBreeding/Worcester (BB/Wor) rat {{develops}} a spontaneous disorder that closely resembles human insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes mellitus. The syndrome is preceded by lymphocytic <b>insulitis</b> that destroys pancreatic beta cells. The morphologic {{features of the}} spontaneous <b>insulitis</b> lesions are also observed within islets transplanted beneath the renal capsule of diabetes-prone and diabetic animals. This study reports the results of experiments in which immunohistochemical techniques were used to characterize the phenotype of the infiltrating mononuclear cells and detect the expression of class I and class II MHC antigens in native islets and islet transplants in diabetic and diabetes-prone BB/Wor rats. The infiltrates within native pancreatic islets and islet grafts were comprised predominantly of Ia+ cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) CD 4 + cells (helper/inducer lymphocytes and macrophages), CD 5 + (pan-T) cells and smaller numbers of CD 8 + (cytotoxic/suppressor and NK) cells. Pancreatic and graft <b>insulitis</b> were accompanied by markedly enhanced class I antigen expression on islet and exocrine cells. Class II (Ia) antigens were not detected on normal islet cells, islets undergoing <b>insulitis</b> or on islet transplants subjected to immune attack. In islet grafts stained with polymorphic MAbs that distinguish Ia antigens of donor and host origin, Ia antigen expression was limited to infiltrating dendritic cells and macrophages of host origin. It is concluded that the phenotypes of infiltrating mononuclear cells that comprise the <b>insulitis</b> lesion in spontaneous BB/Wor diabetes, and the inflammatory attack on islets transplanted into diabetic BB/Wor rats are the same, that pancreatic islet and graft <b>insulitis</b> occur {{in the presence of}} enhanced class I antigen expression but in the absence of class II antigen expression, and that infiltrating Ia+ cells within islet grafts are exclusively of recipient (BB/Wor) origin and may explain the initiation of immune <b>insulitis</b> within grafts derived from donors of incompatible MHC...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the frequency of individuals with type 2 diabetes fulfilling these criteria with reference to non-diabetic and type 1 diabetic individuals. Methods <b>Insulitis</b> was determined by examining CD 45 (+) cells in the pancreases of 50, 13 and 44 organ donors with type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes and no diabetes, respectively. CD 3 (+) cells (T cells) infiltrating the islets were evaluated in insulitic donors. In insulitic donors with type 2 diabetes, the pancreases were characterised according to the presence of CD 68 (macrophages), myeloperoxidase (MPO; neutrophils), CD 3, CD 20 (B cells) and HLA class I hyperstained islets. In all type 2 diabetic donors, potential correlations of <b>insulitis</b> with dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro or age, BMI, HbA(1 c) or autoantibody positivity were examined. Results Overall, 28 % of the type 2 diabetic donors fulfilled {{the consensus}} criteria for <b>insulitis</b> developed for type 1 diabetes. Of the type 1 diabetic donors, 31 % fulfilled the criteria. None of the non-diabetic donors met the criteria. Only type 1 diabetic donors had >= 15 CD 3 (+) cells in >= 3 islets. Type 2 diabetic donors with <b>insulitis</b> also had a substantial number of CD 45 (+) cells in the exocrine parenchyma. Macrophages constituted the largest fraction of CD 45 (+) cells, followed by neutrophils and T cells. Of type 2 diabetic pancreases with <b>insulitis,</b> 36 % contained islets that hyperstained for HLA class I. Isolated islets from type 2 diabetic donors secreted less insulin than controls, although with preserved dynamics. <b>Insulitis</b> in the type 2 diabetic donors did not correlate with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the presence of autoantibodies, BMI or HbA(1 c). Conclusions/interpretation The current definition of <b>insulitis</b> cannot be used to distinguish pancreases retrieved from individuals with type 1 diabetes from those with type 2 diabetes.

40|$|One {{striking}} {{feature of}} spontaneous autoimmune diabetes is the prototypic formation of lymphoid follicular structures within the pancreas.

To explore the potential role of LT-mediated microenvironment in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), an LT � receptor–immunoglobulin fusion protein (LT�R–Ig) was administered to nonobese diabetic mice. Early treatment with LT�R–Ig prevented <b>insulitis</b> and IDDM, suggesting that LT plays a critical role in the <b>insulitis</b> development. LT�R–Ig treatment at a late stage of the disease also dramatically reversed <b>insulitis</b> and prevented diabetes. Moreover, LT�R–Ig treatment prevented the development of IDDM by diabetogenic T cells in an adoptive transfer model.

40|$|Mice {{bearing a}} tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) alpha transgene controlled by an insulin promoter developed an increasingly severe lymphocytic <b>insulitis,</b> apparently {{resulting from the}} induction of endothelial changes with features similar to those observed in other places of intense lymphocytic traffic. This was accompanied by dissociation of the endocrine tissue (without marked decrease in its total mass), islet fibrosis, {{and the development of}} intraislet ductules containing, by places, beta cells in their walls, suggesting a regenerative capacity. Islet disorganization and fibrosis did not result from lymphocytic infiltration, since they were also observed in SCID mice bearing the transgene. Diabetes never developed, even though a number of potentially inducing conditions were used, including the prolonged perfusion of interferon gamma and the permanent expression of a nontolerogenic viral protein on beta cells (obtained by using mice bearing two transgenes). It is concluded that (a) a slow process of TNF release in pancreatic islets induces <b>insulitis,</b> and may be instrumental in the <b>insulitis</b> resulting from local cell-mediated immune reactions, but (b) that <b>insulitis</b> per se is not diabetogenic, lymphocyte stimulation by cells other than beta cells being necessary to trigger extensive beta cell damage.

The degree of <b>insulitis</b> was more severe and the plasma glucose levels were higher in SZ-treated mice than in SZ-treated mice with LDV infection. Severe degenerative and necrotic changes of cells with mononuclear cell infiltration into the islets were seen in the SZ-treated mice.

Besides glucose-lowering action, there is increasingly interest in the potential anti-inflammatory action of this drug. In the present study, we investigated the actions of metformin on experimental <b>insulitis</b> using STZ-induced diabetic mice. Methods Mice with acute diabetes induced by STZ were administered metformin by gavage. Changes of blood glucose and body weight, and the daily amount of food and water intake were measured. Pancreatic tissues were collected for histologic analyses. Pathological assessment and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to determine the effect of metformin on <b>insulitis.</b> Inflammatory cytokines in the pancreas and insulin levels were measured through ELISA analysis. Results Metformin significantly reduced blood glucose levels and improved aberrant water intake behavior in experimental diabetic mice. No significant differences were observed in terms of body weight and food intake behavior in metformin-treated animals. In the STZ-induced model of diabetes, we found the appearance of pronounced <b>insulitis.</b> However, metformin administration reduced the severity of <b>insulitis</b> assessed by blind pathological scoring. In addition, metformin treatment improved insulin levels in experimental diabetic mice. ELISA assay revealed decreased levels of inflammatory response marker IL- 1 β and TNF-α in the pancreatic tissues following metformin treatment.

Ten ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) and 15 female NOD mice at 4 weeks of age were used. Mice were assigned to ICR and NOD groups, and NOD mice were randomly divided to control and NCT-treated groups. NCT was administered to mice orally as a solution and in a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight a day {{from the age of}} 4 to 8 weeks. Diabetes onset was 18 weeks of age in control group, and 22 weeks of age in NCT-treated group. Cumulative incidences of diabetes at 25 weeks of age in control and NCT-treated NOD mice were 63 and 29 %, respectively. <b>Insulitis</b> occurred in all NOD mice. Incidence of <b>insulitis</b> in total islets was decreased by NCT treatment in diabetic NOD mice, but intensity of <b>insulitis</b> was not improved by NCT treatment.

At day 100, 16 control mice receiving the treatment vehicle (arachis oil) had an incidence of <b>insulitis</b> of 75 %, whereas only 41 % of the 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated animals developed <b>insulitis</b> (P < 0. 025). Calcemia, determined 24 h after the last 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 injection was 2. 5 +/- 0. 1 mM, which was higher than in control animals (2. 3 +/- 0. 1 mM), but was well tolerated. Cellular immunity, as assessed with the mixed lymphocyte reaction performed at day 100, was not impaired significantly. This study demonstrates that long-term treatment with high doses of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 is able to decrease the incidence of <b>insulitis</b> in spontaneous autoimmune diabetes without major side effects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{examined}} the effect of systemic administration of T helper (Th) 2 cytokines on reovirus type- 2 (Reo- 2) -triggered Th 1 -mediated autoimmune <b>insulitis</b> with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in DBA/ 1 J suckling mice. We have demonstrated clearly that the systemic administration of both interleukin (IL) - 4 -expressing plasmid DNA (pIL- 4) and recombinant IL- 4 (rIL- 4) inhibited the development of <b>insulitis</b> with IGT in a dose dependent manner as compared to untreated groups in Reo- 2 -infected DBA/ 1 J suckling mice. The inhibitory effects of IL- 4 {{on the development of}} <b>insulitis</b> with IGT and the advantages of pIL- 4 as compared to rIL- 4 in this model are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} induced in susceptible {{strains of}} mice by multiple, low-dose streptozotocin treatment {{has been proposed}} to entail a thymus-dependent, autoimmune destruction of beta cells. In this study, thymectomized and genetically athymic mice have been tested for susceptibility to streptozotocin. Thymectomy was performed on newborn (day 1) to 3 -day-old C 57 BL/KsJ mice. At 8 wk of age, thymectomized and sham-operated mice of both sexes were tested for susceptibility to diabetes induction by multiple, low-dose streptozotocin treatment (35 mg/kg of body weight per day for 6 consecutive days). Thymectomy failed to block susceptibility of males to induction of severe hyperglycemia. Beta cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates (<b>insulitis)</b> were consistent histopathological features. In general, females—both thymus-intact and thymectomized—were less susceptible than males to streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia, and females exhibited an equally severe <b>insulitis</b> by experimental day 14; thus, the detection of an underlying <b>insulitis</b> did not predict {{the development of a}} more severe hyperglycemia because most streptozotocin-treated females at experimental day 35 continued to show only a modest hyperglycemia (about 200 mg/dl) compared to males (> 400 mg/dl). That streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia could occur {{in the absence of an}} intact thymus was further demonstrated in genetically athymic C 57 BL/ 6 J NIcrOu nu/nu males and thymus-intact +/? littermate controls. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were resistant to streptozotocin-induced <b>insulitis.</b> This study shows that the presence of <b>insulitis</b> does not necessarily presage onset of severe hyperglycemia (e. g., C 57 BL/KsJ females), and conversely, the presence of severe hyperglycemia after low-dose streptozotocin treatment is not necessarily diagnostic of an underlying <b>insulitis</b> (e. g., C 57 BL/ 6 J +/? and nu/nu males). These data stress the need for caution in the interpretation of studies of streptozotocin-insulitis sensitivities of nude mice...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} pancreas biopsy specimens from 18 {{newly diagnosed}} insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients to elucidate the mechanism underlying beta cell destruction. Pancreas islets {{were seen in}} all patients and <b>insulitis</b> in eight patients. Infiltrating mononuclear cells consisted of CD 4 +T, CD 8 +T, B lymphocytes, and macrophages. Among them, CD 8 +T lymphocytes were predominant and macrophages followed. The expression of MHC class I antigens was increased in islet and endothelial cells in nine patients. MHC class II expression was increased in endothelial cells of the same patients. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 was increased in endothelial cells {{in two of the}} nine patients with MHC hyperexpression; in one of them, lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 3 expression was also increased. Out of the eight patients with <b>insulitis,</b> seven showed MHC class I hyper-expression, whereas 2 of the 10 patients without <b>insulitis</b> showed the phenomenon (P < 0. 05). The relation between <b>insulitis</b> and the hyperexpression of adhesion molecules was not evident. In conclusion, we revealed the close relation between CD 8 +T lymphocyte-predominant <b>insulitis</b> and MHC class I hyperexpression in islet cells. This suggests that infiltrating CD 8 +T lymphocytes recognize islet autoantigens in association with increased MHC class I molecules and act as major effector cells in autoimmune response against islet cells in IDDM pancreases. The role of adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of IDDM still remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Reovirus type 2 (Reo- 2) {{infection}} in DBA/ 1 suckling mice causes <b>insulitis,</b> {{which leads to}} pancreatic islet-cell destruction,resulting in a diabetes–like syndrome. T-helper (Th) 1 cytokines are thought to {{play a key role}} in islet inflammation in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We examined this hypothesis in the Reo- 2 -induced diabetes–like syndrome. We used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR techniques to examine mRNA expression of interferon (IFN) -γ (Th 1 type cytokine), and interleukin (IL) - 4 (Th 2 type cytokine) in splenic cells. We observed that in Reo- 2 infected mice the level of IFN-γ expression increases with the development of <b>insulitis,</b> whereas expression of message for IL- 4 is minimal to detectable with the immuno-inflammatory process 10 days after infection. The treatment of monoclonal antibody (mAb) against mouse IFN-γ during the expansion phase of <b>insulitis</b> (5 – 9 days after infection) inhibited the development of <b>insulitis</b> and the elevation of blood glucose concentrations in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore altered CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio compared with uninfected mice in the splenic cells by the infection was recovered to the ratio of uninfected mice by the treatment of mAb against mouse IFN-γ, suggesting normalization of T cell balance in immune system. These results suggest that Reo- 2 -triggered autoimmune <b>insulitis</b> may be mediated by Th 1 lymphocytes and IFN-γ may play a role in islet inflammation leading to islet cell destruction...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether BCG, lymphtoxin (LT) or bee venom (BV) can prevent <b>insulitis</b> {{and development of}} diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, we measured the degree of <b>insulitis</b> and incidence of diabetes in 24 ICR and 96 female NOD mice. NOD mice {{were randomly assigned to}} control, BCG-, LT-, and BV-treated groups. The BCG was given once at 6 weeks of age, and LT was given in 3 weekly doses from the age of 4 to 10 weeks. The BV was injected in 2 weekly doses from the age of 4 to 10 weeks. Diabetes started in control group at 18 weeks of age, in BCG group at 24 weeks of age, and in LT- or BV-treated group at 23 weeks of age. Cumulative incidences of diabetes at 25 weeks of age in control, BCG-, LT-, and BV-treated NOD mice are 58, 17, 25, and 21 %, respectively. Incidence and severity of <b>insulitis</b> were reduced by BCG, LT and BV treatment. In conclusion, these results suggest that BCG, LT or BV treatment in NOD mice at early age inhibit <b>insulitis,</b> onset and cumulative incidence of diabetes...|$|E
