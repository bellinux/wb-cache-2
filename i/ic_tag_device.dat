30|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{is known}} in the commercial sectors. Passive or semi-passive <b>tag</b> <b>devices</b> are used in RFID to modulate the radiated RF carrier signals in the wave propagation channel, in which the reader can demodulate the tag’s specific data [1]. The wireless communication approach avoids using an active transmitter in the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> for power and space savings. By including a sensory data source in the <b>tag</b> <b>device,</b> real-time sensing and data transmission become feasible for applications in the wireless sensor network (WSN) [2 – 4]. An innovative implementation is for data-intensive applications such as video streaming using the semi-passive devices. The importance is that the power associated with the transmitter task can be eliminated from the <b>tag</b> <b>device.</b> This permits cost, space, and power saving for semi-passive devices for guaranteed longevity with the available power resources. It is also possible to use the ambient signals from radio stations for the backscatter communications; the ambient signals are used to illuminate the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> instead of the reader’s transmitter [5 – 7]. Considering high data rate communication for data-intensive applications, we target hardening the communication channel with a semi-passive <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> in the multipath fading channels.|$|R

40|$|Government {{and local}} {{government}} have to hurry up to build accessible facilities for elderly people and people who has disabilities. Because our country is experiencing an aging society, for example, pedestrian space should be safe and give a relief. However, {{it is difficult for}} everyone to easily know the route from the present place to a destination safety and relief at ease. One of the methods to solve those problems is to obtain absolute position with high accuracy. Therefore, we suggested here to make Universal Map (UM) with a large scale by using REAL TIME GIS with mobile mapping. And, it is the map including recent information for enabling people to understand the condition of absolute positions. The purpose of the research was to confirm whether absolute positions can be obtained accurately in mobile mapping. For the purpose of the study, the experiment was performed on our campus at Kanazawa district in Japan by using a D-GPS and a VRS-GPS. The experiment was performed by moving in the campus by a wheelchair to which a GPS antenna has been attached. As a result, it became clear that any experiment fields could not receive accurate data. To solve these problems, we adopted <b>IC</b> <b>tags</b> which are new ubiquitous technology to help people with disabilities. With the powerful advantage of <b>IC</b> <b>tags</b> one can receive data without any contact anytime, anywhere. For a solution, it is recommended that the UM be made by the REAL TIME GIS and <b>IC</b> <b>tags.</b> * Corresponding author...|$|R

30|$|An un-coded multi-transmitter query {{scheme is}} {{introduced}} for wireless backscatter communication systems in which M transmitters and N receivers {{are used for}} single-tag connectivity (M[*]×[*] 1 [*]×[*]N). The main idea is to harden the wireless communication channel with a <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> for high data rate readings. The proposed method is designed for multipath fading channels in which the backscatter channel is a multiplicative Rayleigh. A coherent transmit query scheme is used to increase the tag-reflected signals and simultaneously alter the fading statistics in the forward path by implementing a receiver feedback. Full-diversity performance and array gain is achieved using the receiver diversity without requiring any tag antenna diversity. Therefore, the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> remains simple.|$|R

30|$|Backscatter {{communication}} is a radar {{approach that is}} different from one-way wireless communication in which the wave propagation channel observes two distinct paths. In the forward path, the RF carrier is emitted from the transmitter and has no information. In the return path, the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> modulates the <b>tag’s</b> antenna impedance that appeared as a variable radar cross section (RCS) [8]. The backward channel includes the tag-specific information in the form of amplitude or phase modulation of the radiated carrier. The remote receiver decodes the tag antenna reflections and extracts the tag’s data [9]. The modulation level is determined by the number of the loads used in the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> for switching among [10]. Thus, ultra-low power tag becomes feasible thanks to using an ultra-low power switch device instead of an active transmitter with the power-hungry frontend. The communication link performance can be calculated using Radar equations.|$|R

30|$|Using {{multiple}} transmitters {{does not}} influence the statistics of the multiplicative channels [11, 17, 18], because the underlying {{assumption is that}} the transmitter is not the information source. The only achievement with using multiple transmitter schemes is a reduced spatial correlation distance by increasing the AoAs. The multi-transmitting effect in backscatter communication has been studied in [19, 20] as a unitary query method of transmission with tag-specific space-time coding (STC). This method is a breakthrough and provides a significant gain by using time diversity in the forward channel besides the spatial diversity (STC coding) in the backward channel and outperforms the uniform query method of transmission. The drawback is the increased tag complexity and power consumption {{in addition to the}} sophisticated transmitter scheme that should be operated in a synchronous manner with the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> for improved performance. Another form of the multi-transmitting scheme is conducted in [21, 22], where multi-sin transmitting scheme (frequency diversity) is used to transfer more power to the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> to achieve better performance in the reading range.|$|R
30|$|A {{coherent}} query {{scheme is}} proposed for backscatter wireless communication with a single-tag device in a Rayleigh multipath channel. The proposed method uses the receiver feedback for providing appropriate phase {{information in the}} query end and thus spatial wave focusing in the tag antenna. Using the proposed method, the multiplicative Rayleigh fading channel statistics is altered in favor of BER. An analytical approach is used to derive the fading channel statistics, and Monte-Carlo numerical simulations confirm the results. The BER performance is calculated numerically for M- transmitter scheme with the channel feedback. The provided method shifts the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> complexity to the transmitter side in which a moderate complexity is acceptable. The approach is validated experimentally by using SDR implementations. Two transmitters in the query end are synchronized by using a common clock distributor network, and feedback from one receiver is used to control the phase difference between the transmitter carrier signals. Details of system implementation using MATLAB Simulink are provided, and the backscatter communication with a data-intensive <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> is demonstrated. Measurements show coherent summation of the transmitted signal in the tag location, using the coherent query scheme, that results improved data connectivity in multipath channels.|$|R
