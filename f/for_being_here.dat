5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

6000|$|... 'How I fought through it, I don't know,' said Bounderby. 'I was {{determined}}, I suppose. I {{have been}} a determined character in later life, and I suppose I was then. Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody to thank <b>for</b> my <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> but myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am doing}} {{nothing of the}} kind," [...] said Clara. [...] "How can you speak in that way to me so soon after my father's death? It is a rebuke to me <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|He had {{certainly}} brought {{himself to the}} point, but he seemed actually further from it than at first, {{and he made a}} desperate plunge, trying {{at the same time to}} keep something of his habitual nonchalance. [...] "But that doesn't account <b>for</b> my <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> Imogene accounts <b>for</b> that. She has allowed me to stay in Florence." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{stood there}} a moment in dumb consternation. What did the fellow intend? What was going on below? If Benson was a traitor, how could I {{know that there were}} not other traitors among us? I cursed myself for my folly in going out upon the deck, and then this thought {{suggested}} another--a hideous one: who was it that had really been responsible <b>for</b> my <b>being</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{matter who}} is with me. He has the {{authority}} of my commands <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> whoever he may be, while you are here in opposition to them. You know me well enough, Joel, to understand nothing but the simple truth will satisfy me." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{he cursed}} {{himself for a}} fool and a coward, not to have gone away--abroad--long ere such a {{possible}} confrontation threatened him.

6000|$|... "I hate waiting. I do not {{see what}} good it will do. Besides, I don't mean to say {{anything}} about that,--not to-day, at least. I don't indeed. As <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> and not seeing her, that is out of the question. Of course she would think that I had quarrelled with her, and that I meant to take everything to myself, now that I have the power." ...|$|E

"I {{have always}} liked them," [...] he answered, [...] "but now I am angry with them <b>for</b> <b>being</b> soft. <b>Here</b> is my station," [...] he added, {{as the train}} slowed down, and he {{commenced}} to gather his belongings together.

5000|$|My {{mother is}} {{probably}} sort of disappointed at how I turned out, but she doesn't show it. She came by today and {{brought me a}} satin and velvet quilt. I'm surprised I was able to detox without it. I was nervous about seeing her, but it went okay. She thinks I blame her <b>for</b> my <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> I mainly blame my dealer, my doctor, and myself, and not necessarily in that order. ... She washed my underwear and left.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think there}} {{could hardly be}} a more {{appropriate}} time <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> Mr. Hartington; one could have no better time for studying social problems than the present when conventionalities {{have gone to the}} winds and one sees people as they are; but this is hardly the place to talk.

6000|$|... "Aside {{from seeing}} you, {{which is my}} {{principal}} reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> and satisfying myself that I can transport inanimate things from Mars to Earth, and therefore animate things if I so desire, I have no purpose. Earth is not for me. My every interest is upon Barsoom--my wife, my children, my work; all are there. I will spend a quiet evening with you {{and then back to}} the world I love even better than I love life." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{trust that}} you will pardon me <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> I {{do not wish to}} force my {{thoughts}} upon you, but I feel forced myself. Little as I know of Captain Brown, I would fain do my part to correct the tone and the statements of the newspapers, and of my countrymen generally, respecting his character and actions. It costs us nothing to be just. We can at least express our sympathy with, and admiration of, him and his companions, and that is what I now propose to do.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't think {{me a great}} brute <b>for</b> not <b>being</b> <b>here</b> {{to receive}} you," [...] he said, as he clasped his hand. [...] "I was writing an {{important}} letter and I put it to myself in this way: 'If I interrupt my letter I shall {{have to come back}} and finish it; whereas if I finish it now, I can have {{all the rest of the}} day to spend with him.'

6000|$|... ‘I am so sorry,’ she said: ‘I {{dared not}} bring on {{anything}} more. We {{are so small}} a family, and my aunt keeps such an eye upon the servants. I have put some whisky in the milk—it is more wholesome so—and with eggs {{you will be able}} to make something of a meal. How many eggs will you be wanting to that milk? for I must be taking the others to my aunt—that is my excuse <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> I should think three or four.

6000|$|... "Not {{political}} information," [...] Mr. Draconmeyer declared, {{his eyes}} blinking behind his glasses. [...] "For that I certainly should {{not come to}} you.

Are you here in Monte Carlo to look after your wife, or in search of change of air and scene?

[...] "But <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> to guide this fine resistance and lend you the little aid I can---- No, no, I have no misgiving for that. It is the dearest frolic ever my soldiering led me into. I came to Roccaleone with a message of warning; but underneath, deep down in my heart, I bore the hope that mine should be more than a messenger's part; that mine it might be to remain by you and do such work as I am doing." ...|$|E
50|$|Children {{from all}} over Scotland and a few {{from other parts of}} the UK {{attended}} here, and all were funded by their local authorities.

The first person I have to thank is of course my advisor John Preskill. He has put together the amazing place that is IQI, with its constant flux of visitors, postdocs and students, offering me an invaluable chance to meet so many talented people in the field.

Though great lines of railway {{traverse}} it, the trains leave it behind, and go puffing off to Paris and the South, to Belgium and Germany, to the Northern Sea-Coast of France, and to England, and merely smoke it a little in passing. Then I don't know it, {{and that is a}} good reason for being here; and I can't pronounce half the long queer names I see inscribed over the shops, and that is another good reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> since I surely ought to learn how.' In short, I was 'here,' and I wanted an excuse for not going away from here, and I made it to my satisfaction, and stayed here.|$|E

He does not like our milk-and-water style of robbing. He is an out-and-out pirate in heart, and has long desired to cut my throat. I have to thank him <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> to-night. Some of the crew who are like himself seized me while I was asleep, bound and gagged me, put me into a boat and rowed me ashore;--for we had easily escaped the Talisman in the squall, and doubling or our course came back here. The mate was anxious to clear off old scores by cutting my throat at once and pitching me into the sea. Luckily some of the men, not so bloodthirsty as he, objected to this, so I was landed and cast loose." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Jack! {{and it is}} come to this: and {{all from}} the indulgence of his five senses, plus 'the sixth sense of vanity.' His only {{recreation}} save eating is being led about by the mulatto turnkey, the one human being with whom he, dimly understanding what is fit for him, will at all consort; and having wild pines thrown down {{to him from the}} Poui tree above by the spider monkey, whose gambols he watches with pardonable envy. Like the great Mr. Barry Lyndon (the acutest sketch of human nature dear Thackeray ever made), he cannot understand why the world is so unjust and foolish as to have taken a prejudice against him. After all, he is nothing but a strong nasty brute; and his only reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> is that he is a new and undescribed species, never seen before, and, it is to be hoped, never to be seen again.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2007 Huckabee said, [...] "We {{need to make}} {{it clear}} that we will say no to amnesty, and no to {{sanctuary}} cities, and no to the idea that there can be some complete ignoring of the fact that our laws have been broken." [...] In February 2007, Huckabee had stated, [...] "We shouldn't have amnesty where we just say, [...] "Fine, everybody's good, we're going to let it go." [...] We should have a process where people can pay the penalties, step up and accept responsibility <b>for</b> not <b>being</b> <b>here</b> legally. But here's the point. The objective is not to be punitive. The objective is to make things right. Right for us. Right for them." [...] Huckabee said it's irrational to deport twelve million people and supported a pathway to citizenship.|$|R
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come up with a good reason <b>for</b> him <b>being</b> <b>here</b> other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|R
5000|$|Miró {{talked about}} this work: Some people cried a little because these works could provide incomes. But {{it had to be}} like this.

I did not go to the official opening of the exhibition. I was in Barcelona, but at the last moment I announced that I would not go <b>for</b> not <b>being</b> <b>here</b> with the authorities. But I was here for young architects, and at three in the morning, when there was no one, it wasn't a sidewalk show, I was painting on the street.
