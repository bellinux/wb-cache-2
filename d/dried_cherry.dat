40|$|Samples {{of three}} types of honey: polyfloral (PH), linden (LH) and acacia (AH,) without and with {{addition}} of <b>dried</b> <b>cherries</b> (40 %) were analyzed before and {{after three months of}} storage. The total phenol (TPh), flavonoid (TFd) and anthocyanin (TAn) contents, antioxidant activities and sensory properties of honeys with and without the addition of <b>dry</b> <b>cherries</b> were evaluated. TPh and TFd increased with addition of <b>dried</b> <b>cherries</b> to the honey, while enriched honeys showed high TAn. The LH sample with <b>dried</b> <b>cherries</b> showed the highest anthocyanins content (41. 41 mgCGE/ 100 g). The antioxidant activity increased with addition of <b>dried</b> <b>cherries</b> in honey in the DPPH• test and reducing power. The PH and enriched PH exibited the best antiradical activity compared to LH and AH. The EC 50 DPPH values were: 23. 81 for PH and 24. 19 mg/mL for PH, while the EC 50 DPPH were: 1. 16 mg/mL for PH 40 and 1. 18 mg/mL for PH 40 s. RP 0. 5 values were: 57. 00 mg/mL for PH 40 and 56. 00 mg/ml for PH 40 s, while RP 0. 5 were: 15. 05 mg/mL for PH 40 and 15. 18 mg/mL for PH 40 s.

40|$|Vegetable flavour is {{a quality}} {{characteristic}} for consumer acceptability. Sun and air are traditionally used for drying tomatoes; however, the optimal combination of {{techniques such as}} osmotic dehydration or microwave-assisted air-drying could lead to high quality self-stable products. The aim {{of this paper was}} to study the influence of different process variables on the volatile profile of dehydrated cherry tomato halves. The analysed variables were: air-drying temperature (40 and 55 °C), microwave power (0 and 1 W/g) and previous osmotic dehydration with a 55 Brix binary sucrose solution at 30 °C for 120 min (OD 1) or ternary solution of 27. 5 % sucrose + 10 % NaCl (w/w) at 40 °C for 60 min (OD 2). Twenty major volatile compounds were identified in fresh tomatoes. Among them, 2 -isobutylthiazole and 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one stand out as impact volatile compounds. Dehydration modified the volatile profile, mainly due to the changes induced in some typical fresh-like tomato compounds, but also due to the generation of five new compounds: 1 -butanol, 2 -methyl- 2 -butenal, 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone, furfural, acetonitrile, related to Maillard reactions, and the catabolism of carotenoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

40|$|Different {{sour cherry}} cultivars are grown in Latvia {{suitable}} both for fresh market and for processing. Fresh local sour cherry fruits {{are available for}} consumers only in July. Sour cherries are favourite fruits because of pleasant taste, juicy flesh and attractive dark red color. Fruits are rich in natural antioxidants – vitamins and polyphenols, but are low in calories. One of processing methods preserving valuable nutrients in products in significant quantities is drying. <b>Dried</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits or candied fruits {{can be used as}} energetic delicacy and healthy goody. It is a great alternative for people liking sweets and caring for their health. A priority of dried fruits is their long keeping time, as well as their use in preparing other dishes. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate suitability of sour cherry cultivars grown in Latvia for production of candied fruits. Five sour cherry cultivars were chosen: ‘Bulatnikovskaya’, ‘Orlica’, ‘Shokoladnica’, ‘Tamaris ’ and ‘Zentenes’. To evaluate suitability of sour cherry cultivars for drying, candied fruits and syrup, sensory estimation establishing the level of liking was performed and biochemical parameters: content of soluble solids, total acids and phenolic compounds were determined. As a result of the study it was found that higher level of liking had candied fruits and syrup made from the cultivar ‘Shokoladnica’, regardless of their higher acidity. On the other side, the highest content of polyphenols was ascertained in candied fruits of the cultivar ‘Orlica ’ and their by-product, while the highest content of soluble solids was found in candied fruits and syrup made from the cultivar ‘Bulatnikovskaya’.

40|$|Meat lipid {{oxidation}} causes negative quality effects, {{especially in}} further processed products. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and rosemary extract (RM) are common antioxidants, but plant-based tannin compounds {{have been shown}} to be effective antioxidants. The objective was to evaluate antioxidant effectiveness, pH, color, and sensory effects of several tannin sources. In study 1, 19 percent fat ground beef was mixed with no treatment (control), BHA/BHT (0. 02 percent), RM (0. 2 percent), or 0. 25 percent or 0. 5 percent powders of Chardonnay grapeseed (CG), Norton grapeseed (NG), CitruSmart (CS), or <b>dried</b> <b>cherry</b> (CP). Raw and cooked patties were aerobically stored for 0 to 5 days at 4 degrees C. Cooked patties were analyzed using the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) method. Raw patties were analyzed for pH, instrumental color, subjective color, and ingredient specks. Study 2 was similar, except the treatments were 0. 25 percent and 0. 5 percent powders of CG, chestnut (CN), mimosa (M), and quebracho (Q) tannins, as well as 0. 5 percent NG, 0. 02 percent BHA/BHT, 0. 2 percent RM, and a control. In study 1, only the NG and CG pre-cooked patties had similar or lower TBARS values compared to RM and BHA/BHT patties. All tannin treatments, except 0. 25 percent CG and 0. 25 percent CS, lowered pH compared to the control. Patties with NG and 0. 5 percent CG were darker, and tannin-treated patties were not redder than the control. Patties with CG and 0. 5 percent NG were less yellow. Subjectively, tannin-treated patties did not have less discoloration during storage, and the CG and NG patties had numerous visible ingredient specks. In study 2, CN, M, Q, and 0. 5 percent CG treated patties had low TBARS during storage. pH was slightly lower in CG and CN patties than the control. All tannin-treated patties were darker than the control patties, except patties containing 0. 25 percent CG and Q, and control patties had the highest red values. Tannin-treatments patties, except CN and Q patties, were less yellow. Subjectively, only 0. 25 percent M patties had less discoloration than control patties, while 0. 5 percent CN patties were more discolored. Norton and Chardonnay grapeseed flour and chesnut, mimosa, and quebracho powders would be recommended for pre-cooked ground beef patties based on their antioxidant effectiveness in these studies...|$|E

50|$|One {{method for}} {{industrial}} production of <b>dried</b> <b>cherries</b> involves first dipping them in a boiling 0.5-2% solution of sodium carbonate for up to 20 seconds, and then rinsing in cool water; this induces small cracks in the skin and speeds up the drying process. Some other possible materials for the dipping solution include ethyl oleate and oleyl alcohol; adding alkalis like potassium carbonate to such a dip was shown to have no positive effect on drying time. Such results had already been demonstrated in scientific research by the 1940s. <b>Dried</b> <b>cherries</b> might also be produced by freeze drying or air drying.

40|$|People form cooperatives to do {{something}} better than they could do individually or through a Cooperative form of business. Forming a cooperative will not automatically solve business problems faced by individual households. This is because cooperatives {{are subject to the}} same economic forces, legal restrictions and international relations that other business face. Cooperative members’ expectations about the types and quality of services that should be offered and their criteria for performance of these services {{have a major impact on}} the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction felt. Members’ satisfaction on the benefits obtained by establishing cooperatives should be evaluated by the level of the deviation of service expectation from perceived service performance. Thus, cooperatives’ performance should be continuously checked against the level of members’ satisfaction. This study therefore, aims at assessing the performance of primary coffee marketing cooperatives and there by to identify factors that impede members’ satisfaction, and to evaluate the performance of coffee marketing cooperatives in the study area, Financial ratios were computed based on annual audit reports of the cooperatives. Here, efficiency ratios, income ratios and creditworthiness ratios were calculated as performance indicators.

Based {{on a survey}} of 700 Ugandan coffee-producing households conducted in 2008, I analyze a structural model which reflects the increasing complexity of coffee sale mode decisions in coffee marketing given price risk. I find that coffee unit values increase as market sales and levels of coffee processing at sale increase, while unit values decrease with farm gate sales and lower processing levels. Households that sell raw and/or <b>dried</b> coffee <b>cherries</b> at the farm gate have higher average discount rates than households that sell coffee as <b>dried</b> and processed <b>cherries</b> {{in the market and}} at hullers respectively.
