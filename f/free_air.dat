5|$|In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{gave the}} four {{recognized}} parties <b>free</b> <b>air</b> time for political statements. The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also {{for use on}} radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time, though Diefenbaker, who did not speak French well, played only a limited role in the Tories' French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E
5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a <b>free</b> <b>air</b> show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, Endorse It in Dorset, End of the Road and the Larmer Tree Festival.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to simple}} open fires, {{enclosed}} stoves can offer greater efficiency and control.

The 503 has dual independent breakerless, magneto capacitor-discharge ignition (CDI) systems and can be equipped with either one or two piston-type carburetors.

25|$|When {{blending}} {{mixes with}} pressures {{up to about}} , the Ideal gas law provides a reasonable approximation and simple equations {{can be used to}} calculate the pressures of each component gas needed to create the mix. At this pressure and normal temperatures, air departs from linearity by about 5%, e.g. a 10-litre cylinder filled to 230 bar with air only contains about 95% of the expected 2300 litres of <b>free</b> <b>air.</b> Above this pressure, the composition of the final mix is difficult to predict using simple equations but needs the more complex Van der Waals equation.|$|E

25|$|Stations {{typically}} have an air compressor (some {{with a built-in}} or provided handheld tire-pressure gauge) to inflate tires and a hose to add water to vehicle radiators. Some air compressor machines are free of charge, while others charge a small fee to use (typically 50 cents to a dollar in North America). In many U.S. states, state law requires that paying customers must be provided with <b>free</b> <b>air</b> compressor service. In most cases, a token provided by the attendant is used in lieu of coins.|$|E

Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing, as it produces an unpleasant (to some) odor, which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration. Ethanol was sometimes used instead, but the flames it produces look less impressive, and its lower flash point poses a high risk.|$|E
