Here we present the Chandra follow-up observation of 14 AGN detected by Swift-BAT. For five sources in the sample, NuSTAR observations in the 3 - 80 keV band are also available. The X-ray spectral fitting over the 0. 3 - 150 keV energy range allows us to determine the main X-ray spectral parameters, such as the photon index and the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption,</b> of these objects, and to make hypotheses on the physical structures responsible for the observed spectra.

40|$|We {{present a}} catalog of 792 DR 5 SDSS quasars with optical spectra that have been {{observed}} serendipitously in the X-rays with the XMM-Newton. These quasars cover a redshift range of z = 0. 11 - 5. 41 and a magnitude range of i = 15. 3 - 20. 7. Substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line (51) quasars exist within this sample. Significant X-ray detections at ≥ 2 σ account for 87 % of the sample (685 quasars), and 473 quasars are detected at ≥ 6 σ, sufficient to allow X-ray spectral fits. For detected sources, ∼ 60 % have X-ray fluxes between F 2 − 10 keV = 1 - 10 x 10 − 14 ergs cm − 2 s − 1. We fit a single power-law, a fixed power-law with <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> left free to vary, and an absorbed power-law model to all quasars with X-ray S/N ≥ 6, resulting in a weighted mean photon index Γ = 1. 91 ± 0. 08, with an intrinsic dispersion σΓ = 0. 38.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is the study of}} the optical {{properties}} of InP quantum dots (QDs) and the exploration of a new method for the synthesis of InP/CdS core-shell QDs. A multitude of research on colloidal QDs requires detailed knowledge of the relation between optical and structural properties, namely the sizing curve, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient and the molar extinction coefficient. In this work, InP QDs were synthesized and structurally and optically characterized. The sizing curve was established from the average QD diameter, obtained by transmission electron microscopy, and the position of the first excitonic absorption peak. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient and molar extinction coefficient were determined from quantitative elemental analysis and the absorbance of the nanocrystals at short wavelengths. We found that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient is size-independent in this wavelength region and the molar extinction coefficient increases linearly with the QD volume. The focus of our study was then shifted to the fabrication of core-shell QD heterostructures, based on a recently reported method that used a more sustainable and much cheaper phosphorus precursor for the synthesis of high-quality InP/ZnS QDs. Using this procedure, we synthesized highly luminescent InP/CdS QDs and their emission could be tuned in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed on samples of InP/ZnS and InP/CdS QDs. We also report an exploratory study on the mechanism of formation of InP QDs with this new method. A thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism will enable a better control over the synthesis products and is potentially relevant for the fabrication of QDs consisting of other III-V semiconductors (e. g.

40|$|We have {{selected}} {{a sample of}} broad absorption line (BAL) quasars which show significant radio variations, indicating the presence of polar BAL outflows. We obtained snapshot XMM observations of four polar BAL QSOs, to check whether strong X-ray absorption, {{one of the most}} prominent characteristics of most BAL QSOs, also exist in polar outflows. Two of the sources are detected in X-ray. Spectral fittings show that they are X-ray normal with no <b>intrinsic</b> X-ray <b>absorption,</b> suggesting the X-ray shielding gas might be absent in polar BAL outflows. Comparing to non-BAL QSOs, one of two X-ray nondetected sources remains consistent with X-ray normal, while the other one, which is an iron low-ionization BAL (FeLoBAL), shows an X-ray weakness factor of > 19, suggesting strong <b>intrinsic</b> X-ray <b>absorption.</b> Alternative explanations to the nondetection of strong X-ray absorption in the two X-ray detected sources are 1) the absorption is more complex than a simple neutral absorber, such as partial covering absorption or ionized absorption; 2) there might be significant jet contribution to the detected X-ray emission. Current data is insufficient to test these possibilities, and further observations are required to understand the X-ray nature of polar BAL outflows.
