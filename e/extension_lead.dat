40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{the technique}} of neurostimulation of deep brain structures {{for the treatment of}} conditions such as essential tremor, dystonia, Parkinson's disease and chronic pain syndromes. The procedure uses implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes connected to <b>extension</b> <b>leads</b> and an implantable pulse generator (IPG). Hardware failure related to the DBS procedure is not infrequent, and includes electrode migration and disconnection. We describe a patient who received bilateral globus pallidus internus DBS for dystonia with initially good clinical response, but the device eventually failed. Radiographs showed multiple twisting of the <b>extension</b> <b>leads</b> with disconnection from the brain electrodes and a diagnosis of Twiddler's syndrome was made. Twiddler's syndrome was first described in patients with cardiac pacemakers. Patients with mental disability, elderly and obese patients are at increased risk.

The cartoons perfectly complemented Auberon Waughs scabrous and surreal flights of invective, and when Waugh moved his column to The Daily Telegraph as the [...] "Way of the World" [...] in 1990, Rushton followed. The Victoria and Albert Museum, recognising his accomplishments, commissioned 24 large colour illustrations that were collected as Willie Rushtons Great Moments of History. (Rushton had previous experience with the V&A when he had pulled a prank on the institution by labelling an electric plug socket in one of the galleries: [...] "Plug hole designed by Hans Plug (b. 1908)", which remained for a full year - to the great annoyance of a cleaner who had to use a hefty <b>extension</b> <b>lead</b> for 12 months so as not to damage the exhibit.) This large scale excursion into the use of colour was good practice for the monthly colour covers he created for the Literary Review when Waugh became its editor in the late 1980s.

PAMs are strongly bound to organic matter and clay particles, and are therefore, immobile in soil and very difficult to desorb. The adsorption process occurs rapidly and is mostly irreversible, although the degree of adsorption is influenced by PAM conformation, soil and mineral properties and soil solution characteristics [1].

40|$|The {{aromatic}} amine carcinogen 2 -aminofluorene (AF) forms covalent adducts with DNA, predominantly with guanine at the C 8 position. Such lesions are bypassed by Y-family polymerases such as Dpo 4 via error-free and error-prone mechanisms. We show that Dpo 4 catalyzes elongation from a correct 3 ′-terminal C opposite [AF]G in a nonrepetitive template sequence with low efficiency. This <b>extension</b> <b>leads</b> to cognate full-length product, {{as well as}} mis-elongated products containing base mutations and deletions. Crystal structures of the Dpo 4 ternary complex with the 3 ′-terminal primer C base opposite [AF]G in the anti conformation and with the AF-moiety positioned in the major groove, revealed both accurate and misalignment-mediated mutagenic extension pathways. The mutagenic template/primer-dNTP arrangement is promoted by interactions between the polymerase and the bulky lesion, rather than by a base pairstabilized misaligment.

40|$|We present {{new methods}} for {{computing}} square roots and factorization of poly-nomials over finite fields. We also describe {{a method for}} computing in the Jacobian of a singular hyperelliptic curve. There is a compact representation of an element in the Jacobian of a smooth hyperelliptic curve over any field. This compact representation leads an efficient method for computing in Jacobians which is called Cantor’s Algorithm. In {{one part of the}} dissertation, we show that an extension of this compact representation and Cantor’s Algorithm is possible for singular hyperelliptic curves. This <b>extension</b> <b>lead</b> to the use of singular hyperelliptic curves for factorization of polynomials and com-puting square roots in finite fields. Our study shows that computing the square root of a number mod p is equiv-alent to finding any of the particular group elements in the Jacobian of a certain singular hyperelliptic curve. This is also true in the case of polynomial factoriza-tions. Therefore the efficiency of our algorithms depends on only the efficiency of the algorithms for computing in the Jacobian of a singular hyperelliptic curve. The algorithms for computing in Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves are very fast especially for small genus and this makes our algorithms especially computing square roots al-gorithms competitive with the other well-known algorithms.

40|$|Abstract. There is an {{enduring}} story about empiricism, which runs as follows: from Locke onwards to Carnap, empiricism is the doctrine in which raw sense-data are received through the passive mechanism of perception; {{experience is the}} effect produced by external reality on the mind or ‘receptors’. Empiricism on this view is the ‘handmaiden ’ of experimental natural science, seeking to redefine philosophy and its methods in conformity {{with the results of}} modern science. Secondly, there is a story about materialism, popularized initially by Marx and Engels and later restated as standard, ‘textbook ’ history of philosophy in the English-speaking world. It portrays materialism as explicitly mechanistic, seeking to reduce the world of qualities, sensations, and purposive behaviour to a quantitative, usually deterministic physical scheme. Building on some recent scholarship, I aim to articulate the contrarian view according to which neither of these stories is true. On the contrary, empiricism turns out to be less ‘science-friendly ’ and more concerned with moral matters; materialism reveals itself to be, in at least a large number of cases, a ‘vital’, anti-mechanistic doctrine which focuses on the unique properties of organic beings. This revision of two key philosophical episodes should reveal that our history of early modern philosophy is dependent to a great extent on ‘special interests’, whether positivistic or Kantian, and by <b>extension</b> <b>lead</b> us to rethink the relation and distinction between ‘science ’ and ‘philosophy ’ in this period...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Recent {{data suggest}} how adverse events occur more {{frequently}} after Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) replacement {{than during the}} deep electrode positioning in patients treated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). For instance, erroneous extension adjustment to change in laterality and inaccurate lead connection represent problems, which strongly affect patients outcome. We analyzed our data after 13 years of IPG replacement. Materials and Methods: We treated 107 patients (83 PD and 24 Dystonia) with DBS in 13 years. The Dual Channel IPGs replaced during this period were 91. 25 patients needed more than one replacement, especially among the dystonic population. During surgery, we temporarily marked in all the cases the right <b>extension</b> <b>lead</b> before the disconnection from the exhausted IPG. Good impedances were intraoperatively checked in all the cases. Results: Our surgical technique allowed us to avoid any erroneous change in laterality or abnormal impedances due to a suboptimal connection to the IPG. The mean duration of the operation was 25 min and a quick postoperative restart of DBS was possible in all the cases. Stability of symptoms after IPG replacement was achieved in all the patients, with an accurate clinical management within the first 48 - 72 postoperative hours. Conclusion: Our surgical and postoperative management demonstrates how to avoid some important adverse events with some easy steps, without any discomfort for the patients in terms of duration of surgery or longer hospitalization. Thus, stability of symptoms after the IPG replacement may be easily guaranteed during the first postoperative period...|$|E
