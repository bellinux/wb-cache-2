50|$|In 1916 {{she visited}} Eric Gill and The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic in Ditchling. Mairet was so {{impressed}} that she set about moving to the same community. In 1918 she published A Book on Vegetable Dyes. During the 1930s and 1940s she trained people in weaving and dyeing at her Gospels studio at Ditchling. Mairet's seminal training at her workshop {{is said to have}} influenced all of the aspiring hand weavers of that generation. The Swiss weaver Marianne Straub came to work with her and to learn more about <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> <b>weaving</b> and Mairet taught Straub about hand dyeing and spinning. Straub introduced a variety of double cloth weaves and developed a friendship with Mairet. Mairet learnt from Straub and this underwrote her belief that <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> <b>weaving</b> could be used by industry. Straub and Mairet went on three European holidays during the mid 1930s and Straub would frequently return to Mairet and Gospels. A surviving journal written by Mairet from a European journey with her husband in 1927 illustrates how her observations were dominated not by whom she met but what they were wearing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe fashion silhouettes {{had been}} {{replaced}} by the material oriented hand-made looks of surfaces of the textile materials after the 1980 s when the plurality of styles started to appear in fashion industry. Textile designers have begun to explore relief effects taking their inspirations from traditional craft techniques of pleating, printing, crochet, shibori and smocking. Nowadays, crafted textiles are highly popular due to their distinctive prominent appearance, hi this study, a survey is executed to obtain relief effects on pictorial fabric surfaces by using elastic yarns combined with yarns of low elasticity, and with different weave structures such as brocade, double cloth, and overshot on <b>hand</b> jacquard <b>weaving</b> <b>loom.</b> As the pieces are hand-woven on jacquard loom, they reveal the weaver's respect to the craft of weaving. The paper concludes with the presentation of fabrics for use as clothing and with implications for fashion design...|$|R
