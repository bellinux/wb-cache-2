40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), {{the most}} {{prominent}} technique {{for the assessment of}} environmental impacts of products, typically operates on the basis of average meteorological and ecological conditions of whole countries or large regions. This limits the representativeness and accuracy of LCA, particularly in the field of agriculture. The production processes associated with agricultural commodities are characterized by high spatial sensitivity as both inputs (e. g. mineral and organic fertilizers) and the accompanying release of emissions into soil, air and water (e. g. nitrate, <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide,</b> or phosphate emissions) are largely determined by micro-spatial environmental parameters (precipitation, soil prop-erties, slope, etc.) and therefore highly context dependent. This spatial variability is vastly ignored under the “unit world” assumption inherent to LCA. In this pa-per, we present a new calculation framework for regionalized life cycle inventory modeling that aims to overcome this inherent limitation. The framework allows an automated, site-specific generation and assessment of regionalized unit process datasets. We demonstrate the framework in a case study on rapeseed cultivation in Germany. The results from the research are (i) {{a better understanding of the}} char-acteristics and application of spatial data in the context of LCI modeling, (ii) a framework for generating regionalized data structures, and (iii) a first examination of the characteristics and significance of further use cases...|$|E

Also gaseous species like nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are soluble in supercritical water. To test if SCWO-Technic is a useful method to dispose of energetic materials we tested the reaction behavior of explosives in supercritical water. To differ between oxidation and hydrolysis reactions we analyzed first the hydrolysis reaction of DNT and TNT. DNT as well as TNT show a different reaction behavior at sub- and supercritical conditions. At 150 degree Celsius (0. 6 - 1 MPa) TNT produces under alkaline hydrolysis conditions nitride, ammonium, nitrogen and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide.</b> On stronger alkaline content gas production is reduced and more ionic species are formed.

40|$|This {{tutorial}} review {{describes the}} use of variable temperature infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed species (VTIR), a recent method for studying the thermodynamics of weak solid-gas interactions. Examples show how a fundamental relationship of thermodynamics (the van't Hoff equation, used long since in several fields of physical chemistry) can describe equilibrium processes at the solid-gas interface. The VTIR method is fully exploited by measuring absorbance of an IR band, temperature and pressure over a wide temperature range: an estimation of the interaction energy is, however, possible even ignoring the equilibrium pressure. Precise thermodynamic characterization of solid-gas interactions is required in several fields: on the applied side, gas sensing, separation and storage, which involve such areas as work-place security, air pollution control and the energy sector; regarding fundamental knowledge, weak solid-gas interactions are relevant {{to a number of}} fields, including hydrogen bonding, coordination chemistry and surface phenomena in a broad sense. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of (gas) molecules adsorbed on a solid is frequently used to characterize both, the adsorbed species and the adsorbing centres at the solid surface. The potential of the technique can be greatly enhanced by obtaining IR spectra over a temperature range, and simultaneously measuring IR absorbance, temperature and equilibrium pressure. When this is done, variable temperature infrared (VTIR) spectroscopy can be used not only for a more detailed surface characterization, but also for precise studies on the thermodynamics of solid-gas interactions. Furthermore, when weak interactions are concerned, the technique shows favourable features compared to adsorption calorimetry, or to other classical methods. The potential of the VTIR method is highlighted by reviewing recently reported studies on dihydrogen, <b>dinitrogen</b> and carbon <b>monoxide</b> adsorption on zeolites. To facilitate understanding, an outline of the basis of the method is also given, together with an appraisal of the critical points involved in its practical use...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} described herein applies density functional {{theory to}} the activation and scission {{of the small}} multiply bonded molecules <b>dinitrogen,</b> carbon <b>monoxide</b> and carbon dioxide using transition metal catalysts. Starting from the Laplaza-Cummins 3 -coordinate molybdenum amide complex MoL 3 (L = N(tBu) Ar) we have applied electronic structure methods {{in combination with the}} ONIOM approach to complete a comprehensive study of the effect of ligand bulk on theactivation of dinitrogen. Our results show that not only is there expected destabilisation of the intermediate on the pathway, due to direct steric interactions of the bulky groups, but also there is significant electronic destabilisation as the size of the ligand increases. This latter destabilisation is due to the inability of the molecule to accommodate a rotated amide group bound to the molybdenum once the amide reaches a certain size. Interestingly the Laplaza-Cummins catalyst is experimentally inactive towards carbon dioxide despite binding and cleaving one C-S bond in the similar CS 2 molecule. We have used density functional theory (DFT) to show that, at first glance, the reaction of 3 L 3 Mo + CO 2 should proceed smoothly to give L 3 Mo-O + L 3 Mo-CO-MoL 3. However, initial coordination of the CO 2 molecule to L 3 Mo does not take place because of the bending of CO 2, the energy required to cross from the doublet to the quartet state, and the lower metal-CO 2 binding energy compared to metal-CS 2. From this analysis we predicted that replacement of the central metal with a d 2 transition metal would provide improved binding. Our calculations in this regard suggest that the tantalum analogue, TaL 3, will successfully bind to CO 2 in a mononuclear η 2 arrangement and, importantly, will strongly activate one C-O bond to a point where spontaneously C-O cleave occurs. This strongly exothermic reaction takes into consideration formation transition barriers, spin crossings, ligand bulk and even the DFT functional choice. The product from this reaction, CO, is known to react with a similar 3 -coordinate Ta(silox) 3 (silox = OSi(tBu) 3) complex, initially forming a ketenylidene (silox) 3 Ta-CCO, followed by a dicarbide (silox) 3 Ta-CC-(silox) 3 structure. We again applied DFT methods to this reaction revealing an intricate mechanism whereby the previously unknown intermediate [(silox) 3 Ta-CO] 2 was identified. The mechanism has been extended to consider the effect of altering both the metal species and the ligand environment. Specifically we predict that introducing electron-rich metals to the left of Ta on the periodic table to create mixed metal dinuclear intermediates shows great promise, as does the ligand environment of the Cummins-style 3 -coordinate amide structure. Finally our interest in CO 2 reactions lead to the exciting oxygen-atom transfer from carbon dioxide to a Fischer Carbene at (PNP) Ir reaction by the Grubbs group. We have confirmed the mechanism for the important CO 2 reaction and have successfully rationalised the selective cleavage of the CS and CN bonds in OCS and PhNCO. The formation of the iridium-supported carbene itself has also been investigated and a fascinating autocatalytic mechanism has been discovered which nicely fits the observed experimental behaviour. This formation analysis has also been extended to consider the reactions with other linear and cyclic ethers that are known to form either carbenes or vinyl ether adducts. We have successfully rationalised the factors dictating reaction direction where both ether structural arrangement and (PNP) ligand environment contribute to the formation reaction outcomes...|$|R

Therefore, a sustainable approach to the development is needed to reduce the consumption of energy. Malaysia has recorded 7. 3 tons in carbon dioxide emission per capita in the year 2007. This amount puts Malaysia in the 57 th place in the world. This is due {{to an increase in}} oil derivatives and gas expenditures in the last decade. Fuel consumption also has {{a significant role in the}} demolition of the construction sites as well as their waste disposal. Hence, an increase of demands for demolition has a negative impact on these criteria. Building demolition as a case study for life cycle assessment (LCA) that was conducted for a 18740 m 2 floor area, four-storied office, with one story as the top floor, one bridge for connecting the structures and a two-storey basement car park.

Furthermore, a Building Information Modeling (BIM) system is used to determine the accurate quantity of elements and its simulation. The LCA model analyzes the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with demolition and waste disposal. The findings show that as much as 225039. 021 kilograms of CO 2 equivalent of GHGs were released for 15147862 tons of demolition materials where, 97. 633 percent or 219713. 1 kilogram CO 2 equivalent from the amount was carbon dioxide, followed by 1. 358 percent or 3056. 47 kg CO 2 equivalent of methane, 1. 008 percent or 2269. 188 kilogram CO 2 equivalent of <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide</b> and 0. 001 percent or 0. 225 kg CO 2 equivalent of other gases such as chloroform and ethane.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the potential implementation of integrated dimethyl ether (DME) production from by-products of the pulp and paper industry in Fenno-Scandinavia (Finland, Norway and Sweden) and to quantify the consequences of several use scenarios in which fossil fuels were gradually substituted by DME. To that end, two analytical frameworks were jointly used, life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmentally-extended input-output analysis (EEIOA). The first framework was utilised to make an exhaustive inventory of the Chemrec process and its integration in the Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish contexts. The latter framework was employed in order to incorporate this production system into a multi-regional input-output model that has been created for the purpose of the study. For data availability reasons, the stressors that have been examined are anthropogenic carbon dioxide, methane and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide,</b> widely regarded as the elements which are responsible for the most serious environmental impacts. Three different story lines (plus a baseline scenario) were taken into account: a resource assessment scenario, in which a total implementation is assumed; a policy-independent approach setting a constant increase in the use of biofuels and a policy-compliance approach, aiming at satisfying European directive goals. It results that 5. 21 to 20. 6 Mt of DME can be produced, while the range of greenhouse gases emissions that can be saved thanks to a black liquor-based DME production scheme goes from 46. 7 (scenario 3) to 70. 5 (scenario 2) Mt in 2050, that is, 8. 15 12. 8 % out of the otherwise total emissions in Fenno-Scandinavia. This LCA/IO analysis emphasises that the amount of greenhouse gases emissions embodied in every kg of DME highly depends on each country's background economy and evolves considerably along the decade, unit-level analysis show drastic reductions (- 15 % to - 57 % between 2000 and 2050) in DME embodied emissions. A nationwide analysis highlights a very important potential from the Finnish pulp and paper industry. All in all, it shows that such a biofuel production scheme should be implemented in countries that have an remarkable environmental profile to obtain very significant environmental performances. Only a joint effort of all the key sectors (energy, transportation, households) can lead to climate change mitigation and energy security. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{endocrine}} disrupting activity of steroid hormones both {{of natural and}} of anthropogenic origin was recognized as a potential risk to the fertility of wildlife populations in various ecosystems and the human population. Concerns about potential negative ecological effects of steroid hormones have resulted in an increased interest {{with regard to the}} elimination of these compounds in soil, sediments, and during wastewater treatment. Analysis of steroid hormones showed that denitrification significantly contributes to the overall elimination of estradiol in the sewage sludge process. However, nothing is known about the bacteria responsible for this estradiol degradation. Also no information exists about the degradation of testosterone under anoxic conditions. This work gives first data about the anaerobic degradation of both estradiol or testosterone by novel denitrifying bacteria. These bacteria (strain AcBE 2 - 1 and strain FS) were isolated in this work from activated sludge and anoxic digested sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant with estradiol or testosterone as the sole source of carbon and energy and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Strain AcBE 2 - 1 was isolated from activated sludge with estradiol and nitrate. This bacterium oxidized estradiol beyond estrone completely to carbon dioxide and water by reduction of nitrate to a mixture of <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide</b> and dinitrogen, with the intermediate accumulation of nitrite. Electron recoveries were between 90 and 100 %, taking into account assimilated estradiol. With nitrate as the electron acceptor, the bacterium also grew on estrone, fatty acids (C 2 to C 6), isobutyrate, crotonate, DL-lactate, or several citric acid cycle intermediates. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16 S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain AcBE 2 - 1 represents a separate line of descent within the family Rhodocyclaceae (Betaproteobacteria). Together with several clone sequences obtained from hitherto uncultivated bacteria, strain AcBE 2 - 1 forms a novel cluster distinct from known lineages. The closest relatives are the cholesterol-degrading, denitrifying bacteria Sterolibacterium denitrificans DSM 13999 T and strain 72 Chol (= DSM 12783), with < 93. 9 % sequence similarity. The G+C content of the DNA was 61. 4 mol%. Detection of a quinone system with ubiquinone Q- 8 as the predominant compound and a fatty acid profile that is clearly different from Sterolibacterium denitrificans, supported the results of the phylogenetic analysis. On the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence data in combination with chemotaxonomic and physiological data, strain AcBE 2 - 1 (= DSM 16959 = JCM 12830) is placed in a new genus Denitratisoma gen. nov. as the type strain of the type species Denitratisoma oestradiolicum gen. nov., sp. nov. Strain FS was isolated from anoxic digested sludge on estradiol and testosterone with nitrate as the electron acceptor. Strain FS represents the first bacterium that anaerobically mineralizes both estradiol (C 18) or testosterone (C 19). The degradation balance measured in testosterone-limited cultures indicated a complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and water. Estradiol oxidation was almost complete even in nitrate-limited cultures. Estrone and 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione were identified as intermediates of estradiol and testosterone degradation, respectively. <b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide</b> was the sole end product of denitrification, without intermediate nitrite formation. Beside estradiol and testosterone, only a narrow spectrum of organic substrates were used as electron donors under denitrifying conditions including estrone, 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione, acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, valerate, caproate, heptanoate, or glutamate. Comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain FS has no known close relatives and represents a separate line of descent within the Gammaproteobacteria positioned among clone sequences of so far uncultivated bacteria. A distant relationship of about 87. 1 % 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity exists to the genera Nevskia, Hydrocarboniphaga, Nitrosococcus, and Ectothiorhodospira, all of which exhibit different physiological properties in comparison with strain FS. The G+C content of the DNA was 61. 9 mol%. Based on the high 16 S rRNA gene sequence divergence and different physiological properties to previously described bacteria in combination with chemotaxonomic data, strain FS (= DSM 18526) was indicated as the type strain of a type species placed in a new genus Steroidobacter gen. nov., for which the name Steroidobacter denitrificans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. A proteomic approach with Denitratisoma oestradiolicum allowed to demonstrate the induction of estradiol-specific proteins and resulted in the identification of several enzymes for example S-adenosylmethionine synthase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, 3 -octaprenyl- 4 -hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, and several hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that might be involved in anaerobic estradiol degradation. These initial results represent a prerequisite for a detailed characterization and elucidation of the estradiol degradation pathway in this novel denitrifying bacterium. The obtained amino acid sequence data could be used in future studies to construct degenerated oligonucleotides for cloning and sequencing the respective genes coding for these proteins. The complete nucleotide sequence information will then allow to search for related proteins and to make functional and structural comparisons...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} luminescence, reactivity and ionisation of atomic europium isolated in cryogenic thin films of rare gases argon, krypton and xenon. Many studies are available concerning the spectroscopy of matrix-isolated main group metal atoms, however, the lanthanide series remains relatively undocumented. A thorough investigation of matrix-isolated europium is performed in this thesis {{in an effort to}} develop the spectroscopy of the fblock metal atom elements. Absorption spectroscopy identifies the visible s - p type y 8 P - a 8 S and the UV f - d type 8 P - a 8 S electronic transitions of atomic Eu. The absorption spectra are complicated showing numerous features due to multiple guest site occupancy in the host lattices upon deposition. Annealing simplifies spectra, removing one thermally unstable site of isolation in each RG. Site-specific excitation spectra allow further deconvolution of complicated absorption spectra and the identification of two lattice vacancy types occupied by the metal guest. The spherical nature of the [Xe] 4 f 76 s 2 ground state of europium coupled with predicted Eu-RG diatomic bond lengths, allows attribution of these occupied sites to hexa-vacancies and tetra-vacancies. The complex visible y 8 P state luminescence was probed using steady-state and time-resolved methods. Multiple emission features are identified with y 8 P state excitation. Specific excitation in each particular site simplified the emission profiles yielding four emission bands. Based on their spectral location and temporal characteristics the observed emission features are assigned as y 8 P resonance fluorescence, emission from the z 6 P and a 8 D excited states to the ground state and emission of the metastable a 10 D electronic state. The solid state lifetimes of the a 8 D and a 10 D states are the first ever reported for these states. Excitation spectra in the region of the z 6 P state identify the z 6 P 5 / 2, and z 6 P 7 / 2 levels. The z 6 P 3 / 2 level is not identified in accordance with the J = 0, ± 1 electric-dipole selection rule. The effect of each hosts increased capability for distortion is obvious in the excitation spectra recorded in this region. The z 6 P 5 / 2 excitation band is observed to progress from a structureless feature in solid Ar to a resolved triplet in the Xe lattice. The greater capability for distortion of the Xe host causing Jahn-Teller threefold splitting of this state. The effects of y 8 P state laser irradiation on the Eu/RG samples are then investigated. The atomic absorption features are completely removed by this process and replaced with multiple new higher energy absorptions. Based on their spectral location, intensity distribution and lifetime characteristics, these new features are attributed to singly ionised europium formed in the lattice during irradiation. The ionisation shows a strong power dependence suggesting the ion is formed via a multiphoton process. Annealing reforms the neutral species implying the free ionised electron is stabilised in the host lattice. The visible luminescence of the states of 4 f 7 (8 S° 7 / 2) 6 p 1 / 2 and 4 f 7 (8 S° 7 / 2) 6 p 3 / 2 configuration of Eu+/RG are investigated using time-resolved and steady-state techniques. Observed emission features are attributed to relaxation from particular electronic states of the ion. Absorption spectroscopy identifies two lattice trapping sites occupied in Ar and Kr and only one site in solid Xe. The site occupied in all three hosts is attributed to the interstitial octahedral site based on comparison to Eu+-RG predicted diatomic bond lengths. The additional site present in Ar and Kr results from occupancy of a single vacancy. Atomic Eu isolated in argon matrices doped with <b>dinitrogen</b> or carbon <b>monoxide</b> undergoes photochemistry during lamp irradiation. UV/Vis absorption spectra identify atomic isolation upon deposition. Following y 8 P state irradiation all atomic features are completely removed. Infrared absorption spectra in the region of the N-N and C-O stretches show ligand complexation with the metal centre occurs. A vibrational frequency analysis of the Eu:N 2 and Eu:CO complexes is performed using the hybrid B 3 LYP, the DFT BP 86 and the post-Hartree-Fock MP 2 methods. The appropriateness of each functional at describing lanthanide metal chemistry is compared. BP 86 is found to be the most accurate. A vibrational frequency analysis at the BP 86 level allows identification of the binary europium dinitrogen complexes in both the side-on and end-on orientation in low ligand concentration samples in solid argon. The side-on species is calculated to be in the region of 900 cm- 1 lower in energy. The mono-ligated carbon bound Eu(CO) species is observed in samples of 0. 1 % CO in Ar. Analysis of the bonding molecular orbitals shows europium in a high-spin [Xe] 4 f 75 d 16 s 1 state is involved. Metal-ligand interactions occur via a classic synergistic donation/ back-bonding scheme. The high-spin state of europium is occupied as it reduces repulsion by removal of an s electron and increases the metal’s ability for back-bonding by promotion of an electron to a d-orbital allowing a greater degree of ligand co-ordination...|$|R
40|$|Metallothioneins (MTs), a {{low mass}} class of metalloproteins, are {{characterized}} by a high thiolate sulphur- and metal content. MTs are involved in metal homeostasis and heavy metal detoxification, and are efficient scavengers of free radicals. This study investigates the reactions of human fetal liver metallothioneins with bioradicals (hydroxylradicals and NO) with respect to metal release and modification of their amino acid composition. MT was isolated from human fetal liver by the method of Clough et al. (1986), involving extraction of the metallothioneins from liver tissue, gel chromatography, negative affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography, resulting in MT- 0, MT- 1 and MT- 2 isoforms, devoid of fatty acid binding protein (FABP). The purity of the isoform fractions, i. e. absence of FABP and other protein impurities, was confirmed by multiple electrophoresis and blotting methods. The effects of NO (radicals) on MT were investigated as a preliminary study. The results confirmed and expanded {{the data obtained by}} Aravindakumar et al. (2000). Two efficient systems were developed to generate hydroxyl radicals either chemically or by physical means. The chemical Fenton reaction, based on the reaction of ferrous sulphate with hydrogen peroxide, yielded the highest quantity of hydroxyl radicals. The presence of the radicals was demonstrated and quantified by the TBA-test and by electron paramagnetic resonance. Physically generated hydroxyl radicals were obtained by radiolysis of aqueous solutions of MT by gamma irradiation obtained from a 137 CsCl source unit. As the main part of this study we investigated the modification effects on metallothioneins caused by hydroxyl radicals generated either chemically or by gamma irradiation. Amino acid analysis prior to and past treatment of MT with hydroxyl radicals generated by the chemical Fenton reaction demonstrated that the contents of cysteine/half-cystine was reduced dramatically following treatment with hydroxyl radicals. The number of serine residues increased considerably. Serine {{is one of the first}} oxidation products of the treatment of cysteine with hydroxyl radicals. The repeatedly demonstrated increase of the MT glycine content was also remarkable. These results were interpreted as complete destruction of the side chains of certain amino acids to the protein backbone due to the high reactivity of the hydroxyl radicals, hence leading to an increased number of glycine residues. The number of free sulfhydryl groups of the native protein was reduced following treatment of MT samples with hydroxyl radicals, without formation of disulfide bonds. The side chains of MTs cysteines are either oxidized or destructed, but definitely not permanently converted to cystine. In our experimental conditions, Fenton reaction generated hydroxyl radicals caused a zinc release of about 95 %. Hydrogen peroxide as such in the same experimental conditions also caused an extensive zinc release. It was causedby direct reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the metallothionein thiol groups. As an interesting side line on this study we also concluded that the MT- 0 concentration is systematically underestimated if determined by AAS measurements. Secondly, we investigated the irradiation dose- and atmosphere-related effects of hydroxyl radicals on zinc release and amino acid modifications when aqueous solutions of purified MT- 1 were subjected to gamma irradiation by doses ranging from 85 to 1500 Gy. We compared four irradiation conditions concurrently: aerobic conditions, anaerobic argon atmosphere, and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>monoxide</b> atmosphere on native MT- 1; and anaerobic argon atmosphere on metal-depleted MT- 1. Irrespective of the pretreatment of the MT samples, we always observed a fairly rapid increase of serine content by 15 to 20 % as the main irradiation effect. Under strictly anaerobic argon atmosphere however, the serine content eventually reached a plateau value of over 100 % increase at 750 Gy dose. Under all atmosphere conditions the cysteine/half-cystine content decreased simultaneously with the rapid serine formation. Irradiation also led to increased cysteic acid formation except under argon atmosphere. At the higher irradiation doses, cysteic acid was partially reconverted into cystine; this is attributed to the reducing effect of the hydrated electrons generated as a by-product of radiolysis of aqueous solutions. The concentration of methionine decreased gradually, whereas in all but apo-MT- 1 conditions, minute amounts of homocystine and cystathionine were formed. In addition a few other very limited amino acid modifications were observed. Amino acids with aliphatic side chains remained unchanged under all irradiation doses and atmospheric conditions. A zinc release of 27 % was observed when the samples were subjected to 30 minutes of irradiation (250 Gy) in aerobic conditions; irradiation for 60 minutes (500 Gy) or more caused a zinc release of 100 %, showing that initially a slow metal displacement occurred, followed by a facilitated fast and more extensive metal release. When aqueous solutions of zinc-MT- 1 are treated with hydroxyl radicals, formed during gamma irradiation in doses ranging from 85 to 1500 Gy, at first one or a few cysteine/half-cystine residues are converted into serine residues with a limited simultaneous zinc release. As a consequence, MT- 1 loses its rigid structure organized around the two distinct metal clusters, triggering a chain reaction of more zinc being rapidly released, hence exposing more cysteine residues to the oxidizing effects of the hydroxyl radicals present. Cysteines are converted into serine and cysteic acid. In anaerobic argon conditions further conversion occurs only into serine. Side effects include partial destruction of methionine, and formation of homocystine, cystathionine, and minute amounts of hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine and ornithine under selected irradiation conditions. In case higher concentrations of hydroxyl radicals react with MT, as in the experiments with Fenton reaction generated radicals, the main effects are not restricted to formation of serine or cysteic acid, but complete destruction of some amino acid side chains to the aplha-carbon atom occurs, leading to formation of glycine. Presumably the hydrogen peroxide, present in the Fenton reaction system, is also involved. status: publishe...|$|E
