5|$|Kruger {{left the}} Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept {{as the train}} crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first {{outgoing}} steamer, the Herzog of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, {{at the behest of}} the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS <b>Gelderland,</b> and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this, but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. <b>Gelderland</b> departed on 20 October 1900.|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, <b>Gelderland,</b> growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, so {{when the time came}} to extract the potatoes, his family tied a rope around Overmars' waist, connected it to a cart and made him run while they pulled the crop out.|$|E
5|$|On {{receiving}} {{news of the}} siege, Cristóbal de Mondragón, {{the elderly}} Spanish governor of Antwerp, whom Fuentes had left {{in command of the}} Spanish forces opposite to the Dutch, collected a little army gathering forces of several garrisons and marched to Groenlo through Brabant and <b>Gelderland.</b> Mondragón's force comprised two Spanish tercios (under Luis de Velasco and Antonio de Zúñiga), an Irish regiment under William Stanley, a Swiss regiment and 1,300 cavalry under Juan de Córdoba, which, having crossed the Meuse at Venlo, were joined by Frederick van den Bergh's German regiment.|$|E
5|$|Stanley and York's acts {{not only}} negated the gains of the 1586 campaign, but also {{undermined}} Leicester's reputation and the Dutch States {{confidence in the}} English troops. The Dutch States decided to appoint Count Maurice of Nassau as Governor-General of the Netherlands and Philip of Hohenlohe as his lieutenant. With the loss of Deventer and Zutphen's sconce, the Spanish were able to levy war contributions in the provinces of Utrecht, Overijssel and <b>Gelderland.</b> Zutphen and Deventer remained in Spanish control until their capture in 1591 by Maurice of Nassau.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle, the Spanish army's German regiments, induced by Captain Jean van der Cloester, mutinied again in their quarters, {{claiming}} {{that they had not}} received their monthly pay. Verdugo sent Captain Pedrosa to take news of the Spanish victory to Farnese and, having refreshed his troops, aimed to capture the Niezijl fort with his Walloon regiment, his four cavalry companies and a few volunteers from among the German mutineers. As the season changed and a furious rain started, Verdugo was forced to abandon the project of seizing the fort and returned to Noordhorn. The autumnal floods made the Frisian land impassable for the armies, and thus Verdugo moved with his troops to the dry and gritty land of Drenthe, while Norreys kept the remains of his army behind the IJssel river. A group of 400 Dutchmen in Norreys' army lodged themselves in the town of Keppel, in <b>Gelderland.</b> In January 1582, Verdugo destroyed them and seized Keppel and the castle of Bronckhorst, achieving great success in <b>Gelderland.</b>|$|E
5|$|The travel {{journal of}} the Dutch ship <b>Gelderland</b> (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, {{contains}} the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius. They {{have been attributed to}} the professional artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct Mauritian birds, and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{influence}} of the later Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred with horses of Central Europe and the Low Countries and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and <b>Gelderland</b> also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E
5|$|By September 1944, Allied {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of their}} Normandy beachhead and pursued shattered German forces across Northern France and Belgium. Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold plan to head north through the Dutch <b>Gelderland,</b> bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences and opening a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the <b>Gelderland</b> journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the <b>Gelderland,</b> Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Zutphen {{was fought}} on 22 September 1586, {{near the village}} of Warnsveld and the town of Zutphen, the Netherlands, during the Eighty Years' War. It was fought by the forces of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, aided by the English, against the Spanish. In 1585, England signed the Treaty of Nonsuch with the States-General of the Netherlands and {{formally}} entered the war against Spain. Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was appointed as the Governor-General of the Netherlands and sent there in command of an English army to support the Dutch rebels. When Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and commander of the Spanish Army of Flanders, besieged the town of Rheinberg during the Cologne War, Leicester, in turn, besieged the town of Zutphen, in the province of <b>Gelderland</b> and on the eastern bank of the river IJssel.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Lippe was a cavalry action {{fought on}} 2 September 1595 {{on the banks}} of the Lippe river, in Germany, between a corps of Spanish cavalry led by Juan de Córdoba and a corps of Dutch cavalry, {{supported}} by English troops, led by Philip of Nassau. The Dutch statholder Maurice of Nassau, taking advantage of the fact that the bulk of the Spanish army was busied in operations in France, besieged the town of Groenlo in <b>Gelderland,</b> but the elderly governor of the citadel of Antwerp, Cristóbal de Mondragón, organized a relief army and forced Maurice to lift the siege. Mondragón next moved to Wesel, positioning his troops on the southern bank of the Lippe river to cover Rheinberg from a Dutch attack. Maurice aimed then, relying on his superior army, to entice Mondragón into a pitched battle, planning to use an ambush to draw the Spanish army into a trap. However, the plan was discovered by the Spanish commander, who organized a counter-ambush.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the <b>Gelderland</b> journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 <b>Gelderland</b> sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E
5|$|The Batavi, a Germanic tribe, {{inhabited}} the region today known as <b>Gelderland</b> (Netherlands), in the Rhine river delta, {{then known as}} the Insula Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi", because surrounded by branches of the Rhine), part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. They were a warlike people, skilled horsemen, boatmen and swimmers. In return for the unusual privilege of exemption from tributum (direct taxes on land and heads normally exacted from peregrini), they supplied {{a disproportionate number of}} recruits to the Julio-Claudian auxilia: one ala and eight cohortes. They also provided most of Augustus' elite personal bodyguard unit (the Germani corpore custodes), which continued in service until 68AD. The Batavi auxilia amounted to about 5,000 men, implying that during the entire Julio-Claudian period, over 50% of all Batavi males reaching military age (16 years) may have enlisted in the auxilia. Thus the Batavi, although just 0.05% of the total population of the empire of c. 70 million in 23AD, supplied about 4% of the total auxilia i.e. 80 times their proportionate share. They were regarded by the Romans as the very best (fortissimi, validissimi) of their auxiliary, and indeed all, their forces. In Roman service, both their cavalry and infantry had perfected a technique for swimming across rivers wearing full armour and weapons.|$|E
25|$|The Gelderlander was {{originally}} bred in the <b>Gelderland</b> {{region of the}} Netherlands. Although geographically close to Groningen, the soil in <b>Gelderland</b> is much sandier and {{does not require a}} horse with the same power as the Groningen horse. While breeders in Groningen used other horses bred on the heavy Frisian soil - the Alt-Oldenburger, East Friesian, and Holsteiner - those in <b>Gelderland</b> more often used half-bred French stallions as outcrosses. Therefore, Gelderlanders were and remain significantly longer-legged than their northern cousins, though they have the same high-set necks and level toplines.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} Orange's {{threat in the}} south, Alba sent his son Don Fadrique to the two rebellious provinces <b>Gelderland</b> and Holland. Fadrique started his {{campaign}} by the capture of the fortress-city of Zutphen in <b>Gelderland.</b> On his way to Amsterdam, Don Fadrique came across Naarden, which surrendered on 22 November 1572.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{have been}} elected in the States of North Holland between 1987 and 2003, South Holland (1995–1999) and <b>Gelderland</b> (1995–2003).|$|E
25|$|Within a short time, {{occupation}} by the Duke and his Landsknecht {{military force}} became unacceptable to many Frisians of both factions {{and with the}} support of the Duke of <b>Gelderland,</b> they unsuccessfully attempted to regain their old freedoms and put an end to the de-Friesing of Friesland.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{shows the}} {{election}} results of the 2011 provincial election in each province.

25|$|The Menapii {{stretched}} {{from the south}} of Zeeland, through North Brabant (and possibly South Holland), into the southeast of <b>Gelderland.</b> In later Roman times their territory {{seems to have been}} divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.|$|E
25|$|The Eburones, {{the largest}} of the Germani Cisrhenani group, covered a large area {{including}} at least part of modern Dutch Limburg, stretching east to the Rhine in Germany, and also northwest to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into <b>Gelderland.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the 13th and 14th centuries the ministeriales {{formed an}} {{intrinsic}} {{part of the}} lower nobility, and in the 15th century formed {{the core of the}} German knightly class (Ritterstand). Other regions were not as open, for as late as the fifteenth century the documents of the Dutch province of <b>Gelderland</b> continued to distinguish between knights of noble and of ministerial birth.|$|E
25|$|In 1449, nineteen-year-old James married fifteen-year-old Mary of Guelders, {{daughter}} of the Duke of <b>Gelderland.</b> She bore him seven children, six of whom survived into adulthood. Subsequently, the relations between Flanders and Scotland improved. James's nickname, Fiery Face, referred to a conspicuous vermilion birthmark on his face which {{appears to have been}} deemed by contemporaries an outward sign of a fiery temper.|$|E
25|$|The {{carnival}} in the Netherlands {{is mainly}} {{held in the}} southern part of the Netherlands in the provinces of Noord-Brabant and Limburg, some parts of Zeeland and in eastern parts of Twente and <b>Gelderland.</b> As with many popular festivals, people tend to loosen some moral codes and become laid-back or loose, which is based in the ancient role-reversal origins of Carnaval, including dressing in costumes.|$|E
25|$|Derksen {{was born}} in Heteren, <b>Gelderland</b> into a right-wing Protestant family. He {{describes}} his father as being a very strict policeman, both professionally and at home. Ever {{since he was a}} child, he wanted to become a drummer. Derksen, who was an only child, stated that his father wanted him to become a football player instead of choosing the uncertain life of a musician. He was already playing for the local team SDOO Heteren then.|$|E

25|$|North of the Old Rhine, {{apart from}} the Frisii, Pliny reports some Chauci reached into the delta, and two other tribes known from the eastern Netherlands were the Tuihanti (or Tubantes) from Twenthe in Overijssel, and the Chamavi, from Hamaland in {{northern}} <b>Gelderland,</b> who {{became one of the}} first tribes to be named as Frankish (see below). The Salians, also Franks, probably originated in Salland in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.|$|E
25|$|PSV have {{attracted}} around 33,000 people to Eredivisie matches on {{average in the}} last years. The record attendance stands at 35,200, achieved in a match against Feyenoord at 17 November 2002. The club always reserves tickets for away fans and individual ticket purchases; {{the maximum number of}} season ticket holders therefore is 29,200. All season tickets were sold out in 2007 and 2008. More recently in 2013, PSV sold 28,000 season tickets. Research showed that over 25,000 season ticket holders hail from Noord-Brabant, with other significant groups coming from Limburg, <b>Gelderland,</b> Zuid-Holland, Noord-Holland and Belgium.|$|E

It currently employs about 135 people.|$|E
25|$|Heinz sells many {{products}} in the Netherlands; the Elst factory in <b>Gelderland</b> is the primary production facility for Heinz sauces for Western Europe. In 2006, production of both HP Sauce and Daddies was transferred from Birmingham, West Midlands to Elst {{as a result of}} the acquisition of HP Foods and the subsequent closure of the Aston factory. Subsequently, Heinz suffered severe supply issues for the ex-HP Foods brands as the Elst factory struggled to integrate production, resulting in significant negative coverage from UK retailers. Heinz was forced to begin bottling sauce in Spain, shipping ready-made sauce from Elst, to get product back into supply.|$|E
25|$|But now the {{remarkable}} popular insurrection began {{that would save}} the Republic, and overturn the States-Party regime. Protests began in De Witt's hometown, Dordrecht, and soon spread to Rotterdam, Schiedam, Leiden and Amsterdam. In Rotterdam and Amsterdam the militias forced the vroedschap {{to vote against the}} capitulation. Nevertheless, on June 26 the States General voted four to three (Holland, and the three already occupied provinces Utrecht, <b>Gelderland</b> and Overijssel, against the rest) to send De Groot with a mandate to sign away the Generality Lands and offer a large war indemnity to Louis. Louis thought the offer insufficient, and sent De Groot back empty-handed. It was the last offer he would get.|$|E
25|$|Some of the dialects had until {{recently}} extensions across {{the borders of}} other standard language areas. In most cases the heavy influence of the standard language has broken the dialect continuum. Examples are the Gronings dialect spoken in Groningen {{as well as the}} closely related varieties in adjacent East Frisia (Germany). South Guelderish (Zuid-Gelders) is a dialect spoken in <b>Gelderland</b> (Netherlands) and in closely related varieties in adjacent parts of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). Limburgish (Limburgs) is spoken in Limburg (Belgium) as well as in Limburg (Netherlands) and extends across the German border. West Flemish (Westvlaams) is spoken in West Flanders, the western part of Zeelandic Flanders and also in French Flanders, where it virtually became extinct to make way for French.|$|E
25|$|After declaring their independence, {{the provinces}} of Holland, Zeeland, Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and <b>Gelderland</b> formed a confederation. All these duchies, lordships and {{counties}} were autonomous and had their own government, the States-Provincial. The States General, the confederal government, were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives {{from each of the}} seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic too, although it was not considered one of the provinces. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years' War a number of so-called Generality Lands in Flanders, Brabant and Limburg. Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own, and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a {{scion of}} a {{prominent}} family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although {{her husband had been}} raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in <b>Gelderland</b> ("Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait.|$|E
25|$|When Frederick Henry died in March, 1647, his son William II was {{appointed}} stadtholder in Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and <b>Gelderland</b> (the office {{was only to}} become hereditary in 1747). But {{he did not have}} the stature of his father, also because Frederick Henry did not think highly of his capabilities and had refused to allow him to lead troops in the field during the war against Spain that was then in its last stages. William was opposed to the peace with Spain, but he was largely ignored by the politicians in the States General, especially the representatives of the city of Amsterdam. The Peace of Münster was duly concluded in 1648, in spite of the opposition of the province of Zeeland and William, the latter deliberately absenting himself from the discussions to masque his impotence.|$|E
