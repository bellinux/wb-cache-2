Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E

25|$|Both {{of these}} EMFs, despite their {{apparently}} distinct origins, are {{described by the}} same equation, namely, the EMF is {{the rate of change}} of magnetic flux through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see below.) Einstein's special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects. In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the solenoidal vector field portion of the <b>E-field</b> can change {{in whole or in part}} to a B-field or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background is polarized {{at the level of}} a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (<b>E-field)</b> has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (B-field) has a vanishing divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from Thomson scattering in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the South Pole Telescope in 2013; the second one is from gravitational waves arising from cosmic inflation. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} {{controllable}} and precision approach in manipulating catalytic nanomotors by strategically applied electric (E-) fields {{in three dimensions}} (3 -D). With the high controllability, the catalytic nanomotors have demonstrated new versa-tility in capturing, delivering, and releasing of cargos to designated locations as well as in-situ integration with nanome-chanical devices (NEMS) to chemically power the actuation. With combined AC and DC <b>E-fields,</b> catalytic nanomotors can be accurately aligned by the AC <b>E-fields</b> and instantly change their speeds by the DC <b>E-fields.</b> Within the 3 -D orthog-onal microelectrode sets, the in-plane transport of catalytic nanomotors can be swiftly turned on and off, and these cata-lytic nanomotors can also move in the vertical direction. The interplaying nanoforces that govern the propulsion and alignment are investigated. The modeling of catalytic nanomotors proposed in previous works has been confirmed quan-titatively here. Finally, the prowess of the precision manipulation of catalytic nanomotors by <b>E-fields</b> is demonstrated in two applications: the capture, transport, and release of cargos to pre-patterned microdocks, and the assembly of catalytic nanomotors on NEMS to power the continuous rotation. The innovative concepts and approaches reported in this work could further advance ideal applications of catalytic nanomotors, e. g. for assembling and powering nanomachines, nano-robots, and complex NEMS devices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractResearch {{efforts in}} recent years have been {{directed}} toward actively controlling the direction of translocation of microtubules on a kinesin-coated glass surface with <b>E-fields</b> (electric fields), opening up the possibility of engineering controllable nanodevices that integrate microtubules and motor proteins into their function. Here, we present a detailed, biophysical model that quantitatively describes our observations on the steering of microtubules by electric fields. A sudden application of an electric field parallel to the surface and normal to the translocation direction of a microtubule bends the leading end toward the anode, because Coulombic (electrophoretic) forces are dominant on negatively charged microtubules. Modeling this bending as a cantilever deflection with uniform loading requires accurate mechanical and electrical properties of microtubules, including their charge density, viscous drag, and flexural rigidity. We determined the charge density of microtubules from measurements of the electrophoretic mobility in a “zero flow” capillary electrophoresis column and estimate it to be 256 e− per micron of length. Viscous drag forces on deflecting microtubules in electroosmotic flows were studied theoretically and experimentally by directly characterizing flows using a caged dye imaging method. The flexural rigidity of microtubules was measured by applying <b>E-fields</b> to microtubules with biotinylated segments that were bound to streptavidin-coated surfaces. From the calculated loading, and the Bernoulli-Euler curvature and moment equation, we find that the flexural rigidity of microtubules depends on their length, suggesting microtubules are anisotropic. Finally, our model accurately predicts the biophysical properties and behavior of microtubules directed by <b>E-fields,</b> which opens new avenues for the design of biomolecular nanotransport systems...|$|R
40|$|Viking era {{laboratory}} experiments show that mixing tribocharged grains {{in a low}} pressure CO 2 gas can form a discharge that glows, indicating {{the presence of an}} excited electron population that persists over many seconds. Based on these early experiments, it has been predicted that martian dust devils and storms may also contain a plasma and new plasma chemical species as a result of dust grain tribo-charging. However, recent results from modeling suggest a contrasting result: that a sustained electron discharge may not be easily established since the increase in gas conductivity would act to short-out the local <b>E-fields</b> and quickly dissipate the charged grains driving the process. In essence, the system was thought to be self-quenching (i. e., turn itself off). In this work, we attempt to reconcile the difference between observation and model via new laboratory measurements. We conclude that in a Mars-like low pressure CO 2 atmosphere and expected <b>E-fields,</b> the electron current remains (for the most part) below the expected driving tribo-electric dust currents (approx. 10 microA/m(exp. 2)), thereby making quenching unlikely...|$|R
