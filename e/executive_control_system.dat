40|$|International audienceObjective: Numerous {{studies using}} dual-task {{paradigms}} (postural and cognitive) {{have shown that}} postural control requires cognitive resources. However, the influence of postural control on attention components has never been directly addressed. Method: Using the attention network test (ANT), which assesses specifically each of the 3 components of attention—alertness, orientation, and executive control—within a single paradigm, we investigated the effect of postural balance demand on these 3 components. Forty-two participants completed the ANT in 3 postural conditions: (a) supine, a very stable position; (b) sitting on a chair, an intermediate position; and (c) standing with feet lined up heel to toe, a very instable position known as the Romberg position. Results: Our results revealed that the difficulty of postural control does modulate alerting {{in such a way}} that it improves with the level of instability of the position. Regarding the orienting and <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> components of attention, performance was not different when participants were standing upright or seated, whereas in the supine position, performance dropped. Conclusions: The strong and specific interaction between postural control and the alerting system suggests that these mechanisms may share parts of the underlying neural circuits. We discuss the possible implication of the locus coeruleus, known to be involved in both postural balance and alerting. Also, our findings concerning orienting and <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> suggest that supine posture could have a specific effect on cognitive activities. These effects are discussed in terms of particularities resulting from the supine position...|$|R

Disruption of attention is a characteristic symptom in schizophrenia, and further studies on selective attention are crucial for understanding the disease. The current study looks at how subjects with schizophrenia selectively attend to either a visual or auditory metronome {{in the presence of}} asynchronous cross-modal distractors of 3 different frequencies (0. 5, 1, and 2 Hz). Results showed that across all tasks of selective attention, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated increased variability in mean group reaction times compared to healthy volunteers. In addition, across all subjects (patients and controls), response times were most variable during the attend visual condition: a task in which subjects tapped in synchrony to a visual reversing checkerboard while ignoring an auditory metronome. Results also indicated that significantly more errors occurred in the highest (2 Hz) frequency condition. These findings are consistent with previous studies on healthy subjects showing that auditory distractors are more difficult to ignore than visual distractors during synchronized tapping. They are also consistent with studies revealing deficient selective attention in patients with schizophrenia. They do not, however, reveal any significant differences in patient vs. control performances during the auditory and visual conditions...|$|R
40|$|Only some, but not all, {{individuals}} who practice tasks with dual structure, overt and covert, {{are able to}} comprehend consciously a hidden regularity. The formation of implicit representations of regularity has been proposed to be critical for subsequent awareness. However, explicit knowledge also has been predicted by the activation of <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> during task encoding. The present study analysed performance patterns in participants who could comprehend task regularity and {{those who could not}} at delayed recall. Specifically, the role of practice-based knowledge of sequence for individual awareness was focused on. A lateralized variant of the visual serial response time task (SRTT) comprising structured and random blocks was practiced in implicit conditions by 109 participants before and after 10 -h retention, with explicit knowledge about covert sequence tested thereafter. Sequence learning was quantified using the normalized difference between response speed in regular and subsequent random blocks. Patterns of performance dynamics were evaluated using response speed, response variability, and error rate. Major results demonstrate that (1) All participants who became aware of the sequence (solvers), gained practice-based sequence knowledge at learning or after retention, (2) Such knowledge also was accumulated during learning by participants who remained fully unaware about covert task structure, (3) Only in explicit solvers, however, was sequence-specific learning accompanied by a prominent increase in performance variability. (4) Specific features and dynamics of performance patterns distinguished different cognitive modes of SRTT processing, each of which supported subsequent knowledge awareness. It is concluded that a behavioural precursor of sequence awareness is the combination of speeded sequence processing and increased performance variability, pointing to an interaction between implicit and explicit processing systems. These results may contribute to refine the evaluation of online and offline learning of tasks with dual structure, and to extend understanding of increased behavioral variability in both normal and pathological conditions...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive {{hypotheses}} of hypnotic phenomena {{have proposed}} that executive attentional systems may be either inhibited or overactivated to produce a selective alteration or disconnection of some mental operations. Recent brain imaging studies have reported changes in activity in both medial (anterior cingulate) and lateral (inferior) prefrontal areas during hypnotically induced paralysis, overlapping with areas associated with attentional control as well as inhibitory processes. To compare motor inhibition mechanisms responsible for paralysis during hypnosis and those recruited by voluntary inhibition, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity during a modified bimanual Go-Nogo task, which was performed either in a normal baseline condition or during unilateral paralysis caused by hypnotic suggestion or by simulation (in two groups of participants, each tested once with both hands valid and once with unilateral paralysis). This paradigm allowed us to identify patterns of neural activity specifically associated with hypnotically induced paralysis, relative to voluntary inhibition during simulation or Nogo trials. We used a topographical EEG analysis technique to investigate both the spatial organization and the temporal sequence of neural processes activated in these different conditions, and to localize the underlying anatomical generators through minimum-norm methods. We found that preparatory activations were similar in all conditions, despite left hypnotic paralysis, indicating preserved motor intentions. A large P 3 -like activity was generated by voluntary inhibition during voluntary inhibition (Nogo), with neural sources in medial prefrontal areas, while hypnotic paralysis {{was associated with a}} distinctive topography activity during the same time-range and specific sources in right inferior frontal cortex. These results add support to the view that hypnosis might act by enhancing <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> mediated by right prefrontal areas, but does not produce paralysis via direct motor inhibition processes normally used for the voluntary suppression of actions...|$|R
40|$|Executive {{functions}} are {{the constellation of}} higher-level control processes that enable individuals to monitor and regulate cognitive processing. Evidence regarding whether executive function deficits contributes to reading difficulties in children characterized by decoding deficits remains controversial. In this thesis, a range of executive functions were assessed in three samples of English children with reading difficulties whose performance was {{compared to that of}} chronological-age matched control children. Results from the first study showed that children with reading difficulties performed poorly in working memory and in inhibiting prepotent response. A second study replicated this finding and further established that the impairments in working memory, inhibition and dual task coordination were highly restricted to the tasks requiring processing of verbal materials. These patterns were confirmed in a third study employing a range of inhibition-related tasks in addition to measures of working memory and the dual task coordination. Overall, this work does not point to a generalized executive function deficit in children with reading difficulties. Rather, verbal executive function deficits in children with reading difficulties may arise as a consequence of their phonological deficits. Moreover, the finding that group difference in verbal executive functions persisted after the phonological deficit was taken into account gives rise to two possibilities. First, poor performance in executive function measures may surface as a function of certain task requirements, notably the combination of verbal material processing and executive demands. The possible role of phonological deficit that requires executive involvement to compensate in children with reading difficulties was proposed and discussed. Secondly, an impaired connection between the phonological processing and <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> may contribute to both the phonological deficits and verbal executive functions deficits among children with reading difficulties.

Global inhibition refers to suppression of an entire language system, e.g. inhibiting Spanish when speaking English, and local inhibition refers to inhibition of a more specific competing vocabulary, e.g. the translation of the same word or phrase. Local inhibition mostly affects linguistic performance whereas global inhibition affects both linguistic and cognitive performance.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{consciousness}} and hypnosis is presented {{which has its}} origins {{in a series of}} neuropsychological studies on the role of neocortex in associative learning and memory in animals. It is essentially an evolutionary and hierarchical description of increasingly more sophisticated levels of information processing in vertebrate brains which places the more recently evolved systems that are associated with subjective experience into a more meaningful perspective. With the evolution of representa-tional systems (consciousness systems) with the capacity for parallel processing a need was created for an <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to prioritize some currently active representations as the basis for action, particularly in novel situations. Consequently, a major function of the <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is in the re-representation of a selected subset of these representations for further processing in a subsystem (self-awareness system) with priority access to action. Representations that enter the latter subsystem constitute the contents of our subjective experience. In hypnosis, it is argued, influence is exerted through the <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to orchestrate the re-representation of information into the self-awareness system and hence to influ-ence the nature of subjective experience. Important among the pressures acting on the <b>executive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> are those identified by sociocognitive theories as capable of influencing hypnotic enactment and experience.
