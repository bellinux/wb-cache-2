5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> humorous comment.|$|E

25|$|Kicker Gary Anderson {{missed a}} 40-yard field goal attempt on Philadelphia's first possession. In the second quarter, San Francisco quarterback Steve Young {{completed}} 6/7 passes for 60 yards on a 74-yard drive and finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 9-yard touchdown run. The Eagles then reached the San Francisco 8-yard line, but quarterback Ty Detmer threw an interception to defensive back Marquez Pope. The 49ers {{were forced to}} punt on their next drive, and Philadelphia advanced to the San Francisco 5-yard line. However, 49ers defensive end Roy Barker intercepted Detmer with 43 {{seconds left in the}} half, and the Eagles would never seriously threaten again.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{the ball}} back after the missed field goal, Cincinnati put the game away with a 14-play {{touchdown}} drive. Anderson was injured early in the drive and replaced for two plays by Jack Thompson. But Johnson kept the Bengals moving on those plays, first rushing for eight yards and then gaining 14 yards on a screen pass on third down and 8. Later on the drive, Johnson converted a fourth and inches situation with a 7-yard run, and Anderson eventually finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3-yard touchdown pass to Bass, making the final score 27–7. San Diego responded with a drive to the Bengals 5-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs with less than three minutes left.|$|E
25|$|Green Bay regrouped on {{the opening}} drive of the second half, moving the ball 73 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 25-yard {{completion}} from Favre to receiver Donald Driver. Favre finished the drive with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Driver, but the receiver was knocked {{out of the game}} on the play, and Atlanta responded with a 73-yard scoring drive of their own. The key play of the drive was a 22-yard scramble by Vick, while Feely finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 23-yard field goal that gave the Falcons a 27-7 lead. There was still 3:46 left in the third quarter, but this would be the game's final score.

Kosar had a 16-yard scramble on the possession, and eventually wrapped it up with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Brian Brennan, cutting the score to 10-7. However, Denver responded with a touchdown of their own, as Sammy Winder (filling in for injured starter Bobby Humphrey) rushed for 22 yards on the drive, while Elway completed a 53-yard pass to Young and finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 5-yard scoring pass to tight end Orson Mobley, putting the team back up by 10 points at 17-7.

25|$|Favre {{completed}} six {{of eight}} passes for 43 {{yards in the}} first half, including a 5-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman that gave the Packers a 6–0 lead after San Francisco lineman Dana Stubblefield blocked the extra point. The Packers defense limited San Francisco to just 53 yards and a blocked field goal on their first four drives, but the 49ers closed out the half with a 15-play, 86-yard drive that took seven minutes off the clock. Quarterback Jeff Garcia completed six of nine passes for 61 yards on the drive, and running back Garrison Hearst capped <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2-yard touchdown run to give his team a 7–6 halftime lead. It {{marked the first time}} Green Bay had ever trailed {{at the end of the}} first half in a home playoff game since the famous Ice Bowl in 1967.|$|E
25|$|Miami {{continued}} {{to turn the}} ball over through the second quarter. Beasley recorded his second interception from Marino on the Dolphins next possession. Then after a punt, running back Autry Denson fumbled a pitch from Marino, and safety Donovin Darius recovered the ball at the Dolphins 7-yard line. This time, the Jaguars could {{not take advantage of}} the turnover. Two plays later, Dolphins defensive back Calvin Jackson intercepted a pass from Fiedler in the end zone. But several plays after the interception, Jacksonville safety Carnell Lake forced and recovered a fumble from J. J. Johnson on the Dolphins 30-yard line, setting up a 30-yard field goal from Hollis with 1:47 left in the second quarter. Marino, who completed only three of 11 passes for 12 yards up to this point, finally managed to respond, completing seven of 12 passes for 79 yards on an 80-yard scoring drive and finishing <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 20-yard touchdown pass to Oronde Gadsden with less than 20 seconds left before halftime.|$|E

25|$|Playing without star {{receiver}} Sterling Sharpe, who {{had suffered}} a career-ending neck injury {{at the end of}} the season, Green Bay scored first with a 14-play, 76-yard drive. Packers quarterback Brett Favre completed 7/8 passes for 57 yards, while Dorsey Levens finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3-yard touchdown run on fourth and inches. In the second quarter, Packers kicker Chris Jacke missed a 37-yard field goal attempt, but with 2:56 left in the half, he increased the score to 10-0 on a 51-yard field goal (a franchise posteason record) at the end of a 37-yard drive jump-started by Favre's 20-yard completion to tight end Mark Chmura. Detroit responded with Dave Krieg's 46-yard completion to Brett Perriman, earning them a first down on the Packers 11-yard line. But after two incompletions and a 1-yard loss by Sanders, Jason Hanson's 30-yard field goal attempt was no good.|$|E
25|$|New York {{took the}} opening kickoff and scored quickly, driving 67 yards in seven plays and scoring with Eli Manning's 17-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Plaxico Burress only 3:12 into the game. All of the remaining drives {{of the first quarter}} ended in punts, but early in the second quarter, Eagles running back Brian Westbrook's 49-yard touchdown run tied the game at seven. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Philadelphia defensive back Sheldon Brown intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it to the Giants 37-yard line, setting up a 19-yard field goal by Akers to take a 10–7 lead. On New York's ensuing possession, a 41-yard run by halfback Tiki Barber sparked a 78-yard drive capped by Jay Feely's 20-yard field goal to tie the game with 4:45 left in the half. Philadelphia responded, with quarterback Jeff Garcia leading the Eagles down the field 80 yards in ten plays and finishing <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 28-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Donté Stallworth, giving his team a 17–10 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Miami quarterback Dan Marino {{completed}} 14 of 18 {{passes in}} the first half for 151 yards as he led the team to three consecutive touchdowns. On their first touchdown drive, he completed 4/7 passes for 65 yards, the last an 8-yard scoring pass to tight end Keith Jackson. San Diego responded by driving 72 yards in 15 plays to score on a John Carney field goal. Receiver O. J. McDuffie returned the following kickoff 42 yards to the Miami 48-yard line, and the Dolphins ended up scoring another touchdown on Marino's 9-yard pass to Jackson, giving them a 14-3 lead with 7:21 left in the second quarter. The Chargers then drove 60 yards, including three carries by Natrone Means for 38, to score on Carney's second field goal. But this was countered again, with the Dolphins moving the ball 70 yards on a drive that featured a 24-yard reception by Irving Fryar. Marino finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 16-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mike Williams with 27 seconds left on the clock, giving the Dolphins a 21-6 halftime lead.|$|E

50|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, McNair led the Titans on a 70-yard scoring drive, {{completing}} 5 consecutive passes for 59 yards and capping <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 11-yard touchdown pass to Mason. The rest {{of the third quarter}} was scoreless, but midway through the fourth quarter, Troy Brown's 10-yard punt return gave the Patriots great field position at the Titans 40-yard line. The Patriots gained only 13 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was enough for Vinatieri to make a 46-yard field goal, giving New England <b>a</b> 17-14 lead <b>with</b> 4:02 left in regulation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Baltimore {{defensive}} back Chris McAlister gave the offense {{a great chance}} to score when he intercepted a pass from Stewart and returned it 18 yards to the Steelers 7-yard line. But on the next play, safety Brent Alexander intercepted Grbac's pass {{in the end zone}} for a touchback. The Steelers took over and drove to the Ravens 9-yard line, but on third down, Stewart was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Larry Webster and Brown's ensuing field goal attempt was wide left. Following another three and out for Baltimore, receiver Troy Edwards returned their punt 27-yards to the Ravens 43-yard line, setting up Zereoue's second touchdown run. Then linebacker Jason Gildon recovered a fumble from Terry Allen on Baltimore's next drive and the Steelers capitalized with a 46-yard field goal from Brown, increasing their lead to 20–0 with 4:23 left in the half. After going all this time without a single first down, Baltimore finally managed to respond on their next drive. Tight end Shannon Sharpe caught four passes for 48 yards on an 11-play, 57-yard drive. Matt Stover capped <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 26-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 20–3 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Bills {{took the}} opening kickoff and scored with a typical fast-paced drive, moving the ball 76 yards in five plays. Running back Thurman Thomas rushed for 14 yards {{and caught a}} pass for 20, while Jim Kelly {{finished}} <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 40-yard touchdown pass to receiver Andre Reed. Aided by three Bills penalties, the Dolphins responded with a 40-yard drive that ended on Pete Stoyanovich's 49-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 7-3. The Bills struck back with Kelly's 44-yard completion to James Lofton setting up a 24-yard Scott Norwood field goal, retaking their 7-point lead at 10-3. On the next series, Miami quarterback Dan Marino threw a pass that was tipped by Darryl Talley and intercepted by defensive back Nate Odomes, who returned the ball nine yards to the Dolphins 38. Faced with third and 8 on their ensuing possession, Kelly took off for a 16-yard gain. He fumbled at the end, but center Kent Hull recovered the ball for a first down on the 18-yard line. Norwood completed the drive with his second field goal, this one from 22 yards, upping the lead to 13-3.|$|E
25|$|Trailing 15–0 at halftime, the Colts {{finally managed}} to build some {{momentum}} in the third quarter. First, Dominic Rhodes gave them great field position by returning the second half kickoff 35 yards to the 49-yard line. Then running back Edgerrin James spearheaded a 52-yard scoring drive, carrying the ball on seven of 12 plays for 32 yards and capping <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2-yard touchdown run to cut the score to 15–7. But the Patriots took {{over the rest of}} the quarter. After Patrick Pass returned the ensuing kickoff 21 yards to the 43-yard line, Brady completed passes to Larry Centers for 28 yards, Brown for 17, and Kevin Faulk for 8, setting up Vinatieri's third field goal to increase their lead to 18–7. Three plays after the ensuing kickoff, Indianapolis was forced to punt. Antowain Smith then rushed four times for 53 yards on New England's next possession, advancing the ball to the Colts 3-yard line where Vinatieri kicked his fourth field goal. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Law recorded his second interception from Manning on the Colts 31-yard line. But this time, the Patriots failed to score because defensive back Walt Harris picked off a pass from Brady in the end zone.|$|E
