40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a simple method for the automated data acquisition and analysis of data taken by programmable instruments. Device controls and communication method are explained and some typical illustrative examples showing the potential applications of the method in real experiments are presented. This method oers a quick and exible way to control many instruments by using a multi-device arrangement of a stacking method in a parallel operation. The <b>General-Purpose</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Bus</b> (GPIB) is used here for remote control of the devices. By using Excel and Visa interactive programs and using GPIB interface, easy communication and data transfer between instruments and a PC is accomplished. A special probe system is devised for the small resistant measuring experiments and the DC resistance measurements are performed by using the four-probe method. The related temperatures are measured by using a silicone diode as a resistance thermometer detector. Using this data acquisition method, short circuit voltage measurement, resistance measurements and the temperature dependence of resistance for a thin platinum wire are reported...|$|E
40|$|The frequency-multiplier {{submillimeter}} spectrometer (FMSS) is {{a laboratory}} apparatus for far-infrared molecular spectroscopy, embodying several advances over prior such apparatuses. The most innovative {{part of the}} FMSS {{is a source of}} monochromatic submillimeter- wavelength radiation that can be tuned over a wide frequency range, as needed for trace gas analyses and molecular- structure studies for which such apparatuses are typically used. The radiation source features a modular design and is built mostly from commercially available components. It includes a computer-controlled radio-frequency synthesizer, amplifiers, and frequency multipliers of a type heretofore used in local oscillators for heterodyne far-infrared receivers. In conjunction {{with the rest of the}} apparatus, this source makes it possible to perform measurements over large portions of the submillimeter-wavelength spectrum with resolution, accuracy, and sensitivity greater than those achievable in Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In comparison with prior laboratory submillimeter- wavelength radiation sources, this source is much lighter in weight, less cumbersome, less power-hungry, and capable of sustained operation with less intervention by laboratory personnel. Also, unlike some prior submillimeter-wavelength sources, this source does not require a high-voltage power source. As shown in more detail in the figure, the radiation source includes a sweep frequency synthesizer connected to an external waveform generator, the output of which is used as a reference signal. The synthesizer is computer-controlled through a standard <b>general-purpose</b> <b>interface</b> <b>bus</b> (GPIB) and is operated in phase-locked continuous- wave mode for all measurements. The synthesizer output ranges in frequency from 11 to 18 GHz. For suppression of frequency spurs and harmonics, the output of the frequency synthesizer is fed through a tunable yttrium iron garnet (YIG) filter, which is swept in frequency simultaneously with the frequency synthesizer...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the first bus used for {{communication}} {{was developed by}} Hewlett-Packard and was called HP-IB (Hewlett-Packard <b>Interface</b> <b>Bus).</b> Since HP-IB was originally designed to only work with HP instruments, the need arose for a standard, high-speed interface for communication between instruments and controllers {{from a variety of}} vendors. This need was addressed in 1975 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) published ANSI/IEEE Standard 488-1975, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, which contained the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of an interfacing system. The standard was updated in 1987 and again in 1992 This bus is known by three different names, General Purpose <b>Interface</b> <b>Bus</b> (GPIB), Hewlett-Packard <b>Interface</b> <b>Bus</b> (HP-IB), and IEEE-488 Bus, and is used worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, Hewlett-Packard {{designed}} the Hewlett-Packard <b>Interface</b> <b>Bus</b> ( [...] HP-IB [...] ) to connect their line of programmable instruments to their computers. Because {{of its high}} transfer rate at the time (nominally 1 Mbytes/s), this <b>interface</b> <b>bus</b> quickly gained popularity. It was later accepted as IEEE Standard 488-1975, and has evolved to ANSI/IEEE Standard 488.1-1987. Today, the name General Purpose <b>Interface</b> <b>Bus</b> (GPIB) is more widely used than HP-IB. ANSI/IEEE 488.2-1987 strengthened the original standard by defining precisely how controllers and instruments communicate. Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI) took the command structures defined in IEEE 488.2 and created a single, comprehensive programming command set that is used with any SCPI instrument. Many Tektronix instruments, including the 2430-series oscilloscopes, are available with GPIB interface cards.|$|R

5000|$|The MCS-96 family {{originated}} as {{a commercial}} derivative of the Intel 8061, the first processor in the Ford EEC-IV engine controller family. Differences between the 8061 and the 8096 include the memory <b>interface</b> <b>bus,</b> the 8061's M-Bus being a 'burst-mode' bus requiring a tracking program counter in the memory devices. There were also considerable differences in the I/O peripherals of the two parts - the 8061 had 8 HSI (pulse-measurement) inputs, 10 HSO (pulse-generation) outputs entirely separated from the HSI pins, and a non-sampling 10-bit ADC with more channels than the 8096 had. Many differences between the EEC-IV and the 8096 resulted from an effort to share pins to reduce I/O pin count in favor of using the pins for a more conventional memory <b>interface</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|R
