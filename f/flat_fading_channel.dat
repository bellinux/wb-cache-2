40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{trade-off}} between time diversity and the inter-carrier interference (ICI) in an OFDM based MC-CDMA system is discussed. Our {{approach is to}} partially shift each spectrum of an OFDM symbol at the transmitter by using different phase shifts in the time domain at different antennas after the OFDM modulation. The summary signal at the receiver has a wider Doppler spectrum {{as the result of}} different uncorrelated Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> This leads to an artificially increased selective time channel transfer function, which is more favorable for the channel decoder at the receiver. The trade-off between Doppler diversity and ICI is found at about 9 % maximum Doppler spread of the subcarrier distance for <b>flat</b> <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> and frequency selective <b>fading</b> <b>channel</b> models. The distance to the independent Rayleigh channel bound by applying an MMSE detector is less than 2 dBfor convolutional coding and about 2 dBfor turbo coding at a BER of 10 - 3 for <b>flat</b> <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> For frequency selective <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> this approaches to less than 1 dBto the independent Rayleigh channel bound...|$|R
