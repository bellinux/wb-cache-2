40|$|In {{building}} {{a system of}} <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> important place belongs to its diverse and adequate provision. Legal regulation of relations {{in the field of}} <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is aimed at organizing social relations arising in the process of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> That legal regulation of relations in the sphere of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is exercised through a system of effective legal, regulatory and organizational influence on social relationships that develop in the course of state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> Legal regulation of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is to organize social relations which are formed in the process of state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> In the field of legal provision of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> and enforcement practice in Ukraine there are some problems. So, first, the notion of "a unified system of state financial control" is not regulated by any domestic law, and therefore the activity of many regulatory bodies remains uncoordinated properly, resulting in duplication of functions, remains high (and sometimes excessive) "control" load by controlled entities. Secondly, there is no basic law of Ukraine on the state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> which would define the essence of state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> its functional purpose, principles of organization, objects and subjects, and the object types, forms, techniques and methods of its implementation. Thirdly, the status of Supreme Audit Institution is not legally secured. Fourthly, applicable laws and regulations in the area of public <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> sometimes are not consistent. Finally, the legislation virtually governs the organization of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> at the regional and municipal levels, which causes lack of a unified system of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> at the level of business and local government. To ensure full and high-quality legal support system of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> it is necessary to deepen diverse theoretical research on this subject, learn positive foreign experience and critically analyze existing national practice, to use in supervisory authorities practice recent achievements of knowledge management, information technology and financial management, to improve the overall economic culture...|$|R

The overall goal for all branches of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is to ensure that the financial activities of the state, that are activities of formation, distribution and use of centralized and decentralized public funds of monetary resources. At the root of the <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> in the Russian Empire creation was Mikhail Speransky. During rule of the Emperor Nicholas I, activities on the State control (audit) were more solid and detailed in the regulatory framework: rules on the account keeping have been established accounts and reports of ministries were established, senatorial audits were held regularly. Large-scale reforms in the mid nineteenth century, including changes in the financial sector, put the question of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> modernization on the agenda. As a result of the state control (audit) reform, it turned into the united audit body, with the power of documentary audit in all state institutions in the center and in regions.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{is to examine the}} essence of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> {{identify}} directions of its improvement and define effective methods for its evaluation. On the basis of the results of analysis of modern scientific works it is determined that the precondition for building an effective state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> system is defining its role in public financial relationships. According to the data of the conducted study it was concluded that first of all, the state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> is an instrument of fiscal policy and, therefore, its direct purpose is ensuring a sustainable socio-economic development of the country, i. e., achieving the goal of the fiscal policy. Besides, there revealed the need to harmonize the components of the fiscal policy and types of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> in order to build an effective institutional structure of public administration. It is proved that the division of the state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> into internal and external must be conducted in accordance with the fact whether the controlling body and the subject under control belong to the same or different branch of power. Also {{the results of the study}} suggest that for Ukraine it is expedient to choose the model of a decentralized internal state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> instead of the existing mixed one in order to avoid duplication by the State Audit Service of Ukraine bodies of partially the functions of the Audit Chamber, and partially those of internal control departments, which operate in the executive branch. There determined inappropriateness of building a system of state internal <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> on the basis of the principles provided for the bodies of the external state <b>financial</b> <b>control.</b> This situation leads to ungrounded definition of the internal control as an object of internal audit, which is carried out by structural units in budget organizations. It is also important to emphasize the need to evaluate managerial decisions in exercising the audit of the control effectiveness in order to increase the responsibility of officials.
