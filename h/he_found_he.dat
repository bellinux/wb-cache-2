5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied with what <b>he</b> <b>found,</b> <b>he</b> relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E
5|$|Despite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker's only interest. His parents {{recognized}} his intellectual talents, especially for mathematics, {{and sent the}} adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> also had a talent for chess). Lasker gained his abitur (high school graduation certificate) at Landsberg an der Warthe, now a Polish town named Gorzów Wielkopolski but then part of Prussia. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, Göttingen (where David Hilbert {{was one of his}} doctoral advisors) and Heidelberg.|$|E

5|$|Frederick Pepper {{was born}} in 1887, one of nine {{children}} in Netherfield, Nottinghamshire, a small town prospering from the instalment of the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway. He was educated at the local Ashwell and Chandos Street Schools, the latter amalgamating in 1973 to form Carlton le Willows School. Customarily leaving school at 14, Frederick found employment with London and North Eastern Railway as a fireman; it was around this time <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> had an aptitude for association football, and began playing professionally in 1908 aged 21.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} early season games for MCC and A. J. Webbe's XI, all of Bosanquet's cricket in 1901 was for Middlesex. He {{maintained}} his faster style of bowling but {{also began to}} bowl slow leg breaks, with the as-yet unrecognised googly mixed in as variation. Later, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> could not effectively maintain both styles and decided to concentrate on spin, gradually dropping his quick bowling. His bowling brought him 36 wickets {{at an average of}} 37.52 in 1901 but did not take more than three wickets in a single innings. With the bat, it took until July for him to pass fifty runs in an innings but his form improved in August with four fifties. He ended the season with consecutive centuries against Surrey and Essex. In total, Bosanquet scored 1,240 runs at an average of 32.63, and Warner regarded him as one of the three most reliable batsmen in the Middlesex side. After the season, Bosanquet went on his third tour of America, captaining a team himself. From January to April 1902, he toured the West Indies with Richard Bennett's team. He scored 623 runs at an average of 34.61 with five fifties and 55 wickets at an average of 15.47, including figures of eight for 30 in one innings. Bosanquet's cricket followed a similar pattern in 1902. He scored 749 runs at an average of 24.96, with a century against Cambridge. However, he did not pass fifty after the end of May until his last game of the season. With the ball, he took 40 wickets at an average of 21.17. These included 10 wickets against Oxford and 10 against Nottinghamshire; the latter performance, when he took seven for 57 in the second innings was described as remarkable by Wisden. It {{was the first time that}} his new bowling style attracted attention, although Bosanquet himself tried to play down the success for fear of alerting batsmen to his googly.|$|E

25|$|Through {{an adult}} class at a Methodist church {{he learned of}} the Casa de Todos clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, in about 1960. He {{reflected}} on the experience in a 1967 article.

But <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> needed to do something more substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} by some that the Duke of Brunswick was well-inclined {{to enter into}} the views of the Pope, but that <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> could neither raise men nor money {{sufficient}} to warrant even a probability of success. This we are inclined to doubt, for had Otho been ambitious, he might have obtained the empire without much difficulty; and supported as he was by England and Denmark, it is not likely that he could have been at a loss for an army, or for the means of supporting it.|$|E

25|$|After his father's death {{he spent}} four years at the University of Paris, where he began the study of Greek under Adrianus Turnebus. But after two months <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> {{was not in a}} {{position}} to profit from the lectures of the greatest Greek scholar of the time. He read Homer in twenty-one days, and then went through all the other Greek poets, orators and historians, forming a grammar for himself as he went along. From Greek, at the suggestion of Guillaume Postel, he proceeded to attack Hebrew, and then Arabic; of both he acquired a respectable knowledge.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Slocum's book {{revenues}} and income from public lectures provided him enough financial security {{to purchase a}} small farm in West Tisbury, {{on the island of}} Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts. After a year and a half, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> could not adapt to a settled life and Slocum sailed the Spray from port to port in the northeastern US during the summer and the West Indies during the winter, lecturing and selling books wherever he could. Slocum spent little time with his wife on the Vineyard and preferred life aboard the Spray, usually wintering in the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|Hartnell {{continued}} to play comic characters until he was cast in the robust role of Sergeant Ned Fletcher in The Way Ahead (1944). From then on his career was defined by playing mainly policemen, soldiers, and thugs. This typecasting bothered him, for even when cast in comedies <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> was invariably playing the 'heavy'. In 1958 he played the sergeant in the first Carry On film comedy, Carry On Sergeant, and appeared as a town councillor in the Boulting brothers' film Heavens Above! (1963) with Peter Sellers. He also appeared as Will Buckley – another military character – in the film The Mouse That Roared (1959), again with Sellers.|$|E

25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (birefringence) in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate what <b>he</b> <b>found.</b> <b>He</b> later explained it with his wave front theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show birefringence. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a transverse wave theory. For a view from modern physics see wave–particle duality.|$|E
25|$|As well as testing {{conditions}} {{during and after}} the monsoon, the expedition was to test likely climbers for 1936 and follow up the exploratory work of the 1921 reconnaissance. Explicitly there was to be no summit attempt and supplementary oxygen {{was not going to be}} used. Tilman initially regretted having to abandon the Nanda Devi summit attempt but Shipton persuaded him by the lightweight exploratory nature of what was being planned. Charles Warren and Edmund Wigram, both Cambridge medics, Edwin Kempson a Cambridge mathematician, and Dan Bryant, an ice climber from New Zealand agreed to take part. Shipton considered this complement quite ample but <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> had a surveyor, Michael Spender added to the team. Spender had made himself extremely unpopular on earlier expeditions due to his conceit and there were rumours that his inclusion was due to mischief making. All the same, Shipton and Spender became close friends.|$|E
25|$|When {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{took office}} in 1963, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and believed {{to be that of}} former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the Resolute desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the C desk that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the Resolute desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.|$|E

25|$|The couple {{moved to}} America so that Plath {{could take a}} {{teaching}} position at her alma mater, Smith College; during this time Hughes taught at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In 1958 they met Leonard Baskin, who would later illustrate many of Hughes's books, including Crow. The couple returned to England, staying {{for a short while}} back in Heptonstall and then finding a small flat in Primrose Hill, London. They were both writing, Hughes working on programmes for the BBC as well as producing essays, articles, reviews and talks. During this time he wrote the poems that would be published in Wodwo (1967) and Recklings (1966). In March 1960 Lupercal came out and won the Hawthornden Prize. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> was being labelled as the poet of the wild, writing only about animals. He began to seriously explore myth and esoteric practices within as shamanism, Buddhism and alchemy, perceiving that imagination could heal dualistic splits in the human psyche and poetry was the language of the work.|$|E
25|$|In the chaos, Wayne and Stella {{escape to}} a dock, but are cornered {{by a group}} of Shadows. Stella pleads with Wayne to kill her, causing him to recall a {{repressed}} memory; upon returning to his home after the outbreak, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> had only two bullets in his gun. With the house under siege from Shadows, Shannon pleaded with him to kill her and Lydia. With great reluctance, Wayne did so. Having remembered the incident, he refuses to repeat it by killing Stella, instead telling her she must survive and never give up hope. He breaks the wood of the dock, allowing Stella to make it to a nearby sailboat and drift away. Wayne apologizes to his deceased daughter, who appears in front of him, as he laments he should have died with her. However, he is happy they will be together again soon. As the Shadows race towards him, Wayne accepts his fate.|$|E
25|$|After World War I was {{declared}} in 1914, {{with his brothers}} and many friends in military service and himself exempted, Duchamp felt uncomfortable in Paris. Meanwhile, Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2 had scandalized Americans at the Armory Show, and helped secure the sale of all four of his paintings in the exhibition. Thus, being able to finance the trip, Duchamp decided to emigrate to the United States in 1915. To his surprise, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>he</b> was a celebrity {{when he arrived in}} New York in 1915, where he quickly befriended art patron Katherine Dreier and artist Man Ray. Duchamp's circle included art patrons Louise and Walter Conrad Arensberg, actress and artist Beatrice Wood and Francis Picabia, as well as other avant-garde figures. Though he spoke little English, in the course of supporting himself by giving French lessons and through some library work, he quickly learned the language. Duchamp became part of an artist colony in Ridgefield, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City.|$|E
