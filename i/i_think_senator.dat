60|$|My friend went {{on summer}} {{vacation}} {{up into the}} fishing regions of our northern British neighbors, and carried this sermon with him, since he might possibly chance to need a sermon. He was asked to preach, one day. The little church was full. Among the people present were the late Dr. J. G. Holland, the late Mr. Seymour of the 'New York Times,' Mr. Page, the philanthropist and temperance advocate, and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Senator</b> Frye, of Maine. The marvelous letter did its wonted work; all the people were moved, all the people wept; the tears flowed in a steady stream down Dr. Holland's cheeks, and nearly {{the same can be}} said with regard to all who were there. Mr. Page was so full of enthusiasm over the letter that he said he would not rest until he made pilgrimage to that prison, and had speech with the man who had been able to inspire a fellow-unfortunate to write so priceless a tract.|$|E
5000|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie:Governor Chris Christie: “I {{just want}} to make clear that I have been working on this issue in my role on the {{executive}} committee of the National Governors Association because it is an important issue to all the nation’s governors. And I too - along with governors like Governor Daniels and others - urge {{the federal government and the}} Congress in particular to get behind Senator Lamar Alexander’s legislation to allow states to be able to make these choices for themselves. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Senator</b> Alexander’s legislation would be a great step forward in that regard. It would give states options to decide how they want to deal with this and not have to any longer deal with the federal prohibition on dealing with it. So, it would allow us to do it in a much more uniform and broader way. So, I’m with Governor Daniels on this and other Republican governors - Governor Snyder of Michigan and others who feel strongly about it. And we’ve been working on it at the National Governors Association and I know we will continue to and hope to get some type of resolution to it by the end of this year.” ...|$|E
50|$|When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of the <b>Senator</b> of the Third District {{during the}} time he was occupying his seat - now veiled with crepes of {{mourning}} - in this august Senate, he seated beside me and was the most committed supporter of certain issues I sucitated in the parliamentary debates. I, like the whole Archipelago, cannot help but lament at his loss. His death assumes the total sorrowful meaning of a national loss. And I say national loss, because his dynamism, his vigor and his patriotism channeled to serve the country in these historical moments will be of great and undisputed value; will be positive contributions in the task of nation building whose completion we anxiously hope for.|$|R

Well, prithee be plain with me, and tell me the reason and ground of thy discouragement. Why, says the sinner, though God forbids me not, and though I am willing to come faster, yet there naturally ariseth this, and that, and the other thought in my heart, that hinders my speed to Jesus Christ. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am not chosen; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am not called; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am come too late; and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know not {{what it is to}} come.

My argument is this: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were created to experience life to the full. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were made to feel joy and peace and sorrow and love in their fullest forms. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that we came from something big before we got here, and that we’re going somewhere big when we leave here, and so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> God created us to be something.
