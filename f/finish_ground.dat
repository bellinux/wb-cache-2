The as-forged and unground AISI 4620 gear exhibited a 10 percent fatigue life that was approximately one-fourth of that for AISI 9310 and less than one-half that for the AISI 4340 gears. The forged and <b>finish</b> <b>ground</b> AISI 4620 gears exhibited a 10 percent life, approximately 70 percent that of AISI 9310 and slightly better than that of AISI 4340.

40|$|Surface pitting {{fatigue life}} tests were {{conducted}} with five lubricants, using spur gears made from a single lot of consumable-electrode vacuum melted (CVM) AISI 9310 steel. The gears were case carbonized and hardened to a Rockwell c- 60 and <b>finish</b> <b>ground.</b> The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm. The lot of gears was divided into five groups, each of which was tested with a different lubricant. The test lubricants can be classified as synthetic polyol-esters with various viscosities and additive packages. Test conditions included bulk gear temperature of 350 K, a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 GPa (248 ksi) at the pitch line, and a speed of 10, 000 RPM. The lubricant with a viscosity that provided a specific film thickness greater than one and with an additive package produced far greater gear surface fatigue lives than lubricants with a viscosity that provided specific film thickness less than one. A low viscosity lubricant with an additive package produced gear surface fatigue lives equivalent to a similar base stock lubricant with 30 percent higher viscosity, but without an additive package. Lubricants with the same viscosity and similar additive packages gave equivalent gear surface fatigue lives...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to find alternative materials for the cutting tools used in turning operations. The conventional materials like tungsten carbide(WC), titanium carbide(TiC), cubic boron nitride (CBN) and diamond used as cutting tools for turning operations on lathe are expensive. Titanium grade 5 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), SS 440 C/AISI 440 C and SS 316 {{are some of the}} materials which satisfy the necessary requirements for turning metals and polymer materials. These materials are machined as per the standard tool signature of high-speed steel tool (HSS) and are subjected to necessary heat treatment for hardening and then <b>finish</b> <b>ground.</b> The machined tools thus prepared were used to turn mild steel and aluminium workpieces. The cutting forces at play are determined using lathe tool dynamometer and plotted on a MCD (Merchant’s Circle Diagram). The cutting tools are also subjected to tests to determine tool life, wear and work hardening. It is found that the performance and tool life of SS 440 C is better and cost effective compared to existing tools. Even though Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is comparatively costly it could be used for obtaining good surface finish...|$|E
40|$|The paper embraces three related subjects: Photo-elastic {{measurement}} of stresses in spur gear teeth; interpretation of stresses so found to give revised strength factors for B. S. specification {{on the design}} of spur gears; and a tentative attempt to correlate the stresses found with fatigue-test results which have been reported by various investigators. The object of t h i s paper is to propose maximum safe bending loads which involute spur gears can be allowed to carry. The gears investigated are confined to those which can be generated by standard cutters conforming to the 20 -deg. pressure-angle, B. S. basic rack, without either causing under-cutting near the root or undue pointing of the teeth. The values proposed are based on a photo-elastic investigation carried out by the author under the guidance of Professor W. A. Tuplin, at the Post Graduate School of Applied Mechanics, Sheffield University. Strength factors for spur gears are given in the form of charts. These factors embrace the whole possible range of spur-gear combinations, both with and without addendum corrections. To enable a rational assessment of strength to be made, a list of service factors, as well as a graph correlating bending-fatigue data for three classes of surface <b>finish</b> (<b>ground</b> and polished, shaved, hobbed) are given...|$|E

When grinding was carried out up to stock removal 7000 mm 3 /mm, radial wear of grinding wheel ∆R is 3 µm and surface roughness Rz was 0. 5 µm or less.

40|$|A {{twin disk}} rig {{was used to}} perform a series of {{experiments}} investigating mixed lubrication. The disks used in the experiments were manufactured from case carburising steel, were hardened and had a surface <b>finish</b> <b>ground</b> transverse to the direction of oil entrainment in order to simulate the roughness orientation typically found on involute gear teeth. Roughness profile measurements were taken in-situ between experiments which showed that the initial phase of operation for as-manufactured surfaces {{is a period of}} rapid plastic deformation, where asperity features on the surfaces accommodate to one another. It was found that this reduction in roughness improved the state of lubrication by reducing instances of contact between the surfaces. Contact was assessed by measuring the electrical contact resistance between the disks during the experiments and the level of the contact voltage between the disks was used as an indicator of the state of lubrication existing between them. It was found that variations in the dimensionless film thickness strongly influenced the level of the contact voltage. The contact voltage waveform was also found to exhibit similarity between revolutions, indicating repeated contact between groups of interacting asperities. Realigned profile traces demonstrate that prominent asperity features undergo significant plastic deformation during the running-in process. Over extended operation, it was seen that these same roughness features can be subject to a degree of fatigue at the roughness scale, which has been identified as micropitting failure in the experiments. Modifications to an existing numerical model simulating the isothermal non-Newtonian EHL point contact to enable the use of measured 3 D roughness shows that high pressures are generated in the region of interacting asperity features. Asperity contact is also seen to occur across the length of prominent ridges in agreement with image...|$|E

40|$|Human caliciviruses (HuCVs) cause {{waterborne}} {{outbreaks of}} gastroenteritis. Standard indicators of a safe water supply do not adequately predict contamination of water by viruses, including HuCVs. We developed {{a method to}} concentrate and detect HuCVs in water samples by using a cultivable primate calicivirus (Pan- 1) as a model. Viable Pan- 1 was seeded in different types of water and then filtered with a 1 MDS filter, eluted with beef extract (BE), and reconcentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. The viruses in the final samples were tested by plaque assay or by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR following extraction of the RNA with Trizol. Pan- 1 was more sensitive to high-pH treatment than poliovirus was; a pH 9. 0 BE solution was found to recover 35 % more viable Pan- 1 than a pH 9. 5 BE solution recovered. Pan- 1 was recovered from small volumes of deionized, <b>finished,</b> <b>ground,</b> and surface waters at efficiencies of 94, 73, 67, and 64 %, respectively, when samples were assayed after elution without further concentration. When larger volumes of water (up to 40 liters) were tested after elution and concentration with PEG, 38, 19, and 14 % of the seeded Pan- 1 were recovered from <b>finished,</b> <b>ground,</b> and surface waters, respectively. The limit of detection of Pan- 1 by RT-PCR {{was estimated to be}} 0. 75 to 1. 5 PFU in 40 liters of finished water.

50|$|All {{membranes}} are porous to {{a limited}} extent so that, over time, low volumes of leachate will cross the membrane. The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact {{on the quality of}} the receiving groundwater. A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to internal failure as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also wet waste masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in <b>finished</b> <b>ground</b> levels.|$|R
