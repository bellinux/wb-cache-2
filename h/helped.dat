Bradner <b>helped</b> to develop {{a wide range of}} technology needed for the bomb, including research on the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire detonators needed to implode the atomic bomb, developed the bomb's triggering mechanism, and even <b>helped</b> design the new town around the laboratory. He worked closely {{with some of the most}} prominent scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky.

5|$|During his lifetime, Takechi's {{innovations}} {{and contributions}} to Japanese theater {{in general and}} to kabuki specifically were influential for decades. His theoretical work, {{as well as his}} mentoring of several important stars, <b>helped</b> bring about a rebirth in kabuki after World War II. His contributions to cinema were much more controversial. Considered a dilettante outsider by much of the film industry, and suspected of racism and nationalism by others, his work was nevertheless defended by the younger generation of filmmakers such as Seijun Suzuki and Nagisa Oshima. Though his films are today unknown to most Japanese filmgoers, through his career-long fight against censorship, the taboos which his films <b>helped</b> break, and the creative freedom which he <b>helped</b> enable, he remains an important figure in Japanese cinema.|$|E

40|$|Purpose Online <b>help</b> and {{tutorials}} are {{an important}} part of library services, yet they are often studied in specific contexts and disciplines like subject-specific research guides. The objective of this study was to examine users’ common preferences and expectations of library <b>help</b> channels in general and online <b>help</b> in particular. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative survey with 45 library users. The survey asked users how they seek library <b>help,</b> their preferences and expectations of online <b>help,</b> content format and general <b>help</b> channels and later, a content analysis of survey responses was performed. Findings Results showed that survey participants have different prioritizations of library <b>help</b> channels. Half of the respondents preferred conceptual <b>help</b> that emphasizes concepts and underlying principles, while the other half preferred procedural (step-by-step) <b>help</b> or mixed. The survey also indicated reliance by participants on expert <b>help,</b> even when online <b>help</b> was available. Originality/value Based on the results, the authors identified users’ behavioral preferences, attitudes and expectations toward library <b>help</b> channels and online <b>help</b> content. They also discussed the unique challenge of creating online <b>help</b> for libraries, as users have a dynamic range of help-seeking preferences and mixed expectations of <b>help</b> content depending on the context...|$|R

5|$|During {{the year}} after Khánh's rise to power, Thi <b>helped</b> Khánh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him {{a key player in}} South Vietnamese {{military}} politics. In September 1964, he and Kỳ <b>helped</b> rescue Khánh from a coup attempt by two disgruntled Catholic Diệmist generals, Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. This gave Kỳ and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he was prominent in shutting down a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan by younger officers to compulsorily retire old generals. In January 1965, he <b>helped</b> Khánh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương, but by this time he had turned against Khánh. In February 1965, he <b>helped</b> defeat a coup attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo, and <b>helped</b> to force Khánh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Kỳ and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his fellow officers following the resignation of civilian Phan Huy Quát. Thi wanted to let a rival take the job and then step in after he had failed, but he never received a second opportunity.|$|E

40|$|In social psychology, the {{attribution}} model of <b>helping</b> behavior suggests that {{beliefs of the}} <b>helping</b> target’s responsibility for the need for <b>help</b> evoke affective motivators such as feelings of pity, sympathy, or anger. The affective motivation leads to <b>helping</b> or not <b>helping</b> the target. The current emergent theory is an enhancement of this theory by incorporating other personal and situational variables. Through the use of classic grounded theory, I interviewed 80 participants from different De La Salle Schools in the Philippines. This yielded over 1300 individual incidents that were compared and contrasted to form codes, categories and subcategories. A theory on the decision making process of <b>helping</b> emerged that incorporates the helper’s personal conviction, and rational deliberations of the situation. The desire to <b>help</b> {{is based on the}} helper’s rationalemotive beliefs (philosophical ideals and values that nurture <b>helping</b> and the knowledge of the nature of risk/problem) and relational-emotive ties (with the one who needs <b>help</b> and with a social group that nurtures <b>helping).</b> The desire to <b>help</b> undergoes a process of rationalpragmatic-deliberations on the appropriateness of the recipients need of <b>help,</b> the cost of <b>helping,</b> the helper’s capability of <b>helping,</b> and the logistics of <b>helping</b> before the actual <b>helping</b> occurs. The theory has implications for current social psychological theories of <b>helping,</b> and the use of classic grounded theory research...|$|R
