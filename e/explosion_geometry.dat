40|$|Determination of the {{explosion}} type of supernova remnants (SNRs) can be challenging, as SNRs are hundreds to thousands of years old and supernovae (SNe) are classified based on spectral properties days after explosion. Previous studies of thermal X-ray emission from Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs have shown that Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNRs have statistically different symmetries, and thus these sources can be typed based on their X-ray morphologies. In this paper, we extend the same technique, a multipole expansion technique using power ratios, to infrared (IR) images of SNRs to test whether they can be typed using the symmetry of their warm dust emission as well. We analyzed archival Spitzer Space Telescope Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) 24 µm observations of the previously used X-ray sample, and {{we find that the}} two classes of SNRs separate according to their IR morphologies. The Type Ia SNRs are statistically more circular and mirror symmetric than the CC SNRs, likely due to the different circumstellar environments and <b>explosion</b> <b>geometries</b> of the progenitors.

40|$|Israelian and {{coworkers}} {{showed that the}} stellar companion of the black hole binary Nova Sco is polluted with material ejected in the supernova that accompanied {{the formation of the}} black hole primary. Here we systematically investigate the implications of these observations for the black hole formation process. Using a variety of supernova models, including standard as well as hypernova models (for different helium star masses, explosion energies, and <b>explosion</b> <b>geometries)</b> and a simple model for the evolution of the binary and the pollution of the secondary, we show that most of the observed abundance anomalies can be explained for a large range of model parameters (apart from the abundance of Ti). The best models are obtained for He star masses of 10 - 16 M⊙, where spherical hypernova models are generally favored over standard supernova ones. Aspherical hypernova models also produce acceptable fits, provided there is extensive lateral mixing. All models require substantial fallback and that the fallback material either reached the orbit of the secondary or was mixed efficiently with material that escaped. The black hole therefore formed in a two-step process, where the initial mass of the collapsed remnant was increased substantially by matter that fell back after the initial collapse. This may help to explain the high observed space velocity of Nova Sco either because of a neutrino-induced kick (if a neutron star was formed first) or by asymmetric mass ejection in an asymmetric supernova explosion...|$|R
40|$|A long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{marks the}} violent {{end of a}} massive star. GRBs are rare in the universe, and their {{progenitor}} stars are thought to possess unique physical properties such as low metal content and rapid rotation, while the supernovae (SNe) {{that are associated with}} GRBs are expected to be highly aspherical. To date, it has been unclear whether GRB-SNe could be used as standardizable candles, with contrasting conclusions found by different teams. In this paper I present evidence that GRB-SNe have the potential to be used as standardizable candles, and show that a statistically significant relation exists between the brightness and width of their decomposed light curves relative to a template supernova. Every single nearby spectroscopically identified GRB-SN, for which the rest-frame and host contributions have been accurately determined, follows this relation. Additionally, it is shown that not only GRB-SNe, but perhaps all supernovae whose explosion is powered by a central engine, may eventually be used as a standardizable candle. Finally, I suggest that the use of GRB-SNe as standardizable candles likely arises from from a combination of the viewing angle and similar <b>explosion</b> <b>geometry</b> in each event, the latter which is influenced by the explosion mechanism of GRB-SNe.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{compilation}} of the geometry measures acquired using optical and IR spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry to probe the <b>explosion</b> <b>geometry</b> of Type Ia SNe. Polarization measurements are sensitive to asymmetries in {{the plane of the}} sky, whereas line profiles in nebular phase spectra are expected to trace asymmetries perpendicular to the plane of the sky. The combination of these two measures can overcome their respective projection effects, completely probing the 3 D structures of these events. For 9 normal Type Ia SNe, we find that the polarization of Si 2 λ 6355 at 5 days before maximum (p_Si II) is well correlated with its velocity evolution (v̇_Si II), implying v̇_Si II is predominantly due to the asymmetry of the SNe. We find only a weak correlation between the polarization of Si 2 and the reported velocities (v_neb) for peak emission of optical Fe 2 and Ni 2 lines in nebular spectra. Our sample is biased, with polarization measurements being only available for normal SNe which subsequently exhibited positive (i. e. redshifted) v_neb. In unison these indicators are consistent with an off-centre delayed detonation, in which the outer layers are dominated by a spherical oxygen layer, mixed with an asymmetric distribution of intermediate mass elements. The combination of spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric indicators suggests a single geometric configuration for normal Type Ia SNe, with some of the diversity of observed properties arising from orientation effects.

We have performed optical spectropolarimetric observations of the Type Ia SN 2005 ke at 3 epochs (days − 8, − 7, and + 76). The explosion properties are derived by comparing the data to explosion and radiation transfer models. Results. The SN shows polarimetric properties that are very similar to the only other subluminous event for which spectropolarimetry is available, i. e. SN 1999 by. The data present a very marked dominant axis, which is shared by both the continuum and lines such as Si ii λ 6355, suggesting that the relatively large, global asymmetry is common to the photosphere and the line-forming region. The maximum polarization degree observed in the Si ii λ 6355 absorption reaches 0. 39 ± 0. 08 %. At variance with what is seen in core-normal Type Ia, SN 2005 ke displays significant continuum polarization, which grows from the blue to the red and peaks at about 7000 Å, reaching ∼ 0. 7 %. The properties of the polarization and flux spectra can be understood within the framework of a subluminous delayed-detonation (DD), or pulsating DD scenario, or WD mergers. The difference in appearance with respect to core-normal SNe Ia is caused by low photospheric temperatures in combination with layers of unburned C, and more massive layers of the products of explosive C and O burning.

The strong continuum polarization, which is constant with time, shows a wavelength dependence unlike that produced by linear dichroism in Milky Way dust. The observed polarization may be due entirely to interstellar dust or include a circumstellar scattering component. We find that the polarization angle aligns with the magnetic field of the host galaxy, arguing for an interstellar origin. Additionally, we confirm a peak in polarization at short wavelengths that would imply R-V < 2 along the light of sight, in agreement with earlier polarization measurements. For illustrative purposes, we include a two-component fit to the continuum polarization of our + 51 -day epoch that combines a circumstellar scattering component with interstellar dust where scattering can account for {{over half of the}} polarization at 4000 angstrom.

40|$|The {{first light}} from a {{supernova}} (SN) emerges once the SN shock breaks out of the stellar surface. The first light, typically a UV or X-ray flash, {{is followed by a}} broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiation that leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. Motivated by recent detection of emission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock breakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying special attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal equilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We find that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) and possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation is out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i. e., before the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical phase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher temperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal equilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its temporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light curves. Some examples are: (i) Red supergiant SNe have an early bright peak in optical and UV flux, less than an hour after breakout. It is followed by a minimum {{at the end of the}} planar phase (about 10 hr), before it peaks again once the temperature drops to the observed frequency range. In contrast WRs show only the latter peak in optical and UV. (ii) Bright X-ray flares are expected from all core-collapse SNe types.

The thesis includes {{a description of the}} mechanisms of flame acceleration and DDT that need to be modeled when simulating all stages of gas explosions. These mechanisms are flame acceleration due to instabilities that occur in fluid flow and reactive systems, shock propagation, deflagration to detonation transition and propagating detonations. The method presented uses the FLIC-scheme for solving the conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, species and a turbulence model. A reaction rate model that includes both turbulent combustion rates and chemical kinetics to handle turbulence-flame interactions and reactions due to gas compression is designed for simulations of turbulent flames and detonations. Simulation results of gas explosions shows that the presented method can simulate different flame propagation regimes in channels with repeated obstacles like fast deflagrations, quasi-detonation and CJ-detonations. The simulations show the important effects seen in experiments like detonation initiation from shock focusing and flame acceleration from fluid instabilities. Blast waves from high explosives and fuel-air explosives are simulated and results are compared with experimental data. The comparison shows that the numerical solver capture the important waves and that the method can re-produce experimental pressures and impulses with satisfying accuracy. Different tests of the method show that the most significant error sources are numerical diffusion, accuracy of the simplified chemical kinetics and thermodynamic models.

These are often made of concrete and not specifically designed for military threats.

In this work we employ LS-Dyna for calculation, with Lagrangian finite elements and explicit time integration. Reinforced concrete may be represented in a fairly accurate fashion with recent models such as CSCM model [1] and segregated rebars constrained within the continuum mesh. However, such models cannot be realistically employed for complete models of large buildings, due to limitations of time and computer resources. The use of structural beam and shell elements for this purpose would be the obvious solution, with much lower computational cost. However, this modeling requires careful calibration in order to reproduce adequately the highly nonlinear response of structural concrete members, including bending with and without compression, cracking or plastic crushing, plastic deformation of reinforcement, erosion of vanished elements etc. The main objective of this work is to provide a strategy for modeling such scenarios based on structural elements, using available material models for structural elements [2] and techniques to include the reinforcement in a realistic way.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and presents new models for modelling of turbulent reactive flows for CFD simulation of gas <b>explosions</b> in complex <b>geometries</b> like offshore modules. The most important aspects determining {{the course of}} a gas explosion in a complex geometry are the development of turbulence and the corresponding increase in the combustion rate during the explosion. To be able to model the process it is necessary to use a CFD code as a starting point, provided with a suitable turbulence and combustion model. The modelling and calculations are done in a 3 D finite volume CFD code, where complex geometries are represented by a porosity concept, which gives porosity on the grid cell faces, depending on what is inside the cell. The turbulent flow field is modelled with the k-ε turbulence model. The turbulent flow field behind obstructions, which should produce turbulence, is not resolved for smaller geometry. Subgrid models are therefore used for production of turbulence from geometry not fully resolved on the grid. Results from LDA measurements around obstructions in steady and transient turbulent flows have been analysed and the turbulence models have been improved to handle transient, subgrid and reactive flows. The combustion is modelled with a burning velocity model, and a flame model which incorporates the burning velocity into the code. Two different flame models have been developed. SIF, which treats the flame as a interface between reactants and products, and the β-model where the reaction zone is resolved with about 3 grid cells. The flame normally starts with a quasi laminar burning velocity, due to flame instabilities, modelled as function of flame radius and laminar burning velocity. As the flow field becomes turbulent, the flame uses a turbulent burning velocity model, based on experimental data presented by Bradley, as function of turbulence parameters and laminar burning velocity. The extrapolation of these data is evaluated. The laminar burning velocity is modelled as function of gas mixture, equivalence ratio, pressure and temperature in reactant. Pressure/time curves from a range of hydrocarbon gas explosion experiments have been compared with simulations, which in most cases shows good agreement. In simulation of these experiments a range of parameters have been varied, as gas mixture, congestion, obstructions, confinement, scale and grid resolution. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and validation of a methodology for estimating the consequences of accidental dust <b>explosions</b> in complex <b>geometries.</b> The approach adopted entails the use of results from standardized tests in 20 -litre explosion vessels as input to the combustion model in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, and the subsequent validation of the model system by comparing with results from laboratory and large-scale experiments. The PhD project includes dedicated laboratory experiments designed to explore selected aspects of flame propagation in dust clouds, and to reveal {{similarities and differences between}} flame propagation in gaseous mixtures and mechanical suspensions of combustible powder in air. The research project represents a continuation of numerous efforts by various research groups, where the key underlying problem has been the scaling of results obtained in laboratory tests for predicting the consequences of dust explosion scenarios in industry. The traditional approach to the scaling problem entails the use of empirical correlations, typically represented as nomographs or formulas in relevant safety standards. It is generally accepted that empirical correlations may work reasonably well for simple geometries, such as isolated process vessels and silos. The need for more sophisticated methods arises for accident scenarios that involve complex geometrical boundary conditions, such as flame propagation in connected vessel systems and secondary dust explosions inside buildings. The European Commission (EC) supported the Dust Explosion Simulation Code (DESC) project under the Fifth Framework Programme. The goal was to develop and validate a CFD code for simulating industrial dust <b>explosions</b> in complex <b>geometries.</b> To this end, GexCon created the CFD code DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code) by modifying the existing CFD code FLACS (FLame ACceleration Simulator), originally developed for simulating gas explosions in congested offshore geometries. The specific contributions from the candidate with respect {{to the development of the}} CFD software is limited to the methodology for estimating combustion parameters for a given dust sample from experimental results, the validation of the resulting model system against experimental data, and general participation in the R&D team during the development process. The modelling of particle-laden flow and heterogeneous combustion in the CFD code DESC involves several simplifying assumptions. The flow model assumes thermal and kinetic equilibrium between the dispersed particles and the continuous phase, and the k-ε turbulence model in FLACS remains unchanged for multiphase flows. The empirical correlation for the turbulent burning velocity in dust clouds originates from experiments with premixed combustion in gaseous mixtures. The fraction of dust that takes part in the combustion reactions, as function of the nominal dust concentration, is estimated from the explosion pressures measured in a constant volume explosion vessel. The thermodynamic data available in FLACS limit the application area to materials containing the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. The simplifications limit the application area of DESC to certain classes of materials, and flame propagation in dust clouds with relatively high reactivity. DESC do not contain models for simulating phenomena such as agglomeration, gravitational settling, and selective separation of particles in flow through cyclones or along other curved paths. In spite of the simplicity of the model system, the results from the validation work show that the CFD code DESC can describe the course of dust explosions in relatively complex geometries with reasonable accuracy relative to the inherent spread in the experimental results. The results obtained for silo explosions reproduce trends observed for variation in vent area and ignition position from various experiments. Results obtained for flame propagation sustained by dust dispersion from a layer indicate that the empirical model for dust lifting in DESC is suitable for the purpose. Results obtained for dust explosions vented through ducts reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Simulations of dust explosions in a system of two vented vessels connected by a pipe with a 90 ° bend indicate that the DESC can reproduce relatively complex chains of events, including dust lifting from a layer. The results for the connected vessel system also demonstrate how sensitive the results can be with respect to modest changes in the initial and boundary conditions. Finally, simulations of explosion experiments in elongated vessels with repeated obstacles reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Although the results from the validation work indicate that CFD simulations can become a valuable tool for consequence modelling and design of industrial facilities, the modelling in DESC requires further improvements. An essential improvement entails fundamental changes to the numerical solver to reduce in the influence of the grid resolution on the results from the simulations. In the current versions of FLACS and DESC, simulation of explosion scenarios is subject to strict grid guidelines. The current versions of both codes use a structured Cartesian grid, with limited possibilities for local grid refinement. This poses a particular challenge for DESC, since the grid resolution required to resolve complex internal geometries on a structured Cartesian grid varies significantly from case to case. The long-term solution to these challenges will presumably entail the use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and this is outside the scope of the present work. The model system may also benefit from various other improvements, such as turbulent burning velocity correlations specifically developed for dust explosions, an explicit model for turbulent flame thickness, radiation models, local grid refinement in the region where ignition occurs, reduced dependence on empirical input to the model system, and in general more realistic modelling of particleladen flow and heterogeneous combustion. There is, however, a fine balance between the level of detailed information that must be specified in the model, and the applicability and user-friendliness of the model system. For most industrial applications of a CFD tool for dust explosions, there are significant inherent uncertainties associated with initial and boundary conditions. Dust explosion experiments in transparent balloons show that the initial phase of flame propagation in turbulent dust clouds can progress in a distributed manner, with very limited energy output. This observation may explain some of the challenges associated with the analysis of pressure-time histories from 20 -litre explosion vessels for dust explosions when using a weak ignition source. Experiments in a 3. 6 -m flame acceleration tube demonstrate the importance of explosion-generated turbulence for dust explosions, and illustrate the challenge associated with poor repeatability in dust explosion experiments. The results obtained for propane-air mixtures in the same apparatus indicate that FLACS under-predicts the rate of combustion for turbulent flame propagation in fuel-rich propane-air mixtures. The CFD code DESC represents a significant step forward for process safety related to dust explosions in the process industry. There is, however, significant room for further improvements to the model system, and dedicated experiments will play an important role for the future development of the code. Improved safety in the process industry requires reliable and well-documented consequence models, and future development of DESC should include an integrated framework for model validation, including verification and testing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{calculations}} for {{gas explosion}} safety {{have been widely}} used for doing risk assessments within {{the oil and gas industry}} for more than a decade. Based on predicted consequences of a range of potential accident scenarios a risk level is predicted. The development of applications using hydrogen as a clean energy carrier has accelerated in recent years, and hydrogen may be used widely in future. Due to the very high reactivity of hydrogen, safe handling is critical. To be able to perform proper consequence modelling as a part of a risk assessment, it is essential to be able to model the physical processes well. CFD tools have the potential to model the relevant physics and predict well, but without proper user guidelines based on extensive validation work, very mixed prediction capability can be expected. This PhD thesis deals with the development and validation of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool FLACS for hydrogen safety applications. Significant validation work against several experiments has been carried out in order to increase the confidence of predictions of scenarios relevant to hydrogen safety. The validation studies have included dispersion, explosion and combined dispersion and explosion studies. A range of different dispersion experiments is simulated, including low momentum releases in a garage, sub-sonic jets in a garage with stratification effects and subsequent slow diffusion, low momentum and subsonic horizontal jets influenced by buoyancy, and free jets from high-pressure vessels. LH 2 releases are also considered. Some of the simulations are performed as blind predictions. FLACS uses a utility program in order to model releases from high-pressure reservoirs. Work has been carried out in order to extend the models in the utility program in order to include real gas effects. Validation against <b>explosion</b> experiments in <b>geometries</b> ranging from smooth and obstructed pipes, refuelling station, tunnel, vented vessels, jet-ignited lane, etc. have been successfully performed. However, CFD tools must be validated against representative experimental data, involving combined release and ignition scenarios, in order to have a real predictive capability in accidental situations. Therefore, a detailed study involving release and ignition experiments from FZK has been carried out. Work has also been done for developing risk analysis methods specific to hydrogen applications. Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) of hydrogen applications presents new challenges due to a large difference in properties of hydrogen and natural gas, namely in reactivity, flammability limits, buoyancy and transport properties. However, it is not realistic to perform an extensive risk assessment for all hydrogen applications similar to that carried out for petrochemical installations. On the other hand, simplified tools and techniques based on codes and standards likely have a limited applicability, as these are not able to represent actual geometry and physics of the explosion. A 3 -step approach is proposed, in which the CFD-tool FLACS is used to estimate the risk. The initial approach is to carry out a “worst-case” calculation evaluating the consequences if a full stoichiometric gas cloud is ignited. Mitigation measures can also be considered. As a second step, if potential consequences of the initial approach are not acceptable, the assumptions are refined and more calculations are performed to make the evaluations more realistic and reduce unnecessary conservatism of the chosen worst-case scenarios. Typically a number of dispersion calculations are performed to generate likely gas clouds, which are subsequently ignited. If estimated consequences are still not acceptable, a more comprehensive study, including ventilation, dispersion and explosion, is performed to evaluate the probability for unacceptable events. Calculation examples have been used to illustrate the different approaches. The proposed approach is thus very flexible, and can be tailored to the scenario under consideration. However, in many of these scenarios, especially involving reactive gases such as hydrogen, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) may be a significant threat. Another main part of this thesis has been the development of models in order to enable FLACS to provide indications about the possibility of a deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). The likelihood of DDT has been expressed in terms of spatial pressure gradients across the flame front. This parameter is able to visualize when the flame front captures the pressure front, which is the case in situations when fast deflagrations transition to detonation. Reasonable agreement was obtained with experimental observations in terms of explosion pressures, transition times, and flame speeds for several practical geometries. The DDT model has also been extended to develop a more meaningful criterion for estimating the likelihood of DDT by comparison of the geometric dimensions with the detonation cell size. In the end, several practical studies have been carried out. This includes a very detailed simulation study to examine what, if any, is the explosion risk associated with hydrogen vehicles in tunnels. Its aim was to further our understanding of the phenomena surrounding hydrogen releases and combustion inside road tunnels, and furthermore to demonstrate how a risk assessment methodology described above could be applied to the current task. A study to determine the relative risk of methane, hydrogen and hythane (a blend of hydrogen and methane) has also been performed. The work performed in the dissertation has resulted in 18 publications (journal articles + conference proceedings). 12 of them are included in the appendix and the complete list of publications (including 4 other conference papers connected with the work done in this thesis) is presented in the next pages. Thus, this dissertation presents the extensive work that has been carried out to develop and validate FLACS-Hydrogen to pave the way to use the tool for applications related to hydrogen safety...|$|R
