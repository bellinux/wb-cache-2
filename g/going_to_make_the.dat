Samantha claims to not remember anything about her abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her. The next day, The Smoking Man offers Mulder the truth if he quits the FBI and comes work for him; Mulder refuses. Mulder later meets with Blevins, who now has evidence Skinner was withholding information concerning Ostelhoff's death. Blevins tells Mulder he can help him if he names Skinner as the traitor in the FBI. Later, Mulder meets with Scully, telling her he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> deal with The Smoking Man but now will not after his meeting with Blevins. Despite Scully's pleas, he refuses to name Skinner as the traitor in the FBI.|$|E

Believing his chance had finally come, Carrier jumps onto the ice, only to be given an {{immediate}} penalty by the parish priest acting as referee. The priest claims Carrier's substitution is illegal as there are already five players on the ice.

500|$|After {{missing the}} entire 1955–56 season, {{he came out}} of {{retirement}} to play half of the 1956–57 season to help the Leafs who were short on players due to injuries and were struggling to make the playoffs. Kennedy returned November 27 to train himself back into shape after the Leafs had won only one game in their last 11. He scored 22 points in 30 games, but the Leafs finished out of the playoffs. He shared the captaincy with Jim Thomson. A highlight of the season was March 16, 1957, when the Maple Leafs scored 14 goals against the New York Rangers and Kennedy got four assists in what is still the Leafs' all-time record for goals in a single game. When it became clear the team was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, he sat out the last two games so the management could have a look at a young Frank Mahovlich.

500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> most of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] if we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging me the whole way. If I don't go down, I'm not going to get a call because they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E
