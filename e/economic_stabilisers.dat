This can be explained in part by the recent financial and economic crisis. Social benefits can contribute to reducing poverty. Benefits can further function as an <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> in times of crisis, b...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of a Cournot duopoly under cross-ownership participation when players have heterogeneous, i. e. bounded rational and naïve, expectations. We find that when the shareholder that owns firm also holds a percentage of firm, the parametric stability region of the unique Cournot-Nash equilibrium is larger than when every firm is owned by a unique shareholder, {{and an increase in}} the fraction of shares that the shareholder that owns firm has in firm tends to stabilise the market equilibrium. Moreover, when products are (horizontally) differentiated, a rise in the fraction of shares of firm held by the shareholder that owns firm acts as an <b>economic</b> (de) <b>stabiliser</b> when products of variety and are (complements) substitutes between each other. The policy implication is that, despite on the one hand, cross-ownership acts as an anti-competitive device that indeed tends to reduce social welfare with the corresponding anti-trust consequences, on the other hand, it acts as an <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> (except when products are complements). ...|$|R
40|$|In a Post-Keynesian (PK) model we {{show that}} {{inflation}} targeting monetary policies, as the main stabilisation tool proposed by the New Consensus Model (NCM), {{in the short run}} are only adequate for certain values of the model parameters, but are either unnecessary, counterproductive, or limited in their effectiveness for other values. Taking into account medium-run cost and distribution effects of interest rate variations renders monetary policies completely inappropriate as an <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser.</b> Based on these results we argue that the NCM macroeconomic policy assignment should be replaced by a PK assignment. Enhancing employment without increasing inflation will be possible if macroeconomic policies are coordinated along the following lines: The central bank targets distribution between rentiers, on the hand, and firms and employees, on the other hand, and sets low real interest rates, wage bargaining parties target inflation and fiscal policies are applied for short- and medium-run real stabilisation purposes.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} a unionised (nonlinear) duopoly with two different labour market institutions, i. e. efficient bargaining (EB) and right to manage (RTM), to analyse product market stability under quantity competition with trade unions. We show {{that when the}} preference of unions towards wages is small, (i) the parametric stability region under RTM is higher than under EB, and (ii) {{a rise in the}} union power in the Nash bargaining played between firms and unions monotonically increases (resp. reduces) the parametric stability region under RTM (resp. EB). In contrast, when the preference of unions becomes larger, an increase in the union’s bargaining power acts: (1) as an <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> when the union power is small; (2) as an economic de-stabiliser when the union power is high. In addition to established results with regard to equilibrium outcomes, our findings shed some light on the effects of how the labour market regulation affects out-of-equilibrium behaviours in a Cournot duopoly...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} {{issue in a}} Cournot duopoly with codetermined firms. We show that when both firms codetermine employment together with decentralised employees’ representatives, a rise in wages acts as an <b>economic</b> de-stabiliser (<b>stabiliser)</b> when the wage is fairly low (high), while under profit maximisation a rise in wages always stabilises the market equilibrium. Moreover, increasing the union’s bargaining power has a de-stabilising effect, except when the wage is low and the firm’s power is already high. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} a unionised duopoly {{with the two}} most popular labour market institutions, i. e. efficient bargaining (EB) and right to manage (RTM) unions and analyses product market stability under quantity competition. By focusing on {{the role played by}} labour market institutions on the market dynamics, we show that when the preference of unions towards wages is fairly low, (i) the stability region under RTM is higher than under EB, and (ii) a rise in the union power in the Nash bargaining monotonically increases (reduces) the parametric stability region under RTM (EB). In contrast, when the preference of unions towards wages becomes higher, an increase in the union’s bargaining power acts: (1) as an <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> when the union power is still low; (2) as an economic de-stabiliser when the union power is already high. These results shed some light on the effects of how labour market structures affect out-of equilibrium behaviours in a duopoly in addition to the many established results on how they affect equilibrium behaviours in such a context, and thus also constitute policy warnings for the design of the labour market institutions as regards the important issue of economic stability. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the feasibility of}} introducing a European Unemployment Benefits Scheme (EUBS), which would work as an insurance mechanism against the risks of asymmetrical shocks among countries. The implementation of a EUBS presents a number of difficulties. It is necessary, first of all, to analyze the legal compatibility between the EU treaties and a form of EUBS. Moreover, {{it is useful to}} explore the possible coexistence of EUBS with the benefits of the national (in this case Italian) social security system, which provides for the involuntarily unemployed. After analyzing these problems, it is crucial to analyze the administrative management of the system as part of a European multi-level governance, in a context in which the Open Method of Coordination is to this day problematic, and {{in which there is no}} harmonization among social protection systems. It is also interesting to analyze the possible link between a EUBS and a European Minimum Income. The question that inspired this paper is as follows: is the EUBS only a good <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> or could it be inspired by the principle of solidarity between Member States, in a context in which solidarity is overshadowed by the need for economic and financial stability in the Union...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{stability}} {{issue in a}} Cournot duopoly with asymmetric unionism and heterogeneous players. We show that labour market institutions matter or {{the stability}} of the unique interior Cournot-Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, the role played by the existence of firm-specific unions on stability, when the degree of unionism is asymmetric between the two firms, is at all different depending on whether the (more) unionised firm has bounded rational or naive expectations. Indeed, a shift in the union’s preference from employment towards wages acts as an <b>economic</b> (de) <b>stabiliser</b> when workers are paid with the (competitive) unionised wage by the bounded rational firm and with the (unionised) competitive wage by the naïve firm.

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{stability}} issue in a Cournot duopoly with codetermined firms. We show that when both firms codetermine employment together with decentralised employees' representatives, a rise in wages acts as an <b>economic</b> (de) <b>stabiliser</b> when the wage is fairly (high) low, while under profit maximisation a rise in wages always acts as a stabilising device because the parametric stability region monotonically increases with the wage in such a case. Moreover, {{a rise in the}} union's bargaining power has a de-stabilising effect, except when the wage is low and the firm power is already high. Therefore, under codetermination a change either in the wage or firm power in the Nash bargaining plays an ambiguous role on stability. We also show with numerical simulations that complex dynamics can also occur...|$|R
40|$|Reforms {{aiming at}} {{lowering}} {{the tax burden}} and cutting social benefits may boost efficiency and output, and improve market adjustment to shocks, but, by reducing the size of automatic stabilisers, may also imply less cyclical smoothing. This would be problematic in EMU given the loss of national monetary autonomy. This paper argues that the alleged trade-off between efficiency/flexibility and stabilisation depends on the typology of shocks affecting the economy. taxation, tax reforms, fiscal policy, social welfare, social benefits, fiscal <b>stabilisers,</b> automatic <b>stabilisers,</b> <b>economic</b> and monetary union, EMU, shocks, Buti, Van den Noord...|$|R
40|$|Peasants, workers, worker-peasants, nomenklatura and {{the state}} in {{northern}} Poland’s ‘Recovered Territories’ have employed a strategy they call ‘kombinacja’ to survive economic transitions {{into and out of}} socialism from 1945 to the present. Kombinacja is the process of manipulating space and legal, political, or cultural rules in order to appropriate a resource—food, commodities, labour, information, power—and then combine them into an ersatz product to meet an economic, cultural, or political end. No person, class, institution, or economy ‘owns’ kombinacja. The ‘who’ and ‘what’ are relational. The ‘when’ and ‘where’ are contextual. Yet, it is not ubiquitous; every kombinacja is a form of speech that charts a terrain of economic and political trajectories intended to shift the balance of power at a given point in time. This multi-sited historical ethnography tracks how these ‘arts of combination’ have pirouetted across agrarian and industrial, formal and informal, socialist and capitalist boundaries in the agro-industrial commune of Dobra. The arts of combination were forged through the exploitation of workers in Poland’s industrialising cities during the 19 th century, across its popularisation as a survival strategy during Nazi-occupation, and towards its reformulation into an <b>economic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> for both villagers {{and the state}} during the ‘socialist’ era from 1945 to 1989. Villagers used kombinacja to access or hide resources from the state in the midst of broken supply chains, bureaucratic gridlock, food shortages, and complex regulations. When commune officials {{turned a blind eye to}} kombinacja to stay in power, they too drew from the arts of combination to ‘fix’ formal state problems in the commune. Kombinacja was used to subvert and accommodate the state. Reworking the state through kombinacja to ensure that no one went hungry informalised the command economy and contributed to the incremental breakdown of the local state apparatus into a feudal-like order. I then turn to nomenklatura privatisation, potato pilfering, alcohol consumption, mushroom foraging, and other practices to trace how kombinacja is being reformulated (or not) to rework post-socialism. The arts of combination call attention to practices that cut across a series of binaries - capitalist/socialist, formal/informal, state/non-state - to show how those marginalised by power seek to control the conditions of their subjection and how those in position of power seek to control the conditions of others’ subjection. Building upon J. K. Gibson-Graham’s ‘diverse economies’, the case of kombinacja shows us that informality does not always create alternatives that subjugate hegemony; rather, they can alternatively be used to crystallise a hegemonic imaginary. I suggest a much broader understanding of how informality has been a site of ingenuity and nequality, innovation and suffering, across time and space...|$|R
40|$|It {{is largely}} {{recognised}} that fiscal policy will have larger responsibilities for cyclical stabilisation in EMU given {{the loss of}} the monetary instrument. At the same time, the EMU's budgetary framework emphasises the need to rely on automatic fiscal stabilisers, rather than active policies in cushioning the business cycle. We show that automatic stabilisers are relatively powerful in the event of shocks to private consumption, but less so in the case of shocks to private investment and exports. In the case of supply side shocks, the automatic stabilisers are largely ineffective, but this may actually be a good thing to the extent that supply-side disturbances call for structural adjustment rather than cyclical stabilisation [...] Fiscal Policy, Automatic <b>Stabilisers,</b> <b>Economic</b> and Monetary Union, Shocks, cyclical stabilisation, Brunila, Marco Buti, in 't Veld, Buti...|$|R
