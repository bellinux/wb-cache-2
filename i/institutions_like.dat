5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E

5|$|Public school {{instruction}} in music in Baltimore began in 1843. Prior to that, itinerant and professional singing masters were the dominant form of formal {{music education in}} the state. Music <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra sometimes have programs aimed at youth education, and other organizations have a similar focus. The Eubie Blake Center exists to promote African American culture, and music, to both youth and adults, through dance classes for all age groups, workshops, clinics, seminars and other programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of music into Baltimore {{public schools in}} 1843 caused a slow decline in the popularity of private youth singing instruction. In response to the growing demand for printed music in schools, publishers began offering collections with evangelical tunes, directed at rural schools. Formal, adult musical <b>institutions,</b> <b>like</b> the Haydn Society and the Euterpe Musical Association, grew in popularity following the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the Force Publique to function {{from day to}} day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic digital computer. Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

Some of the programs are organized by Fordham itself, {{such as those in}} London, United Kingdom; Granada, Spain; and Pretoria, South Africa; while others are operated by partner <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> Georgetown University, the University of Oxford, and the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE). In addition to the ISAP programs, the university's constituent schools offer a range of study abroad programs that cater to their specific areas of study. Fordham has produced 126 Fulbright scholars since 2003.|$|E
5|$|Almost 50,000 Hungarians live in Cluj-Napoca. The city {{is home to}} {{the second-largest}} urban Hungarian {{community}} in Romania, after Târgu Mureș, with an active cultural and academic life: the city features a Hungarian state theatre and opera, as well as Hungarian research <b>institutions,</b> <b>like</b> Erdélyi Múzeumi Egyesület (EME), Erdélyi Magyar Műszaki Tudományos Társaság and Bolyai Társaság. With respect to religious affairs, the city houses central offices for the Reformed Diocese of Transylvania, the Unitarian Diocese and an Evangelical Lutheran Church Diocese (all of which train their clergy at the Protestant Theological Institute of Cluj). Several newspapers and magazines are published in the Hungarian language, yet the community also receives public and private television and radio broadcasts (see Media). , 7,000 students attended courses in the 55 Hungarian-language specialisations at the Babeș-Bolyai University. Gheorghe Funar, mayor of Cluj-Napoca from 1992 to 2004, was notorious for acts of ethnic provocation, bedecking the city's streets in the colours of the Romanian flag and arranging pickets outside the city's Hungarian consulate; however, tensions have subsided since.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{education}} system was {{enhanced by the}} establishment of the University of Mysore in 1916 by Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV. Until reorganisation and renaming of Mysore State, Mysore University was the supreme university and prescribed education in and around the Kingdom of Mysore. Various disciplines were, later, delegated to subsidiary institutions, which later grew up to universities. Owing to rapid increase in the student population, department of medicine was transferred to Rajiv Gandhi University in 1984. Later, in 1998, a surge in engineering disciplines and students forced the spawning of Visvesvaraya Technological University. Old institutes that were affiliated of the University in these disciplines now continue to operate in affiliation to the new ones or in autonomy: Mysore Medical College & Research Institute is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University, while engineering and technical <b>institutions</b> <b>like</b> the National Institute of Engineering and SJCE function autonomously.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary <b>institutions,</b> <b>like</b> medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have a good performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E
