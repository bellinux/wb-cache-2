25|$|Plummer {{appeared}} {{less frequently}} on Broadway in the 1960s {{as he moved}} from New York to London. He appeared {{in the title role}} in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht's The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, which did not succeed, but he had a great success in Peter Shaffer's The Royal Hunt of the Sun, playing conquistador Francisco Pizarro to David Carradine's Tony Award-nominated Atahuallpa. (In the 1969 film adaptation, Plummer would take the title role.) From May to June 1973, he appeared on Broadway as the title character in Cyrano, a musical adaptation of Edmond Rostand's 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac by Anthony Burgess and Michael J. Lewis. For that performance, Plummer won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical and a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. Later that year, he played Anton Chekhov in Neil Simon's adaptation of several Chekhov short stories, The <b>Good</b> <b>Doctor.</b>|$|E

500|$|Audience {{appreciation}} {{ratings were}} taken {{for the first}} two episodes of City of Death, and both episodes attained a respectable score of 64%. Listings magazine Radio Times published two letters from viewers regarding City of Death. Les Rogers of Hastings praised the serial's cast and the location filming; less impressed, however, was Paul R. Maskew of Exeter who felt the show was being played for laughs. Responding to similar criticisms from viewers, Douglas Adams wrote, [...] "If the programme didn't move and take a few risks then it would have died of boredom years ago". Several viewers wrote to point out the discrepancy between the start of life on Earth of 4,000 million years ago and the date given in City of Death of 400 million years ago. Graham Williams replied, [...] "The <b>good</b> <b>Doctor</b> makes the odd mistake or two but I think an error of 3,600 million years is pushing it! His next edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica will provide an erratum". Another viewer wrote {{to point out that the}} atmosphere of the primordial Earth would have been poisonous to the Doctor and his companions; Douglas Adams responded to this criticism, citing artistic license.|$|E

500|$|Truss {{highlights}} the importance that Gibbons places on detachment as a necessary adjunct to effective writing: [...] "Like many a <b>good</b> <b>doctor,</b> {{she seems to have}} considered sympathy a peculiar and [...] redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time." [...] This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons's Guardian obituarist Richard Boston, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, [...] "were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders". It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated [...] melodrama [...] that Gibbons most disliked {{was at the heart of}} her one great [...] success; [...] Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as [...] "a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental." [...] While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as [...] "a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable".|$|E
500|$|The Rhoads' letter created one of {{the first}} crises for James Beverley, newly {{appointed}} as the acting Governor of Puerto Rico. He said the letter was a [...] "confession of murder" [...] and [...] "a libel against the people of Puerto Rico", and ordered an investigation, one of his first acts. Beverley said of Rhoads that [...] "he was just a damned fool, ... a <b>good</b> <b>doctor,</b> but not very strong mentally on anything else." [...] Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that he was joking in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a [...] "fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico," [...] explaining that nothing [...] "was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated." [...] Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes.|$|E

When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form, Rhys covers for him, but makes it clear he wants something in return. Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin, Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon. Despite being warned that Martin does not like to talk shop during his golf games, Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed. Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap [...] "And Karl {{has no choice but to}} agree that Rhys is a <b>good</b> <b>doctor.</b> It's a bit awkward, because Karl doesn't like the way Rhys operates— so to speak!" [...] Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program; however he forgets everything he knows and makes a fool of himself due to being hungover. Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling [...] "devastated and desperate." [...] Barber described the position as the Holy Grail for Rhys and because of a stupid act, he has lost it.|$|E

500|$|Believing {{himself to}} be in a [...] "impossible dilemma", Anderson said that Oliver was trying to make good on what he had done by repeating his F2 exams. [...] "By exposing the lie he'll end his career, Oliver can't {{understand}} why Penny won't stand by him." [...] He added that since Oliver made a serious surgical error, his colleagues had lost trust in his medical capability. When a train crash occurred, he was forced to take control of AAU. Anderson explained: [...] "He's not fully qualified and that's all he can think about. He's struggling." [...] When he saved a patients life, Oliver thought he should keep his job. However, he was then told that Penny had died, news that would [...] "change Oliver's life forever." [...] Following Penny's death, Craig-Brown stated that [...] "whether he's good enough to stay in medicine will be [...] big storyline." [...] The series explored how Oliver coped with her death through a flashback episode. Henry, who plays Hanssen, observed that Oliver's return to work saw him make multiple mistakes and [...] "hit rock bottom". Oliver tried to resign from Holby, though before he left he responded to a dangerous RTA call and saved a patient's life. When he was summoned by Hanssen about his resignation, he was given [...] "fatherly advice", and the senior doctor [...] "turned a blind eye" [...] to Oliver's confession. Henry explained that Hanssen [...] "doesn’t think a <b>good</b> <b>doctor</b> should lose his chance at a career in medicine", after learning Oliver risked his own life on the job.|$|E

Lawrence stated that the guests were underdeveloped, but concluded that, [...] "it lacked the clever-cleverness that has marred recent episodes and proved how <b>good</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who can be when it simply tells a story." [...] Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, stated that [...] "Clara's outburst was the next stage in what I have loved about this series most of all.
