60|$|The Carnival still continues, though I {{hardly see}} how it can have {{withstood}} such a <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> this rainy day. There were several people-- three, I think--killed in the Corso on Saturday; some accounts {{say that they were}} run over by the horses in the race; others, that they were ridden down by the dragoons in clearing the course.|$|E
60|$|Time {{had passed}} swiftly, {{but as the}} {{necessity}} for immediate action had gone by, the hours gradually assumed something of their normal length. The night wore on. The air grew colder, the stars brighter, the sky bluer, and, if such could be possible, the silence more intense. The fire burned out, and for lack of wood could not be rekindled. Gale patrolled his short beat, becoming colder and <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> dawn approached. The darkness grew so dense {{that he could not}} see the pale faces of the sleepers. He dreaded the gray dawn and the light. Slowly the heavy black belt close to the lava changed to a pale gloom, then to gray, and after that morning came quickly.|$|E

50|$|Other {{differences}} are purely cosmetic and consist {{of the lack}} of a full fairing, a superbike handlebar instead of clip-ons and different paint schemes. Like the first generation Tuono, the Tuono 1000 R also employs a steering <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> standard.|$|E

50|$|During winter sleet {{and snow}} does fall, {{but it is}} {{temporary}} and does not settle for long. Although the climate is semi-arid, the ground remains <b>damp</b> <b>as</b> it is often impermeable to water.|$|R
5000|$|Mirror lock-up: Canon {{considered}} {{the mirror in}} the T90 sufficiently <b>damped</b> <b>as</b> to need no mirror lock-up feature. Many users disagree, and {{instructions on how to}} modify the camera to add this feature are available.|$|R
50|$|All {{mechanical}} {{systems in the}} real world contain some amount of damping. Damping dissipates energy in the system, which reduces the vibration level which is transmitted at the natural frequency. The fluid in automotive shock absorbers is a kind of <b>damper,</b> <b>as</b> is the inherent damping in elastomeric (rubber) engine mounts.|$|E
50|$|The MacPherson strut {{is a type}} of {{automotive}} suspension system that uses the top of a telescopic <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> the upper steering pivot. It is widely used in the front suspension of modern vehicles and is named for American automotive engineer Earle S. MacPherson, who originally invented and developed the design.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1860s a mass poison {{attempt was made}} against the clan using {{poisoned}} flour given to make damper. After taking the flour to their camp, the old people and children of the Arakwal tribe refused to eat the <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> {{it was a new}} food. Upon waking the next morning, survivors found nearly 150 adults dead.|$|E

50|$|Monolulu's name is {{referenced}} by {{the character}} Rigsby in the 1974 pilot {{episode of the}} UK comedy series Rising <b>Damp</b> <b>as</b> a humorous comparison to the new tenant Philip who had stated {{he was the son}} of a chief.|$|R

5000|$|For vacuum-operated or {{pneumatically}} operated zone dampers, {{the thermostat}} usually switches the pressure or vacuum on or off, causing a spring-loaded rubber diaphragm {{to move and}} actuate the <b>damper.</b> <b>As</b> with the second style of electrical zone dampers, these dampers automatically return to the default position without the application of any power, and the default position is usually [...] "open", allowing air to flow. Like the second style of electrical zone damper, these dampers may allow adjustment of the [...] "closed" [...] position.|$|E
50|$|A vehicle {{contacts}} {{the ground}} through {{the spring and}} damper in a normal spring damper suspension, as in Fig. 1. To achieve the same sustainability in the Skyhook theory, the vehicle must contact the ground through the spring, and the imaginary line with the <b>damper,</b> <b>as</b> in Fig. 2.Theoretically, in {{a case where the}} coefficient of the damper reaches an infinite value, the vehicle will be in a state where it is completely fixed to the imaginary line, thus the vehicle will not shake.|$|E
50|$|A magnetorheological damper or magnetorheological shock {{absorber}} is a damper filled with magnetorheological fluid, which {{is controlled by}} a magnetic field, usually using an electromagnet. This allows the damping characteristics of the {{shock absorber}} to be continuously controlled by varying {{the power of the}} electromagnet. Fluid viscosity increases within the <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> electromagnet intensity increases. This type of shock absorber has several applications, most notably in semi-active vehicle suspensions which may adapt to road conditions, as they are monitored through sensors in the vehicle, and in prosthetic limbs.|$|E
25|$|Air {{suspension}} {{was fitted}} all round which provided adaptive <b>damping</b> <b>as</b> well as rear self leveling. Unlike other manufacturers Jaguar {{did not provide}} any driver control of ride height or suspension mode which was fully computer controlled. Dynamic stability control as well as traction control were standard.|$|R
5000|$|Rising damp {{is widely}} {{referred}} to in Victorian literature and the Public Health Act of 1875 introduced the requirement for a damp-proof course in walls to prevent rising damp.

50|$|To help {{address the}} speed wobble issue, the H2 {{came with a}} {{friction-type}} steering <b>damper,</b> <b>as</b> well as a built-in frame lug to attach a hydraulic steering damper. The H2 had a front disc brake, an all-new capacitor discharge ignition system which performed better than cap and rotor type, was virtually maintenance free, and was unique to the H2. The H2 also had a chain oiler, and a steering friction damper. The front disc brake performed adequately, though some riders added a second front disc for more braking performance.|$|E
5000|$|Toyota {{increased}} the 5M-GE's stroke to 91 mm (3.58 in) {{to create the}} 3.0 L (2954 cc) 6M-GE. This necessitated the fitment of larger diameter intake runners (37 versus 35 mm). Only produced in 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC/fuel-injected versions, it was available as the 6M-GE and Japan-spec 6M-GEU from 1984 through 1987. The 6M engine used the same crank, machined to accept a different torsional <b>damper,</b> <b>as</b> the 1986-1989 7M-GE and 7M-GTE engines; this fact is witnessed by the designation [...] "6M" [...] stamped on the counterweight of the crank on the earlier 1986-1988 7M engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{roots of}} the RSV Tuono lie with the 1998 - 2003 RSV Mille superbike. The {{original}} 2003-2005 RSV Tuono uses the 2002 Mille frame, engine, suspension and brakes. The majority of parts are interchangeable between Mille and Tuono models up until {{the introduction of the}} RSV 1000 R which replaced the Mille. One minor difference is that the RSV Tuono is fitted with a steering <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> standard whereas the RSV Mille is not. The reason for this is to avoid potential speed wobble under full acceleration due to the motocross style handlebars atop high machined ergal risers causing the rider to sit more upright, resulting in less weight over the front wheel. The main difference is the lack of significant bodywork (fairings).|$|E

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this paper involved characterizing the amplitude and frequency dependent stiffness and damping coefficients for oil-free metal mesh dampers weaved from several different types of materials. The material test matrix consisted of stainless steel 304, Inconel 600, copper, and nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy. The research specifically focuses on NiTi alloy damper and how the stiffness and damping performance compares with the other metal mesh damper materials. Steady state forced vibration and transient vibration tests were used to characterize the stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>as</b> functions of frequency and vibration amplitude. The results show that vibration amplitude has the opposite influence on the NiTi material damping when compared to the other materials, whereas the influence of vibration amplitude on NiTi stiffness was the same as the other materials. While the conventional metal samples give decreasing <b>damping</b> <b>as</b> vibration amplitude increases, the NiTi samples generated increasing <b>damping</b> <b>as</b> vibration levels increased. In addition to comparisons of stiffness and damping between different materials with the same mesh density, a lower mesh density for NiTi was tested and compared to the higher mesh density damper.

5000|$|The new [...] car {{appeared}} in 1901 and remained in production until 1905, with only minor design modifications. He became {{a friend of}} Rudyard Kipling and would send him experimental models to test. In 1905, Lanchester produced a [...] four-cylinder engine, and in 1906 he produced a [...] six-cylinder engine. Although Sir Henry Royce had already tackled the problem of crankshaft torsional oscillation and consequent vibration in straight-6 engines, Lanchester analysed the problem scientifically and invented the torsional crankshaft vibration <b>damper</b> <b>as</b> {{a solution to the}} problem of engine balance. His design, patented in 1907, used a secondary flywheel coupled to the end of the crankshaft with a viscous clutch. At around the same time Lanchester also patented a harmonic balancer to cancel out the unbalanced secondary forces in a four-cylinder engine, using two balance weights rotating at twice crankshaft speed in opposite directions.|$|E
50|$|In Showa's BPF-SFF (Big Piston Fork - Separate Function Fork) suspension, {{the left}} leg bar a bigger and {{stronger}} spring than the right one, with regulated pre-load. The right bar has bigger oil damper section, with regulated rebound and compression damping. According to the manufacturer, this asymmetric design provides a reduction of the friction inside the fork, significant mass loss and more friendly response of suspension. The KTRC system uses manipulation of the ignition timing on all 3 traction control modes, while mode 3 (rain mode) also uses a separate throttle controlled by the on-board electronics, to allow faster reaction for wheel over-spin on slippery surfaces. Traction control and power modes can be adjusted or turned off whenever the throttle is closed, even while riding the bike. The bike is sold without a steering <b>damper,</b> <b>as</b> Kawasaki reports that people complained about the OEM steering dampers in the previous model, {{so they decided to}} not include one into the new bike.|$|E
5000|$|The 1966 Mustang debuted with {{moderate}} trim changes {{including a new}} grille, side ornamentation, wheel covers and gas cap. Ford's new C-4 [...] "cruise-o-matic" [...] three-speed auto transmission became available for the 225 hp V8. The 289 [...] "HiPo" [...] K-code engine was also offered with a c4 transmission, but it had stronger internals and can be identified by the outer casing of the servo which is marked with a 'C'. The long duration solid-lifter camshaft that allowed the high revving 289 to make the horsepower it was known for, was not friendly for a low stall speed automatic torque converter. The [...] "HiPo" [...] could be spotted very easily by the 1 in vibration <b>damper,</b> (<b>as</b> compared to 1/2 inch on the 225-hp version) {{and the absence of}} a vacuum advance unit on the dual point distributor. With the valve covers off, there is a large letter [...] "K" [...] stamped between the valve springs, along with screw in studs (vs. a pressed in stud for other 289s) for the adjustable rocker arms. A large number of new paint and interior color options, an AM/eight-track sound system, {{and one of the first}} AM/FM mono automobile radios were also offered. It also removed the Falcon instrument cluster; the previously optional features, including the round gauges and padded sun visors, became standard equipment. The Mustang would be the best-selling convertible in 1966, with 72,119 sold, beating the number two Impala by almost 2:1.|$|E
