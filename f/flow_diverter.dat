40|$|International audienceBackground and purpose: Pore density (PD), surface metal {{coverage}} (SMC) and {{the number}} of wires are all different parameters which can influence the efficacy of a flow disruptor/diverter. Nevertheless, the relative importance of a parameter to induce intra-aneurysmal blood stasis is still poorly evaluated. Therefore, comparison between devices based on a unique value is not reliable. The aim {{of this study was to}} propose a new bench top parameter (the pressure reduction coefficient (PRC;)) in order to assess the global haemodynamic effect of each flow diverter/disruptor to slow flow. Methods: Eight devices were tested in vitro during three different flow conditions. For the eight devices, the PRC was computed at different volumetric flow rates to characterise flow reduction. Comparison was made with SMC, PD {{and the number}} of wires. Results: The PRC obtained for flow disruptors was on average 1. 5 times more efficient in reducing flow compared to <b>flow</b> <b>diverters.</b> PD (mm 2) ranged from 24 to 38 for <b>flow</b> <b>diverters</b> and did not independently correlate with the PRC. The SMC of <b>flow</b> <b>diverters</b> ranged from 25 % to 70 %, and ranged from 20 % to 100 % for flow disruptors, without independent correlation to the PRC. The number of wires ranged from 48 to 96 for the <b>flow</b> <b>diverters</b> and did not correlate independently to the PRC. Conclusion: There were no direct correlations between individual device characteristics and the PRC, suggesting a multi-faceted and interrelating association of the overall design of each implant. Hence, the PRC could be used as a simple, reliable parameter to assess the overall capacity of flow disruptors/diverters to induce intra-aneurysmal blood stasis...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Flow</b> <b>diverters</b> (PED) were placed into 22 female New Zealand white rabbits abdominal aortas to cover 1 lumbar artery. Animals were divided into 3 groups (single PED, n 9; double PED with 2 telescoped/overlapped devices, n 7; and triple PED, with 3 telescoped/ overlapped devices, n 6) and were followed for 6 or 12 months.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent {{studies have}} shown {{promising}} results regarding intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diverters. However, these have had adverse effects, including delayed aneurysm occlusion, posttreatment symptoms, and rupture. The hemodynamic profiles of aneurysms treated with flow diverters were analyzed to determine the ones associated with successful and failed treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics were used to simulate hemodynamic profiles, including the presence of jet flow, energy loss, volume flow, and wall shear stress in 4 successful occlusions of aneurysms and 4 failed cases after flow-diverter deployment. In these 4 failed cases, hemodynamic profiles were examined again after a hypothetic second intervention. This involved replacing the failed <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> with a hypothetic optimally deployed <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> or simulated placement of a second <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> within the first (double hypothetic optimally deployed). RESULTS: Where successful occlusions were achieved, a marked obliteration of jet flow was observed. Flow entering the aneurysm sac was diverted via {{the center of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> and joined smoothly with the continuation of flow leaving the aneurysm sac into the parent arteries. These observations were supplemented by a reduction in the other hemodynamic profiles. Aneurysm neck geometry might influence the efficacy of the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic indices, as calculated by using computational fluid dynamics techniques, have close correlation with flow-diverter treatment outcome.

We hypothesize that phosphorilcholine surface modified flow diverters (Pipeline Flex with Shield Technology, sPED) would have less acute thrombus formation on the device surface compared with the classic Pipeline Embolization device (cPED). METHODS: Elastase-induced aneurysms were created in 40 rabbits and randomly assigned to receive cPED or sPED devices with and without dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (four groups, n= 10 /group). Angioplasty was performed to enhance apposition and create intimal injury for a pro-thrombotic environment. Both before and after angioplasty, the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> was imaged with intravascular optical coherence tomography. The outcome measure {{was the number of}} predefined segments along the implant relative to the location of the aneurysm with a minimum of 0 (no clot formation) and maximum of 3 (all segments with thrombus).

40|$|Industrial tray air-dryers are {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} drying of agricultural products. The main drawback of these dryers is the non-uniform velocity distribution in the drying zone resulting in a non-uniform drying of the product. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software was implemented to predict and decrease the non-uniform velocity distribution of various dryer configurations. Tunnel dryers in commercial use were used to obtain experimental data. The CFD results were correlated with the test data. Trolley and tray tunnel dryers provide a relatively simple, low capital intensive and versatile method for drying {{a wide range of}} products. Artificial drying has the advantage of controlled drying conditions compared to traditional sun drying. The main focus of every tunnel design should be the improvement {{of the quality of the}} product in terms of colour, texture and aroma. Increasing the evaporation rate without increasing the energy required to do so, should always be done in-line with this main objective. Many studies focus on the mango structure and food dehydration principles that influence the uniform drying product with the assumption that the airflow over the produce is uniform. Few have been conducted on the air movement inside industrial dryers. CFD analysis predicts the airflow without influencing the airflow pattern compared to the measuring equipment inside test dryers. The experimental data were obtained from an empty dryer without a <b>flow</b> <b>diverter.</b> This was compared to dryer with the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> included and compared to a dryer with the trolleys, trays and mango slices included. The test results showed that turbulence created by this configuration, still played a major role in the nonuniform velocity distribution along the drying zone of the tunnel. The inclusion of a <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> did however dampen the swirl effect of the main fan. Measuring the velocity distribution was practically difficult with the handheld devices used, which influenced the accuracy of the measurements taken. This justified the CFD analysis in order to better visualise and predict the airflow pattern inside the dryer. The total average speed CFD results of the sections in the drying zone (without mangoes and trolleys) of the dryer without a <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> was 11. 2 % higher compared to the test results. It was 14 % higher for the dryer with the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> included. The dryer with the mangoes, trays, trolleys and <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> showed a large difference where the total average speed of the CFD analysis was 49 % higher compared to the test results. The main reason for the difference of the CFD analysis compared to the measured results are the factors that influenced the uncertainty of the experimental set up. The CFD analysis showed that the coefficient of variance (CV) of the dryer with the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> (mangoes and trolleys included) was 3 % lower compared to the dryer without one. Various dryer configurations were analysed using the CFD software to investigate what the best combination of <b>flow</b> <b>diverter,</b> vanes and blanking-off plates would be. A dryer configuration where flow diverters (Up-and-downstream of the main fan) above the false ceiling and inside the drying zone was analysed. A 16 % decrease in terms of the CV value was obtained compared to the dryer with just the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> downstream of main fan above the false ceiling. There was however a large region of swirl upstream of the main above the false ceiling resulting in a larger loss of heated air through the outlet fan before it reached the drying zone. The cost of manufacturing a simple vane and <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> for an existing dryer is 4 % of the initial building costs (excluding the initial cost of the trolleys). The overall drying uniformity of this dryer is improved according to the CFD analysis by 7 %. A cost analysis (taking into account the 15 year life cycle of a dryer) in terms of the energy requirement to evaporate water from the drying zone, showed that the dryer with the <b>flow</b> <b>diverter</b> was 6 % less expensive to run on a yearly basis. Labour costs will be lower due to man-hours saved in terms of sorting out the wet slices from the dried product. Resources (dryers and trolleys) that would have been used for re-drying the wet produce, could now be implemented to increase the production rate of the plant.

The devices were implanted across the neck of 12 elastase-induced aneurysms in New Zealand White rabbits and followed for 1 and 3 months (n[*]=[*] 6 respectively). Aneurysm occlusion rates, parent artery stenosis and patency of jailed branch occlusions were assessed by angiography, histology and scanning electron microscopy studies. RESULTS: It was feasible to navigate and implant the 96 -strand device over the aneurysm orifice in all cases. At follow-up two aneurysms in the 48 -strand vs. one in the 96 -strand group were not occluded. This aneurysm from the 96 -strand group however had a tracheal branch arising from the sac and showed a reverse remodelling of the vascular pouch at 3 months.
