25|$|In October 2009 {{students}} at Carleton, Guelph, and Concordia organized {{a drive to}} leave CFS, resulting in petitions meeting the threshold necessary to initiate <b>disaffiliation</b> votes. Students at the University of Victoria Students' Society, and the Graduate Student Association at the University of Calgary collected enough signatures to initiate a <b>disaffiliation</b> vote.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2010, {{undergraduate}} students at the University of Guelph and the Alberta College of Art and Design and graduate students at the University of Calgary and McGill University attempted to hold <b>disaffiliation</b> votes. Only the Alberta College of Art and Design vote followed the applicable CFS bylaws. Several irregularities {{in the conduct of}} the students' unions at McGill and Calgary were cited by the CFS as reasons for invalidating the <b>disaffiliation</b> votes.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the next}} month, the Shea and Young factions battled {{for control of}} various Teamster locals. In late August, Shea ordered all Teamster locals to hold {{meetings}} to vote on whether they wished to remain with the IBT or go with the secessionist UTA. Shea sent representatives to each local union meeting to lobby for continued affiliation. This effort was largely successful, holding <b>disaffiliations</b> to {{only about half the}} 30 locals in Chicago {{and a handful of other}} others scattered across the nation.|$|R
25|$|The crisis {{severely}} weakened Rieve's {{political position}} within the union, and led to collective bargaining difficulties. Membership losses were particularly high in the South and Canada. Although most of Rieve's political opponents had left the TWUA for the UTW, the secession movement led many of the remaining members to question Rieve's leadership of the union. The union's finances were significant affected by the <b>disaffiliations,</b> forcing members to raise dues to cover a budget shortfall. Rieve claimed that only 12,500 members had disaffiliated, but admitted that the union's membership had fallen by 400,000 as it defended itself from raids rather than organized new members.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the developments taking place within European Christianity, it seems worth our while to take another took at the notion of religious belonging, one which turns out to be more complex than it seemed at first glance. The flow of affiliations and <b>disaffiliations</b> it sets in motion might well be reinterpreted as the ambivalent expression of the engagements and disengagements associated with the construction of a common world. In this connection, the works of the historian, M. de Certeau, leading to an anthropology of belief, offer a significant contribution {{to the development of a}} theory of belonging...|$|R
25|$|But {{with the}} loss of several million members due to the <b>dis{{affiliation}}</b> of the CTW unions, the AFL-CIO sought to change the 2001 affiliation criteria.|$|E
25|$|In the Constitution Party's April 2006 {{national}} convention in Tampa, Florida, a heated <b>disaffiliation</b> vote forced members {{to choose between}} one of two pro-life positions. The assembly voted not to disaffiliate the Independent American Party of Nevada over the more exceptive position of its gubernatorial candidate, Christopher H. Hansen. Baldwin {{voted in favor of}} <b>disaffiliation,</b> favoring the more conservative position. Baldwin remained with the party, but several conservative state parties subsequently voted to leave the national party, believing it to have unacceptably compromised its pro-life platform; rump factions have been orchestrated by the national Constitution Party in some of these states.|$|E
25|$|Sweeney angrily {{denounced the}} disaffiliations. Gerald McEntee called the <b>disaffiliation</b> threats a power-play, {{claiming}} that the Change to Win coalition had demanded that Sweeney announce his retirement within six months and endorse a replacement of their choosing.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} {{established}} in the late 1940s, and has previously had strong connections to the Oxford and Cambridge Labour Clubs. In recent years, it has enjoyed collaborating with the Hull University Labour Club and the LSE SU Labour Society. Over the years the society has gone through several <b>disaffiliations</b> as a result of committees failing to hand on the society before graduating. QM Labour Society has been an active society in the Tower Hamlets region, with members campaigning during the general elections of 1992, helping contribute towards the +7.6% swing towards Labour and, more prominently, in 1997.|$|R

5000|$|Vaughan {{stood for}} Bethnal Green South West at the 1922 and 1923 general {{elections}} for the Labour Party, with {{the endorsement of the}} CPGB, narrowly missing election on both occasions. [...] However, the Labour Party nationally had decided to expel CPGB members from the party. The Bethnal Green Labour Party refused to endorse this, and was instead disaffiliated by Labour - the first of several such <b>disaffiliations</b> around the country. It became the [...] "Left-Wing Committee", and the following year, Vaughan was a founder of the National Left-Wing Movement, which attempted to draw these disaffiliated groups together and promote a Labour-Communist alliance.|$|R
25|$|On June 6, 1984, the NUHHCE {{executive}} board voted to disaffiliate from RWDSU, effective October 1, 1984. A mail ballot was issued on July 31, 1984, and the <b>disaffiliation</b> approved. The AFL-CIO issued its direct charter on October 1.|$|E
25|$|At the NYSUT {{convention}} in New York City that same year, delegates argued over {{the merits of}} the <b>disaffiliation</b> resolution.

25|$|The organization's {{primary goal}} {{was to provide a}} forum in which {{jurisdictional}} conflicts between trade unions could be adjudicated. But the organization lacked the power to enforce its rulings. Under pressure from competing AFL building trades councils and repeated threats of <b>disaffiliation</b> by its own members, it affiliated with the AFL in 1908.|$|E
2500|$|The RLEA's {{importance}} in national labor affairs fell {{along with the}} significant decline of the railway industry in the national economy.

In 1950, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen disaffiliated from the RLEA, and did not rejoin it until December 1954. By the mid-1950s, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had rejoined the RLEA, but disaffiliated again in November 1964. Just two months later, the International Association of Machinists quit as well.|$|R
50|$|The Cambridge Universities Labour Club (CULC) is {{a student}} {{political}} society, first founded as the Cambridge University Fabian Society in 1905, to provide a voice for Labour Party values of socialism and social democracy at the University of Cambridge. Although the society served only University of Cambridge students {{for most of its}} history, in 2007, membership was also opened up to students of Anglia Ruskin Polytechnic. CULC's varied past has seen it go through several <b>disaffiliations</b> with the national Labour Party, including periods in the 1960s and 1970s when it was {{under the influence of the}} entryist Militant tendency. It is currently affiliated to the Labour Party, Labour Students, and the Cambridge Constituency Labour Party.|$|R

25|$|The <b>disaffiliation</b> {{of several}} major unions in 2005 led the AFL-CIO {{to reconsider the}} use of DALUs. Many of the disaffiliated unions {{provided}} the majority of members, staff and funds to AFL-CIO state federations and central labour councils. The loss of these resources would not only have effectively dismantled the AFL-CIO presence in these areas but eviscerated the labor movement as well.|$|E
25|$|NEA {{responded to}} the <b>disaffiliation</b> move by setting up a rival state organization, the New York Education Association (NYEA). The NEA {{believed}} that many NYSUT locals, with at least 50,000 members, would leave the organization. While many locals disaffiliated from the NYSUT, a few soon rejoined. Over the next quarter-century, NYEA's membership stagnated, while NYSUT's exploded thanks to its leaders' decision to recruit members outside the field of education.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, {{differences}} over {{support for the}} Vietnam War {{and the civil rights}} movement as well as a disagreement over organizational procedures led once more to the <b>disaffiliation</b> of District 65. Joined by 10 other breakaway RWDSU unions, a new national organization—the National Council of the Distributive Workers of America (NAWCDA)—was formed. In 1969, NAWDCA joined the short-lived American Labor Alliance formed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Auto Workers. In 1979, NAWDCA affiliated with the UAW.|$|E
25|$|SBTA also {{struggled}} {{to enforce its}} rules without causing additional <b>disaffiliations.</b> SBTA president Kirby successfully established many new local councils, and resolved conflicts which threatened to sunder existing ones. But the Alliance's one union-one vote rule often meant that smaller specialty unions were easily able to build majorities to sanction larger unions for infringement on speciality union jurisdiction. The offended larger union would then threaten {{to withdraw from the}} local alliance, taking its dues and influence with contractors went with it. Local alliances would then ask the national SBTA to enforce the rules. Kirby and Spencer were sympathetic to the demands made by local councils, but often refused to take any enforcement action for fear that the large unions would disaffiliate.|$|R
40|$|During {{most of the}} 1960 s, the CSN {{was both}} an {{advocate}} of provincial autonomy and a defender of federalism. In the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, however, a majority of its leaders and militants came to favour separatism. Many of them saw independence as a precondition {{for the creation of}} a socialist Quebec. In 1972, the CSN rejected capitalism, endorsed socialism, and envisaged an internal referendum on the independence issue. The internal debate, however, took place only after the Parti quebecois was elected to power in 1976. Fearing internal divisions and <b>disaffiliations,</b> the CSN did not endorse separatism. Being disappointed with the Parti quebecois' governmental record, the CSN was content to give a critical support to a yes vote in the referendum in 1980...|$|R
40|$|This paper takes {{a social}} constructivist {{position}} of culture, identity, and classroom discourse in exploring the “culture talk ” of international {{students in a}} university English for academic purposes (EAP) course. The analysis focuses on the interactional work being accomplished by the students as they participate in a classroom task about traditional clothing. Results show how participants used cultural affiliations and <b>disaffiliations</b> systematically in their talk to establish competing discourses and to make available multiple identities, which were then taken up and transformed by co-‐group members. Implications of this study relate communicative practices {{that take place in}} university EAP courses and the possibilities for teachers to move beyond a compare-‐contrast approach to teaching and learning culture toward a pedagogy of intercultural understanding...|$|R
25|$|The CCU {{founded the}} Canadian Mineworkers Union, and began an {{organizing}} campaign in late 1981. In a federally-supervised union election in March 1983, the miners voted 1,750 to 1,393 against affiliating with the CMU. CMU forced a second election in March 1984, but the miners rejected <b>disaffiliation</b> {{a second time}} {{by a vote of}} 1,795 to 1,242. CMU's support declined quickly thereafter, as miners became disenchanted with the constant campaigning for votes. UMWA was never challenged again, and continued to represent miners on Cape Breton Island for the next 17 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, photoengravers in New York City went {{on strike}} to demand a 48-hour work week. ITU President S.B. Donnelly refused to support the local, fearing {{employers}} might retaliate. The New York City photoengravers won their strike, {{but the lack of}} ITU support led most of the union's photoengraver locals to seek <b>disaffiliation.</b> A national convention in Philadelphia in November 1900 saw the photoengravers leaving the ITU and establishing the International Photo-Engravers' Union of North America. ITU President James M. Lynch, pressured the AFL into refusing to recognize the photoengravers' union until May 1904.|$|E
25|$|On 23 May 1887, the Pope {{declared}} “The struggle which {{damaged the}} church and was of no good to the state is now over”. The Mitigation and Peace Laws restored the inner autonomy of the Catholic church while leaving key regulations and the laws concerning {{separation of church and}} state in place (civic marriage, civic registry, religious <b>disaffiliation,</b> government school supervision, civic registry of clerics, ban of Jesuits, pulpit law, state supervision of church assets, constitutional amendments and the Catholic section in the Ministry of Culture was not reintroduced).|$|E

25|$|The New Voice ticket {{then asked}} the {{convention}} to implement its platform. Subsequently, the convention voted to provide state federations with representation on the AFL-CIO general board, which {{had previously been}} open only to national union presidents. The convention also expanded the AFL-CIO executive council from 33 to 54 members. Sweeney offered these new seats to previously unrepresented unions. The expansion nearly doubled representation for women and minorities on the council. The expansion had the added advantage of enabling both Sweeney supporters and Donahue loyalists {{to sit on the}} council, encouraging reconciliation. A 'unity slate' of executive council members was announced by Douglas H. Dority, president of the UFCW and a key Donahue supporter, and Gerald McEntee. The unity slate helped avoid the threat of <b>disaffiliations</b> from the labor federation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{struggle}} between the pro- and anti-clerical movements reached a crescendo. [...] It had a bearing on public education, {{up to the point}} that in 1834 the [...] "Les Amis Philanthropes" [...] lodge founded the Université libre et laïque de Bruxelles, on the suggestion of Théodore Verhaegen in his discourse of 24 June 1834 to that lodge. [...] The project then expanded massively, with several Catholic freemasons choosing freemasonry over the Catholic Church. [...] Little by little Freemasonry came to recruit its members from the anti-clerical milieux, but the struggle was rough, as seen most of all in the changes in the Grand Lodge. [...] For example, the old [...] "Bonne Amitié" [...] lodge at Namur came to be held at arm's length by its [...] "ancients", members of the Primitive Scottish Rite, and so did not disappear despite the importance of the <b>disaffiliations</b> and dissensions caused by the encyclical. [...] Other lodges, however, did not have the same opportunity.|$|R
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{cancellation of}} the debate by Durham Union Society President Anna Birley on safety grounds was met with fierce backlash. NUS President Wes Streeting was prompted to personally appear before the Durham Union Society to apologise {{for the actions of}} the officers concerned, though outrage among Durham students was sufficient that a significant number protested outside the debating chamber at the time. A protest group on Facebook quickly amassed over 2,500 members. An official petition was lodged with Durham Students' Union to call for a referendum on <b>disaffiliation</b> from NUS. On 12 March 2010, the referendum concluded with a majority of voting students choosing to disaffiliate.|$|E
25|$|Reuther was spurred toward merger by {{the threats}} from David J. McDonald, Murray's {{successor}} as President of the Steelworkers, who disliked Reuther intensely, insulted him publicly and flirted with <b>disaffiliation</b> from the CIO. While Reuther {{set out a}} number of conditions for merger with the AFL, such as constitutional provisions supporting industrial unionism, guarantees against racial discrimination, and internal procedures to clean up corrupt unions, his weak bargaining position forced him to compromise most of these demands. Although the unions that made up the CIO survived, and in some cases thrived, as members of the newly created AFL-CIO, the CIO as an organization was folded into the AFL-CIO's Industrial Union Department.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{a number}} of {{universities}} across the UK, such as Oxford, Newcastle, Cambridge and others, held referenda {{on whether or not}} their student unions should leave the NUS. The grounds for this range from perceived anti-Semitism within the NUS, a lack of democracy within the NUS, not feeling represented by what many view as an overly politicised movement, and others. The campaign has been marred by allegations of cheating or breaking referendum rules by the NUS at various universities by allegations of racism, tokenism, and others by students campaigning both for and against <b>disaffiliation.</b> Despite this, prestigious universities such as Newcastle have left the NUS, with others such as Oxford and Cambridge voting to remain.|$|E
50|$|NTV is not {{the only}} {{television}} station that lost its affiliation status with a major television network and became independent in 2002. Other similar <b>disaffiliations</b> with U.S. stations occurred at that time in ways similar to that of NTV over contract disputes, both of which were longtime network affiliates for their given areas, and both of which became independent stations afterwards. The two stations are NBC affiliate KRON-TV in San Francisco and longtime CBS affiliate WJXT in Jacksonville, Florida. However, in 2006, KRON became the San Francisco Bay Area's affiliate of MyNetworkTV (then a television network owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and 20th Television and now a television broadcast syndication service), and from 2010 to 2011 took a secondary alternate NBC affiliation by airing selected NBC programming when the local NBC owned-and-operated station, KNTV (no relation to CJON-TV) in San Jose, could not do so. A similar switch would later occur in 2009 when three stations of the now-defunct CH/E! system, CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, CJNT-TV in Montreal and CHEK-TV in Victoria, British Columbia all went independent following the collapse of E! (coincidentally, like CJON, CHEK was originally a CBC affiliate and later a CTV affiliate).|$|R
50|$|The {{launches}} {{of these}} networks drastically {{reduced the number}} of independent stations in the United States; some mid-sized markets would not regain a general entertainment independent until the early 2000s, through sign-ons of unaffiliated stations and <b>disaffiliations</b> by existing stations from other commercial and noncommercial networks. In 2001, Univision Communications purchased several English language independents in larger markets (which mostly operated as Home Shopping Network affiliates until the late 1990s) from USA Broadcasting to form the nuclei of the upstart Spanish language network Telefutura (now UniMás), which launched in January 2002. Several stations affiliated with The WB and UPN became independent again when the respective parent companies of those networks (Time Warner and CBS Corporation) decided to shut them down to form The CW, which launched in September 2006 with a schedule dominated by shows held over from and an affiliate body primarily made up of stations previously aligned with its two predecessors. Some of the newly independent stations subsequently found a new network home through MyNetworkTV, itself created out of the prospect that the UPN affiliates of corporate sister Fox Television Stations would become independents due to The CW choosing to affiliate with CBS Television Stations and Tribune Broadcasting stations in overlapping markets.|$|R
25|$|The 2008 Conference in Blackpool was {{dominated}} by the governance review debate and vote. The proposals were for a restructuring of {{the running of the}} Union but the vote was lost by 25 votes (a two-thirds majority was required). The review was criticised for what was felt by detractors to be an attack on the organisation's democratic accountability. Its supporters however defended the review as providing a more 'innovative' corporate structure which was hoped to make it more credible in negotiating policy, rather than simply 'reactive'. This was not well received by many in the executive with President, Gemma Tumelty, vowing to press ahead with reform. The perceived lack of progress on governance reform has also prompted Imperial College Union to hold a referendum on <b>disaffiliation.</b>|$|E
