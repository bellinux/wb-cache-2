5|$|In 1985, Magical Zoo's The Screamer was a bio-horror RPG {{released}} for the NEC PC-88 {{that was}} set in a post-apocalyptic research facility, while the gameplay featured shooter-based combat and permanent death. The {{latter half of the}} 1980s saw the release of several other horror-themed games, including Konami's Castlevania in 1986, and Sega's Kenseiden and Namco's Splatterhouse in 1988, though despite the macabre <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> these games, their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at the time.

Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.|$|E

40|$|Introduction]: The {{emergence}} of sport psychology has influenced how athletes train and compete. Increasingly, coaches and athletes are incorporating mental {{as well as}} physical skills into their training programs and competition routines. Imagery is one such mental skill. To develop an imagery program tailored to the athlete three pieces of information are vital: the <b>imagery</b> ability <b>of</b> the athlete; the effect <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> on performance; and the motive for using imagery. This paper explores measurement <b>of</b> the <b>imagery</b> ability <b>of</b> the athlete. Specifically, the aim was to create new and valid measures <b>of</b> kinaesthetic <b>imagery</b> and examine the relationship these measures share with existing measures <b>of</b> <b>imagery...</b>|$|R

5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E

40|$|The {{concepts}} of consolation {{and of the}} afterlife have produced a lot of unease. Over the past two centuries, ‘consolation’ has been negatively associated with Christian <b>imageries</b> <b>of</b> the afterlife; and since such <b>imageries</b> <b>of</b> the afterlife {{have been subjected to}} scathing critiques by nineteenth and twentieth century ideologies working through in popular culture, there is nowadays a widespread perception that consolation is a cheap affair, trading in illusory denials of death and compensations for misfortunes in this life. The fairly recent increase in death studies and the renewed interest in the cross-cultural and historical richness of ‘continuing bonds’ have not yet led to a fair re-appreciation of the legacy of Western consolatory literature. In my article I propose to fill the lacuna and look afresh at the legacy of Western consolation and its invocation of the afterlife, with a particular focus on the formative phase of ancient Greco-Roman and early Christian consolations: How do they represent the afterlife, and what is its consolatory function? I argue that early Christian and ancient philosophical consolations are far more closely linked than is claimed in the literature; in fact they can be characterized as members of one extended family, sharing essential characteristics. I argue, moreover, that where ancient consolations propose <b>imageries</b> <b>of</b> the afterlife, their main thrust is to dignify fundamental life choices and thus to facilitate biographical closure...|$|R

5|$|Heaven is {{represented}} by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Vargas Llosa {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a {{membership}} he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La tía Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.|$|E
5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project.|$|E
