5|$|Alphonse Amadou Alley (April 9, 1930 – March 28, 1987) was a Beninese {{army officer}} and {{political}} figure. He was most active when his country {{was known as}} <b>Dahomey.</b> He was born in Bassila, central <b>Dahomey,</b> and enrolled in schools in Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal before enlisting in the French army in 1950. He saw combat in Indochina from 1950 to 1953, in Morocco from 1955 to 1956, and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961. After the coup in 1965, President Christophe Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army. Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley's chef de cabinet in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the Ewe {{people of}} Ghana, who {{were said to}} have been guided from <b>Dahomey</b> to Ghana by a bird, {{incorporate}} the flapping of the bird's wings in dances such as Agbadza, Atsiagbekor, and Gakpa.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{collaboration}} with Foccart, Houphouët-Boigny {{took part in the}} attempted coup of 16 January 1977 led by famed French mercenary Bob Denard against the revolutionary regime of Mathieu Kérékou in <b>Dahomey.</b> Houphouët-Boigny, in order to fight against the Marxists in power in Angola, also lent his support to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA party, whose feud with the MPLA party led to the Angolan Civil War.|$|E
50|$|After the {{election}} Dunglas won {{a seat in}} <b>Dahomey's</b> territorial assembly. He died in 1952 in Porto Novo. His grave {{is located in a}} Porto Novian cemetery.|$|R
500|$|U.S. Ambassador to Gabon Charles Darlington {{suggested}} that the coup plotters may have tried to imitate the style of Colonel Christophe Soglo. Soglo, a commander in <b>Dahomey's</b> 800-man army, had deposed President Hubert Maga in October 1963, ruled for about a month, then resigned in favor of <b>Dahomey's</b> citizens. The plotters apparently did not consider French involvement, so therefore didn't take any additional steps to prevent it. They could have created protests to show public support, although {{the spokesman for the}} coup plotters, Sub-Lieutenant Daniel Mbene, justified the coup by claiming in a broadcast that the army had to act to avoid the rash of [...] "uncontrollable demonstrations that would have been difficult to halt".|$|R
50|$|In the November 1946 French National Assembly elections, Apithy ran {{under the}} ticket of Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO). Winning 32,977 votes out of 33,605 cast, he {{captured}} <b>Dahomey's</b> sole seat allotted at the Assembly. His only opponent, Emile Poisson, left the race {{the day before}} the election.|$|R
5|$|Borders and {{administration}} of the colony similarly changed a number of times. Originally, and for the initial period, the colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a reorganization of the colony split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, the Ivory Coast and <b>Dahomey.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Allied {{victory in}} Abyssinia the Force Publique {{moved to the}} British colony of Nigeria, which was {{being used as a}} staging ground for a planned {{invasion}} of Vichy-controlled <b>Dahomey</b> which did not occur, was also garrisoned by 13,000 Congolese troops. Then a part of the Force Publique went to Egypt and British Mandatory Palestine and was redesignated the 1st Belgian Congo Brigade Group during 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Benin {{participated in}} eight summer Olympic games between {{its debut in}} the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Competing under the name <b>Dahomey,</b> Benin made their Olympic debut in 1972, sending two athletes to the games. The most number of Benin athletes {{participating}} in a summer games, is 16 in the 1980 games in Moscow. Five athletes from Benin were selected {{to compete in the}} 2008 games: track and field athletes Fabienne Feraez and Mathieu Gnanligo; swimmers Alois Dansou and Gloria Koussihouede; and taekwondo practitioner Jean Moloise Ogoudjobi.|$|E
50|$|He {{started to}} work as a restorer for the Abomey Museum in 1987, when he was hired to {{replicate}} the original bas-reliefs that told many of <b>Dahomey's</b> legends and stories while celebrating the individual kings for the new King Glelé royal palace façade, among the Royal Palaces of Abomey reconstructed by the government of Benin.|$|R
6000|$|The branch Churches have no {{important}} liberties, {{none that}} {{give them an}} important voice in their own affairs. Those are all locked up, and Mrs. Eddy has the key. [...] "Local Self-Government" [...] is a large name and sounds well; but the branch Churches have no more of it than have the privates in the King of <b>Dahomey's</b> army.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} trade, while Abiodun favored {{economic}} expansion {{for its own}} sake, his opponents favored using the wealth from <b>Dahomey's</b> tribute to finance further military expansion. Abiodun soon proved victorious and pursued a policy of peaceful trade with the European merchants of the coast. This course significantly weakened the army, leaving his successor, Awole, facing a number of local revolts.|$|R
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by <b>Dahomey</b> and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{became quite}} tense {{with each of}} the sides making threats and refusing to meet with each other. Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto-Novo would join with Nigeria. Ethnic tensions increased with these threats and with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories. Many inside the country considered <b>Dahomey</b> to be close to civil war.|$|E
5|$|While {{at work on}} The Songlines between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin {{frequently}} {{came down}} with colds. He also developed skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in <b>Dahomey</b> or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E
50|$|King Agaja (1718-1740) {{defeated}} {{the kingdom of}} Allada in 1724 and the Kingdom of Whydah in 1727. This resulted in killing of several prisoners. Many of the prisoners were also sold as slaves at Ouidah, then called Gléwé. These wars {{marked the beginning of}} the dominance of <b>Dahomey's</b> slave trade (which was carried out through the port of Whydah with the Europeans.|$|R
50|$|Thereafter Apithy {{was named}} to several {{political}} posts, all while a member of <b>Dahomey's</b> only political party, the Dahomeyan Progressive Union (UPD). He was the choice for {{vice president of the}} Rassemblement Democratique Africain (RDA), though left the organization shortly afterwards when facing Catholic opposition. The year 1946 also marked his entry into the General Council, becoming one of its inaugural 30 representatives.|$|R
2500|$|The French {{column was}} able to cross another [...] toward Abomey after Adégon, bivouacking at the village of Akpa. From the moment they arrived, they were {{attacked}} daily. From the French arrival until October 14, <b>Dahomey's</b> Amazons were conspicuously absent from the fighting. Then, on the 15th, they reappear in nearly every later engagement inflicting significant losses especially against officers. Once resupplied, the French left Akpa on October 26 toward the village of Cotopa.|$|R
5|$|Following {{independence}} in 1960, <b>Dahomey</b> had its first elections in December. As {{a result of}} Fon ethnic identification with Ahomadégbé and perceived corruption and ineffectiveness of the Apithy administration, Ahomadégbé made large gains in the Porto-Novo region traditionally aligned with Apithy. Apithy responded to this by making a parliamentary alliance with Maga which made Maga the first President of <b>Dahomey</b> and made Apithy the first Minister of Finance and then later the Vice President. To consolidate his power, Maga promoted a number of allies and people from the north through the new positions in the country's civil service. In addition, he tried to weaken his ally's political power by appointing Apithy to be the Ambassador of France {{while he was still}} the Vice President. Unfortunately giving political positions and channeling money to the north caused severe budgetary problems in the country which eventually led Maga to freeze wages for public employees leading to a general strike by unionists and students in October 1963. On 28 October, Christophe Soglo, the Army Chief of Staff, removed Maga from power and created a new system of government with Apithy being appointed the head of state and Ahomadégbé the head of government. However, the division between these roles and the responsibilities between the two leaders was not clearly defined. During the 1963 coup, Maga and many of his inner circle were arrested and tried for mismanagement of public funds.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused {{to participate in the}} Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, <b>Dahomey,</b> and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to their disqualification, former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election was held on May 15, and was Dahomey's first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country, {{in an attempt to}} crack down on dissent. Alley felt he had made a mistake in disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to <b>Dahomey.</b>|$|E
50|$|Zinsou {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of <b>Dahomey's</b> first {{political}} party, the Union Progressiste Dahoméenne (UPD). He was an assistant to Sourou-Migan Apithy in 1945 and was a deputy to the French National Assembly. From 1947 to 1953 he was vice president of the Assembly to the French Union. During this time the UPD splintered into ethnic/regional factions led by Apithy, Hubert Maga, and Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Zinsou merged the remainder of the UPD with Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin's Bloc Populaire Africain to form the Union Démocratique Dahoméenne.|$|R
5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, <b>Dahomey's</b> first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|R
5000|$|Sinzogan was {{alternate}} {{judge of}} the military trial convened in 1972 to address an attempted coup that Kouandété tried to perpetrate. He handed the death penalty to Kouandété {{and two of his}} companions. In October, when Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup, Sinzogan was removed from the military and appointed commissioner of the National Society of the Development of the Forest (S.N.A.F.O.R.). Academic Samuel Decalo described the man as [...] "too timid to mount a coup" [...] during the 1960s and 1970s, being [...] "one of <b>Dahomey's</b> few senior officers not to attempt to." ...|$|R
5|$|Empire: Total War {{ships with}} nine {{different}} versions of box art, eight of which represent the major faction for the market the game is sold in, and one general international version. For instance, German customers are presented artwork displaying colours with the Prussian eagle and Prussian army uniforms, whilst the American artwork shows the American revolutionaries and the Betsy Ross flag. A special edition version of Empire: Total War entitled Special Forces incorporates six elite faction-specific units: HMS Victory, the French Irish Brigade, Spanish guerillas, Gurkha infantry, Rogers' Rangers and the Ottoman Ribauldequin. Additionally, three retailers were provided with a special unit for customers to receive; Amazon.com customers were given the <b>Dahomey</b> Amazons, buyers from Best Buy were able to receive the USS Constitution and customers buying from Game received the Death's Head Hussars. A further 14 units were added {{with the objective of}} increasing graphical and unit variety among the factions. These 14 units were released as part of the game's 1.3 patch in June 2009; accompanying the update was a second set of 14 units, released as downloadable content for purchase.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1959, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} {{federation}} linking the Sudanese Republic with Senegal, <b>Dahomey,</b> and the Upper Volta in a federation of autonomous states. By April, however, neither Dahomey's nor Upper Volta's legislatures had ratified the federation, and so the Mali Federation was formed with only the Sudanese Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta's RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in the Sudanese Republic and joined forces with the dominant party in Senegal, headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The federation achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the French Community in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|With the {{appointment}} of Zinsou as a civilian leader of the country, Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga tried {{to return to the}} country but were informed that their plane would be shot down if they entered <b>Dahomey</b> airspace; they instead flew to neighboring Togo. Zinsou, who had a history of advocacy against the policies of the military, quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host of policies without consultation with them. In addition, to control continued deficits, Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population. The result was that on 10 December 1969, Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near Natitingou. Following the coup, Kouandété found {{that he did not have}} the support to rule throughout the entire military, and so instead Paul-Emile de Souza (the director of military affairs for Zinsou's government) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate (with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît Sinzogan holding the other seats). The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections, thus allowing Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga to run.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} September Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{convinced}} the trade unions that he owned to begin another strike for Maga's inability to promote national development and ensure {{the welfare of the}} working class. The strike, which existed in <b>Dahomey's</b> capital of Porto Novo and its largest city of Cotonou, became so serious that police forces used tear gas and ended when Maga sent down some faithful Northerners, carrying around bows and arrows and patrolling the streets at night. At the same time members of the UDD organised a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy for help in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately rejected.|$|R
25|$|Moumouni {{was born}} in Cotonou on October 25, 1922. Moumounti {{graduated}} from the Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2 University of the University of Bordeaux in France with a Doctorate of Medicine, and later qualified as a Master of Public Health and Science, obtained respectively in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Chicago, United States. After his university studies, Moumoni returned to Cotonou, where he practised as a physician until 1959, and would later spend much {{of his adult life}} outside <b>Dahomey's</b> borders. When independence was obtained, Moumouni was appointed Director of the Ministry of Health for his country. From 1963 to 1968, he worked for the World Health Organization in Brazzaville, Congo.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1972, when Mathieu Kérékou led a {{coup and}} seized power, Hachème was again {{dismissed}} {{from the army}} as well as every other senior officer from the south. He was instead given the post of Commissioner of <b>Dahomey's</b> Ceramic Crafts (SONAC), a role with very little responsibility. Along with Alley and Pascal Chabi Kao, Hachème was accused of planning a coup against Kérékou on February 28, 1973 and was imprisoned with 20 years of hard labor. Hachème was released on amnesty on August 1, 1984, {{as well as all}} other political detainees besides those involved in the [...] "ignoble and barbarous imperialist armed aggression of Sunday, January 16, 1977." ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Dahomey</b> Amazons were an all-female {{military}} regiment of the Kingdom of <b>Dahomey</b> {{in present}} day Benin - the nickname {{was given by}} western observers.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, the French {{had another}} major {{encounter}} with the Fon at the village of Adégon. The Fon, again, fared badly, losing 86 <b>Dahomey</b> Regulars and 417 <b>Dahomey</b> Amazons. The French suffered six dead and another 32 wounded before the fighting was ended. The French made use of a bayonet charge, which inflicted the lion's share of Dahomey's casualties. The Battle {{was a turning point}} in the mind of <b>Dahomey.</b> The royal court decided that there would be no victory for <b>Dahomey.</b> The battle was also significant in that much of Dahomey's Amazon corps was lost in the engagement.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Dahomey</b> {{follows the}} {{attempts}} of two con men (played by Bert Williams and George Walker) charged with recovering a lost heirloom to be flipped for profit. The {{search for the}} heirloom crosses paths with a colonized society that looks to settle in <b>Dahomey.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} September Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{convinced}} the trade unions that he owned to begin another strike for Maga's inability to promote national development and ensure {{the welfare of the}} working class. The strike, which existed in <b>Dahomey's</b> capital of Porto Novo and its largest city of Cotonou, became so serious that police forces used tear gas and ended when Maga sent down some faithful Northerners, carrying around bows and arrows and patrolling the streets at night.

5000|$|He {{served in}} the French senate from 1955 to 1958, joining the Independents d'Outre-Mer. While a senator, Zinsou {{developed}} a close bond with future President of Senegal Léopold Sédar Senghor. Zinsou was a deputy to <b>Dahomey's</b> Territorial (later National) Assembly and was Minister of Commerce during the [...] "loi-cadre" [...] liberalization period of 1958 to 1959. He {{did not want to}} see the breakup of France's African colonies after independence and was the secretary of the Dakar-based Parti du Regroupement Africain (PRA). Zinsou broke with Apithy in 1959 after Apithy backed out of the idea of a Mali Federation, one of the PRA's chief proposals.|$|R
