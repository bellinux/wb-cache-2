To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz.

In Switzerland, the album jumped from 0 to No.1 and was awarded Double-Platinum for selling 100,000 units, which was {{ranked in the top}} 40 albums of all-time, after remaining on the Swiss album chart for a staggering 67 weeks. Shortly after the release of World in Motion, Baumann went on a promotional tour in Asia for twenty days, which was then followed by another one month-tour in Brazil, Chile and Colombia.|$|E
500|$|Although more commercially {{successful}} than the band's previous albums, Mother's Milk received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion {{found throughout the}} record. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it [...] "a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," [...] and believed that [...] "if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, 'Good Time Boys', <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic 'Higher Ground' to prove that this new lineup was onto something special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out 'Punk Rock Classic' and the band's own punched-up tribute to 'Magic Johnson', Mother's Milk was everything the band had hoped for, {{and a little more}} besides." [...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it a [...] "high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rap—sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone," [...] while noting that [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] combined [...] "electrifying musicianship". The Toronto Star commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were [...] "the Mothers of Invention for the 1990s." [...] In 2005, Mother's Milk was ranked number 359 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.|$|E

One whole company was enlisted from the Railway Clearing House {{and the rest of}} the battalion from other local businesses and organisations such as London Zoo in Regent's Park. Early training was undertaken in civilian clothes, parading in the drill hall and then marching to Regent's Park for training. The first commanding officer was Lt-Col E.J. Christie, a believer in singing on the march, and the battalion soon became known as 'Christie's Minstrels'. In October the battalion [...] absorbed the unfit and Home Service men of 1/19th, but lost some of its best recruits in exchange. The Home Service men were later passed on to the 3/19th (Reserve) Battalion.|$|E

The track was produced upon the request of Coca-Cola in Spain. They were in search of an artist who could produce an attention-drawing mambo-song for their new campaign. However, the condition was {{that it had to be}} done within a period of ten days. This task was completed and handed over to Coca-Cola by René and his co-producer Axel Breitung within the given time-limit. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> couple of weeks for the single [...] "Chihuahua" [...] to reach No.1 on the Spanish single chart. The song eventually became No.1 in Switzerland, and France also. It was certified Platinum in Switzerland for sales of over 40,000 units and in France the single reached a Diamond status for sales of over one million units.|$|E

Mr. Tilly was very watchful over the spars, and though we had a large share of squally weather, and for some days, at different times, were becalmed in a heavy swell, the most trying of all situations to the gear of a vessel, yet, thank God, all went well, and I have heard of the schooner safe in Auckland harbour. About forty of our Melanesians here are Solomon Islanders, from seven different islands; a few came from the New Hebrides, the rest from the Banks Islands. We are already pretty well settled down to our work. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> day or two to get to work; our old scholars are such great helpers to us.

One of our young baptized lads fell into sinful ways, and is not now with us. He was not one of whom we had great expectations, though we trusted that he would go on steadily. Many others, thank God, were kept pure and truthful in the midst of it all, refusing even to sleep one night away from our little hut, and in some cases refusing even to leave the schooner. [...] "No, I will wait till I am married," [...] said two lads to me, who were married here to Christian girls on November 24th, [...] "and then go ashore for a time with my young wife. I don't think I should yield, but I don't want to put myself in the way of such temptations." [...] And so, when I had naturally expected that they would take their six weeks' holiday on shore, while the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] went from Mota to Norfolk Island and back (during my stay at Mota), they remained on board, rejoining me, as they were two of my boating crew, for the New Hebrides trip! This was very comforting. And when I married three couples on November 24th, and knew that they were pure, youths and girls alike, from the great sin of heathenism, you can well think that my heart was very full of thankfulness and hope.|$|E
