40|$|Some {{countries}} have sophisticated financial systems, with numerous banks and a mature set of bond markets. In others, such features are only embryonic. Most developed countries are {{at one end}} of a spectrum between these positions. Most developing and transition economies are moving towards that point, but at different speeds; and some have quite some way to go to reach it. The first point to stress about transition and developing countries financial and economic systems is that they are very far from homogeneous 1. Money, in its narrowest form of token coinage and paper notes, circulates in every country in the world, however. In more advanced countries, monetary policy works through interest rates. Central banks alter their policy rate. Interest rates on treasury bills and retail interest rates on loans and deposits quickly move more or less one for one. Interest rate changes then prompt changes in consumption and investment spending through a variety of channels; and policy interest rate changes may alter the value of the exchange rate, with consequent impact on aggregate demand through changes in the gap between exports and imports. Interest rates therefore provide the crucial early steps in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in advanced countries. So <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mechanism <b>work</b> in institutional environments where interest rates are relatively unimportant, or even, in the extreme, completely absent? <b>How</b> and why <b>does</b> a rise in monetary aggregates arise in such a context?

In this chapter, we examine in some detail optical technology, hypertext, and the marriage of the two—interactive multimedia. Each provides powerful tools for accessing and delivering information spanning diverse media. In concert, these technologies underlie a set of new “cognitive enhancers ” that may significantly alter {{the manner in which}} teachers teach and students learn. Optical Technologies Perhaps our first acquaintance with optical technology was the compact disc, or CD, that brought noise-free music into our living rooms. These 12 -centimeter (4. 72 -inch) shiny silver disks, introduced in the 1980 s, have rapidly advanced in the consumer market. Both CDs and their larger siblings, videodiscs, hold information that is read by a light beam generated by a low-intensity laser—thus, their designation as “optical” technologies. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> The Basics of the Technology Standard computer storage media like hard disks and floppies store information magnetically; variations in magnetism along each disk track are interpreted as strings of 0 s and 1 s.

50|$|PSM helps {{employees}} get {{the most}} out of their job experience and is rapidly evolving to work towards employee goals and company needs effectively. Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as <b>how</b> those <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team’s success and productivity. Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} related surveys of 366 union organisers and 31 state union {{secretaries}} in 13 unions and of 2400 union delegates in 8 unions to examine three issues regarding {{the relationship between}} unions and community. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> delegates who are community activists differ from other delegates? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> union organisers {{who have come to}} the union movement from backgrounds in community or student activism differ from other organisers? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> unions <b>that</b> <b>work</b> in coalition with community groups differ from unions <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not? We find that amongst delegates, community activists are more confident, better networked and have broader orientations than other members, despite their having no higher levels of training and similar levels of functional activism. Community-union delegates are more active and their presence is associated with greater workplace power for the members with whom they are associated. However these characteristics are not something that can be simply transferred from an external context and expected to automatically apply in the workplace. Training is essential to ensure that unions are {{able to take advantage of}} the potential offered by community activists. Indeed, without training just about all the potential they have is lost, as without training community-union activists are not able to effectively apply to the workplace the skills and knowledge they bring from outside. Amongst organisers, those with activist backgrounds have fewer difficulties than their peers in several areas (such as identifying activists and image problems), and appear slightly more oriented to organising issues. Organisers who report that their union branch frequently works in coalition with community or social groups consistently report more positive perceptions on a range of issues concerning organising, democracy, impediments to their work and their own satisfaction and expected tenure. Union secretaries who reported <b>that</b> they had <b>worked</b> a number of times with community or women's groups in campaigning appeared more likely to report increases in membership and in their financial position. Overall, the data suggest that there are gains for unions both from actively engaging with community groups and from recruiting delegates and probably organisers with broader activist experience. However, neither approach alone is the answer to union decline. Each must be part of a broader strategy based around organising, training and democratisation to have any beneficial effect. Community unionism is not a stand-alone tactic that can be isolated from the democratisation and opening of unions to new ideas, new constituencies and new strategies. Instead it is part of a wide-ranging package of union renewal. Griffith Business School, Dept of Employment Relations and Human ResourcesNo Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|When the Hunts came to {{the school}} it {{consisted}} of a single building, Odd Fellows Lodge, and the school had {{an annual budget of}} $840. The Hunts lived with no running water. Hunt began to change the school's educational model to aim more towards vocational training and trade-based studies. Hunt instated classes in sewing, cooking, carpentry, and gardening. Hunt also planted two hundred peach trees (Fort Valley is located in {{what is known as the}} Peach Belt) to expand the agricultural program to include practical and demonstrative agricultural education. Hunt felt a focus on agricultural studies was important given the emphasis on and prevalence of agriculture in middle Georgia, where the school was located. In the beginning and throughout Hunt's career the area surrounding the school was dominated by a population of African Americans who worked in agriculture. Hunt often stated his goal as empowering the African Americans attending Fort Valley, as well as the surrounding African American community, to become effective in their trade. [...] "With Negroes cultivating millions of acres of land, surely no argument is needed to prove the wisdom and the justice of giving them every possible opportunity to learn <b>how</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> more intelligently and with greater skill." [...] In 1907, Hunt presented to the Board of Trustees the need to add the study of scientific agricultural training to the existing agricultural studies program."Working as we do among a people who are engaged very largely in agriculture it would seem to be not only important but absolutely necessary that special inducements be held out to students who wish to give attention to this particular line of work."Also in 1907, Hunt began an annual Fort Valley conference for African American farmers. The conference brought experts from throughout the state, the country and some of the top industrial schools such as Tuskegee, to inform the attendees of the latest agricultural technology and information. At these conferences, Hunt stressed the possibility for African American farmers to own their farms. In 1907, Hunt also began a practical agricultural program, with the help of the United States Department of Agriculture, five acres of land were cultivated and used as part of the educational process through demonstrations. With financial help from the General Board of Education, Hunt added fifty-five acres to the school’s educational farmland in 1915. Hunt’s reputation as an advocate for the African American farmer spread. In 1918, the Governor of Georgia, Hugh M. Dorsey, appointed Hunt to the position of supervisor of Negro economics for the state of Georgia. In this position Hunt focused on problems relating to agricultural labor in Georgia.|$|R
40|$|A {{recurring}} {{question in}} narrative scholarship {{has been the}} relationship of narrative to law. Most narrative scholars agree that stories are central to law. As Stephen Paskey recently pointed out, stories {{are more than a}} tool for persuasion. They are embedded in law’s very structure. But <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> Are rules just stories articulated in a different form? We have barely begun to explore narrative’s roles, but it is already clear that, in the words of Meryl Streep, “it’s complicated. ” A conceptual map of what we’ve learned so far can help us unpack the complexity. Otherwise we may run into two problems: We may be less likely to understand and appreciate each other’s work, and we may have trouble thinking clearly about how law and narrative relate. This article takes a first run at a conceptual map, one that honors the work of narrative scholars of various stripes and explains how the strands in this rich body of work interrelate. With that proposed structure in mind, the article then offers some thoughts about how stories relate to rules. It argues that rules are not the opposite of stories, nor are they just stories in a different form. Rather, at every level of their creation, justification, interpretation, and application, rules are constructed from multiple narrative influences. Understanding these influences will produce judges better able to make good decisions and lawyers better able to perfect their craft. Much work remains to be done, but as the map demonstrates, we are well on our way...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{community}} team at Sobell House {{needed to}} find ways of managing increasing numbers of referrals. It was felt that one person exclusively undertaking telephone support would free more time for others to visit patients with the greatest need at home. The idea was viewed by some with scepticism -"palliative care by phone? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> then?". In December 2009 an advanced nurse practitioner was appointed on a six month trial. PROCESS: The telephone support nurse holds a caseload of 80 - 100 patients. Call frequency is agreed individually and ranges from weekly to monthly. Patients or others can also phone for advice or to discuss changes. Home visits, outpatient appointments or admissions can be arranged as needed. Aspects of care covered include psychological support, symptom management, medication changes, coordination with other services, the provision of information, suggesting 'coping strategies', and so on. RESULTS: The role rapidly proved its worth and the post was made substantive after three months. Feedback from patients and carers from three surveys using detailed questionnaires has been unequivocally positive: We find it very reassuring that help, support and understanding is just a phone call away … Thank you for being there for us and making a difference … [has] taken a positive holistic view outside the treatment regimes … They [other services] are more task and treatment orientated, this provides something which supports living my life. More detailed feedback is available for presentation. CONCLUSION: Regular telephone contact in palliative care can work safely and effectively in providing support at all levels. The role is fully integrated into and valued by the community team and service as a whole. Key is an open, empathic and unhurried approach...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how different organizations and authorities work and collaborate to make children of mentally ill parents more visible. The question formulations, which are used in our research, are: - How do different organizations and authorities work to make children of mentally ill parents more visible and how can this work be improved? - How do laws and guidelines affect the organizations and authorities work to make children of mentally ill parents more visible? - Is there any collaboration between the different organizations and authorities concerning work with children of mentally ill parents, and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> appear? A qualitative method strategy was chosen to gather an in-depth understanding of the informant’s experiences and to collect descriptive information. Six organizations and authorities were selected from the comprehension that they could be important in giving support and because it is possible for them to pay attention to these children. Interviews were performed by using a half- structured interview guide. The study indicates that it is important to pay attention to these children in an early state. It is unclear which organization or authority that has the main responsibility for this task. There seems to be a need for more information and knowledge in the society about mentally illness to decrease the stigmatization. A wider perspective is more often used in the society rather than the specific subject “children of mentally ill parents”. This wider perspective often contains other features, such as abuse and addiction. The secrecy and the obligation to give notice to the social services, can affect the way of paying attention to these children in a negative way. There seems to be a lack of mutual guidelines concerning paying attention to children of mentally ill parents. Collaboration between the organizations and authorities is considered to be necessary, but there is an uncertainty about how it should be organized and accomplished in practice...|$|E

40|$|Air traffic {{management}} (ATM) {{is an industry}} which is not very visible to the public {{but it has a}} big influence on air traffic, including the environmental impact of aviation. There is also little communication regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the business, even though corporate social responsibility is a hot topic which companies in other businesses take seriously. Therefore, this essay is answering the following three research questions: (i) <b>how</b> <b>does</b> ATM work with CSR and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> they communicate <b>that</b> <b>work,</b> (ii) why <b>does</b> ATM work with CSR, and (iii) what opportunities for future development are there for CSR in ATM? In order to answer these questions, research on CSR in general, and related to air traffic, has been studied. The study is built empirically on open sources (websites, reports etc.) and qualitative interviews with representatives of the air navigation service providers LFV, ACR and EUROCONTROL. What is found gives an interesting insight of an industry where corporate social responsibility is a fairly new phenomenon and where companies do not always seem to follow the traditional ways of developing their CSR strategies. It is found <b>that</b> the companies <b>work</b> with and think about CSR in fundamentally different ways but primarily pay attention to the many laws and rules they have to follow. More specifically, ACR believes that following these is sufficient while EUROCONTROL sees the need of more CSR as almost a necessary evil and LFV looks at it as a strategic tool. Lastly, some new opportunities to profit both the companies and society by developing CSR in the industry are identified. The opportunities found are targeted on the three mentioned companies as well as the air {{traffic management}} industry as a whole. One important conclusion is for example that the organizations in the business have much to gain by trying to learn from and inspire each other when it comes to working with corporate social responsibility.

We also want to examine what they think about the sex purchase law and the debate that have arisen around it in the recent years.

In order to answer our issues we have done qualitative interviews with social workers. One of them was a group interview with two social workers and the other was a case study with four social workers. The social workers in the group interview works with prostitution on the street. The social workers in the case study works with prostitution on the Internet and with the persons who buy sex. The interviews have focused on the social workers perspectives, thoughts and the reasoning about their work with prostitution and the sex purchase law.

40|$|International audienceAs {{soon as we}} {{consider}} promising from {{what seems to be}} the most natural point of view – namely a moral point of view – it is immediately seen as an act by which one undertakes a commitment: the obligation for the promiser to perform what she promised to do. Herbert Hart thus says: ‘Promises constitute the obvious case of moral obligation. […] When we promise we make use of specified procedures to change the moral situation; in lawyer's language we exercise a “power” conferred by rules to change moral relations. ’ 1 Thus, when I promise to help someone, I create (for myself) the moral obligation to help this person. It is shown by the fact that one often tells children it is a bad thing not to keep their promises. Now the speech-act character of the promise is supposed to rely on this ‘creation’ of duty. That is to say that a promise consists in acting by committing oneself to perform what one said one would perform. The active aspect of a promise would thus lie in the taken commitment – a commitment which, at first glance, seems to be of a moral kind. Contrary to the one who merely expresses the intention to perform something, the one who promises does take the obligation to perform what she commits to; the one who promised cannot change her mind. Somehow she is bound to perform what she promised to do, as if the promise itself had a constraining force (or efficiency). But how is such a thing possible? To put the question the way Warnock once did: ‘[Why] (or how) does a promise induce, in the promise-giver, an “extra” sense that he ought to do the thing specified in the promise? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> What is in promising, what could it be, that mysteriously generates a special sort of commitment to acting in a special way?’ 1 And, we may add, is this special sort of commitment a moral one? 2 Is it because it is a(n) (intrinsically) moral (speech) act that a promise does generate a commitment? That is to say: is it because a promise belongs to the domain of morals that it is a speech act? In this paper, I shall address these questions by first examining the accepted conception of speech act theory (mainly John R. Searle's one) and, then, by criticizing its intentional account of the promise's efficiency (namely its ‘illocutionary force’). I will thus show (in a Humean and Austinian vein) that only a conventionalist conception can account for the special efficiency (a normative efficiency) of a promise (as a speech act). I will conclude that this efficiency is not intrinsically moral, even if the choice of using such a speech act pertains to a deliberate, and as such a moral, choice. Promising is not in itself moral but to make a promise – to play the game of promising – is, in our society, morally binding because it can be, and usually is, a moral practice...|$|E
40|$|Australia’s present private-public {{healthcare}} mix is unsustainable, argues Gwendolyn Gray in this {{extract from}} her new book, The Politics of Medicare, published by UNSW Press in association with Australian Policy Online HEALTH policy conflicts are so intractable, it has been said, that political rivals can be vanquished simply by giving them responsibility for the portfolio. Since the emergence of modern medicine {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century, health ministers in Australia, as in most industrialised countries, have been regularly embroiled in do-or-die struggles between unyielding interests. Health has been a major issue at almost every federal election since the 1940 s and disputes have raged between elections. Nowhere is Harold Lasswell’s view of politics as a struggle over who gets what, when and how more clearly exemplified than in the politics of health policy. Huge benefits flow from the production of health services, and the shape of a nation’s health system largely determines who gains and who loses. Health is big business. Average spending in OECD countries was 8. 4 per cent of gross domestic product in 2001. Australia’s spending in the same year was 9. 2 per cent of GDP; in the country with the highest costs, the United States, expenditure was 13. 9 per cent of GDP. The enormous size of health as an industry can be illustrated by a comparison with defence: in 2001, Australia spent well over five times as much on health as on defence; in the United States health spending was four-and-a-half times higher than defence spending. For providers, high profits and high incomes are at stake. For citizens, the central question is whether access to high-quality and appropriate services is affordable. And governments have their own set of concerns: ideology, electoral advantage and issues of principle are important but, throughout the OECD, the overriding government objective of the past two decades has been to restrain escalating health care costs. These three sets of objectives - high profits and incomes, affordable access to quality services and control of total health care expenditures - cannot all be achieved at the same time. The stakes, therefore, are high. Nowhere, with perhaps the exception of the United States, have health financing policies been more vehemently contested than in Australia. In keeping with the tradition of perpetual struggle, 2003 was a troubled year in Australian health policy. Continuing anxiety about declining levels of general practitioner bulk billing manifested itself in lively political activity from the beginning. As the primary instrument for removing the financial barriers that prevent people from using medical services, bulk billing is a fundamental building block of Medicare. By the end of the year, little had been achieved: the government’s efforts to defuse health policy as a political issue had failed. And the passage of the revamped Medicare Plus in March 2004 has done nothing to resolve the main problems of the system. Public disquiet intensified when, in February 2003, an ACNielsen poll found that bulk billing had declined sharply and predicted that, within six months, only 22 per cent of general practitioners would offer this payment method for all services. When the prime minister claimed in March that bulk billing was never meant to be universal he set off another round of argument; ‘leaks’ about proposed reforms served only to magnify the controversy. The announcement of the Fairer Medicare reform package at the end of April 2003 pleased no one. It was condemned by all major stakeholders, provider and consumer groups alike, and all the other political parties. The Labor opposition pledged a double injection of funding to ‘revive’ Medicare. In the meantime, ‘defend Medicare’ groups formed around the country and existing groups stepped up their activities. Official statistics showed that general practitioner bulk billing had fallen to its lowest level in thirteen years and headlines like ‘Economic rationalists move in on Medicare’ appeared. Leading journalists were generally critical, and some, like Alan Ramsey, claimed that the prime minister had always intended to dismantle Medicare, despite his promise in 1996 that the scheme would be retained ‘in its entirety. ’ Opinion polls showed that only 10 per cent of people thought they would be better off under the Fairer Medicare plan and 77 per cent of people thought that the tax cuts of the May budget should have been spent on health and education. Enabling legislation failed to pass the Senate, where the Democrats moved to establish a select committee to examine Medicare issues, including the likely impact of the proposed package on access, affordability and service quality. In June, the government indicated that it was willing to negotiate with the Democrats and independents in the Senate but it was unable to secure the passage of its legislation. Debate continued throughout the winter, fuelled by evidence from multiple perspectives presented to the Senate committee and by a report, commissioned by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, which found that elective surgery was increasingly being moved to private hospitals and that citizens without private insurance were being denied access to a range of surgical procedures. In August, research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that health costs had increased more than twice as fast as other prices in the previous year, reaching an all-time high of 9. 3 per cent of GDP. More damaging for the government was the finding that direct charges to patients had increased even faster, by 7. 7 per cent each year in real terms between 1997 and 2002, the period covering most of the government’s term of office. At the end of September, the prime minister announced that Tony Abbott would replace Kay Patterson as health minister. The Senate committee, whose government members were in a minority, reported in October 2003. It concluded that the Fairer Medicare package would lead to a further decline in bulk billing for non-concession cardholders and that working families and those with chronic illnesses would be most severely affected. It recommended that the main planks of the package be rejected and that policies be developed which would be oriented ‘towards the role of Medicare as a universal insurer, with equal benefits for everyone. ’ Amid the release of statistics showing a further decline in bulk billing and reports that voters rated health a priority issue, the new minister announced that he was looking at proposals to amend the package. The prime minister announced ‘Medicare Plus’ in November. The central feature was a commitment to spend an additional $ 1. 5 billion, to be used mainly for additional payments to doctors who continued to bulk bill concession cardholders, for more comprehensive safety nets and for additional training places for doctors and nurses. Minister Abbott announced that he was ‘reasonably optimistic’ that the necessary legislation would be passed in the Senate within a fortnight. He was to be disappointed. The fate of Medicare Plus, quickly tagged ‘Medicare Minus,’ by Labor leader, Simon Crean, was similar to that of the previous package. With one exception, the same array of groups condemned the new proposals because, as in the Fairer Medicare package, the assumption remained that user charges would be a permanent and major financing mechanism. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) cautiously welcomed the scheme as a ‘second best’ option. It suggested that the money could have been better spent on an across-the-board increase in the general Medicare rebate to doctors. Minister Abbott’s attempts to negotiate with the Democrats and independents in the Senate, like the efforts of his predecessor, Senator Patterson, were unsuccessful. During discussions, broader issues, such as the low bulk-billing rates among specialists, were raised, compounding problems. On 25 November, the Select Committee on Medicare was reconstituted to conduct an inquiry into key elements of Medicare Plus. The government’s efforts to resolve health policy problems before 2004, an election year, had come to nothing. After intense negotiations and significant government concessions, Medicare Plus finally passed the Senate in March 2004. Because the legislation does not address the fundamental structural flaws of the two-tiered arrangements, health will continue to be a high-profile political issue. Despite the arguments and counter-arguments, the moves and countermoves, 2003 was not an unusually contentious year in Australian health politics. Since the McGowan government tried to reform the NSW hospital system in the first years of the twentieth century, every attempt to introduce major change has been engulfed in intense controversy. Other notable periods of disputation, at times bordering on hysteria, include the proposal to introduce national health and pensions insurance in the late 1930 s, Labor’s attempt to introduce a national health service in the 1940 s and the introduction of Medibank, Medicare’s prototype, in the 1970 s. In the case of Medibank, the claims that participants made and the lengths to which they were prepared to take their political activities seem extraordinary in 2004, given that national health insurance has operated for twenty years. The AMA launched a political campaign of enormous proportions. It engaged a public relations firm, placed advertisements in all sections of the media (including 250 television commercials a week) and distributed 16, 000 publicity kits in 1973 alone. Doctors went on speaking tours across country and engaged the public relations services of a former Miss Australia, Sue Gallie. At the same time, every effort was made to influence members of federal parliament. The opposition spokesperson for social security, Senator Don Chipp, argued in the national legislature that the introduction of Medibank would create anarchy. ‘Anarchy,’ he said, ‘is a situation not unknown to socialists. It is part of their bread-and-butter. ’ The manager of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia, a large voluntary insurance organisation, claimed that the new scheme was based on Karl Marx’s theories and that health care would henceforth be bought at the ‘government shop. ’ The dynamics underpinning health policy struggles are not well understood. Opinion polls, for decades, have reported that large numbers of citizens, sometimes up to 45 per cent, cannot answer straightforward questions about proposed policies, even when the issues in question are high on the political agenda. Leading journalists, too, frequently seem unclear about the details and cogency of arguments. One of the main reasons for confusion is the complexity of financing and benefit arrangements in a two-tiered system, which is being made more complicated by the day. Another reason is that contending interests push their own perspectives (often disguising them as the interests of others), making it difficult to assess their validity. As in other countries, the views of well-resourced, institutionalised provider groups tend to dominate public discussions; the voice of the community, where groups have relatively few resources, is weak. The information problem was articulated by the ABC radio presenter (and lawyer), James O’Loghlin, at the end of 2003 : I’m still wading my way through the whole Medicare thing [...] . It’s quite embarrassing, because it’s one of the big issues of the year, but I still have to go back and think, ‘Okay, what’s the gap again, and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work,</b> and how does the rebate work, and why is it if I don’t have private health insurance I’m somehow worse off financially because of the rebate thing?’ The present system is inherently - and fatally - unstable. Moreover, it creates serious problems for access and equity: as doctors raise their fees and abandon bulk billing, the user charges that people pay will become both higher and more widespread, deterring people from seeking the care they need. Medicare cannot co-exist with a large private hospital insurance sector and a system in which doctors are free to choose their own fees, except at the cost of huge taxpayer subsidies to private insurance or the virtual destruction of Medicare. Because the health debate focuses on hospital and medical services, it concentrates attention - and resources - on services for the sick. These are crucially important but they are not the only services that we should expect a health system to provide. Politically, there has been little room for considering the way the health system should be organised or the way doctors might be paid. The social environment is not seen as a health issue and the preventive and support services that might improve population health are a dead issue, discussed largely within small groups of experts. The evaluation of treatments is rarely discussed. And the major casualty is health itself. Gwendolyn Gray is a senior lecturer in political science at the Australian National University.
