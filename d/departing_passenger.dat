40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A very economical way of reducing the operational energy consumed by large commercial buildings such as an airport terminal is the automatic control of its active energy systems. Such control can adjust the indoor environment systems setpoints to satisfy comfort during occupancy or when unoccupied, initiate energy conservation setpoints and if necessary, shut down {{part of the building}} systems. Adjusting energy control setpoints manually in large commercial buildings can be a nightmare for facility managers. Incidentally for such buildings, occupancy based control strategies are not achieved through the use of conventional controllers alone. This research, therefore, investigated the potential of using a high-level control system in airport terminal building. The study presents the evolution of a novel fuzzy rule-based supervisory controller, which intelligently establishes comfort setpoints based on flow of passenger through the airport as well as variable external environmental conditions. The inputs to the supervisory controller include: the time schedule of the arriving and <b>departing</b> <b>passenger</b> planes; the expected number of passengers; zone daylight illuminance levels; and external temperature. The outputs from the supervisory controller are the low-level controllers internal setpoint profile for thermal comfort, visual comfort and indoor air quality. Specifically, this thesis makes contribution to knowledge in the following ways: 	It utilised artificial intelligence to develop a novel fuzzy rule-based, energy-saving supervisory controller that is able to establish acceptable indoor environmental quality for airport terminals based on occupancy schedules and ambient conditions. 	It presents a unique methodology of designing a supervisory controller using expert knowledge of an airport s indoor environment systems through MATLAB/Simulink platform with the controller s performance evaluated in both MATLAB and EnergyPlus simulation engine. 	Using energy conservation strategies (setbacks and switch-offs), the pro-posed supervisory control system was shown to be capable of reducing the energy consumed in the Manchester Airport terminal building by up to 40 - 50...|$|E
40|$|As {{the primary}} {{output of the}} air {{transport}} sector, the flow of air passengers {{plays an important role}} in the economic and social welfare of nations, while the sector’s regulatory framework represents the main vehicle through which government can exert a given level of influence over the provision of such services. This research modifies and applies existing macroeconomic impact theory to the Caribbean Community (Caricom), before developing an improved method by which to evaluate the supply and demand effects of further air policy liberalisation in the region. It was found, using an original multi-method approach, that the Caricom air transport sector contributed on average 16. 9 % towards GDP and 14. 2 % of the labour force. A large variation around these regional averages were noted, however, and are said to be primarily determined by exogenous factors such as relative size of GDP, relative sector diversity and relative level of trade dependency, with the largest impacts being recorded in smaller, tourism dependent islands. A significantly different picture emerges if catalytic impacts are removed showing the strength of the multiplier, with contribution to GDP reducing to 2. 8 % and the percentage of the labour force declining to around 1. 9 %. Multipliers for Trinidad & Tobago (- 0. 40), the Bahamas (2. 38) and Guyana (2. 95) were below the global average, however, reiterating the heterogeneity of the sample and by extension the whole Caribbean community. Using fixed-effects panel regression, the removal of bilateral or multilateral entry and tariff barriers were found to increase the average country-pair’s arriving and <b>departing</b> <b>passenger</b> levels by 250, 000, 22, 000 and 8, 000 on NA-, UK- and Intra-Caricom markets respectively, given a one unit increase in air policy liberalisation. The actual impact of liberalisation on any given market was moderated by unobserved fixedeffect dummy variables which provided each country-pair with a unique intercept value to take account of underlying network and market maturity differences. Hence, all currently restricted country-pairs in the sample would stand to gain around 183, 000 passengers per annum if a gradual bilateral approach to liberalisation was adopted. A counterfactual analysis suggested that a one unit policy change in the year 2000 on all 13 currently restricted markets would have increased passengers levels to around 16. 4 million. In the multilateral scenario both restricted and partially liberal markets experience simultaneous reform resulting in a predicted traffic increase of 621, 000 passengers per annum. Using ‘within sample’ multipliers, the extra bilateral output is estimated to increase baseline expenditure by US$ 51 million or US$ 16 million per annum when catalytic spending is included and excluded respectively. With multilateral reform, an additional US$ 164 million or US$ 53 million would accrue to the regional economy. When compounded, the total time-series effect of multilateral liberalisation totals 3. 7 million passengers on top of the baseline, boosting regional output by 2. 6 % or 0. 7 % and increasing employment by 1. 4 % or 0. 2 %. Given previous evidence, extra-regional reform will not take place multilaterally in the foreseeable future. In the short to medium term, a combination of a revised Caricom MASA and gradual moves towards bilateral liberalisation would produce optimum macroeconomic results. The historical and counterfactual findings of this research challenge current restrictive practises in the region. Further assistance with respect to foreign carrier entry and regional carrier integration could stimulate the desired fare, capacity, frequency and connectivity improvements and generate significant increases in overall welfare...|$|E
40|$|Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, (“AAS”), {{owned by}} the Schiphol Group (“SG”), plays a key part in the hugely {{competitive}} airline industry. One of the primary goals of the Schiphol Group is to provide high service at a low cost. In recent years, Schiphol and the Dutch Government are cutting the relevant budgets {{with a view to}} make substantial savings in specific areas, for example, the Security and Border Control Departments. In achieving this goal there is a fine balance to be met. High quality Security and Border Control, (under the control of The Royal Dutch Marechaussee (“KMar”), is crucial for the successful operation of AAS. With this in mind Schiphol Group and the Government should be cautious in making savings as a decrease in service level would be detrimental to the successful operation of AAS. A sound example of ‘high service/low-cost’ improvements could be achieved through more efficient scheduling of staff, namely utilising less staff but still providing a sufficient service level for local departing passengers. Staff scheduling is dependent on the travel behaviour of passengers, more specifically when passengers arrive at Schiphol from landside. The travel behaviour among those millions of local departing passengers is quite diverse. Many passengers arrive hours before departure time when check-in desks are not open for servicing, while other passengers arrive at the last-minute when the check-in desks are closing. Consequently, coping with this ebbing and flowing process by scheduling staff is extremely difficult. Fortunately, AAS runs a model which provides valuable prognoses to achieve an accurate picture of the number of passengers that arrive per time interval, these prognoses are used by the different stakeholders. The Passenger Services Department (“PS”) at Schiphol estimates the number of passengers entering different processes, for example the number passengers arriving at Passport Control. This prognoses, (up to four months), is available for stakeholders to analyse. The ‘operational model’ and the data it has provided has proven its worth but Schiphol could make improvements with regard to the model and its prognoses. The greatest problem is that simple observations measure different passenger numbers than originally forecasted by the model, so prognoses are inaccurate. Security and the KMar make use of the prognoses to calculate and schedule staff, so that a sufficient amount of manpower to service passengers is available. With this in mind overestimations of the forecast model results in high service and a higher cost base than necessary. Conversely, underestimations result in queues, lower cost and a decreasing level of service. Currently Security and Passport Control is decentralized and staff of Security and Passport Control can be moved to another Security or Passport Control area to deal with rising queues in a particular area. Prognoses are important but will be more crucial when the OneXS Project is finished. This new megaproject is about centralizing all Security and Passport Control filters. One location where all passengers are screened, together with their baggage, and have to show their passport at the same location, would certainly be more efficient {{but on the other hand}} scheduling would become far more important because exchanging staff between filters would not be possible. Accurate prognoses are needed here more than ever. When Schiphol identifies the causes of inaccuracies of the prognoses and solves these problems, sooner or later more accurate prognoses become available. Altogether by improving the accuracy of the forecast model, Schiphol, Security and the Royal Dutch Marechaussee can provide a higher service at a lower cost. This research seeks to address the following main question: How accurate are the current local <b>departing</b> <b>passenger</b> prognoses, what are the main causes for inaccurate passenger prognoses and which improvements on arrival distributions and accuracy measurement for the passenger forecast model can be made? Methodology This Master Thesis has been organised in the following way; It begins describing the forecast and passenger process, it will then go on to an analyses of the stakeholders involved and end with an assessment on the suitability of the current operational model. Then the methodology of measuring passengers and mathematical measurements to calculate accuracy will be discussed. The systems for measuring passengers, the data and the locations of the measurement have been validated. The most important part is presenting the current accuracy; it will then go onto the causes of inaccurate prognoses and look at adjustments that could be made to increase accuracy. Finally, this thesis contains a conclusion and recommendation. To run the model and create prognoses, two elements are essential: a flight schedule and an arrival distribution of local departing passengers. The flight schedule contains information on all flights, the crucial data being the date, departure time, carrier, destination and predicted number of passengers on that flight. An arrival distribution model simplifies the stochastic travel behaviour of local departing passengers. To put it differently, a distribution indicates how many minutes before departure time passengers are entering Departure Hall 3, for example, 20...|$|E
