40|$|A <b>hinge</b> (20) {{includes}} two <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) and a connecting <b>hinge</b> pin (32). A coil spring (48) supported on a bushing (44) overlies the <b>hinge</b> pin (32), which {{is free to}} move along its longitudinal axis (30). A cam follower (42) on the <b>hinge</b> pin (32) engages a cam (32) mounted {{to one of the}} <b>hinge</b> plates (22), so that the <b>hinge</b> pin (32) slides longitudinally as the <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) pivot relative to each other about the <b>hinge</b> pin (32). As the <b>hinge</b> pin (32) slides longitudinally, it axially compresses or decompresses the spring (48). The cam (32) is oriented such that pivoting of the <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) in either direction from an open position compresses the spring (48), providing a restoring force which tends to retain the <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) in the open position...|$|R

They were equipped with <b>hinged</b> plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the <b>hinged</b> plates.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a <b>hinged</b> shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle.

40|$|Flexure <b>hinges</b> {{have been}} used to produce {{frictionless}} and backlashless transmissions in a variety of precision mechanisms. Although there are many types of flexure <b>hinges</b> avail-able, designers often chose a single type of flexure <b>hinge</b> (e. g., circular flexure <b>hinges)</b> without considering others in the design of flexure-based mechanisms. This is because the analytical equations are unique to each kind of flexure <b>hinge.</b> This work offers a solution to this problem {{in the form of a}} generalized flexure <b>hinge</b> model. We propose a new class of flexure <b>hinges,</b> namely, elliptical-arc-fillet flexure <b>hinges,</b> which brings elliptical arc, circular-arc-fillet, elliptical-fillet, elliptical, circular, circular-fillet, and right-circular flexure <b>hinges</b> together under one set of equations. The closed-form equations for all the elements in the compliance and precision matrices of elliptical-arc-fillet flexure <b>hinges</b> have been derived. The analytical results are within 10 percent error compared to the fi-nite element results and within 8 percent error compared to the experimental results. The equations for evaluating the strain energy and stress level for elliptical-arc-fillet flexure <b>hinges</b> are also provided. This model can be used as a complementary model for the gen-eralized model for conic flexure <b>hinges.</b> [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4004441]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Relating {{features}} of protein sequences to structural <b>hinges</b> {{is important for}} identifying domain boundaries, understanding structure-function relationships, and designing flexibility into proteins. Efforts in this field have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a proper dataset for studying characteristics of <b>hinges.</b> Results Using the Molecular Motions Database we have created a <b>Hinge</b> Atlas of manually annotated <b>hinges</b> and a statistical formalism for calculating the enrichment of various types of residues in these <b>hinges.</b> Conclusion We found various correlations between <b>hinges</b> and sequence features. Some of these are expected; for instance, we found that <b>hinges</b> tend to occur on the surface and in coils and turns and to be enriched with small and hydrophilic residues. Others are less obvious and intuitive. In particular, we found that <b>hinges</b> tend to coincide with active sites, but unlike the latter they are not at all conserved in evolution. We evaluate the potential for <b>hinge</b> prediction based on sequence. Motions {{play an important role in}} catalysis and protein-ligand interactions. <b>Hinge</b> bending motions comprise the largest class of known motions. Therefore it is important to relate the <b>hinge</b> location to sequence features such as residue type, physicochemical class, secondary structure, solvent exposure, evolutionary conservation, and proximity to active sites. To do this, we first generated the <b>Hinge</b> Atlas, a set of protein motions with the <b>hinge</b> locations manually annotated, and then studied the coincidence of these features with the <b>hinge</b> location. We found that all of the features have bearing on the <b>hinge</b> location. Most interestingly, we found that <b>hinges</b> tend to occur at or near active sites and yet unlike the latter are not conserved. Less surprisingly, we found that <b>hinge</b> residues tend to be small, not hydrophobic or aliphatic, and occur in turns and random coils on the surface. A functional sequence based <b>hinge</b> predictor was made which uses some of the data generated in this study. The <b>Hinge</b> Atlas is made available to the community for further flexibility studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of compliant mechanisms yield optimized topologies that combine several stiff parts with highly elastic flexure <b>hinges.</b> The <b>hinges</b> are often represented in {{finite element analysis}} by a single node (one-node <b>hinge)</b> leaving doubts on the physical meaning {{as well as an}} uncertainty in the manufacturing process. To overcome this one-node <b>hinge</b> problem of optimized compliant mechanisms' topologies, one-node <b>hinges</b> need to be replaced by real flexure <b>hinges</b> providing desired deflection range and the ability to bear internal loads without failure. Therefore, several common types of planar flexure <b>hinges</b> with different geometries are characterized and categorized in this work providing a comprehensive guide with explicit analytical expressions to replace one-node <b>hinges</b> effectively. Analytical expressions on displacements, stresses, maximum elastic deformations, bending stiffness, center of rotation and first natural frequencies are derived in this work. Numerical simulations and experimental studies are performed validating the analytical results. More importance is given to practice-oriented flexure <b>hinge</b> types in terms of cost-saving manufacturability, i. e. circular notch type <b>hinges</b> and rectangular leaf type <b>hinges...</b>|$|R

40|$|Flexure <b>hinges</b> are {{advantageous}} {{for use in}} high-precision applications {{because of}} their lack of hysteresis, friction and backlash. However, their range of motion is limited due to increasing stresses and a decreasing support stiffness at large strokes. Currently available <b>hinges</b> are typically designed for strokes of up to 10 ∘ and {{only a small number}} of <b>hinges</b> achieve a stroke of 40 ∘. In this paper we present <b>hinge</b> concepts with a stroke up to 90 ∘. On the one hand, the conceptual design of such <b>hinges</b> is addressed and, on the other hand, a method to optimise the design of such <b>hinges</b> is presented. The <b>hinge</b> performance is measured by evaluating the natural frequency of the second relevant eigenmode of the <b>hinge</b> with a specific load. For best performance the minimal value for this frequency throughout the full operating range is maximised. Analysing known <b>hinge</b> concepts in view of this criterion gives insight in the strengths and weaknesses of these <b>hinges.</b> This knowledge helps to improve the <b>hinge</b> layout. Also the possibility of stacking multiple <b>hinges</b> is considered. To find the optimal geometric parameters of a given design, a numerical optimisation routine is formulated and implemented, making use of the tools present in the ANSYS finite element program. Two types of conceptual <b>hinges</b> are synthesised and optimised for a range of ± 45 ∘. Their behaviour is studied and compared to a commonly used three flexure cross <b>hinge</b> that is also optimised for this large stroke. A significant performance gain is found for the new <b>hinge</b> concepts. The paper shows that it is possible to design flexure <b>hinges</b> for large strokes of up to 90 ∘. And, more importantly, a method for analysing their performance and optimizing their geometry has been established. The method allows for a quick assessment and optimisation of future large stroke flexure <b>hinges...</b>|$|R

In this paper a method is presented for optimizing {{the geometry of}} flexure <b>hinges,</b> which aims at maximizing supporting stiffnesses. In addition, the new ∞ -flexure <b>hinge</b> design is presented. The considered <b>hinges</b> are subjected to a load and deflected an angle of up to ± 20 [*]deg. The measure of performance {{is defined by the}} first unwanted natural frequency, which is closely related to the supporting stiffnesses.
