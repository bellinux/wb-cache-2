5|$|As he {{was escorted}} {{to the locker}} room, Blount confronted Boise State fans who were jeering at him after seeing the video replay. Blount says that one Boise State fan brandished a chair at him and another punched him. Two police {{officers}} and Oregon assistant coach Scott Frost restrained Blount and escorted him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b> Video of the incident spread rapidly on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> and locking his teammates {{out in the cold}} while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E
5|$|Finn's death hits Beiste hard, {{and when}} Puck comes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> drunk, {{weeks after the}} funeral and saying that he is lost without Finn, Beiste tells him he needs {{to take charge of}} his life and give himself the advice and {{guidance}} he would have gotten from his best friend. The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes a tree that Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E
50|$|After {{learning}} Evolver has recording capabilities, Kyle and Zach send Evolver <b>into</b> <b>the</b> girls <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> {{at their}} school. Discovering the robot, the girls push Evolver <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boys <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b> He switches to game mode and enters <b>the</b> boys <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> and sees <b>the</b> only occupant - Dwight, a bullying jock - and makes Dwight another opponent. Dwight throws Evolver against a wall, {{to which the}} robot reacts by shooting out one of Dwight's eyes and knocking him {{down a flight of}} stairs, killing him.|$|R
50|$|The Bulldogs missed another {{field goal}} attempt {{at the end}} of their first second-quarter drive. This time Paul Schumacher missed from 32 yards out. Halfway {{thorough}} the quarter, Charlotte's Blake Brewer missed a 47-yard field goal attempt. On the first play of the next drive, the Niners' Branden Dozier intercepted Lucas Beatty's pass and returned the ball 39 yards for the touchdown and the lead. The Bulldogs would get Paul Schumacher within field goal range with time running out. This time he would connect from 35 yards away to end the half. Both teams went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> tied at 17.|$|R
50|$|On {{their first}} two drives, Oregon State drove into Iowa territory. Each drive ended with a fumble that {{was turned into a}} Hawkeye touchdown. With 7:20 left in the first quarter, the Hawkeyes were up 14-0. After trading touchdowns in the second quarter, Iowa went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> up 21-6 at halftime. In the third quarter, Iowa's Mike Hagler scored on a 66-yard double reverse, which put the game out of reach. The Beavers made a game rally, but the Hawkeyes held on for a 35-19 victory. Oregon State's three fumbles and poor {{tackling}} are generally cited as keys to the loss.|$|R
25|$|Washington {{lost three}} fumbles, missed two field goals and punted {{three times in}} the first half. The Huskies went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> down 34–0 and didn't get on the board until Jake Locker scored on a 15-yard {{touchdown}} run with 5:37 remaining in the 3rd quarter.|$|E
25|$|After Florida State {{scored a}} field goal on their first drive, Auburn responded with a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two in the second to storm out to a 21-3 lead. After a successful punt fake, the Seminoles managed a late touchdown before the half to go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> down 21-10, marking the first halftime deficit of the season for the Seminoles.|$|E
25|$|They had an {{informal}} basketball game, {{as part of}} a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) promotion for an upcoming show at the Rosemont Horizon. Hogan liked how Wight worked the crowd, and recommended him to World Championship Wrestling Vice President Eric Bischoff. Wight went to the Horizon show, and was invited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> where he met Ric Flair, Arn Anderson (his boyhood hero) and Paul Orndorff. He later met Bischoff there and came to a deal.|$|E
5000|$|Emily first notices Sydney in [...] "Surfing the Aftershocks", {{staring at}} her by the {{staircase}} at Rosewood High and later again at <b>the</b> <b>lockers.</b> Thinking that she is staring because of Alison, Emily confronts her, only for Sydney to disclose that she admires her swimming talent and would love to hear Emily's opinions on her own abilities. At first, Emily is hesitant, but agrees to help Driscoll. Having watched Sydney swim, Emily and Driscoll head <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms,</b> where Emily begins to measure Sydney's height to arm span ratio. Paige walks in and starts helping Emily, leading to an awkward conversation filled with suggestive innuendos.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{having the}} ball for 22:08 in the first half, Louisville only gained 173 yards of offense. This was, however, 113 more yards than UNC going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> at <b>the</b> half. In the second half however, UNC outgained Louisville 202 to 95. Louisville's only score of the game came with only 42 seconds left to end the shutout for the UNC defense. Giovani Bernard became the first ever {{freshman}} running back to rush for over 100 yards in 4 straight games. With this win, UNC has won 8 straight games against non-conference opponents. Their last lost was against LSU in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game.|$|R
5000|$|The {{temperature}} was 26 degrees with a windchill of 5. There were pockets of ice {{all over the}} field. Oregon took the opening kickoff and drove 69 yards for a 7-0 lead. Three plays later, the Ducks' E.J. Duffy recovered a fumble at the Beaver 32. Four plays later, Oregon lead 14-0. Less than 10 minutes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game and before attempting a single pass, Gonzales was knocked out with a head injury. Duffy recovered two more first half fumbles in the Duck red zone. The second at Oregon's eight with 1:53 left in the half. The Ducks drove 92 yards in 1:34 to take a 31-0 lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Hawkeyes' perfect {{season and}} hopes at a {{national}} championship were in serious jeopardy for three quarters, as Indiana went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> ahead 21–7 at the half thanks to an opening-drive score and special teams miscues by the Hawkeyes (a 9-yard punt and a fumble on a punt return deep in Iowa territory). The Hoosiers looked to extend the lead to three scores when Tyler Sash somehow managed to intercept a Ben Chappell pass and take it 86 yards the other way for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Worth noting in {{a regular}} season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game which the Spurs won 91–86, Tim Duncan {{suffered}} his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while sitting on the bench. Joey Crawford, the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight {{which led to the}} longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Ginóbili getting into an altercation after a rebound.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury. The risk paid off; Walton's {{acquisition}} helped Boston win a league best 67 games. One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout. With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards. In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals. Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round, leading Boston to victory in six games. The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked {{as one of the greatest}} basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globes Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{word about}} the Lithuanians triumph spread wide. The {{defeated}} Spanish of El Mundo considered that [...] "the good Spanish mood, accuracy and {{the joy of the}} game evaporated in front of the Lithuania national team victory desire", and El Periódico de Catalunya added that [...] "when Lithuania was leading 62–48, what the Spanish players wished the most was to end the game and to head <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> just to finish this suffering." [...] In Italy, Tuttosport described the victorious squad as [...] "a true Lithuania national team. Without NBA stars.", while La Gazzetta dello Sport noted how [...] "there is no other country in the Old Europe which would love the venerable, precious basketball more." ...|$|R
5000|$|Walking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> in [...] "Thrown From the Ride", Sydney is {{disappointed}} in her 58 second time. Emily informs Driscoll that her technique has gotten better and then asks {{if they want}} to meet up the next day. Sydney replies that she’ll have to ask her parents first, but it should be okay. Emily explains that her mother keeps asking questions about Alison’s return to Rosewood, and Sydney tells her it’s only natural and that she has questions too. The following day, Sydney meets Emily in <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> and apologises for being late. Emily asks if Paige wants to join them, and Sydney backs her up, saying they’re only doing sprints on the track. At the Pizzeria in town, Driscoll is spotted with Emily and Paige grabbing some food.|$|R

25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

500|$|Buffy, Willow, Jesse McNally (Eric Balfour), and Xander meet {{during a}} break, and Xander returns the stake. Buffy claims it is {{standard}} self-defense in Los Angeles. Cordelia appears and tells Buffy that gym is cancelled {{due to the}} [...] "extreme dead guy" [...] in one student's gym locker. Buffy asks whether there were marks on the body, freaking out Cordelia. Buffy forces her way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> examines the body, and finds the characteristic puncture wounds of a vampire on the neck. Buffy returns {{to the library and}} confronts Giles, who informs her that he is her Watcher. Buffy refuses to accept her calling as a Slayer, since it had gotten her kicked out of her previous school and robbed her of a social life. After they leave the library, Xander emerges from behind the shelves, having overheard the strange conversation.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, further {{expansions}} were contracted at a {{total cost}} of $1,667,000. This provided {{for the construction of}} the Roundhouse, home to the indoor sporting venues. On the lower level, a new swimming pool and boys' <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> were constructed. <b>The</b> old swimming pool was converted to classroom space, but the old gymnasiums are still in use. <b>The</b> old <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> were remodeled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> girls' <b>locker</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Building off {{the road}} win in game three, Buffalo scored the first goal in game four {{very early in the}} first period by center Jean-Pierre Dumont, but the Penguins would respond with a powerplay goal by center Martin Straka. Sabres center Curtis Brown scored a short-handed goal late in the first period to give Buffalo <b>the</b> edge heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> second period {{featured}} only one goal by Janne Laukkanen, set up by Jagr and Lemieux, and the game was tied up going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third. Stu Barnes scored twice in the third period, and the Sabres {{went on to win the}} game by three, five goals to two. Both teams were effective on the powerplay, each scoring one goal on two chances. Coming off two straight home losses, Buffalo works hard on the road to swipe the two home games back, swinging the series back to Buffalo's advantage.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Scream For Me", Sydney is {{changing}} in <b>the</b> Rosewood High <b>locker</b> <b>rooms</b> when Emily approaches her. Emily couldn't watch practice because she got hung {{up in the}} language lab before thanking Sydney for helping Hanna sober up the night before. She questions Sydney about what Hanna might've said and whether she mentioned New York. Sydney says she didn't and wonders why Emily really came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms.</b> Sydney discloses to Emily the team wants her to be the assistant coach, but Emily says she already has a lot going on. Walking into Emily’s bedroom, Sydney hands Emily the hooded sweatshirt and says she got ahead of herself. She explains that since they've stopped training together, Driscoll just wanted to have someone in the bleachers cheering for her, since her boyfriend is off in college and her parents aren't into it. Sydney lets it slip that she knows Emily and her friends were in New York, but covers when Emily points out her lie by saying she must've been mixed up from {{too much time in}} the pool.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't know very much about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I think if you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tomjanovich {{was able}} to get up and walk around, however, and on the way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became {{aggressive}} and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel. Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured {{in such a way that}} Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said [...] "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it" [...] and likened the surgery to Scotch-taping together a badly shattered eggshell.|$|E
500|$|Later, Youkilis {{was swept}} up in the team's ritual annual hazing, in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters {{waitress}} outfits, orange satin shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida. [...] "I walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> and all my clothes were gone", Youkilis said. [...] "There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes." [...] Youkilis was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Month for May, after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a [...]446 OBP as he batted [...]318 with 7 RBIs, and 15 runs in 13 games. Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed, he said: [...] "I'm staying in the best hotel I've ever stayed in, and my paycheck has quadrupled." [...] In mid-July he was sent back down to AAA, however, to make room for Ramiro Mendoza, though he was brought up again {{towards the end of the}} season.|$|E
50|$|In the second, Flacco again found Boldin, {{this time}} from 31 yards away, to even the scoring again at 14-all. On Washington's ensuing possession, Alfred Morris fumbled, Baltimore recovered, and Flacco found tight end Dennis Pitta from 19 yards out for his 3rd TD pass of the half, and <b>the</b> Ravens went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> halftime <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> with a 21-14 edge as Washington could not answer in the quarter.|$|R

500|$|The Tide {{went ahead}} in the second quarter. [...] Greg McElroy threw for only 58 yards on 6 of 11 passing for Alabama, but 23 of those yards came on a {{completion}} to Julio Jones that advanced {{the ball to the}} Texas 12. [...] Three plays later Mark Ingram ran it in from two yards out, and Alabama went ahead 7–6. [...] After an exchange of punts, Bama took possession on the Texas 49-yard line, and on the second play Trent Richardson burst {{through a hole in the}} middle and raced 49 yards untouched for the touchdown, extending the lead to 14–6. [...] Texas continued to struggle for offense in McCoy's absence, and on the next possession a Texas drive ended when Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass at the Alabama 25. [...] Following a short punt late in the quarter, Bama drove to the Texas 9, and increased their lead to 17–6 following a successful 26-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal. [...] It appeared that the Crimson Tide would go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> leading 17–6. [...] However, after gaining nine yards on a rush up the middle, Texas called time out with 15 seconds left. With the ball at the Texas 37, Gilbert threw a shovel pass to D.J. Monroe, who bobbled the ball and batted it into the arms of Alabama defensive lineman Marcell Dareus, who lumbered 28 yards for a touchdown that made the halftime score 24–6.|$|E
500|$|According to McGuire, {{the game}} {{did not start}} with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points. After a few minutes, the Warriors led 19–3, and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the Knicks trailed 42–26, and in his typical style, Chamberlain had already scored 23 points, making all nine of his free throws. Free throws were the weakest part of his game, making barely more than half in his first seasons. He had started {{shooting}} free throws underhanded that season per McGuire's suggestion. Chamberlain at that point was thinking more about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game. Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble. After one foul, he snapped at the referee, [...] "Well, why don't you just give the guy a hundred now and we'll all go home!" [...] Neither referee had ever been a lead official before, and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working the game. By halftime, the Warriors had lost some of their edge, but still led 79–68. Chamberlain's point total stood at 41. The Warriors felt little excitement, as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions. [...] "I often came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> with 30 or 35 points, therefore, 41 points was not a big deal", Chamberlain later explained. During halftime, the Warriors' Guy Rodgers said, [...] "Let's get the ball to Dip. Let's see how many he can get." [...] McGuire agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Notre Dame got on {{the board}} first when Quinn capped a 7-play, 44-yard drive with a two-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Jeff Samardzija. [...] UCLA would roar back, however, scoring fourteen unanswered second quarter points before Notre Dame would add a field goal as the quarter expired. [...] Down 14-10 heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> at halftime, the situation looked grim for the Irish, who were unable {{to deal with the}} relentless UCLA defense.|$|E
50|$|After {{thrashing}} the Czech Republic 4-1 and displaying more offensive potency in a 1-1 draw with Poland, the Russians were {{favored to}} earn the one point they needed to advance against the Greeks. However, Greece delivered a trademark 1-0 defensive victory and advanced to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals. The Greeks scored when Russian defender Sergei Ignashevich errantly headed a Greece throw-in behind the Russian defense for Giorgos Karagounis to pounce on. Greece's captain sprinted in on goal and struck the ball far-post under keeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in first-half stoppage time to send <b>the</b> Russians reeling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms.</b> Ignashevich appeared to have conceded an additional golden scoring opportunity for Greece upon tripping Karagounis in the Russian penalty area {{early in the second}} half, but referee Jonas Eriksson instead booked Karagounis for what he believed to be simulation. This being Karagounis's second yellow card of the tournament, Greece was to be without its suspended captain in the next round. With that victory, Greece qualified to the quarterfinals for a second time after their successful Euro 2004 campaign.|$|R
