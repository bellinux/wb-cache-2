A comprehensive study has been carried out to assess its performance. The efficiency of fluoride removal (R%) as a function of key operational parameters such as <b>initial</b> pH, <b>detention</b> time (t), current density (CD), inter-electrode distance (ID) and initial concentration (C 0) has been examined and an empirical model has been developed. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation of the influence of the EC process on morphology of the surface of the aluminium electrodes, showed the erosion caused by aluminium loss. A preliminary estimation of the reactor's operating cost is suggested, allowing for the energy from recycling of hydrogen gas hydrogen gas produced amount. The results obtained showed that 98 % of fluoride was removed within 25  min of electrolysis at pH of 6, ID of 5  mm, and CD of 2  mA/cm(2). The general relationship between fluoride removal and operating parameters could be described by a linear model with R(2) of 0. 823. The contribution of the operating parameters to the suggested model followed the order: t > CD > C 0  > ID > pH. The SEM images obtained showed that, after the EC process, the surface of the anodes, became non-uniform with a large number of irregularities due to the generation of aluminium hydroxides. It is suggested that these do not materially affect the performance. A provisional estimate of the operating cost was 0. 379 US $/m(3).

40|$|This {{work was}} {{initiated}} {{to investigate the}} possibility of using a continuous flow Micro Wave (MW) radiation system with heat exchanging for ammonia nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater after the success of using the system as a batch reactor in our previous work. The effects of <b>initial</b> ammonia concentration, <b>detention</b> time, and <b>initial</b> temperature were investigated. The optimum <b>detention</b> time and <b>initial</b> temperature were determined using synthetic wastewater and found to be 8. 5 minutes and 62 ºC, respectively. These optimum conditions are valid within the range of 60 to 120 mg NH 3 -N/L. The residual concentrations under optimum conditions were 3. 5 ± 0. 4, 4. 4 ± 0. 4, 5. 1 ± 0. 2, and 6. 9 ± 0. 5 mg NH 3 -N/L for initial concentrations of 60, 70, 80, 100, and 120 mg NH 3 -N/L, respectively. These concentrations meet the 5 mg NH 3 -N/L standard for recharging wastewater to groundwater in many countries such as Jordan. Similar results were obtained using real wastewater samples (3. 1 ± 0. 2, 4. 0 ± 0. 1 and 4. 9 ± 0. 3 mg NH 3 -N/L for initial concentrations of 65. 7, 73. 8, and 94. 6 mg NH 3 -N/L, respectively).

40|$|Psychological {{models of}} mental disorder, human rights, and {{compulsory}} {{mental health care}} in the community Recent amendments to the 1983 Mental Health Act in the UK (Mental Health Act 2007) include the controversial provision for: “supervised treatment in the community for suitable patients following an <b>initial</b> period of <b>detention</b> and treatment in hospital”. This provision is widespread, and more formal, in other English-speaking jurisdictions. Reviews of the international literature, human rights considerations and the perspective of psychological approaches to mental health care suggest that proposed „supervised community treatment orders ‟ are valuable, lawful, and compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights if certain specific conditions are met. Provisions for „supervised community treatment orders ‟ in the UK should be supported, but with the provisos that: the powers of the Mental Health Act are limited as in Scotland, to persons whose “ability to make decisions about the provision of [care] is significantly impaired”, that each order is time-limited and subject to review by a properly constituted Tribunal, and that the use of such orders should represent a benefit to people in terms of more appropriate treatment, or be a least restrictive alternative, or better preserve the person‟s private and family life. 3 Psychological models of mental disorder, human rights, and compulsory mental {{health care in the}} community Mental Health Legislation Compulsory mental health care in the United Kingdom is provided {{under the auspices of the}} Mental Health Act 1983 as recently amended by the Mental Health Act 2007.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{beneficial}} use of stormwater in Swedish urban environments. The {{focus has been}} on open stormwater systems for source control, as well as rainwater collection systems. To analyse the implementation of open stormwater systems, two case studies are presented: Augustenborg in Malmö and Bäckaslöv wetland in Växjö. The retention and detention effects of green-roofs have been also studied by means of experimental work. Ringdansen, a residential area in Norrköping, is used to discuss rainwater collection for urban applications. The aim of the Augustenborg {{study was to determine the}} effect of disconnecting impervious areas from a combined sewer system in favour of a new open stormwater system. The open system, which consists of a combination of structural best management practices (BMPs), was assessed by comparing synthetic hydrographs for the ½, 2, 5 and 10 -year design storms assuming wet and dry initial conditions. It was found that the BMPs are able to lower the total runoff from the area and successfully attenuate storm peak flows for all the recurrence intervals considered. Bäckaslöv wetland in Växjö, is shown as an example of a multi-purpose urban stormwater facility. The wetland system has been the focus of studies into water quality and hydraulic processes, as well as surveys of plant and bird populations. Apart from stormwater management, the system benefits include urban renewal, habitat creation and the provision of an outdoor laboratory. In order to estimate the response of green-roofs to individual rain events, precipitation and runoff data from controlled experiments (with dry and wet initial conditions) on a sedum album green-roof were analysed by means of linear programming. The results indicated that slope does not influenced retention volumes. Under dry initial conditions, stormwater can be retained and detained, whereas under wet <b>initial</b> conditions only <b>detention</b> is possible. To further investigate the detention effect, a comparison between the response of an impervious roof and a green roof was carried out. Green-roofs can be implemented in combination with other BMPs to successfully detain stormwater. The Ringdansen study showed that rainwater collection systems are efficient elements in Swedish urban environments. They contribute to water saving by supplying water for domestic use where potable water is not essential. Rainwater collection systems are also shown to be important elements of stormwater management systems...|$|R
40|$|Migrant {{smuggling}} is a dangerous, sometimes deadly, {{criminal activity}} which cannot be rationalized, justified, or excused. From both a {{supply and demand}} side, failing to respond effectively to migrant smuggling and deter it will risk emboldening those who engage in this illicit enterprise, which generates proceeds for organized crime and criminal networks, funds terrorism and facilitates clandestine terrorist travel; endangers the lives and safety of smuggled migrants, undermines border security, with consequences for the Canada/U. S. border, and undermines the integrity and fairness of Canada’s mmigration system. Introduced in Parliament in June, 2011, the Preventing Human Smugglers from Abusing Canada’s Immigration System Act (Bill C- 4) includes amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) that would: 1. Enhance the existing offence of migrant smuggling, {{in terms of the}} elements of the offence, the penalties available, and recognized aggravating factors; 2. Modify the general provisions of the IRPA to provide for detention of foreign nationals on arrival in Canada on grounds of serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality; and 3. Create a separate legislative scheme for groups of smuggled migrants who arrive in Canada that relates to detention, release, and timing to apply for various forms of immigration status. This paper supports Bill C- 4, but with two necessary amendments, namely: 1. <b>Initial</b> review of <b>detention</b> of designated foreign nationals should take place within 48 hours of detention, with further reviews every three or six months thereafter, in order to comply with binding Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence; and 2. An exemption for designated foreign nationals who are minors (persons under 18 years of age) from the detention provisions of Bill C- 4, which would instead subject them to the general rules related to detention of foreign nationals who are minors. These changes would provide Bill C- 4 with a more balanced response to migrant smuggling. Bill C- 4 is just part of the overall action being taken by the Government of Canada to address migrant smuggling. A comprehensive approach to addressing migrant smuggling ultimately requires three primary strategies pursued together at the national and international levels: 1. National jurisdictions must take greater action to discourage illegal migration and disrupt migrant smuggling operations through legislation like Bill C- 4 and through international cooperation; 2. National jurisdictions must establish more efficient refugee-determination processes and expedient procedures to remove failed claimants; and, 3. As part of the solution, the international community should continue to develop a proactive response to the global refugee situation...|$|R
