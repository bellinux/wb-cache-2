25|$|Prostaglandin is a {{large family}} of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play {{important}} roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and thromboxane is the determinant factor for vascular tone. Indeed, Merck has stated {{that there was no}} effect on prostacyclin production in blood vessels in animal testing. Corey speculated that the cardiotoxicity may be associated with an organic acid anhydride formed when rofecoxib is exposed to air.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that Arab immigration somehow {{made up a}} large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.|$|E
25|$|Numerous other {{historical}} figures were reputed {{to have lived}} past 100. The sixth dynasty Egyptian ruler Pepi II is believed by some Egyptologists to have lived to 100 or more (c. 2278 – c. 2184 BC), as {{he is said to}} have reigned for 94 years. However this is disputed: others say he only reigned 64 years. Hosius of Córdoba, the man who convinced Constantine the Great to call the First Council of Nicaea, reportedly lived to age 102. The Chronicon of Bernold of Constance records the death in 1097 of Azzo marchio de Longobardia, pater Welfonis ducis de Baiowaria, commenting that he was iam maior centenario. Ultimately, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that centenarians did not exist in antiquity, even if they were not commonplace.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{mutation rate}} {{used by the}} geneticists is more questionable. They often use different mutation rates and studies frequently arrive at vastly different conclusions. NRY and mtDNA may be so susceptible to drift that some ancient patterns may have become obscured. Another assumption is that population genealogies are approximated by allele genealogies. Guido Barbujani points out that this only holds if population groups develop from a genetically monomorphic set of founders. Barbujani argues that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Europe was colonised by monomorphic populations. This would result in an overestimation of haplogroup age, thus falsely extending the demographic history of Europe into the Late Paleolithic rather than the Neolithic era. Greater certainty about chronology may be obtained from studies of ancient DNA (see below), but so far these have been comparatively few.|$|E

25|$|Maps of {{the period}} {{generally}} depicted a large continent named Terra Australis Incognita of highly variable shape and extent. This land was posited by Ptolemy as a counterbalance to the extensive continental areas in the northern hemisphere; {{due to a lack}} of exploration and various misunderstandings, its existence was not fully abandoned until circumnavigation of the area during the second voyage of James Cook in the 1770s showed that if it existed, it was much smaller than imagined previously. The first confirmed landing on Antarctica was not until 1820, and the coastline of Queen Maud Land did not see significant exploration before Norwegian expeditions began in 1891. In 1513, Cape Horn had not yet been discovered, and indeed Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation was not to set sail for another six years. It is unclear whether the mapmaker saw South America itself as part of the unknown southern lands (as shown in the Atlas Miller), or whether (as Dutch thought) he drew what was then known of the coast with substantial distortion, but in any case, serious scholarship holds that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.|$|E
500|$|Gödel's listed theorems {{follow from}} the axioms, so most {{criticisms of the}} theory focus on those axioms or the {{assumptions}} made. Oppy argued that Gödel gives no definition of [...] "positive properties". He suggested that if these positive properties form a set, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that any such set exists which is theologically interesting, or {{that there is only}} one set of positive properties which is theologically interesting.|$|E
500|$|But {{even if one}} {{accepts the}} {{susceptibility}} to error of people's intuitions, the objection can be reformulated: if the existence of mental conditions seems perfectly obvious and is central in people's conception of the world, then enormously strong arguments are {{needed in order to}} successfully deny the existence of mental conditions. Furthermore, these arguments, to be consistent, need to be formulated in a way which does not pre-suppose the existence of entities like [...] "mental states", [...] "logical arguments", and [...] "ideas", otherwise they are self-contradictory. Those who accept this objection say that the arguments in favor of eliminativism are far too weak to establish such a radical claim; therefore there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in eliminativism.|$|E

500|$|The blaming of Kahn for Meany's {{speech and}} Isserman's {{scholarship}} {{have been criticized}} by Rachelle Horowitz, Kahn's friend, and by Joshua Muravchik, then {{an officer of the}} Young People's Socialist League (1907). According to Horowitz, Meany had many speechwriters—two specialists besides Kahn and even more writers from the AFL–CIO's Committee on Political Education (COPE) Department. Horowitz stated, [...] "It is in fact inconceivable that Kahn wrote those words." [...] She quoted a concurring assessment from Arch Puddington: [...] "assumes that because Kahn was not publicly gay he had to be a gay basher. He never was." [...] According to Muravchik, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Kahn wrote those lines, and Isserman presents none." ...|$|E
500|$|In the poem, Anactoria is absent, {{though it}} is not evident from the {{surviving}} lines exactly why. [...] One suggestion is that she has left Sappho in order to marry. [...] Christopher Brown argues that the description of Anactoria's αμαρυχμα ("the radiant sparkle of her face") is suggestive of the χαρις ("grace", [...] "charm") of a [...] "nubile girl" [...] of marriageable age, and that it is likely that Anactoria has returned to her native city in order to marry. [...] Eric Dodson-Robinson suggests that the poem could have been performed at a wedding, with Anactoria the bride leaving her family and friends. George Koniaris disagrees, arguing that there is [...] "no special reason" [...] to believe that Anactoria left Sappho for a man. [...] Glen Most goes further, saying that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Anactoria's absence was anything more than temporary.|$|E
500|$|The moral panic was not {{confined}} {{solely to the}} gender of the murderers, but also the role played by so-called [...] "video nasties". The news media immediately made a connection between the Bulger murder trial and the Capper murder trial when the horror movie [...] was mentioned as part of the testimonies. D.I. Wall said [...] "throughout interviews with the accused there was no suggestion that the reason Suzanne was killed {{had anything to do with}} [...] "Child's Play" [...] but this was overlooked by more sensationalist headlines (Demonic doll Chucky links the horror crimes; The curse of Chucky). Neither Powell or McNeilly owned a video recorder, and the Child's Play–inspired music that had been used to torture Capper was a popular track at the time, taped direct from Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. Broadcaster David Elstein called the video connection [...] "a false story... branded into the consciousness of the media," [...] and questioned the news media's fascination with the film: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Suzanne Capper [...] would be alive today if the audiotape had instead contained the torture scene from King Lear, or a catchphrase from Bruce Forsyth... But the Child's Play hare has been running ever since the last day of the James Bulger murder trial." [...] Elstein argued that the film was simply a scapegoat which the press [...] "made a three-course meal out of." [...] The Guardian reported that 21,000 four–nine-year-olds watched each of BSkyB's two transmissions of Child's Play 3 – but Elstein explained the figure was [...] "simply a projection based on an average of just two actual viewers from BARB's reporting panel, and that the margin of error means even the two may have been just one. But why spoil a good running story by asking what the figures mean?" ...|$|E
