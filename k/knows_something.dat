5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|West {{attacks and}} kills a {{fisherman}} in a wood, then encounters and frightens {{a little girl}} (Julie Drazen) there, but she escapes unharmed. Nelson tracks West by following his radiation trail with a geiger counter, but only finds his detached ear stuck to a tree branch. Perry arrives by plane, and is picked up by Nelson; shortly thereafter, they visit the crime scene where the fisherman's body was found. Sheriff Neil Blake (Michael Alldredge) suspects that Nelson <b>knows</b> <b>something,</b> but Nelson tells the sheriff nothing because Perry had earlier informed him that any information about West was classified. Later that night, Nelson returns home to his pregnant wife Judy (Ann Sweeny), who tells him that her elderly mother Helen (Dorothy Love) and Helen's boyfriend Harold (Edwin Max) are coming over for dinner. On their way, however, Helen and Harold are attacked by West in their car, and he kills them both.|$|E
25|$|Throughout their adventures {{all over}} Trantor, Seldon {{continuously}} denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, {{it may take}} several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon <b>knows</b> <b>something,</b> so he continuously presses him {{to work out a}} starting point to develop psychohistory.|$|E

25|$|Oba is {{also aware}} of the second sorceress {{and the fact that}} she <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> {{concerning}} his fate or nature. He hires a guide to the swamp, which he safely negotiates as well. The sorceress reveals that Oba is now a thrall to the Keeper of the Underworld and kills herself before Oba can do the deed. This, along with the fact that his guide has stolen all his money, enrages Oba. He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses' cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People's Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using the voice in his mind to make the D'Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl.|$|E
25|$|Back at the garden, Lucy is {{planting}} seeds {{around the}} well, when Jacinda arrives {{to take her}} to Bainbridge Island across the lake, so they can be together and escape from Victoria. When they arrive at the town line, Jacinda's car breaks down and the elevator to the docks has been closed, which Lucy believes means they're trapped in Hyperion Heights, much like the residents of Storybrooke were. At the police station, Victoria interrupts Henry and Rogers to ask the officer to help find Lucy and Jacinda, believing that Henry <b>knows</b> <b>something.</b> Victoria's daughter Ivy and Officer Rogers find the pair, who have decided to stay and fight Victoria's claim. As Ivy gives Rogers Lucy's Once Upon a Time book, and insists that it be thrown away, Rogers catches sight of a specific page featuring a picture of Emma Swan.|$|E
25|$|Poirot is {{diverted}} {{to stay in}} an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he doesn't appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing {{in front of the}} fire in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic who is trying to repair the car. The young man – Ted Williamson – is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called 'Grasslawn' to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went out for a walk with her and she said she would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita – but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and was told the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-haired and bad-tempered, whereas the girl Williamson described was golden-haired. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. He also speaks with the owner of 'Grasslawn', Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie – with some unease – but doesn't recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> of Sir George that Poirot would like to know, but the detective doesn't take up the offer, much to her annoyance.|$|E

500|$|After {{uncovering}} {{the identity of}} the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", a serial killer who chops up the bodies of his victims and drains their blood, Dexter hurries to find his sister Debra. Since the murderer had always sent secret messages to Dexter, he searches his apartment for clues that Rudy could have left, and finds a picture of the shipping container where his mother was killed. When Dexter is about to leave, Doakes and LaGuerta arrive, telling him that they think Rudy Cooper was the one who stabbed Batista. Doakes insists that Dexter <b>knows</b> <b>something,</b> and he reveals that the blood on Angel's collar matched Rudy's. The pair leave, and Dexter goes to find the shipping container. At the station, LaGuerta orders a search for Rudy. Matthews walks in and introduces Esmee Pascal, the new lieutenant replacing LaGuerta.|$|E
500|$|Soma meets Graham again, and {{questions}} him on Yoko's suspicions. Graham claims he will receive Dracula's powers, believing {{himself to be}} Dracula as he was born on the day Dracula was slain. Graham inquires as {{to the nature of}} Soma's powers, to which Soma responds that he has [...] "the power to rule," [...] causing Graham to panic and flee. Concerned, Soma confides this incident to Yoko, who recommends that Soma join her in stopping Graham. As Soma proceeds further through the castle, he comes upon a scene of Graham stabbing Yoko with a knife. Graham retreats, and Yoko warns Soma of Graham's power. Arikado arrives, promises Soma he will look after Yoko, and demands that Soma pursue Graham. Soma meets [...] "J" [...] again, who reveals he is , the man who defeated Dracula in 1999. As he leaves, he remarks that he <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> about the current situation, but does not elaborate.|$|E

2500|$|The epistle dedicatory is to Richard Lichfield, a barber-surgeon of Cambridge {{noted for}} his ability to make humorous, mock-academic orations. Nashe, who clearly <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> of Lichfield but may not have known him personally, at first {{addresses}} him in hyperbolic terms of exaggerated respect. The language chosen for the dedication is probably in imitation of a verbose and comically pedantic style sometimes used by Lichfield, and certain other barber-surgeons at Cambridge, for entertainment. Throughout the epistle Nashe seems to be appealing to Lichfield to join him in attacking Harvey and his brothers, though the tone is edgy and it is unclear whether Nashe seriously expects a favourable response.|$|E
2500|$|Duke University Provost Peter Lange responded, [...] "I cannot {{tell you}} how disappointed, saddened and appalled I was to receive this letter from you. A form of {{prejudice}} - one felt so often by minorities whether they be African American, Jewish or other - is the act of prejudgment: to presume that one <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> 'must' have been done by or done to someone because {{of his or her}} race, religion or other characteristic." [...] He continued, [...] "We do not know much about the worst of what may have happened in the incident that has inflamed our community," [...] and concluded, [...] "Sadly, letters like yours do little to advance our common cause." ...|$|E

2500|$|Trevor {{is arrested}} {{for a series}} of murders which {{occurred}} at the local hospital. He is wrongly accused as viewers knew that Lindsey was the serial killer, dubbed the [...] "Gloved Hand Killer". Wall said her character knows Trevor better than anyone and knows he would not have committed these crimes. She sets out to prove his innocence but Lindsey is actively trying to frame Trevor. Wall likened Grace trying to complete a puzzle as she goes out to find clues that lead to the actual killer. Grace realises that Charlie Dean (Charlie Behan) <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> about the actual culprit. Wall said that Grace is true to form and behaves [...] "very aggressive", kidnaps him and tries to force Charlie to talk.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates repeats {{his claim}} that formal accusations of {{corruption}} and impiety shall not destroy him, but that he shall be harmed by the prejudiced gossip and slanders of his enemies. He tells the court of being unafraid of death, because his true concern is in acting ethically. That people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death {{might be a good}} thing, but that most people fear death as an evil thing, when they cannot possibly know death to be either good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant: “I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he <b>knows</b> <b>something,</b> when he does not.” Apology, 21d.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, RiverClan {{reveals that}} their Clan {{is facing a}} [...] "small problem" [...] {{and that they are}} being forced to live on the Gathering island for a short while. Though Leopardstar is {{fiercely}} protective of her Clan and refuses to elaborate, Hollypaw <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> is not right because her friend Willowpaw and the rest of RiverClan are acting extremely nervous. She informs Firestar of her concerns. However, he does not believe this is ThunderClan's problem and refuses to take action. Hollypaw heads to RiverClan on her own. When she arrives, Willowpaw shows her how human children are disturbing their camp, but the RiverClan cats are widening the river to discourage the children from playing near the camp. Hollypaw is kept with RiverClan so she cannot tell anyone about their secret because they think she is a spy.|$|E
