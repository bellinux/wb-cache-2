5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

5000|$|Pauline Kael {{would later}} say in an interview: [...] "You really feel you should drive a stake {{through the heart}} of the man who made <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so vile. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> so horrible." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig {{spoke about}} the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that [...] "the great {{challenge}} is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, {{the entrance of the}} Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. That is {{a deadly}} thing: <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a deadly thing to young men, when such beastly queens shall, with words and {{carriages}} that are openly tempting, discover themselves unto them; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hard for such to escape their snare.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm {{surprised}} that I've got {{this amount of}} material together in five years," [...] Bush remarked. [...] "I'm thrillled, really… <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a form of 'greatest hits'. It's just put in a box and it's a nicer way of doing it." ...|$|R

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{met with}} Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the {{director}} had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Stone liked the [...] "stiffness" [...] of Sheen's acting style {{and used it}} to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in Romancing the Stone and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, [...] "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that [...] "when he's acting he gives it his all". Stone said that he saw [...] "that villain quality" [...] in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I’d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unbelievable". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.|$|E
500|$|According to Betty Cortina of People magazine, Dreaming of You {{marked a}} shift that abrogated the singer being marketed {{as part of}} her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in [...] "the most {{fundamental}} way for her". From 1989, Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena's principal music producer and songwriter, and remained so throughout her career. Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer's follow-up recording to Amor Prohibido (1994), he could not produce the crossover album. He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best [...] "fit with Selena's style". Dreaming of You was the first album Selena's family did not produce. They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] but had not yet completed the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album. [...] Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals. Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24, 1995 to finish recording the song. In a 2002 interview, Pérez said Thomas provided Selena with a cassette of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and said she had the song [...] "on loop" [...] and she [...] "must have heard it a hundred times". He believed it had an [...] "effect on her" [...] because [...] "she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [...] was letting her do her thing and <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an incredible thing to watch".|$|E

But I don't regret it--the getting up early <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a change. <b>I</b> got {{everybody}} else up too, and we all had breakfast at seven.|$|R

6000|$|... “I didn’t bring a hat,” he said, “because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> such a {{nuisance}} when one <b>is</b> shopping; <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so awkward if one meets anyone one knows {{and has to}} take one’s hat off when one’s hands are full of parcels. If one hasn’t got a hat on one can’t take it off.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Ship in the Bottle" [...] was {{the only}} {{completed}} track left off the record. [...] "That was the super-pop song of the record," [...] said Beck in 2002 interview. [...] "I {{think it was a}} little too corny. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> heartfelt, but since then people have been telling me they really liked it. I think we felt that the album was so long already. I don't know what the fate of that will be." [...] "Ship in the Bottle" [...] was released on the Japanese version of Sea Change and later remasters.|$|E
2500|$|His next band, The Royal Pythons ("a gang {{that turned}} into a musical group"), was not a success either. Said DeVille: [...] "I {{decided to go to}} San Francisco; there was nothing really {{happening}} in New York. Flower power was dead. All the day-glo paint was peeling off the walls. People were shooting speed. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> real Night of the Living Dead. So I bought a truck and headed out west. I traveled all around the country for a couple of years, looking for musicians who had heart, instead of playing 20-minute guitar solos, which is pure ego." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what {{you kind of}} rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should be}} better off than Young," [...] said Wilkinson, {{as though he were}} {{speaking}} to himself. [...] "But that is not the point. I do not know that I have ever looked at it exactly in that light. There is the house, the parsonage <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> full of women"--'twas thus irreverently that he spoke of his mother and sisters--"what other woman would come among them?" ...|$|R

2500|$|When the 1974 {{recording}} of the song was reaching {{number one on the}} country charts, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded. Parton refused. She recalls:I said, 'I'm really sorry,' and I cried all night. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like the worst thing. You know, it's like, Oh, my God … Elvis Presley.' And other people were saying, 'You're nuts. It's Elvis Presley.' ...I said, 'I can't do that. Something in my heart says, 'Don't do that. And I just didn't do it... He would have killed it. But anyway, so he didn't. Then when Whitney [...] came out, I made enough money to buy Graceland.|$|E
2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
