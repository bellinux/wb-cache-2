5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals <b>his</b> <b>bad</b> grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both {{the old man and the}} young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes.

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as Deputy Premier Tikhonov {{was in charge of}} {{metallurgy}} and chemical industry; his responsibilities did not change with his ascension to the post of First Deputy Premier. However, he did provide a general coordination for heavy industry. When Alexei Kosygin, the Premier, was on sick leave in 1976 Brezhnev took advantage of his illness by appointing Tikhonov to the office of First Deputy Premier. As First Deputy Premier, Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby figure. Tikhonov was, however, {{one of the few who}} got along with both Brezhnev and Kosygin, both of them liked his candor and honesty. In 1978 Tikhonov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and was made a voting member of the Politburo in 1979. Tikhonov was not informed of the decision to intervene in Afghanistan; the reason being <b>his</b> <b>bad</b> relationship with Dmitriy Ustinov, the Minister of Defence at the time.|$|E

5|$|Pathan was {{subsequently}} signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season, where {{he attempted to}} regain his form after <b>his</b> <b>bad</b> start to the year. Pathan arrived in late-May and stayed for six weeks. He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series, taking six wickets at 24.66 and an economy rate of 5.41 in four one-dayers, including 3/42 against Essex. In the new Twenty20 format, Pathan took 12 wickets at 12.75 and an economy rate of 6.37 in seven matches, including a best of 4/27 against Essex. He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31-run win. However, his difficulties in first-class matches continued. He took 4/81 and 1/68, and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex, and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out. However, he failed to take another wicket and ended with five wickets at 64.80 and 126 runs at 63.00, scoring 68 against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|Tabbed as {{a starter}} during the preseason, Auguste, {{as one of the}} team's few post options, {{established}} himself {{as a starter}} during his junior season with good performances early in the season, albeit against weaker opposition. A memorable December 13, 2014 game against Florida State, in which he scored a career-high 26 points, started what coach Brey described as a run of key contributions from the forward, with Auguste quickly recouping from <b>his</b> <b>bad</b> performances. In January 2015, Auguste was sidelined by Notre Dame due to academic issues, with the length of the suspension undisclosed. It would ultimately only last three days, with the unknown reason later described as minor by the player. Auguste was seen as a major contributor to the Irish's 2015 ACC Tournament title contributing 16 points and 13 rebounds in the final against North Carolina (for an average of more than 11 points and 9 rebounds in the whole tournament).|$|E
