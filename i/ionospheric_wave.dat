A strong depletion of both Pc 1 types is observed in sunspot maximum years with the amount of structured pulsations being slightly more depleted than unstructured pulsations. We present the diurnal distributions of both pulsation types for minimum and maximum years separately and note on interesting changes over the solar cycle. We have also calculated the average period of the two pulsation types during the two sunspot phases. While the average period of unstructured Pc 1 's remains nearly constant, the average period of structured pulsations is found to increase in sunspot maximum years.

The method is tested on the VTEC map corresponding to a simulated realistic scenario and on actual data from dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements gathered by + 1200 GPS receivers of the GPS Earth Observation Network (GEONET) in Japan. The contribution consists of the detection {{of the number of}} independent MSTIDs from a nonuniform sampling of the ionospheric pierce points. The problem is set as a sparse decomposition on elements of a dictionary of atoms that span a linear space of possible MSTIDs. These atoms consist of plane waves characterized by a wavelength, direction, and phase on a surface defined, the part of the ionosphere sounded by the GEONET (i. e., 25 °N to 50 °N of latitude and 125 °E to 155 °E of longitude).

Consequently, the associated random errors contributed by the nature background noise would severely affect the accuracy of phase and group velocities.

The present analysis is carried out on five sets of occultation profiles, all at high solar zenith angles (SZA). Variations spanning 2 Martian years are investigated near aphelion conditions at high northern latitudes (64. 7 - 77. 6 N) making use of four of these data sets. A mean ionospheric peak height of 133. 5 - 135 km is obtained near SZA = 78 - 82 deg.; a corresponding mean peak density of 7. 3 - 8. 5 x l 0 (exp 4) / qu cm is also measured during solar moderate conditions at Mars. Strong wave number 2 - 3 oscillations in peak heights are consistently observed as a function of longitude over the 2 Martian years. These observed ionospheric features are remarkably similar during aphelion conditions 1 Martian year apart. This year-to-year repeatability in the thermosphere-ionosphere structure is consistent with that observed in multiyear aphelion temperature data of the Mars lower atmosphere. Coupled Mars general circulation model (MGCM) and Mars thermospheric general circulation model (MTGCM) codes are run for Mars aphelion conditions, yielding mean and longitude variable ionospheric peak heights that reasonably match RS observations.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the present paper are to present some interesting morphological features of pc 1 pulsations observed at low latitudes and to propose the most plausible model of generation and propagation of the pulsations. Comparison between the low-latitude pc 1 and the high-latitude one will be done in our joint paper (KUWASHIMA et al., 1981). In this paper, occurrence characteristics, the most important factors, of the pulsations are mainly investigated. In the first place, some statistical features of the pulsations are shown {{on the basis of}} data obtained at Memambetsu, the northernmost one of the Japanese chain stations, during two-years period from June 1967 to May 1969. And the features of the diurnal and seasonal variations are compared with those of the electron density of the ionospheric F 2 layer at Wakkanai which is located at a distance of about 200 km from Memambetsu. Next, conjugate relationships of the pulsations at middle and low latitudes are analyzed statistically on the basis of data obtained at Memambetsu, Japan and Newcastle and Hobart, Australia for the same two-years period. Relations between the occurrence and the development of the ring current (Dst) are also discussed. Moreover, the above conjugate relationships of the pc 1 occurrence at middle and low latitudes are investigated in more detail in comparison of dynamic spectra obtained at Memambetsu and the Australian longitudinal chain stations, Mundaring, Woomera, Newcastle and Auckland, for the period of April 1 - 30, 1977.

The direct GNSS Ionospheric Interferometry technique (hereinafter dGII), presented in this paper, is applied for correcting MSTID effects on precise Real Time Kinematic (RTK) and tropospheric determination. It consists of the evolution of the former climatic Differential Delay Mitigation Model for MSTIDs (DMTID), for real-time conditions, using ionospheric data from a single permanent receiver only. The performance is demonstrated with networks of GNSS receivers in Poland, treated as users under real-time conditions, during two representative days in winter and summer seasons (days 353 and 168 of year 2013). In range domain, dGII typically reduces the ionospheric delay error up to 10 - 90 % of the value when the MSTID mitigation model is not applied. The main dGII impact on precise positioning is that we can obtain reliable RTK position faster. In particular the ASR (ambiguity success rate) parameter increases, from 74 % to 83 %, with respect to the original uncorrected observations. The average of time to first fix is shortened from 30 s to 13 s.

These waves propagate along the geomagnetic field lines to the ionosphere, where they interact with the ionospheric plasma, generating compressional-mode waves. EMIC waves can generate isolated proton auroras via wave-particle interactions at subauroral latitudes (e.g., Sakaguchi et al. ([2008]); Nomura et al. ([2012])).

They concluded that these southwestward-moving MSTIDs are {{not caused by}} ionospheric instabilities, as usually suggested at middle latitudes, but {{are likely to be}} caused by auroral disturbances as TADs because the observed background thermospheric wind was poleward, stabilizing the ionospheric instability. On the other hand, Shiokawa et al.

In particular, ionospheric signatures of class M = 8 earthquakes were imaged near the source (Heki and Ping, 2005; Astafyeva and Heki, 2009; Astafyeva et al, 2009) and also far from the source (Dučić et al., 2003; Rolland et al., 2011). For seismic sources, two kinds of waves were identified in a close vicinity of an epicenter: waves propagating at the typical sound speed at ionospheric heights (from 0.6 to 1 km/s) and waves propagating beyond 3 km/s. The first kind {{is related to the}} acoustic plume emitted by the piston-like effect of the Earth’s surface oscillations on the surrounding atmosphere, and modeled using seismic ray tracing (Heki and Ping, 2005) following Calais et al.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{electromagnetic}} wave generation by an electrodynamic tethered satellite system is important {{both for the}} ordinary operation of such systems and for their possible application as orbiting transmitters. The tether's ionospheric circuit closure problem is closely linked with the propagation of charge-carrying electromagnetic wave packets away from the tethered system. Work is reported which represents a step towards {{a solution to the}} problem that takes into account the effects of boundaries and of vertical variations in plasma density, collision frequencies, and ion species. The theory of Alfen wave packet generation by an electrodynamic tethered system in an infinite plasma medium is reviewed, and brief summary of previous work on the problem is given. The consequences of the presence of the boundaries and the vertical nonuniformity are then examined. One of the most significant new features to emerge when ion-neutral collisions are taken into account is the coupling of the Alfven waves to the fast magnetosonic wave. This latter wave is important, as it may be confined by vertical variations in the Alfven speed to a sort of leaky <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wave</b> guide, the resonances of which could be of great importance to the signal received on the Earth's surface. The infinite medium solution for this case where the (uniform) geomagnetic field makes an arbitrary angle with the vertical is taken as the incident wave-packet. Even without a full solution, a number of conclusions can be drawn, the most important of which may be that the electromagnetic field associated with the operation of a steady-current tethered system will probably be too weak to detect on the Earth's surface, even for large tethered currents. This is due to the total reflection of the incident wave at the atmospheric boundary and the inability of a steady-current tethered system to excite the ionospheric wave-guide.

The vortex street is shown to be a consequence of coupling between the magnetospheric Alfvén waves carrying field-aligned currents and the <b>ionospheric</b> density <b>waves</b> driven by Pedersen/Hall currents...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, the STIDs {{induced by}} the Rayleigh <b>waves,</b> <b>ionospheric</b> AGWs, and tsunami waves have been {{observed}} by ionograms recorded by the 5 ionosondes near the earthquake. The circle method {{can be used to}} locate origins and enable the determination of the propagation speed of STIDs triggered by seismic waves and tsunami waves of large earthquakes.|$|R
40|$|Abst ract. Acceleration of charged particles, and {{emissions}} of electromagnetic waves {{over a wide}} range of frequencies, occur in the auroral region of the terrestrial magnetosphere. Many interesting results concerning such phenomena were presented at the second EGS Alfv~n conference held in Stockholm during May 1999. We present a summary of some of these results. Our presentation i cludes recent in-vestigations of the mechanisms accelerating electrons both upward and downward along the geomagnetic field in the auroral region, and of the waves causing energization and upward outflow of <b>ionospheric</b> ions. <b>Wave</b> phenomena such as Auroral Kilometric Radi-ation and various types of Solitary Waves are als...|$|R
