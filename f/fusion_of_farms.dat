We define a notion of defect between conformal nets, formalizing {{the idea of an}} interaction between two conformal field theories. We introduce an operation <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> defects, and prove that the <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> two defects is again a defect, provided the fusion occurs over a conformal net of finite index. There is a notion of sector (or bimodule) between two defects, and operations of horizontal and vertical <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> such sectors. Our most difficult technical result is that the horizontal <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> the vacuum sectors of two defects is isomorphic to the vacuum sector of the fused defect.

30|$|<b>Fusion</b> <b>of</b> GPS with an RBPF {{importance}} function was previously proposed. <b>Fusion</b> <b>of</b> GPS and IMU by the Kalman filter for RBPF particle reweighting {{was used in}} [20, 21]. These RBPFs are similar to FS 1.0 in that sensors are fused by EKF. Ren et al. used the Kalman filter to separately estimate GPS and IMU [20]. Depending on the sensor availability, only the sensor will be updated to the particle filter. <b>Fusion</b> <b>of</b> sensors is successful because the particle filter follows a Bayesian rule. Both approaches employ fusion data using a method similar to FS 1.0 for a landmark-based environment.
