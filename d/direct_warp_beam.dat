40|$|Seersucker is a {{thin and}} {{puckered}} fabric used to make clothing for spring. Due to its specific structure, this fabric is held away from the skin when worn, facilitating heat dissipation and air circulation. Seersucker is produced by slack tension weaving using two <b>warp</b> <b>beams.</b> Due {{to the use of}} two beams, such fabrics were not possible to weave on conventional (with single <b>warp</b> <b>beam)</b> weaving machines. Additional twin beams arrangement was required for such weaving. The objective of the current study is to produce seersucker fabric on conventional looms using a single <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> For achieving this objective, two types of weft yarn: 100 % cotton yarns and blended yarns of cotton and elastane (95. 67 % cotton and 4. 33 % Lycra) are used in groups. The viscoelastic behaviour of the produced fabric samples is tested using ASTM standard D 3107 - 07.

50|$|The warp {{passes from}} the <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> passes over a {{friction}} guide roller, where it horizontally {{passes through the}} loom to a breastbeam. Here it turns vertically to the cloth beam. Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction. The cloth beam bears a toothed wheel which works a pinion. A ratchet wheel is attached with a click level {{to take up the}} slack in the cloth. This was Roberts invention.|$|R
40|$|Yarns of <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> to knit on warp {{knitting}} machines {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead to produce valleys and ridges of warp yarns on the beam and hence different lengths of individual warp yarns. These length variations lead to loop length variations in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual warp yarns on <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> for <b>warp</b> knitting were examined. 16 % of warp yarns were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual yarns of a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> show that 0 - 1. 7 % length variations exist among the yarns. The fabrics knitted at different tension values ranging from 4 cN to 20 cN show 6. 6 % increase in wale density. Although the fabric weight variation is below 5 %, the microscopic view of the fabrics shows significant change in the size of loops and rupture of filaments. This has caused visual colour difference in the fabric...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of interlinked, multi-layer fabrics and near net shape preforms for engineering applications, woven on a 48 shaft dobby loom using glass, aramid, and carbon continuous filament yarns is assessed. The interlinking was formed using the warp yarns. Two basic types of structure were used. The first used a single <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> and hence {{each of the}} warp yarns followed a similar path to form four layer interlinked reinforcements and preforms. In the second two <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> were used, one for the interlinking yarns which pass from the top to the bottom layer through-the-thickness of the fabric and vice versa, {{and the other to}} provide 'straight' yarns {{in the body of the}} structure to carry the axial loading. Fabrics up to 15 mm in thickness were constructed with varying amounts of through-the-thickness reinforcement. Tapered T and I sections were also woven, with the shaping produced by progressive removal of ends during construction. These fabrics and preforms were impregnated with resin and cured to form composite samples for testing. Using these two basic types of construction, the influence of reinforcement construction and the proportion and type of interlinking yarn on the {{performance of}} the composite was assessed...|$|R
25|$|The weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads {{are known}} as the warp, and the cross way threads {{are known as}} the weft.

2500|$|At {{the onset}} of a thunderstorm, {{according}} to Nikola's own description, he felt a great excitement; he heard some music in the thunder, all his muscles tightened, and something made him go. He would take a sickle and a scythe, a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> on which a twin sister had wound warp yarns, the bag with the last-year's pellets, and the bottle with last-year's dew. With this he would run directly toward the cloud, looking neither left nor right, nor watching where he treads. Once on the field, Nikola would stick the scythe into the ground, and say a prayer for lightning to strike. Having gone away from the scythe, he would make {{the sign of the}} cross with the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> in the direction of the cloud, to break it into quarters. Further beneath it, he would shake the cloud apart using the pellets and dew. There he also addressed the souls of the drowned and hanged leading the cloud, praying them that the [...] "rain like this dew" [...] fall, and spoke various other prayers. For these protective services, Nikola had been receiving wheat and maize from his fellow villagers. He was eventually warned by the authorities to stop with these activities, branded backward superstition by them.|$|R

Most looms used for industrial purposes have a machine that ties new warps threads to the waste of previously used warps threads, while still on the loom, then an operator rolls {{the old and new}} threads back on the <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> The harnesses are controlled by cams, dobbies or a Jacquard head.|$|R
5000|$|In 1795, {{the machine}} was {{successfully}} used to make lacey fabrics. [...] Warp frames could be used with any thread, and the warps provided a fixed anchor for the transverse threads. In 1786 Flint invented the point bar which kept the threads at a fixed distance. In 1796, Dawson introduced cams to move the bars, and regulate the twist. Brown and Copstake succeeded in imitating Mechlen net. Lindley invented the bobbin in 1799, and Irving and Skelton the regulator spring. In 1802, Robert Brown of New Radford patented the first twist-frame, a knitter that could produce wide net.Whittaker's frame of 1804 had half its thread mounted on a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> and half wound on bobbins mounted on a carriage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} the warp vision on living {{entities}} was demonstrated when Rick, trapped in Sleepwalker's body after an encounter with the Chain Gang, inadvertently used the beam on his former girlfriend Alyssa Conover, {{who was about to}} kill Sleepwalker in Rick's body. Sleepwalker's vision causes living bodies to twist and contort, causing intense physical agony in the process, although this effect is only temporary. The beam also has the side effect of breaking the mental control of any outside entity possessing the victim's mind, expelling the controller in the process. As a result, Rick unintentionally freed Alyssa from the domination of the Chain Gang, a tactic Sleepwalker himself would later adopt when freeing other people from the mental enslavement of Cobweb's minions, using his ability to detect mental enslavement to identify the humans who needed his help. In these cases, when he used his <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> on their human victims, the humans suffered little to no mental trauma, only experiencing a mild [...] that they quickly recovered from. Alyssa Conover, on the other hand, suffered both the physical pain of her contortion and a serious mental shock from the effects of Sleepwalker's <b>warp</b> <b>beams,</b> which according to Sleepwalker forced her to repeatedly experience her worst nightmares. It seems that the mindspawn demons, who had completely suppressed the wills of their human victims and had completely taken over their bodies, took the brunt of the blast. In Alyssa's case, on the other hand, the Chain Gang did not completely take over her body, but rather attempted to force her conscious mind to do their bidding, leaving her vulnerable to the full {{effects of the}} beam.|$|R

The algorithm of fuzzy neural network optimization for transfer coefficient of elastic damage (TCOED) offers a method and basis to predict the stress state in front of the working face.

In contrast to previous implementation of the warped stretch compression, here the decoding can be performed without the need of phase recovery.|$|R
40|$|Accuracy of speaker {{verification}} is high under controlled conditions but {{falls off}} {{rapidly in the}} presence of interfering sounds. This is because spectral features, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), are sensitive to additive noise. MFCCs are a particular realization of warped-frequency representation with low-frequency focus. But there are several alternative, potentially more robust, warped-frequency representations. We provide an experimental comparison of five warped-frequency features. They use exactly the same frequency warping function, the same number of coefficients and postprocessing, but differ in their internal computations. The compared variants are (1) conventional MFCCs from discrete Fourier transform (DFT), followed by Mel-scaled filterbank, (2) MFCCs via <b>direct</b> <b>warping</b> of DFT, followed by linear-scale filterbank, (3) warped linear prediction features, (4) perceptual minimum variance distortionless features and (5) recently proposed sparse Mel-scale histogram features.

Adanur and Qi (2008 a) established an on-line tension measurement system by producing denim fabric on an air-jet loom in order to evaluate yarn tensions. Adanur and Qi (2008 b) studied the effects of tension on the properties of denim fabrics made on an air-jet weaving loom. The variations in warp yarn tension during the weaving process become smaller by the backrest roller’s swinging motion. At a high speed of the weaving machine, it could be possible to obtain a suitable relationship between movements of the whip roller and warp yarn tension (Kloppels et al. 2002).|$|R
50|$|It has two <b>warp</b> <b>beams,</b> {{though it}} can be run using just one or none.

The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R

He is also capable of the projection of crude images of what he's seen from his eyes. His only offensive power was his [...] "warp gaze". With this vision-based power, Sleepwalker could alter the shape of physical objects and twist them to his purposes. He could also modify the physical characteristics of the objects he affected-making them harder or softer, for example. Sleepwalker initially demonstrated this power by using it to distort a sidewalk to capture a criminal.
