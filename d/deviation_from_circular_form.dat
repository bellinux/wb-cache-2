40|$|We present H I 21 cm {{observations}} of the grand design spiral galaxy NGC 4321, as obtained with the VLA. From our original data, we have obtained data cubes with resolutions ranging from 13 '' to 45 ''. The H I is observed to break up into small condensations at high resolution. These condensations, with typical masses of 3. 3 +/- 0. 7 x 10 (7) M., are {{not confined to the}} arm regions. They may be unresolved at 15 '' resolution and thus may have physical sizes smaller than 1 kpc. The total H I distribution is mostly confined to the radius of the optical disk, but a large though faint extension is seen in the H I data at 45 '' resolution on the SW side of the disk. NGC 4321 is asymmetric in H I and may be called ''lopsided. '' We have derived a rotation curve which agrees fairly well with what was previously published but shows more detail due to the higher resolution of our new observations. The rotation curve does not decline within the radius of the disk, but important differences are seen between the behavior of the approaching and the receding sides. These differences are caused by <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> motions in the outer disk that are probably due to a close passage of the companion galaxy NGC 4322, which may also be the cause of the observed asymmetry in the total H I distribution. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> motion due to density wave streaming are seen in the inner disk. From skewing of the velocity contours in the central part of NGC 4321, the presence of a nonaxisymmetric potential is deduced.

40|$|We use {{a set of}} cosmological N-body {{simulations}} {{to investigate}} the structural shape of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Unlike most previous work on the subject - which dealt with shapes {{as measured by the}} inertia tensor - we focus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity more directly relevant to comparison with observational probes. A further advantage is that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, as a consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and well approximated by concentric ellipsoids. Our main result is that the asphericity of the potential increases rapidly towards the center of the halo. The radial trend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the mass distribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter halos to become increasingly aspherical inwards. Near the center the halo potential is approximately prolate ((c/a) _ 0 = 0. 72 +/- 0. 04, (b/a) _ 0 = 0. 78 +/- 0. 08), but it becomes increasingly spherical in the outer regions. The principal axes of the isopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most halos the angular momentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the major axis. This suggests that galactic disks may form in a plane where the potential is elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius. This can result in significant <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> motion in systems such as low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs), even for relatively minor <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> symmetry. Simulated long-slit rotation curves can appear similar to those of LSBs often cited as evidence for constant density "cores". This suggests that taking into account the 3 D shape of the dark mass distribution might help to reconcile such evidence with the cuspy mass profile of CDM halos.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{kinematics}} of gaseous disks in triaxial dark matter halos using the closed-loop orbit solutions in non-axisymmetric potentials. The orbits are in general non-circular and, for given triaxiality, their ellipticity {{depends on the}} ratio of escape to circular velocities, V 2 2 esc /Vc. This ratio increases steeply towards the center for cold dark matter (CDM) halo density profiles, implying that even minor <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> spherical symmetry may induce large <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> orbits in the velocity field of a gaseous disk, especially near the center. This result suggests that caution should be exercised when interpreting constraints {{on the presence of}} density cusps in the dark halo derived from the innermost velocity profile. Simulated long-slit rotation curves vary greatly in shape, depending primarily on the viewing angle of the disk and on its orientation relative to the principal axes of the potential. “Solid-body” rotation curves—typically interpreted as a signature of a constant density core in the dark matter distribution—are often obtained when the slit samples velocities nea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{binary system}} YY Gem, which {{consists}} of two dM 1 e stars, has been observed during an eclipse using intercontinental Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at 1. 6 GHz. The stellar emission was at a low, quiescent level at all observing periods. The correlated flux decreases slightly with baseline length, indicating that the source is resolved at the longest baselines. This is confirmed by model fits, which give a FWHM size of 0. 94 (± 0. 24) mas (2. 0 · 10 11 cm or 2. 1 photospheric diameters) for the radio emitting source. A lower limit to the size derived {{from the lack of}} observable eclipse effects is consistent with this value. The resulting brightness temperature of 1. 1 · 10 9 K is compatible with gyrosynchrotron emission. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> symmetry are not significant.

40|$|We review five {{often used}} quad lens models, {{each of which}} has {{analytical}} solutions and can produce four images at most. Each lens model has two parameters, including one that describes the intensity of non-dimensional mass density, and the other one that describes the <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> the <b>circular</b> lens. In our recent work, we have found that the cusp and the fold summations are not equal to 0, when a point source infinitely approaches a cusp or a fold from inner side of the caustic. Based on the magnification invariant theory, which states that the sum of signed magnifications of the total images of a given source is a constant, we calculate the cusp summations for the five lens models. We find that the cusp summations are always larger than 0 for source on the major cusps, while can be larger or smaller than 0 for source on the minor cusps. We also find that if these lenses tend to the circular lens, the major and minor cusp summations will have infinite values, and with positive and negative signs respectively. The cusp summations do not change significantly if the sources are slightly deviated from the cusps. In addition, through the magnification invariants, we also derive the analytical signed cusp relations on the axes for three lens models. We find that both on the major and the minor axes the larger the lenses deviated <b>from</b> the <b>circular</b> lens, the larger the signed cusp relations. The major cusp relations are usually larger than the absolute minor cusp relations, but for some lens models with very large <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>circular</b> lens, the minor cusp relations can be larger than the major cusp relations.

A spinless particle also deviates from geodesic behavior when a test radiation field is superimposed on the Schwarzschild background: in fact the interaction with the radiation field, i. e., the absorption and re-emission of radiation, leads to a friction-like drag force responsible for the well known effect which exists already in Newtonian gravity, the Poynting-Robertson effect. Here the Poynting-Robertson effect is extended {{to the case of}} spinning particles by modifying the Mathisson-Papapetrou model describing the motion of spinning test particles to account for the contribution of the radiation force.

The receptive field of each cell was stimulated with a drifting sinusoidal grating of the preferred size and spatial and temporal frequency; we probed different positions in the suppressive surround with either a large half-annular grating or a small circular grating patch of the preferred spatial and temporal frequency.

The amplitude of the local magnetic moment is found to vary with temperature, while the Skyrmion shape does not change significantly. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> a <b>circular</b> to a hexagonal Skyrmion structure are observed in the lattice phase, {{in agreement with the}} results of micromagnetic simulations...|$|R

[...] This second class comprises many of the most remarkable and [...] interesting objects in the heavens, as well as the most extensive [...] in respect of the area they occupy." ...|$|R
