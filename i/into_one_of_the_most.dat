5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E

5|$|The town's name in Welsh, Llanilltud Fawr, {{is derived}} from the name of Saint Illtud, who came to the area from Brittany, Gaul.

At its peak it attracted over 2000 students, including princes and numerous eminent clergymen, some now revered as saints. Destroyed by the Vikings in 987, the monastery was rebuilt in 1111 and continued to be a centre of learning governed by Tewkesbury Abbey until it closed in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The 13th-century St Illtyd's Church, built near the ancient monastery, is today a Grade I listed building and one of the oldest parish churches in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 12thcentury, {{important}} socio-political changes {{took place in}} the Deccan, south of the Krishna river. During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the Malnad region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power. They are known to have existed as chieftains from the mid-10thcentury when they distinguished themselves as subordinates of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani. In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas of Tanjore and annexed Gangavadi (parts of modern southern Karnataka), thus bringing the region back under native rule. In the following decades, with the waning of the Chalukya power, the Hoysalas proclaimed independence and grew <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful ruling families of southern India. Consequently, literature in Kannada, the local language, flourished in the Hoysala empire. This literature can be broadly subdivided as follows: works dominated by the themes of Jain writings, contrasting works by Veerashaiva writers not belonging to the vachana poetic tradition, rebuttals to Shaiva writings from Jain writers, early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the birth of the Bhakti (devotional) movement in the Kannada-speaking region, writings on secular topics, and the first writings in native metres (ragale, sangatya and shatpadi).|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s, {{the city}} enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid {{expansion}} beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by {{the building of a}} railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion, and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In late 1108 {{or early}} 1109, Henry V, then the King of the Romans, sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote {{separately}} {{to her mother}} on the same matter. The match was attractive to the English King: his daughter would be marrying <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France. In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor. The final details of the deal were negotiated at Westminster in June 1109 and, {{as a result of}} her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October. She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.|$|E

5|$|Magadheeras success turned Kajal <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema and catapulted {{her into}} the foray of leading Telugu actresses. The film was also {{considered}} a fate changer in the career of Ram Charan. The role of Sher Khan played by Srihari was considered {{as one of the}} best roles in his career and also catapulted S. S. Rajamouli to stardom. Dev Gill attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several South Indian films as an antagonist. After the release of Magadheera, people began recognising him as Ranadheer. According to writer Gopimohan, Magadheera started a trend of experimentation with period, socio-fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like Panchakshari (2010), Nagavalli (2010), Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011), Mangala (2011), Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) and Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara? (2012).|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already {{coming on the}} back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with a razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E
5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E
