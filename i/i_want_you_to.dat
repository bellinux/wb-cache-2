5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match {{and out of the}} side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
25|$|D: Well, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell Washington {{that this}} is being done, and that I want them to land the BLTs , the two marine BLTs on the {{aircraft}} carriers offshore. I want them to land and protect the palace.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} have a way in, making it visual and making it funny. I want it to be really funny and entertaining, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> not realize how much {{information}} is being thrown at you because you're having fun. We've found a couple of ideas on how to bust the form a bit, in order for all that information to reach you in a way that's a little oblique.|$|E

We {{men and women are}} like the flowers. It is in {{sunshine}} that we come <b>to</b> our best. <b>You</b> were my hero. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be great. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be surrounded by lovely dreams. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> your love to be a thing holy, helpful to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To run {{was exactly}} what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] Ray answered. [...] "You had the dispatch-box, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> safe away." ...|$|R

25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{understand that it is}} not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

500|$|Besides his {{increasing}} {{influence in}} Washington, {{by the late}} 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure. [...] After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he subsequently endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off. [...] He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. [...] As Koch related, [...] "He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know he's nasty to everybody.' I thought that was rather nice." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Payne of Billboard ranked {{it as the}} band's fifth best lead single, {{beating out}} [...] "Hash Pipe", [...] "(If You're Wondering If <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>To)</b> I Want You To", [...] "Pork and Beans", and [...] "Memories". Hilary Hughes of Fuse praised it as {{a return to the}} band's old sound, saying [...] "a {{promising}} look at what's sure to be a satisfying listen for new and old fans alike." [...] Ian Rogers from The Vine commented that it [...] "Sounds exactly like a highly professional, crassly commercial L.A. rock band performing a Weezer-styled song about Weezer returning to their roots." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stand up on your feet, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess you'll think I'm {{about as}} forth-putting as I was when <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{give me a}} three-hundred-dollar picture for a week's board." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{had turned}} to Mitchy. [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know. So <b>I</b> spoke. It's not more {{complicated}} than that. As for WHY <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> dine with {{my grandfather}} at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you. Such is life!' ...|$|R
500|$|Dunn {{once told}} then-cadet Edward Vergne Adams, [...] "One day <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> direct this band." [...] Adams thought the Colonel was joking, but [...] "went to music school after {{graduation}} {{just in case}} he wasn't". After music school, he joined the army and put his musical skills to rest {{for the duration of}} the war, with one exception: while on regimental staff during the retreat ceremony at the end of the day, the assigned bugler had no experience and couldn't play a single note, so Adams stepped out of formation, took the bugle from the bugler's hands, blew the appropriate calls, handed the bugle back, and marched back into his spot in the formation.|$|E
500|$|In her {{testimony}} and replies to {{questions from the}} commissioners, Dworkin denounced the use of criminal obscenity prosecutions against pornographers, stating, [...] "We are against obscenity laws. We do not want them. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> understand why, whether you end up agreeing or not." [...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction. Their basic presumption is that it's women's bodies that are dirty." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 21, 2005, {{the day of}} {{the release}} of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page {{advertisements}} in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. [...] "For a year now", Corgan wrote, [...] "I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} very well; I didn't believe {{a word of}} it. But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come into the house; I thought we should be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are making}} a fool of that little girl. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see her, but they have spoiled her entirely. She's nothing but a doll tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, you can't {{blame me}} for that. I'd loved you so long, so passionately. I'd never dared <b>to</b> hope that <b>you</b> cared for me. And when I knew! I {{never said a}} tenth part of what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to. <b>I</b> went home and I just wrote all that had filled my heart <b>to</b> overflowing. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know how humbly {{grateful}} I was for the wonderful happiness you'd given me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know that my soul to its most hidden corners was yours for ever.|$|R
500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me {{you have to give}} me all your men and do just exactly what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at {{the battle}} cab, a {{maintenance}} squadron officer was told, [...] "Listen, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> generate as many airframes [...] as you can!" [...] This immediately caused all personnel to be called back and they were ordered {{to work on the}} remaining jets. This rush involved the placement of missiles on all jets, including some newer missiles which were rarely pulled out. Six jets which were on a training mission were traversing through the Whiskey Airspace when they were told by the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center to head back to Otis immediately. Once landed, the pilots were told to park their jets but leave the engines on. Finally, the first planes took off at 10:20 in the morning.|$|E
500|$|It also {{incorporates}} a Queen-referencing chorus: [...] "I {{want you to}} rock me, yeah, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care." [...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's {{not a lot of}} overt machismo in the song". [...] "I approached it like high school," [...] said [...] Hollander: [...] "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture".|$|E
6000|$|... "How perfect our manners are! It's a {{treat to}} listen! How {{did you know}} that that was the one hat in New York <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, husband, I {{hope you}} don't think so! <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say <b>you</b> didn't. And if you don't think so, yes, I'll believe it came for that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You idiot, <b>I</b> won't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry him; <b>I</b> only <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{make a fool}} of him. Surely, {{being of}} the sex you are, you won't find that an uncongenial occupation." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was {{released}} as the B-side to [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] on December 2, 1968. The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think how nice it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|From 1946 to 1951, Willie Dixon {{sang and}} played bass with the Big Three Trio. After the group disbanded, {{he worked for}} Chess Records as a {{recording}} session arranger and bassist. Dixon wrote several songs, but label co-owner Leonard Chess failed to show any interest at first. [...] Finally, in 1953, Chess used two of Dixon's songs: [...] "Too Late", recorded by Little Walter, and [...] "Third Degree", recorded by Eddie Boyd. [...] "Third Degree" [...] became Dixon's first composition to enter the record charts. [...] In September, Waters recorded his [...] "Mad Love (<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> Love Me)", which Dixon biographer Mitsutoshi Inaba calls [...] "a test piece for the forthcoming 'Hoochie Coochie Man'" [...] because of its shared lyrical and musical elements. [...] The song became Waters' first record chart success in nearly two years.|$|E
500|$|... "Finally I {{caught him}} in Studio A of RCA. [...] He {{came out of the}} control booth and he had a couple of bikers - bikers hung around with him a lot, some pretty tough looking {{customers}} - and I'd had enough. [...] I just said, 'Hey Waylon!' [...] And he turned. [...] I said, 'I got these songs that you claimed you was gonna listen to, and if you don't listen to 'em I'm gonna whip your ass right here in front of everybody.' And boy, whew. [...] Man! [...] Everything got quiet and them old boys started formin' and Waylon stopped 'em. [...] He said, 'Hoss, you don't know how close you come to gettin' killed.' [...] I said, 'Well, I've had enough. [...] You done told me you was gonna do this. [...] Now I'm full of songs and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> listen to 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] she said. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> win; {{not that}} I cared for your winning, but because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> satisfy others {{who do not}} know you so well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' I protested, 'I {{hated her}} and despised her; but I tried to forget you; and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> feel certain that I no longer cared for you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Any man {{who holds}} a place here, now, stands {{prepared}} at all times <b>to</b> vacate it. <b>You</b> are doing, now, exactly what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do a year ago.|$|R
