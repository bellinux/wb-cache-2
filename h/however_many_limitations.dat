40|$|Abstract. One of the {{fundamental}} problems in phylogeny reconstruction is combining a set of trees into one “representative ” tree. There are exist numerous methods for that purpose that combine trees over the same taxa (consensus) or different taxa (supertree) sets. <b>However,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> and shortcomings of these methods have been pointed out. In this paper, we state various desirable properties of “representative ” trees {{and the impact of}} considering sets of trees to represent the input. We analyze the sets of compatibility trees and several consensus sets and show which of the properties are satisfied. Specifically, one of the desired properties is the output-polynomial enumeration of the set itself. ...|$|E

40|$|Human hands sweat in {{different}} circumstances {{and the presence}} of sweat can alter the friction between the hand and contacting surface. It is, therefore, important to understand how hand moisture varies between people, during different activities and the effect of this on friction. In this study, a survey of fingertip moisture was done. Friction tests were then carried out to investigate the effect of moisture. Moisture was added {{to the surface of the}} finger, the finger was soaked in water, and water was added to the counter-surface; the friction of the contact was then measured. It was found that the friction increased, up until a certain level of moisture and then decreased. The increase in friction has previously been explained by viscous shearing, water absorption and capillary adhesion. The results from the experiments enabled the mechanisms to be investigated analytically. This study found that water absorption is the principle mechanism responsible for the increase in friction, followed by capillary adhesion, although it was not conclusively proved that this contributes significantly. Both these mechanisms increase friction by increasing the area of contact and therefore adhesion. Viscous shearing in the liquid bridges has negligible effect.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{infectious}} diseases may change their geographic range, seasonality and incidence due to climate change, but there is limited research exploring health vulnerabilities to climate change. In order to address this gap, pan-European vulnerability indices were developed for 2035 and 2055, based upon the definition vulnerability = impact/adaptive capacity. Future impacts were projected based upon changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, whilst adaptive capacity was developed {{from the results of}} a previous pan-European study. The results were plotted via ArcGISTM to EU regional (NUTS 2) levels for 2035 and 2055 and ranked according to quintiles. The models demonstrate regional variations with respect to projected climate-related infectious disease challenges that they will face, and with respect to projected vulnerabilities after accounting for regional adaptive capacities. Regions with higher adaptive capacities, such as in Scandinavia and central Europe, will likely be better able to offset any climate change impacts and are thus generally less vulnerable than areas with lower adaptive capacities. The indices developed here provide public health planners with information to guide prioritisation of activities aimed at strengthening regional preparedness for the health impacts of climate change. There are, <b>however,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> and uncertainties when modeling health vulnerabilities. To further advance the field, the importance of variables such as coping capacity and governance should be better accounted for, and there is the need to systematically collect and analyse the interlinkages between the numerous and ever-expanding environmental, socioeconomic, demographic and epidemiologic datasets so as to promote the public health capacity to detect, forecast, and prepare for the health threats due to climate change...|$|E

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} {{have been}} proposed as a potential biopreservatives in pharmaceutical research and agribusiness. <b>However,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> hinder their utilization, such as their vulnerability to proteolytic digestion and their potential interaction with other food ingredients in complex food systems. One approach to overcome such problems is developing formulations entrapping and thereby protecting the antimicrobial peptides. Liposome encapsulation is a strategy that could be implemented to combine protection of the antimicrobial activity of the peptides from proteolytic enzymes and the controlled release of the encapsulated active ingredients. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop dual-coated food grade liposome formulations for oral administration of bacteriocins. The formulations were developed from anionic and cationic phospholipids as models of negatively and positively charged liposomes, respectively. Liposomes were prepared by the hydration of lipid films. Subsequently, the liposomes were coated with two layers comprising a biopolymer network (pectin) and whey proteins (WPI) in order to further improve their stability and enable the gradual release of the developed liposomes. Liposomes were characterized for their size, charge, molecular structure, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and release. The results of FTIR, zeta potential, size distribution, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the liposomes were efficiently coated. Ionic interactions were involved in the stabilization of the positively charged liposome formulations. Negatively charge liposome formulations were stabilized through weak interactions. The release study proved the efficiency of dual coating on the protection of liposomes against gastrointestinal digestion. This work is the first to study the encapsulation of antimicrobial peptides in dual-coated liposomes. Furthermore, the work successfully encapsulated MccJ 25 in both negative and positive liposome models...|$|E
40|$|During {{wellbore}} cementing, stray gas migration {{may occur}} when a pressure imbalance exists within the hydrating cement slurry, where the pore pressure {{is less than}} that of the surrounding formation gas pressure. A fluid column of hydrating cement slurry with appropriate density will provide sufficient hydrostatic pressure to prevent formation gas from invading and migrating through the cemented column. As cement hydration progresses, slurry behavior gradually shifts from that of a liquid to an impermeable solid. This transition is associated with a reduction in hydrostatic pressure, potentially leaving the annulus susceptible to the invasion and migration of untargeted formation gas. The current industry approach relies on measurements of static gel strength of the hydrating cement slurry to define the period of gas migration susceptibility, which is referred to as transition time. The transition time is minimized to reduce gas migration potential; <b>however,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> exist with this approach. In order to improve the understanding of gas migration susceptibility, a study was performed to accurately characterize hydrostatic pressure reduction within a cemented annulus using fundamental parameters, such as degree of hydration and capillary porosity. Laboratory tests were conducted using the University of Pittsburgh’s wellbore simulation chamber to simulate various depths of interest. By using fundamental parameters, microstructural development and cement material properties may be predicted at any time and depth along the wellbore and related to the occurrence of gas migration. This study shows that the development of hydration can be predicted {{as a function of the}} curing conditions, the mixture design, and the cement composition. Hydration can also be directly linked to strength and constitutive properties of the hydrating cement slurry...|$|E
30|$|In this work, a {{dithiocarbamate}} (DTC) resin {{prepared as}} a novel adsorbent {{for the removal}} of Co(II) from simulated wastewater was presented. DTC molecular group can strongly bind with various heavy metal ions and display high removal efficiency due to its strong tendency of sharing electrons between N, S elements and heavy metal ions (Bai et al. 2011). For example, Fan et al. (2014 a, b, c) prepared three different silica-supported ion-imprinted hybrid sorbents all functionalized with S, N-donor atoms for lead (II), cadmium (II) and lead (II) through the surface imprinting technique. The sorbents showed high adsorption for Pb(II) (54.9  mg g− 1), Cd(II) (29.1  mg g− 1) and Pb(II) (61.9  mg g− 1) within 30  min, respectively. In addition, Fan et al. (Fan et al. 2011) presented a Co(II)-imprinted silica gel sorbent with the same technique as mentioned above and the maximum adsorption capacities toward Co(II) was 35.2  mg g− 1 compared to 6.5  mg g− 1 which is the non-imprinted. Hence, micromolecular DTC is usually synthesized from carbon disulfide and amino compounds, including diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, ethylenediamine, diethylamine, etc., under an alkaline environment (Stathi et al. 2010; Jones et al. 1980; Shaaban et al. 2013; Horvath and Barnes 1986). <b>However,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> have also been found, such as being volatilizable, very expensive, not easily available, and toxic (Talebi et al. 2010; Ling et al. 2011). To tackle these problems, the DTC resin here was developed by grafting polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto chloromethylated polystyrene (CPS) beads (Gao et al. 2006) as the amino compound. To examine the adsorption capability, different simulated wastewater bodies with various Co(II) concentrations in the range of 40 – 320  mg L− 1 were tested. The maximum adsorption conditions of Co(II) have been identified {{and the nature of the}} adsorption process with respect to its kinetics and thermodynamic aspects were investigated.|$|E

40|$|Combining {{modes of}} vibration, such as {{longitudinal}} and torsional vibration, is advantageous in many ultrasonic {{applications such as}} ultrasonic drilling, welding, and motors. In this work we present a novel approach to the design a longitudinal-torsional (LT) ultrasonic horn which adapts the front mass in a traditional Langevin transducer. Different approaches, such as degeneration of longitudinal vibration and coupling between longitudinal (L) and torsional (T) modes, {{have been used to}} generate the LT mode of vibration. The degeneration approach creates a non-uniform section, by cutting and twisting a number of slots along the path of the L wave such that part of the wave converts into T wave whilst the remaining part propagates unchanged through the section; these two parts are recombined near the output surface to form LT vibration. The mode coupling approach uses two set of vibration generators, usually piezoelectric elements, where one set generates L vibration whilst the second set generates T vibration. An exponential cross-sectional horn uses to combine the two modes where the area reduction factor is selected such that these modes resonate at the same frequency. <b>However,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> prevent the wide usage of these methods in ultrasonic applications. These limitations are the complex design and excitation, possible coupling with surrounding modes, instability in operating at different boundaries, difficulty in securing the structure without influencing the vibrational response and the low produced torsionality, which is the ratio of torsional to longitudinal response at the output face. The new approach is based on combining the principles of these methods to overcome the previously stated limitations, the slotting technique is incorporated into the exponential cross-sectional path and the horn produced is utilised as the front mass of a Langevin transducer. A set of design and performance criteria are used to optimise the transducer and includes applicable design; methods of securing the transducer; and the excitation features of LT transducer such that it can operate without the effects of surrounding modes of vibration and can produce high response and torsionality at the output surface. A methodology which combines mathematical and experimental modelling is used to optimise LT transducer design. The mathematical modelling, which includes finite element (FE) and analytical methods, is performed to optimise the geometry and to predict electromechanical parameters, modal parameters and the dynamic behaviour of LT transducer. The experimental modelling is used to validate the mathematical results and to characterise the fabricated prototypes under different operating conditions. The dimensions of the initial design of the L mode Langevin transducer are derived from the principles of the wave equation. This transducer has a set of piezoceramic components sandwich between a cylindrical back mass and an exponential front mass connected by a pre-stressed bolt. The dimensions are used to create the FE model, using the FE software package ABAQUS, where different shapes of cut at different dimensions and at various angle of twist along the front mass are introduced and examined by a modal analysis procedure to the front mass. An optimised model is then utilised in a size scaling study to confirm the suitability of using this approach for different ultrasonic applications. The dimensions of the optimised design are also used in the analytical study, based on Mason’s electric equivalent circuit approach, to predict the electromechanical parameters where a one-dimensional equivalent circuit approach is created separately for each part whilst the combination vibrational motion in the front mass is represented by two, longitudinal and torsional, equivalent circuits. The complete equivalent network of the LT transducer is then solved using the mathematical software package MATHEMATICA. The analytical model is also extended to validate some of particular FE findings such as the distribution of the response amplitude and the location of the longitudinal nodal plane along the transducer’s structure. Two optimised models of different sizes are fabricated and characterised through different testing techniques including electrical impedance analysis, experimental modal analysis (EMA) and experimental harmonic analysis. Optimisation of the pre-stressing of the transducer is performed by applying different torques to the pre-stressed bolt and measuring the electrical impedance spectra where the results are compared to analytical findings. EMA is then used to describe the natural characteristics of the structures where the results are used to accurately extract the modal parameters and to validate the predictions of the FE and analytical model. Different levels of harmonic excitation are used to characterise the fabricated prototypes where the results are compared to the findings of the mathematical modelling. A case study of the design of the LT drill is presented to validate the design approach for real ultrasonic applications. A similar methodology is applied and the resulting LT drill is tested for both unloaded and loaded operating conditions. The results obtained show that this new approach can be easily and successfully applied to ultrasonic applications to produce a torsional to longitudinal amplitude response of 0. 8 which is measured on a fabricated prototype. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} {{physical}} aspects of high performance soccer. As such, four interrelated studies were designed to pursue this purpose. Each study was designed to overcome certain distinct methodological limitations of previous science and football (soccer) research and build upon existing research. The research designs {{for each of the four}} studies were methodologically different and progressed from previous research design incorporating data collected and analysed from text and internet sources, computerised video-analysis of interactive televised material and combined performance and laboratory assessments. In the following section the purpose of each study included in this thesis is provided and the rationale underpinning the selection of each research design is explained. Study 1 : Analysis of Age, Stature, Body Mass, BNH and Quality of Elite Soccer Players from four European Leagues For many sports, there are specific physical characteristics that indicate suitability for, or potential to compete in that sport at the highest level. Various anthropometric characteristics of athletes have been shown to be reasonable predictors for participation at the highest level in sports such as swimming (Ackland et al., 1993), basketball, rugby league and American football (Norton and Olds, 2000). Surprisingly, there is no research available exploring these characteristics in soccer, particularly within the elite European soccer. It might well be that the recent changes in demands in soccer(Williams et al., 1999) PhD Thesis 6 Jonathan R- Bloomfield have been accompanied by physical characteristic changes in soccer players that have been of greater magnitude than that of the normal population. This is an important issue because even small changes in these physical characteristics of players could result in a large reduction in the pool of people to draw from in the general population who have the suitable physical characteristics to be successful in soccer (Olds, 2001). Furthermore, the comparison of players in different leagues and in different positions might provide some valuable information regarding the different demands placed on soccer players in different leagues (Reilly et al, 2000 a; Rienzi et al, 2000; Strudwick et al., 2002). It is well documented that different positions in soccer constitute various different demands. Such findings suggest heterogeneity in physical characteristics that might be important for success in particular positions in soccer (Strudwick et al., 2002). The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether there are physical differences (age, stature, body mass, body mass index) between players in different positions in four European soccer leagues. This will also provide information into the diversity in playing style as well as the variation in what is being valued in soccer players in the various countries. This results in valuable information for the adaptation of different physical conditioning regimes as well as implications for talent identification (Fisher and Dean, 1998). The second aim of the present study was to assess the quality of the players of each of the four European leagues by surveying their international status, nationality and FIFA world ranking as well as participation in the FIFA World Cup 2002. This will offer information regarding the actual quality of international players within these leagues which, in turn, provides information about which league would be of the highest quality, differences in playing style and player selection. As the four leading European leagues were selected for analysis, the results provide beneficial information concerning the current status and possible future development of European soccer. Study 2 : The 'Bloomfield Movement Classification': Motion Analysis of Individual Soccer Players In close relation with the investigation of the physical characteristics of elite level players, it was also aimed to identify the physical demands of performance. Computerised video-analysis was selected as the most appropriate platform to incorporate a study using the time-motion analysis methodology. This involves the notation of various subjectively or objectively chosen modes of motion which are digitally timed throughout the performance. To date, fewer than 8 modes of motion have often been chosen in time-motion investigation in soccer which arguably does not provide a sufficient degree of specificity to detail the physical demands. A high element of performance specificity must be established to elicit a high degree of transfer from competition into a training regime to optimise competitive performance (Henry, 1968; Barnett et al., 1973; Sale and MacDougall, 1981; Rosenbaum, 1987; Morrissey et al., 1995; Hill et al., 1998). The present study outlined a new approach to time-motion analysis through a method involving a greater depth of detail concerning modes of timed-motion, as well as other non-timed movements, directions, intensities, turning and 'On the Ball' categories. The aim of this study was to present a new methodology and establish reliability. The purpose was to provide a new method to perform a more detailed time-motion analysis study in soccer performance to be used in the third study of this thesis. PhD Thesis 8 Jonathan R. Bloomfield Study 3 : Physical Demands of Outfield Positions in FA Premier League Soccer. To elicit an enhancement in soccer performance, it is considered important to analyse the physical demands of match-play (Reilly and Thomas, 1976; All and Farrally, 1991 a; Hughes, 2003). Time-motion analysis has been used to investigate these demands. <b>However,</b> <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> exist with previous research, one of which being the range of classifications used in the collection of data- A high degree of performance specificity is desired to improve coaching practices such as physical conditioning (Barnett et al., 1973). To this end, a new time-motion analysis methodology was designed (see Study 2) and aimed at providing a new level of specificity of performance into the physical demands of high level soccer. Also, the majority of soccer-related time-motion analyses have reported macroscopically with total frequency, total duration or total distance covered providing a summary of the overall physical requirements of soccer. As soccer match-play is essentially an intermittent exercise (Bangsbo, 1994 e), it is important to progress the knowledge of the physical nature of the sport and further provide a higher level of specific detail. The aims of the present study were to provide detail regarding intermittent patterns of Purposeful Movement (PM) and Recovery (R), performed by players of three different positions (defender, midfielder and striker), to investigate the reoccurrence of bouts of PM and R within selected time phases and finally provide time-motion analysis of the PM using the BMC. PhD Study 4 : Effective Conditioning for Soccer Match-Play The interaction of multiple dynamic physical activities often produces a hybrid of physiological and biomechanical stresses. Higher levels of soccer require increased levels of physical fitness through increased demands from high intensity activity (O'Donoghue et al., 2001; Strudwick and Reffly, 2001; Mohr et al., 2003). Therefore, increased ability to perform complex chains of movement skills (agility) in conjuncture with speed (both acceleration and deceleration) and quickness (overcoming inertia) are relative to high level performance (Withers et al., 1982; Bangsbo, 1992; Reilly, 1994 a). This occurs through processes of motor learning and physical conditioning with the rules of specificity and overload as key underlying principles.

40|$|Texturing using {{a set of}} two {{dimensional}} image maps is an established and widespread practice. <b>However,</b> it has <b>many</b> <b>limitations.</b> Parameterizing a model in texture space can be very difficult, particularly with representations such as implicit surfaces, subdivision surfaces, and very dense or detailed polygonal meshes. This paper proposes {{the use of a}} new kind of texture based on an octree, which needs no parameterization other than the surface itself, and yet has similar storage requirements to 2 D maps. In addition, it offers adaptive detail, regular sampling over the surface, and continuity across surface boundaries. The paper addresses texture creation, painting, storage, processing, and rendering with octree textures...|$|R
50|$|The {{developing}} {{theory of}} cultural districts increasingly conceives them as development models for local systems, where the term ‘district’ refers to supra-urban area. At supra-urban or regional level {{the complexity of}} a cultural district is even more marked than at urban level, due to potential interdependencies among a greater multitude of actors. A useful approach towards a deeper understanding can be to conceive cultural districts as complex adaptive systems. Indeed, complexity is definitely not a management fad and fashion, a mere metaphor or methodology, but a deeper perception of reality. Organizations are classically seen as purpose-driven entities with a structural form, exhibiting {{a certain degree of}} order and determinism. Such a linear top-down approach to analysis and design, <b>however,</b> exhibits <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> when used for organizational settings characterized by a complex web of interdependencies. The view of a cultural district as a complex adaptive system suggests new ideas and approaches for policy-makers, designers and managers. It also opens up debate on issues of organizational design and change.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because {{of their}} good {{multiplexing}} capabilities, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are being studied more actively {{than any of}} other fiber optic sensors. The application fields of FBG sensors have been mainly focused on composite materials through embedding rather than through surface attachments. <b>However,</b> there are <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> on the embedding of FBG sensors into composite materials because of the birefringence that is induced when FBG sensors are not embedded parallel to the reinforcing fibers. This study investigates the fabrication of FBG sensors that have various grating lengths, good multiplexing capabilities, better stability from birefringence, and ease in production. The signal characteristics of FBG sensors are also verified through the cure monitoring of two composite laminates...|$|R
40|$|Traditional library catalog {{systems have}} been {{effective}} in providing access to collections of books, films, and other material. <b>However,</b> they have <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> {{when it comes to}} finding musical information, which has significantly different, and in many ways more complex, structure. The Variations 2 search system is an alternative designed specifically to aid users in searching for music. It leverages a rich set of bibliographic data records, expressing relationships between creators of music and their creations. These records enable musicians to search for music using familiar terms and relationships, rather than trying to decipher the methods libraries typically use to organize musical items. This paper describes the design and implementation of the system that makes these searches possible. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of confrontation visual field testing was determined for 512 visual fields using automated static perimetry as the reference standard. The sensitivity of confrontation testing excluding patchy defects was 40 % for detecting anterior visual field defects, 68. 3 % for posterior defects, and 50 % for both anterior and posterior visual field defects combined. The sensitivity within each group varied {{depending on the}} type of visual field defect encountered. Confrontation testing had a high sensitivity (75 % to 100 %) for detecting altitudinal visual loss, central/centrocecal scotoma, and homonymous hemianopsia. Confrontation testing was fairly insensitive (20 % to 50 % sensitivity) for detecting arcuate scotoma and bitemporal hemianopsia. The specificity of confrontation testing was high at 93. 4 %. The high positive predictive value (72. 6 %) and negative predictive value (75. 7 %) would indicate that visual field defects identified during confrontation testing are often true visual field defects. <b>However,</b> the <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> of confrontation testing should be remembered, particularly its low sensitivity for detecting visual field loss associated with parasellar tumors, glaucoma, and compressive optic neuropathies...|$|R
50|$|Target {{recognition}} {{was done}} for years by playing the baseband signal to the operator. Listening to this signal, trained radar operators can identify various pieces {{of information about the}} illuminated target, such as the type of vehicle it is, the size of the target, and can potentially even distinguish biological targets. <b>However</b> there are <b>many</b> <b>limitations</b> to this approach. The operator must be trained for what each target will sound like, if the target is traveling at a high speed it may no longer be audible, and the human decision component makes the probability of error high. However, this idea of audibly representing the signal did provide a basis for automated classification of targets. Several classifications schemes that have been developed use features of the baseband signal that have been used in other audio applications such as speech recognition.|$|R
