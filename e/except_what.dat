5|$|The {{figure of}} Joan of Arc {{represents}} both a common {{person and a}} child that was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of Joan of Arc for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology <b>except</b> <b>what</b> was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the policy}} of the Christian {{authorities}} was generally to block such emigration. Consequently, this option was only practically doable for the wealthiest among those living near the southern coast, and even then with great difficulty. For example, in Sierra Bermeja, Granada in 1501, an option of exile was offered as an alternative to conversion only for those who paid a fee of ten gold doblas, which most citizens could not afford. In the same year, villagers of Turre and Teresa near Sierra Cabrera in Almeria fought the Christian militias with help from their North African rescuers at Mojácar while leaving the region. The people of Turre were defeated and the planned escape turned into a massacre; the people of Teresa got away but their properties, <b>except</b> <b>what</b> could fit into their small boats, were left behind and confiscated.|$|E
25|$|What {{remains in}} my memory of this day is the {{constant}} taking up of new positions, followed by constant orders to retire, terrible blocks on the roads, inability to find anyone anywhere; by exceeding good luck almost complete freedom from shelling, a complete absence of food of any kind <b>except</b> <b>what</b> could be picked up from abandoned dumps.|$|E

25|$|Chiang Kai-shek's forces pushed {{as far as}} Chinchow (Jinzhou) by November 26, 1945, {{meeting with}} little resistance.

The truce fell apart in June 1946 when full-scale war between CPC and KMT forces broke out on June 26. China then entered a state of civil war that lasted more than three years.|$|E

25|$|In the {{postface}} to the Kongzi Jiayu, {{its author}} describes the collection as discussions Confucius had with his disciples and others, recorded by his disciples.

500|$|According to Maxwell's papers, {{when news}} of the {{destruction}} of the sandstone slab reached Bengal, James Prinsep asked the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Colonel William John Butterworth, to secure any legible fragments that might still exist and to send them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum. Butterworth replied: [...] "The only remaining portion of the stone you mention, <b>except</b> <b>what</b> Colonel Low may have, I have found lying in the verandah of the Treasury at Singapore, where it was used as a seat by the Sepoys of the guard and persons in waiting to transact business. I lost no time in sending it to my house, but, alas! not before the inscription was nearly erased. Such as the fragment was then however – i.e., in 1843 – it is now; for I have preserved the stone with much care, and shall have much pleasure in sending it for your museum, having failed to establish one, as I hoped to have done, in Singapore." ...|$|E

[...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything <b>except</b> <b>what</b> you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul.

500|$|The {{previous}} {{husband of}} a British queen regnant, William of Orange, had become king, refusing {{to take a}} subordinate rank to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne {{as a means of}} building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife's authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew [...] "nothing <b>except</b> <b>what</b> the prince tells me", but it was an artifice. Husbands had a legal right to their wife's property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church's teachings for a man to be subject to his wife. George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. [...] "I am her Majesty's subject", he said, [...] "I shall do naught but what she commands me." [...] In the words of historian Anne Somerset, [...] "the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism." [...] Winston Churchill wrote that he [...] "was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured... He was neither clever nor learned—a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all the pleasures of the table. Charles's well-known verdict... does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character." ...|$|E

60|$|But first Captain Horn {{ordered a}} {{thorough}} investigation {{to be made of}} the surrounding country, and in an hour or two a place was found which he believed would answer very well for a camping-ground until assistance should arrive. This was on a little plateau {{about a quarter of a}} mile back from the ocean, and surrounded on three sides by precipices, and on the side toward the sea the ground sloped gradually downward. To this camping-ground all of the provisions and goods were carried, <b>excepting</b> <b>what</b> would be needed by the boating party.|$|R
60|$|With these dispositions of both parties, {{and fears}} and hopes of the event, the Parliament met upon the seventh of December, one {{thousand}} seven hundred and eleven.
