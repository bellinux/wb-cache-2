5000|$|Total Factor Productivity (TFP), the <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of both {{labor and}} capital, is {{important}} because labor income depends on labor productivity growth. This growth is the average product of labor which correlates with labor’s contribution to enterprise revenue and profits. Improvements in workers’ real wages and earnings is related to labor productivity growth and not exactly to employment growth. Improvements in real wages, improves the poverty incidence of the people thus helping in poverty reduction. Canlas, Aldaba Esguerra argues that policymakers should have {{a good understanding of}} the sources of TFP because sustainable growth comes from rising TFP growth."One key factor is educated labor, which has the capacity to invent, innovate, and master new techniques." [...] At the long run, it is important to educate the population and invest in human development and research and development to improve TFP. But there should be care in this issue as there is the so-called job mismatch which will be discussed later. Canlas, Aldaba, Esguerra advise that to raise TFP growth, monetary policy and fiscal policy should stabilize a predictable environment for the private sector.|$|E

40|$|Low {{availability}} of phosphorus (P) {{is a major}} constraint to legume production, and efforts are being made to identify legume genotypes with tolerance to low P and greater P use efficiency (PUE). Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) genotypes vary in their adaptation to low-P soils. In order to investigate to what extent this variation {{may be related to}} PUE for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF), five genotypes, Adrar, El Kala, Djenet, Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia, were grown in semihydroponic culture with sufficient versus deficient P supply. At the flowering stage, the biomass of plants and nodules and their P contents was determined after measuring the quantity of N 2 fixed. The results showed that nodule and shoot biomass were less when P was deficient. The genotypes that presented the maximum growth during the experiment presented a high <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of the rhizobial symbiosis calculated as the slope of plant biomass regression as a function of nodulation. Under P-deficiency, <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of P for SNF was significantly increased in the genotypes El Kala, Djenet and Adrar and accompanied with an increase of the <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of the rhizobial symbiosis. Hence the large differences show that traits for more P uptake-efficient plants exist in the tested cowpea genotypes. This opens the possibility to breed for more P uptakeefficient varieties as a way to bring more sparingly soluble soil P into cycling in crop production and obtain capitalisation of soil P reserves...|$|E
40|$|Legumes {{have the}} {{capacity}} to fix large amounts of atmospheric N 2 into the biosphere through their symbiosis with soil rhizobia. However this legume contribution to the N bio-geochemical cycle varies with the nodulated-root rhizospheric environment, in particular phosphorus availability. In order to assess the environmental constrains that might limit this symbiosis, a nodular diagnosis was performed in field-sites chosen with farmers of the Mediterranean basin, with common bean as a model grain-legume, and a major source of plant proteins for world human nutrition. The engineering of the legume symbiosis is addressed by participatory assessment of bean recombinant inbred lines contrasting for their <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of phosphorus for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Withthis methodology, a large spatial and temporal variation in nodulation and in the <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of the rhizobial symbiosis for plant growth, with a positive effect of the later on soil P-bioavailability. Soil P availability was a major limiting factor of the rhizobial symbiosis.

40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the world's {{high-grade}} natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to deplete these natural uranium resources rapidly. The present paper considers different strategies of uranium <b>use</b> involving, <b>in</b> addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced Converter Reactors (ACR) with an extremely high <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>using</b> natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only depleted natural uranium (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated. Given such an endowment, the breeder output can be increased on the basis of self-generated plutonium. Although the <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>using</b> natural uranium is less in advanced converter reactors, their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts <b>used</b> up <b>in</b> burners. Such considerations of a more efficient future uranium use by deploying advanced reactors in addition to burner reactors are based on a hypothetical trajectory of a total installed nuclear capacity increasing to 10 TW(e) by the year 2030.
