40|$|With {{the vast}} {{majority}} of university students carrying smartphones, more pieces of technology should take advantage of its availability. Currently, most lock and key systems are outdated and primitive. Our team is proposing a solution to this problem that makes use of the technology that we all carry in our pockets daily. Our solution, DigiKey, will improve security and ease of use along with adding on additional features to the current system with the use of smartphones as <b>digital</b> <b>keys.</b> DigiKey will utilize a database of <b>digital</b> <b>keys</b> that can be used from a smartphone to unlock a DigiKey lock over a bluetooth connection...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea is that}} a <b>digital</b> <b>key</b> to decrypt {{and recover}} {{sensitive}} or personal data should have long-term durability and not be stored on any computer or network.

A certification authority is a trusted third party that can issue public and private keys, thus certifying public keys. It also works as a depository to store key chain and enforce the trust factor.|$|E

The cruise control driver assist is able to recognize speed limits and will adjust the vehicle's speed accordingly. The lane driving assist warns the driver of possible side or rear collisions.

40|$|OCIS codes: 250. 0250, 060. 0060, 140. 0140, 190. 0190) We {{consider}} an electro-optic phase chaos system with two feedback loops organized {{in a parallel}} conﬁguration such that the dynamics {{of one of the}} loops remains internal. We show that this conﬁguration intrinsically conceals in the transmitted variable the internal delay times, which are critical for decoding. The scheme also allows for the inclusion, in a very efﬁcient way, of a <b>digital</b> <b>key</b> generated as a long pseudorandom binary sequence. A single <b>digital</b> <b>key</b> can operate both in the internal and transmitted variables leading to a large sensitivity of the synchronization to a key-mismatch. The combination of intrinsic delay time concealment and <b>digital</b> <b>key</b> selectivity provides the basis for a large enhancement of the conﬁdentiality in chaos-based communications. © 2012 OSAThe authors thank L.

40|$|Entity {{authentication}} becomes ubiquitously {{necessary in}} pervasive computing environments. We provide taxonomy of entity authentication between keys and locks. Based on the discussion, we propose a novel authentication approach for pervasive computing environments. A person uses a single device, the Master Key, which aggregates all his <b>digital</b> <b>keys</b> for entity authentication. The Master Key initiates authentication and selects proper keys by exchanging code words with locks. With {{an emphasis on}} usability, the Master Key secures authentication, keeps authentication private, and supports various key-lock interactions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a technique to}} reliably and securely identify individual integrated circuits (ICs) based on the precise measurement of circuit delays and a simple challenge–response protocol. This technique {{could be used to}} produce key-cards that are more difficult to clone than ones involving <b>digital</b> <b>keys</b> on the IC. We consider potential venues of attack against our system, and present candidate implementations. Experiments on Field Programmable Gate Arrays show that the technique is viable, but that our current implementations could require some strengthening before it can be considered as secure.
