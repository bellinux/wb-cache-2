So we made the shooting aspects more frenzied in order to really wake the player up.

After Johnson had completed the recordings Stevo began dealing with both Decca and CBS for a record deal. The deal famously went to CBS with a bizarre contract signing in Trafalgar Square.|$|E

The film-maker Mat Snead has said of the film: [...] "I think what I {{wanted to do was to}} try and take Wilfredo off stage and almost push the absurdity of it by showing him in a real world environment. Wilfredo really does exist on stage, so what I was trying to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> him off stage and get him into some different environments and do some things that you can’t do on stage.
