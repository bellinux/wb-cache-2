60|$|Jim saw Nell {{lying on}} the bed. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> and her long, dark lashes seemed black against the marble paleness of her skin.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> and {{she paid}} no heed: but the appeal was once more whispered--this time more insistently, and almost {{against her will}} she murmured: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped short}} {{and hurried to}} her side, alarmed at her appearance. Her cheeks, even her lips, were ashen pale and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> She had fainted in her chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closing,</b> heavy-lidded, and {{she lifted}} sweet, tremulous, waiting lips.|$|R
60|$|That brought <b>her</b> back. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closing,</b> {{but they}} opened again.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A 10th-century Yogini statue from Tamil Nadu, India. She {{is seated}} in an asana, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> in meditative state.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> now. She spoke {{no longer}} to me but to herself. She whispered other vague things, little sentences, ghosts of long dead moments. [...] . Her words grew less distinct.|$|E
60|$|She {{was leaning}} back in the {{carriage}} and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> but she felt that firm fingers removed the irons from her wrists, and that a pair of warm lips were pressed there in their stead.|$|E
6000|$|She caressed my hand, {{but did not}} speak; {{and when}} I looked up, her worn face had dropped on the pillow, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> [...] "I am tired--tired," [...] she murmured. [...] "Stay with me a little longer, but leave me if I sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looks like}} a young maiden, since her brow [...] Is smooth and fair, Her cheeks <b>are</b> very smooth, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> [...] She sleeps a rare Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.|$|R
6000|$|Although {{she made}} no complaint, he {{instantly}} saw that Emily was overcome by the heat. Her lips <b>were</b> white, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closing.</b> [...] "Let me take you out," [...] he said, [...] "or you will faint." ...|$|R

The {{side of the}} church is painted with words that read "Lighthouse Christian Fellowship". One of the women is facing the camera and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and she <b>is</b> smiling. She is wearing a large head scarf...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night," [...] said Willie; [...] "good-night, Jim." [...] Jim replied good-night heartily, {{and then}} Willie {{stepped into the}} dark passage. He {{glanced back at the}} fairy before {{shutting}} the door, but <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> so he said good-night to her in his heart, and went home.|$|E
60|$|Very quietly he {{rose and}} climbed over the low {{partition}} which separated his compartment from that in which the woman was. She was seated in the corner, her head leaning back, so that the feeble light from the lamp fell on it, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> She was asleep.|$|E
60|$|With sad hearts we {{came back}} to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an {{appearance}} of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death. For {{a second or two}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> as if she were in secret prayer.|$|E
6000|$|... '"I see an {{old woman}} lying on a bed. She has a black dress, and on her head is a little white cap. She has a {{wrinkled}} face and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed.</b> There <b>is</b> a band tied round her chin. The bed is {{in a sort of}} hole, in the wall, and there are shutters to it." ...|$|R
50|$|The 3.5 metre tall bronze {{sculpture}} {{was made}} in 2002 and depicts a huge fat woman from the west, sitting {{on the shoulders of}} a starved African boy. The woman is holding a pair of scales as a symbol of justice, but <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> to show that justice is degenerating into self-righteousness and unwillingness to see the obvious injustice.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Blows paid no heed; {{her face}} was white and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> Her husband, with a dawning {{perception}} {{of the state of}} affairs, drew a mug of water from the tap and flung it over her. She opened her eyes and gave a faint scream, and then, scrambling to her feet, tottered toward him and sobbed on his breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are only}} {{upsetting}} yourself," [...] said Peter Ivanovitch, patiently {{but in a}} firm tone. This admonition had its usual effect on the Egeria. She dropped her thick, discoloured eyelids and changed her position on the sofa. All her angular and lifeless movements seemed completely automatic now that <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> Presently she opened them very full. Peter Ivanovitch drank tea steadily, without haste.|$|E
60|$|They did not move. Her {{head had}} fallen on his shoulder. She was to give it but a moment, and then----But the moment had passed and still her hair pressed his cheek. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> He seemed to have found the way to woo her. Neither of them spoke. Suddenly they jumped apart. Lady Pippinworth stole to the door. They held their breath and listened.|$|E

A hand from outside the frame is pressed against her forehead. Behind her a woman has her head in her hands, and two other stand with their arms in the air, eyes closed...|$|R
60|$|Lady Lundie's own maid {{opened the}} door noiselessly, and stole on tip-toe to the bedside. <b>Her</b> ladyship's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> <b>Her</b> ladyship {{suddenly}} opened them.|$|R
60|$|Gerald {{shook his}} head, {{and the woman}} did not pursue the subject. Only once <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> half <b>closed</b> and <b>her</b> words drifted across the room.|$|R
6000|$|Resting on the parapet; {{toward the}} great view, {{she was silent}} a little, {{and he saw the}} next moment that <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> [...] "I go but by one thing." [...] Her hand was on the sun-warmed stone; so that, turned as they were away from the house, he put his own upon it and covered it. [...] "I go by YOU," [...] she said. [...] "I go by you." ...|$|E
60|$|Kennicott {{had always}} seemed out of place there but Erik {{surprisingly}} harmonized {{with the spirit of}} the room as he stroked the books, glanced at the prints. He held out his hands. He came toward her. She was weak, betrayed to a warm softness. Her head was tilted back. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed.</b> Her thoughts were formless but many-colored. She felt his kiss, diffident and reverent, on her eyelid.|$|E
6000|$|At length [...] "Wilbur" [...] said: [...] "Good-night." [...] I rose, and Miller, eagerly, expectantly, {{turned the}} light slowly on. Mrs. Smiley sat {{precisely}} {{as we had}} last seen her. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> her head leaning {{against the back of}} her chair. Her hands were fastened exactly as we had left them, and, strangest thing of all, the table was pushed away from her so that the silk threads were tight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dat's all right; Josefina and me no want pay--we glad {{to do for}} you," [...] {{answered}} Carlos; and Josefina smiled so broadly that <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> fairly <b>closed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss Spence {{lay back}} in her chair without speaking. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> still <b>closed.</b> Mr. Hutton stroked his moustache. The silence {{prolonged}} itself for what seemed a very long time.|$|R
50|$|Punae/Bune (the concubine): Punae is {{a forward}} and sexual character, {{appearing}} in the plays as the concubine of either the scholar or the aristocrat. The mask is symmetrical and made of one solid piece of wood. She has a very small mouth with red rouged lips, cheeks and forehead. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> {{and she has a}} general look of happiness and good-humor. The mask is constructed with black hair painted on {{the top of her head}} and 2 cords/strings hanging from the sides of the mask.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> her net was off, and all {{the pretty}} black curls lay about her {{shoulders}} as one hand idly pulled them out, while the other rested on the red shawl, as if she loved its glowing color and soft texture. She was humming to herself the little song of the dove and the donjon, and something in the plaintive voice, the solitary figure, went straight to Merry's gentle heart.|$|E
60|$|Sick {{with horror}} Leonard drew himself {{back into a}} sitting posture, and glanced up at Juanna. She was {{crouched}} in her ivory chair overcome, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> either through faintness or to shut out the sight of dread. Then {{he looked down at}} Otter. The dwarf, staring fixedly at the water, sat still as the stone effigy that supported him. Evidently in all his varied experience he had seen no such thing as this.|$|E
60|$|The door of it {{was also}} of iron. He opened it and passed within, and there saw two great tables or blocks of {{polished}} marble. Upon one was the dagger and a goblet of gold brimming with water. Upon the other lay {{the figure of a}} woman, and as Gebhart looked at her he thought her more beautiful than any thought or dream could picture. But <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> and she lay like a lifeless figure of wax.|$|E
60|$|So long {{as women}} sit up of nights {{listening}} for a footstep, will they flatten their faces at the window, though all without be black. Jean {{had not been}} {{back in the kitchen}} for two minutes before she raised the blind. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to the glass, when she saw another face almost meet hers, as you may touch your reflection in a mirror. But this face was not her own. It was white and sad. Jean suppressed a cry, and let the blind fall, as if shutting the lid on some uncanny thing.|$|R

Around her neck hangs a light leather or cloth bib or apron with tassles (the chief's insignia of office), covering her right leg.
