Health effects on intelligence {{have been described}} as being among the most important factors in the origins of human <b>group</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> IQ test scores and other measures of cognitive ability. Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood–brain barrier of the child is less effective. Such impairment may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the link}} between a disease and an unusual gene variant is more subtle. The genetic {{architecture}} of common diseases {{is an important factor}} in determining the extent to which patterns of genetic variation influence <b>group</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> health outcomes. According to the common disease/common variant hypothesis, common variants present in the ancestral population before the dispersal of modern humans from Africa play an important role in human diseases. Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer disease, deep venous thrombosis, Crohn disease, and type 2 diabetes appear to adhere to this model. However, the generality of the model has not yet been established and, in some cases, is in doubt. Some diseases, such as many common cancers, appear not to be well described by the common disease/common variant model.|$|E
2500|$|The 1996 Task Force {{investigation}} on Intelligence {{sponsored by the}} American Psychological Association concluded that there are significant variations in IQ across races. The problem of determining the causes underlying this variation relates {{to the question of}} the contributions of [...] "nature and nurture" [...] to IQ. Psychologists such as Alan S. Kaufman and Nathan Brody and statisticians such as Bernie Devlin argue that there are insufficient data to conclude that this is because of genetic influences. A review article published in 2012 by leading scholars on human intelligence concluded, after reviewing the prior research literature, that <b>group</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> IQ are best understood as environmental in origin.|$|E

40|$|Net Gain Analysis (NGA) is {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to Responders Analysis (RA) as a more comprehensive method to tap clinical relevance of the effect of treatment. NGA is the <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> responders minus the <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> deteriorators; while RA is the <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> responders. We examined the performance of these two methods in a dataset consisting of individual patient data from 10 randomized controlled trials (N = 2666) of five different antipsychotics in patients with acute mania by comparing the rank ordering of the five compounds according to both systems (NGA and RA). The rank order did not differ between the 2 systems but the inferiority of one compound was revealed more evidently by the NGA in comparison to the RA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

2500|$|As Buchanan commented:Harder {{to brush}} off was the {{impression}} that Eysenck [...] was insensitive, even willfully blind to the way his work played out in a wider political context. He {{did not want to}} believe, {{almost to the point of}} utter refusal, that his work gave succor to right-wing racialist groups. But there is little doubt that Jensen and Eysenck helped revive the confidence of these groups. [...] It was unexpected vindication from a respectable scientific quarter. The cautionary language of Eysenck's interpretation of the evidence made little difference. To the racialist right, a genetic basis for <b>group</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> intelligence bore out racialist claims of inherent, immutable hierarchy.Buchanan exemplifies Eysenck's cautionary approach with a number of concrete examples from Eysenck's writings, and concludes that:If the appropriation of his work by right-wing groups brought him baggage that would be hard to shake off, how then did he construe his relationship with them? Eysenck was a scientist who believed that good research would eventually help temper social wrongs and excesses. The trouble was that the empirical science was clearly taken to be part of the problem as well as the solution. Its very impartiality was itself held up to question. The lack of consensus on the technical issues fed open-ended arguments about truth, social justice, and how we should live. Thus the controversy ran on and on.Eysenck's defence was that ultimately he did not shy away from publishing or being interviewed in controversial publications, and that he did not necessarily share their editorial viewpoint. Buchanan suggests that this may have been true in general, with an Eysenck interview appearing in Mayfair and several articles by Eysenck being published in Penthouse. In his autobiography, Eysenck answered his critics with: [...] "It is odd, and indeed paradoxical, that my most determined opponents should have been people with whose aims I completely agreed." [...] Regarding the equality of people, Eysenck wrote: The major argument in modern times is between those who define equality in terms of social status, and those who define it in terms of equality of biological inheritance. Equality of social status has always been a socialist idea, and it is certainly possible to argue about its desirability, or the possibility of achieving it. Equality of biological abilities and traits is a chimera which no thinking person should entertain for one moment. Eysenck stated his own views in the Introduction to Race, Education and Intelligence: he reader is consequently entitled to ask in which direction the writer's own political and social beliefs and attitudes go. [...] My recognition of the importance of the racial problem, and my own attitudes of opposition to any kind of racial segregation, and hatred for those who suppress any sector of the community on grounds of race (or sex or religion) were determined in part by the fact that I grew up in Germany, at a time when Hitlerism was becoming the very widely held doctrine which finally prevailed and led to the deaths of several million Jews whose only crime was that they belonged to an imaginary [...] "race" [...] which had been dreamed up by a group of men in whom insanity was mixed in equal parts with craftiness, paranoia with guile, and villainy with sadism.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effect on worry of biased attentional engagement and disengagement. Variants of a novel attention modification paradigm were developed, designed to induce a <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> either <b>in</b> participants’ tendency to selectively engage with, or disengage from, threatening meanings. An index of threat bias, reflecting relative speeding to process threat word compared to non-threat word content, confirmed that both procedures were effective in inducing differential attentional bias. Importantly, when the induced <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> attentional bias followed the procedure designed to influence selective engagement with threat meanings, it also {{gave rise to a}} corresponding <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> worry. This was not the case when it was induced by the procedure designed to influence selective disengagement from threat meanings. These findings suggest that facilitated attentional engagement with threat meanings may causally contribute to variability in worry...|$|R
40|$|Academics {{examined}} correlation scatter {{plots and}} made judgments of group bias. Half {{of the subjects}} judged bias in salaries from graphs that showed salaries plotted against merit with a separate correlation ellipse for each of two groups. The others judged test bias from graphs that showed job performance vs test scores. Relative positions of the centroids {{for the two groups}} and the within-group correlation were systematically varied. Judgments of bias were not consistent with either “forward ” or “reverse ” regression definitions of bias. Judged bias is not a monotonic function of the <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> salary between persons of equal merit nor is it a monotonic function of the <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> merit between persons of equal salary. Instead, judgments in both tasks were consistent with a difference of differences model; for example, when the <b>group</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> standard deviation units is equal on both salary and merit, judges say the situation is unbiased. The results are consistent with a one-mediator model of group equity, which assumes that both measures are imperfectly and equally correlated with the mediator. o 198...|$|R
