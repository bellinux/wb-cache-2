30|$|The {{method for}} {{controlling}} [CO 2] {{in an open}} field is described by Nakamura et al. ([2012]). In brief, four blocks (replicates) were established in paddy fields, each consisting of two octagonal plots (240  m 2, 17  m across): an ambient [CO 2] (AMB) plot and an E-[CO 2] (FACE) treatment plot. The FACE plots were equipped with <b>emission</b> <b>tubes</b> around the perimeter, which released CO 2 from the windward side to keep the [CO 2] measured at the central point at ca. 200  μmol mol− 1 above the AMB level. The season-long daytime average [CO 2] in 2012 was 392  μmol mol− 1 in the AMB plots and 577  μmol mol− 1 in the FACE plots.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, the {{automotive}} sector presents large interest for light alloys tubes for structural and body car parts to reduce CO 2 <b>emissions.</b> <b>Tubes</b> hydroforming {{is one of the}} most popular processes to obtain complex parts by using liquids as active part of the dies (i. e. water- or oil-based emulsions) with reduced costs of equipment and machines. However, when elevated temperatures should be used to increase the material formability, hydroforming processes are strongly limited due to the boiling point of liquids. The use of gas at elevated temperature in the so- called Hot Metal Gas Forming process (HMGF) has shown promising capabilities thanks to the increased formability and the possibility to form parts with lower pressures. The paper focuses on a novel experimental set-up to evaluate the tubes formability at high temperatures. Tubes are heated by electric current and air in pressure is used to form the material. Aluminium alloy AA 6060 tubes specimens were used to test the experimental equipment and evaluate temperature and pressure ranges able to shape the material...|$|R
40|$|Control {{methods for}} the field {{emission}} x-ray spectra and their applications to biomedical imaging are described. The x-ray source used for this research was a single shot type and consisted of the following essential components : a high voltage generator, a simple low impedance pulser with a coaxial oil condenser of 0. 2 µf- 100 kV, an impulse switching system utilizing a light communication device, and two types of field <b>emission</b> <b>tubes.</b> The tubes were of the diode type and were connected to a turbo molecular pump which allowed operation at pressures of approximately less than 1 x 10 - 3 Pa. The maximum intensity was about 30 C/kg at lm/pulse, and the exposure time was about 1 µs. The bremsstrahlung spectra from this source were determined by means of intensity attenuation analysis using {{a new type of}} spectrum function (derived by the authors) closely fitting the field emission spectrum distribution. The peak intensity and the energy latitude of the spectra could be controlled. Various kinds of high speed radiography, (e. g., single shot dual energy subtraction radiography, and three dimensional image analysis) were accomplished by controlling the spectrum distribution...|$|R

50|$|If a poor gas {{quencher}} {{is introduced}} to the tube, the positive argon ions, during their motion toward the cathode, would have multiple collisions with the quencher gas molecules and transfer their charge and some energy to them. Thus, neutral argon atoms would be produced and the quencher gas ions in their turn would reach the cathode, gain electrons therefrom, and move into excited states which would decay by photon <b>emission,</b> producing <b>tube</b> discharge. However, effective quencher molecules, when excited, lose their energy not by photon emission, but by dissociation into neutral quencher molecules. No spurious pulses are thus produced.|$|R
40|$|The {{site for}} bud {{selection}} and germ <b>tube</b> <b>emission</b> in two yeasts, Candida albicans and Yarrowia lipolytica, was analysed. Both dimorphic organisms display different patterns of budding, which also {{differ from those}} described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. C. albicans, which is diploid and (until now) lacks a known sexual cycle, buds in an axial budding pattern. During the yeast-hypha transition induced by pH, serum, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or temperature, germ tube emergence occurs at approximately 50 % in a polar manner, while the other 50 % of cells show non-polar germ <b>tube</b> <b>emission.</b> Y. lipolytica, in {{which most of the}} natural isolates are haploid and which has a well characterized sexual cycle, buds with a polar budding pattern independently of the degree of ploidy. Germ <b>tube</b> <b>emission</b> during the yeast-hypha transition in both haploid and diploid cells generally occurs at the pole distal from the division site (bipolar). The addition of hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, also produces different effects. In its presence, and therefore in the absence of DNA synthesis, the yeast-hypha transition is completely abolished in Y. lipolytica. By contrast, in C. albicans germ <b>tube</b> <b>emission</b> in the presence of HU is similar to that observed in control cultures for at least 90 min under induction conditions. These results demonstrate that, rather than a single developmental model, several models of development should be invoked to account for the processes involved in the morphological switch in yeasts (the yeast-hypha transition).

Compressed air (19.5  mL/min) was sparged through a temperature-controlled oven (50  °C) holding a calibrated ethanol permeation <b>tube</b> (<b>emission</b> rate 209  ng/min at 50  °C). Mass flow controllers were used to control medical grade compressed air flowing through the permeation tube and a second dilution stream, introduced after the permeation tube, to produce concentrations of 101, 199, 484 and 924  ppb of ethanol based on the calibrated permeation <b>tube</b> <b>emission</b> rate.

The temperature of the permeation tube was then increased to 80  °C to produce ethanol concentrations comparable to those observed in the fungal experiment (1.2 – 6.2  ppm). The humidity of the air was varied by utilizing a hydration flask before the dilution. Humidity was monitored via the ratio of the H 3 O+(H 2 O) to H 3 O+ ion intensities with calibration experiments performed under conditions that closely matched the humidity in the fungal experiments. At low humidity, the sensitivity factor had a relatively constant value of approximately 4.0.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of Cerenkov emission, luminescence, secondary electron emission, and bremsstrahlung to radiation-induced data current and noise of multiplier phototubes were analyzed quantitatively. Fluorescence and Cerenkov <b>emission</b> in the <b>tube</b> window {{are the major}} contributors and can quantitatively account for dark count levels observed in orbit. Radiation-induced noise can be minimized by shielding, tube selection, and mode of operation. Optical decoupling of windows and cathode (side-window tubes) leads to further reduction of radiation-induced dark counts, as does reducing the window thickness and effective cathode area, and selection of window/cathode combinations of low fluorescence efficiency. In trapped radiation-free regions of near-earth orbits and in free space, Cerenkov emission by relativistic particles contributes predominantly to the photoelectron yield per event. Operating multiplier phototubes in the photon (pulse) counting mode will discriminate against these large pulses and substantially reduce the dark count and noise to levels determined by fluorescence...|$|R

Important uncertainties exist in the values of the thousands of parameters included in the most advanced kinetic models. This talk discusses the application of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods to the analysis of shock tube data as well as the design of shock tube experiments. Attention is focused on a spectral framework in which uncertain inputs are parameterized in terms of canonical random variables, and quantities of interest (QoIs) are expressed in terms of a mean-square convergent series of orthogonal polynomials acting on these variables. We outline the implementation of a recent spectral collocation approach for determining the unknown coefficients of the expansion, namely using a sparse, adaptive pseudo-spectral construction that enables us to obtain surrogates for the QoIs accurately and efficiently. We first discuss the utility of the resulting expressions in quantifying the sensitivity of QoIs to uncertain inputs, and in the Bayesian inference key physical parameters from experimental measurements.
