40|$|An ELISA {{method was}} {{developed}} for the measurement of toxoplasma IgG antibodies in human serum using antigen-coated polystyrene beads as a solid phase and anti human IgG-horse radish peroxidase conjugate as an enzymatic tracer. In order to assess ELISA sensitivity and specificity, a between methods comparison was made using 'conventional' serological tests as reference (dye-test, crossover-linked immunoassay, passive <b>haemagglutination,</b> <b>indirect</b> immunofluorescence). From {{an analysis of the}} group classifications obtained some considerations emerged: the ELISA specificity looks comparable with that of the 'reference' tests, as no sample classified as negative by all these tests was ELISA-positive, and vice versa; ELISA appears to correlate better with haemagglutination and immunofluorescence, {{on the basis of the}} respective class frequencies; in particular, the number of positives, which is much lower for the dye-test and crossover-linked immunoassay, suggests that a higher sensitivity is reached in the former cases...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} {{pilot study}} showed a high frequency of anti-smooth muscle autoantibody in Omani blood donors and pregnant women. We conducted this larger-scale study {{to investigate the}} frequency and significance of several autoantibodies in healthy individuals from different regions of Oman. METHODS: Sera obtained from 1537 healthy Omanis (1153 males and 384 females), {{ranging in age from}} 18 to 57 years, were tested for the presence of ten different autoantibodies using <b>indirect</b> immunofluorescence, <b>haemagglutination</b> and latex agglutination techniques. RESULTS: Low levels of autoantibodies were detected in 33. 5 &#x 0025;, whereas a few individuals (1. 8 &#x 0025;) showed high autoantibody titres. Anti-smooth muscle autoantibodies (ASMA) were the most prevalent (11 &#x 0025;). Anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) were the second most prevalent (7. 6 &#x 0025;). Anti-thyroid microsomal autoantibodies (ATMA) and anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies (ATA) were present in 6. 5 &#x 0025; and 4. 4 &#x 0025; of individuals, respectively. The other autoantibodies were detected much less frequently: anti-parietal cells autoantibodies (APCA) were found in 1. 6 &#x 0025;, anti-brush border antibodies (ABBA) in 1. 3 &#x 0025;, anti-reticulin autoantibodies (ARA) in 1 &#x 0025;, antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in 0. 8 &#x 0025;, antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (AGBMA) in 0. 7 &#x 0025; and rheumatoid factor (RF) in 0. 4 &#x 0025;. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that autoantibodies are present in healthy Omani individuals, and therefore caution should be taken when interpreting laboratory results of patients suspected of having autoimmune disease...|$|R
5000|$|In humans, P. skrjabini infections {{can result}} {{in a wide variety of}} symptoms, {{rendering}} it difficult to diagnose and challenging to quickly enact proper treatment. [...] Diagnosis typically requires first a general recognition of the symptoms followed by laboratory and radiologic tests. [...] Radiology, for example, can pick up on P. skrjabini's migration to ectopic places like the brain. [...] Serological or immunological tests including intradermal test, immunodiffusion, <b>indirect</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot also play a key role in not only diagnosing the overall presence of Paragonimus parasites in the body but also distinguishing the various different species invading. [...] The ELISA test detects the antibody used to combat the P. skrjabini infection. [...] Although cases of P. skrjabini infection can exhibit early symptoms such as abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, and high fever, it can also come on slowly and fail to exhibit identifiable symptoms for a period of latency between 20 days to as long as 3 months. [...] Later on in the infection, the type of symptoms that appear primarily depends on which organs the P. skrjabini parasites enter. [...] Infections and the resulting set of symptoms can be classified under five different types including the subcutaneous mass type, cerebral type, pericarditis type, abdominal type, and pleurisy type. [...] Infections of the pleurisy type, for instance, exhibit symptoms like chest pain and cough while the cerebral type tends to result in vomiting and headaches. [...] The pericarditis type is associated with shortness of breath and palpitation while the abdominal type infections lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. [...] P. skrjabini has shown no effect on mammalian reproductive abilities. [...] Despite occasional cases resulting in death, P. skrjabini has not been widely known to cause morbidity and death. [...] Surgery may be occasionally necessary for patients with cerebal or pleural paragonimiasis.|$|E

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} seroimmunological {{investigation of}} malaria was performed {{as part of}} the WHO research project conducted {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria from 1970 to 1975. The project included a preintervention phase, an intervention phase with application of malaria control measures (spraying of residual insecticide and mass drug administration), and a postintervention phase. Serological observations were made on the total population of eight villages consisting of approximately 3000 persons. Six immunological parameters were studied, namely, the serum levels of IgG and IgM, the number of bands of precipitation for Plasmodium falciparum in the double diffusion (Ouchterlony) test, the titres of antibodies for P. falciparum and P. malariae in the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, and the titres of agglutinating antibodies for P. falciparum by the <b>indirect</b> (passive) <b>haemagglutination</b> (IHA) test. The serological results were used to evaluate the impact on the humoral immune response of different levels of parasitaemia resulting, in the unprotected population, from natural factors such as seasons and ageing and in the protected population, from human intervention through the application of control measures and their interruption. The linkage by computer processing of the longitudinal data allowed analysis of the relationship between the results of a serological test in the same person at different surveys, and analysis of correlation between serological results and the concurrent parasitological findings. The correlation between parasitaemia and the results of the different serological tests at the same survey in the same person were also examined and analysed in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the tests...|$|R
40|$|Minor {{reactions}} to streptokinase are not uncommon, although the etiology is unknown. It is widely presumed, however, that these, like {{the more serious}} immune reactions, are antibody-mediated. We measured specific anti-streptokinase IgG, subclasses IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 3, IgG 4 and IgE by ELISAs, <b>haemagglutination,</b> <b>indirect</b> Coombs' test and immunoblotting in six patients who developed {{reactions to}} streptokinase. Evidence of complement activation by streptokinase was sought by a haemolytic complement assay and by measurement of C 3, C 4 and C 3 d. The patients who reacted to streptokinase presented with low titres of anti-streptokinase IgG (median = 5; range 0 - 32) and IgG 1 (median = 3; range 0 - 14). No evidence of any other IgG subclass was found, nor of specific anti-streptokinase IgE. Anti-streptokinase IgG 1 was found to fix complement; patients who reacted to streptokinase {{were found to have}} low levels of total complement 1 year post reaction. Probable aggregates and fragments of human albumin (added stabilizer) were found in the streptokinase preparation and proved to be antigenic in some patients, but were not found {{to be related to the}} development of reactions. The findings suggest that patients who develop reactions to streptokinase cannot be predicted on the basis of antibody titres at presentation. Minor reactions to streptokinase would not appear to be antibody-mediated, although complement activation may be involved...|$|R
40|$|One hundred sera from 49 {{patients}} with glandular toxoplasmosis were examined by a {{latex agglutination test}}, the dye test, an <b>indirect</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test, and a double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antitoxoplasma IgM. The results support previous findings that the dye test, <b>indirect</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test, and latex agglutination test measure different antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. In early glandular toxoplasmosis, when specific IgM was detected, the titres of both the latex agglutination test and the <b>indirect</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test were lower than the dye test. Repeat specimens from 11 of the patients showed four {{cases in which the}} latex agglutination test titres never exceeded 1 / 256, whereas both the dye test and the <b>indirect</b> <b>haemagglutination</b> test showed significant titres and specific IgM was detected in every case. We conclude that the latex agglutination test should not be used as a substitute for the dye test in the serological diagnosis of glandular toxoplasmosis. All sera giving a positive latex agglutination test result should be referred for further tests. A combination of the dye test and double antibody sandwich ELISA gives the most reliable serological diagnosis of early glandular toxoplasmosis...|$|E
