5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank <b>industry</b> <b>leaders</b> acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank <b>industry</b> <b>leaders</b> that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.|$|E

5|$|The linen {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its <b>industry</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and <b>Industry</b> <b>Leaders</b> {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence.

Comedy group The Three Stooges also made fun of it in two of their short subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 1977, Amway {{bought the}} network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began {{developing}} {{what would become}} the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity. In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.
