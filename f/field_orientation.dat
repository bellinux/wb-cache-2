40|$|The <b>orientation</b> <b>field</b> of a {{fingerprint}} {{is crucial for}} fea-ture extraction and matching. However, estimation of ori-entation fields in latents is very challenging because latents are usually of poor quality. Inspired by the superiority of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) for various clas-sification and recognition tasks, we pose latent <b>orientation</b> <b>field</b> estimation in a latent patch to a classification problem, and propose a ConvNet based approach for latent orienta-tion field estimation. The underlying idea is to identify the <b>orientation</b> <b>field</b> of a latent patch {{as one of a}} set of represen-tative orientation patterns. To achieve this, 128 representa-tive orientation patterns are learnt from a large number of <b>orientation</b> <b>fields.</b> For each <b>orientation</b> pattern, 10, 000 fin-gerprint patches are selected to train the ConvNet. To simu-late the quality of latents, texture noise is added to the train-ing patches. Given image patches extracted from a latent, their orientation patterns are predicted by the trained Con-vNet and quilted together to estimate the <b>orientation</b> <b>field</b> of the whole latent.

5000|$|Kantor {{originally}} {{named his}} system Organismic Psychology, {{but around the}} time of the publication of the first volume of his Principles of Psychology (Kantor, 1924), he had already renamed it to Interbehavioral Psychology. Interbehaviorism as developed by Kantor was characterized as [...] "field-theoretic, not lineal-mechanistic, self-actional, or mediational; a system that is naturalistic, not dualistic; and a system that is comprehensive, not narrowly focused." [...] (Midgley & Morris, 2006). At the University of Chicago, Kantor was heavily influenced by the pragmatism and functionalism of Dewey (who had retired earlier from the University), Angell, and Mead. Kantor was also heavily impressed by the development of relativity theory in physics. It was from these two sources, as well as from his historical inquiry, that Kantor devoted himself to the creation of a naturalistic system in psychology. Kantor saw a similar goal in the recently developed school of behaviorism, although he saw it as reductionistic and simplistic, and not completely separated from mentalism. His conclusion was that in order to do so, behaviorism had to embrace a <b>field</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scientific {{opinion is}} divided on what causes {{geomagnetic}} excursions. The dominant {{theory is that}} they are an inherent aspect of the dynamo processes that maintain the Earth's magnetic field. In computer simulations, it is observed that magnetic field lines can sometimes become tangled and disorganized through the chaotic motions of liquid metal in the Earth's core. In such cases, this spontaneous disorganization can cause decreases in the magnetic field as perceived at the Earth's surface. In truth, under this scenario, the Earth's magnetic field intensity does not significantly change in the core itself, but rather energy is transferred from a dipole configuration to higher order multipole moments which decay more rapidly with the distance from the Earth's core, so that the expression of such a magnetic field at the surface of the Earth would be considerably less, even without significant changes in the strength of the deep field. This scenario is supported by observed tangling and spontaneous disorganizations in the solar magnetic field. However, this process in the sun invariabily leads to a reversal of the solar magnetic field (see: solar cycle), and has never been observed such that the field would recover without large scale changes in <b>field</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{universal}} field-oriented (UFO) controller is used {{to control}} the induction motor torque and airgap flux independently of each other. In this work, the direct UFO control is realized by sensing the airgap flux using center taps on two machine windings. Moreover, an adaptive control scheme that accomplishes a continuous and automatic tuning of the rotor time constant of the field-oriented controller whenever the drive operates in the direct <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> mode is proposed. In addition, at low invertor frequencies, the UFO controller switches over to the indirect <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> mode in which the rotor time constant is frozen to the last tuned value of the previous direct <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> mode.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the lived <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> {{experiences}} of 12 missionaries living in Kenya and Tanzania relative to their perceptions of personal effectiveness. This study was driven by how a segment of missionaries described their <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> in relation to perceived effectiveness on the field. Four major themes relative to <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> emerged. Recommendations relating to missionary <b>field</b> <b>orientation</b> programs were offered. Every year thousands of new missionaries relocate overseas with the intent of ministering in a new culture. All experience cultural shock and problems.

Data collected during a series of interviews was developed into strong narratives. This approach allowed the participants voices to be heard as they reflected on their experiences. Four major themes (relationships, communications, language and culture, and calling and personal discipleship) were found to be extremely important to all participants.
