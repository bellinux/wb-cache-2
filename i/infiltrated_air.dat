50|$|Air {{changes are}} {{often cited as}} a means of {{preventing}} condensation in houses with forced ventilation systems often rated from 3 - 5 ACH though without referencing the size of the house. However, where ACH is already greater than 0.75 a forced ventilation system is unlikely to be of use at controlling condensation and instead insulation or heating are better remedies. Seven out of eight houses studied in NZ in 2010 had an ACH (corrected for ventilation factors) of 0.75 or greater. The presence of forced ventilation systems has been shown in some cases to actually increase the humidity rather than lower it. By displacing air inside a dwelling with <b>infiltrated</b> <b>air</b> (air brought in from outside the dwelling), positive pressure ventilation systems can increase heating (in winter) or cooling (in summer) requirements in a house. For example, to maintain a 15 °C temperature in a certain dwelling about 3.0 kW of heating are required at 0 ACH (no heat loss due to warmed air leaving the dwelling, instead heat is lost due to conduction or radiation), 3.8 kW at 1 ACH and 4.5 kW are required at 2 ACH. The use of roof space for heating or cooling was seen as ineffectual with the maximum heating benefits occurring in winter in more southerly regions (being close to the South Pole in these southern hemisphere reports) but being equivalent only to about 0.5 kW or the heating provided by about five 100 W incandescent light bulbs; cooling effects in summer were similarly small and were more pronounced for more northerly homes (being closer to the equator); in all cases the values assumed that the ventilation system automatically disengaged when the infiltrating air was warmer or cooler (as appropriate) than the air already in the dwelling as it would otherwise exacerbate the undesirable conditions in the house.|$|E

A heat exchanger for the condensation of industrial waste steam containing <b>infiltrated</b> <b>air</b> was designed. The condenser consists of a bundle of vertical tubes in which the steam condenses as it flows downwards with cooling water flowing outside the tubes in the opposite direction. Experiments with pure steam and with mixtures of steam with added air were carried out to find the dependence of the condensation heat transfer coefficient (HTC) on the air concentration in the steam mixture. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical formulas describing the cases. The theoretical determination of the HTC is based on the Nusselt model of steam condensation on a vertical wall, where the analogy of heat and mass transfer is used {{to take into account the}} behaviour of air in a steam mixture during the condensation process. The resulting dependencies obtained from the experiments and obtained from the theoretical model have similar results.

Equivalently to these 2 D examples, planar structures with 1 D arrays of air holes can offer a complimentary platform for nonlinear optics investigations. Importantly, if these structures can be photolithographically defined with longitudinal variations, then a rich array of periodic nonlinear phenomena can be studied. We present a novel planar integrated optic platform for fluid infiltration experiments. The platform consists of layers of SU 8 epoxy fabricated with 3 x 3 µm photolithographically defined microfluidic channels. The channel layer can be doped with rhodamine {{in order to increase}} its refractive index to enable vertical confinement and also provides a fluorescent trace to clearly indicate the path of the light. The air channels can be filled with fluids, such as high refractive index oil, to act as optical waveguides in the visible range. Our fabrication consists of spin coating and curing the SU 8 lower cladding. We then spin-coat and cure the doped SU 8 channel layer and pattern using conventional photolithography. In order to seal the channels with the upper cladding, an SU 8 dry film is applied using lamination techniques. The fabrication process is highly flexible and can be easily extended to more complex waveguides like splits, mach zehnder structures.

40|$|Infiltration has {{traditionally}} been assumed to affect the energy load of a building by an amount equal to {{the product of the}} infiltration flow rate and the sensible enthalpy difference between inside and outside. Results from detailed computational fluid dynamics simulations of five wall geometries over a range of infiltration rates show that heat transfer between the <b>infiltrating</b> <b>air</b> and walls can be substantial, reducing the impact of infiltration. Factors affecting the heat recovery are leakage path length, infiltration flow rate, and wall construction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{model for the}} analysis of impact of building envelope porosity on energy. In the porous envelope, the <b>infiltrating</b> <b>air</b> entering a building can change in temperature, along the infiltration path due to heat exchange between the air itself and the porous insulation matrix; hence the envelope effectively behaves as a heat exchanger. The presented model is based on combined airflow and heat transfer through porous media. Microscopic energy equations are formulated for solid and gas phases separately. Overall macroscopic heat transfer modeling is derived using volume average method and is applied for varying infiltration paths and porosity. Modeling results indicate that heat exchange performance is mainly determined by airflow rate with secondary influence from the infiltration path. Comparatively, under the same inlet velocity, the influence of porosity variation is not significant...|$|R

40|$|The {{penetration}} of ambient air pollutants into the indoor environment {{is of concern}} owing to several factors: (1) epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between ambient fine particulate pollution and elevated risk of human mortality; (2) people {{spend most of their}} time in indoor environments; and (3) most information about air pollutant concentration is only available from ambient routine monitoring networks. A good understanding of ambient air pollutant transport from source to receptor requires knowledge about pollutant penetration across building envelopes. Therefore, it is essential to gain insight into particle penetration in <b>infiltrating</b> <b>air</b> and the factors that affect it in order to assess human exposure more accurately, and to further prevent adverse human health effects from ambient particulate pollution. In this dissertation, the understanding of air pollutant infiltration across leaks in the building envelope was advanced by performing modeling predictions as well as experimental investigations. The modeling analyses quantified the extent of airborne particle and reactive gas (e. g., ozone) penetration through building cracks and wall cavities using engineering analysis that incorporates existing information on building leakage characteristics, knowledge of pollutant transport processes, as well as pollutant-surface interactions. Particle penetration is primarily governed by particle diameter and by the smallest dimension of the building cracks. Particles of 0. 1 - 1 {micro}m are predicted to have the highest penetration efficiency, nearly unity for crack heights of 0. 25 mm or higher, assuming a pressure differential of 4 Pa or greater and a flow path length of 3 cm or less. Supermicron and ultrafine particles (less than 0. 1 {micro}m) are readily deposited on crack surfaces by means of gravitational settling and Brownian diffusion, respectively. The fraction of ozone penetration through building leaks could vary widely, depending significantly on its reactivity with the adjacent surfaces, in addition to the crack geometry and pressure difference. <b>Infiltrating</b> <b>air</b> can also travel through wall cavities, where the {{penetration of}} particles and ozone is predicted to vary substantially, depending mainly on whether air flow passes through fiberglass insulation. For ozone, its reactivity with the insulation materials is also an important factor. The overall pollutant penetration factor is governed by the flow-weighted average from all air leakage pathways. Large building leaks would strongly influence the overall penetration factor, because they permit much larger flow...|$|R

The model, based on the steady-state one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation, provides a simple analytical solution for the heat recovery factor and requires only three inputs: the infiltration rate, the U-value for the building, and estimates of the effective areas for infiltration and exfiltration.

40|$|Infiltration has {{traditionally}} been assumed {{to contribute to the}} energy load of a building by an amount equal to the product of the infiltration flow rate and the enthalpy difference between inside and outside. Some studies have indicated that application of such a simple formula may produce an unreasonably high contribution because of heat recovery within the building envelope. The major objective {{of this study was to}} provide an improved prediction of the energy load due to infiltration by introducing a correction factor that multiplies the expression for the conventional load. This paper discusses simplified analytical modeling and CFD simulations that examine infiltration heat recovery (IHR) in an attempt to quantify the magnitude of this effect for typical building envelopes. For comparison, we will also briefly examine the results of some full-scale field measurements of IHR based on infiltration rates and energy use in real buildings.

To investigate the specific contribution of SCPA to the virulence of group A streptococci, scpA insertion and deletion mutants were created by directed plasmid insertion into scpA and gene replacement. The precise locations of insertion and deletion mutations were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. The impact of mutation on virulence was investigated with a mouse air sac model of inflammation. Experiments evaluated clearance of streptococci from the air sac within 4 h after infection.
