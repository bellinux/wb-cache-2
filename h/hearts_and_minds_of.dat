5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death of former President Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made in the <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> people and not through legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture.|$|E

No doubt the need for so much industry is sufficiently comparable to the tactics we still observe today to sway groups of people.

No hope was in sight for many following the devastation and mass killings of the pogroms that followed {{in the wake of the}} Chmielnicki Uprising (1648–1654), the largest single massacre of Jews until the Holocaust, and it was at this time that a controversial scholar by the name of Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) captured the <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the Jewish masses of that time with the promise of a newly minted messianic Millennialism in the form of his own personage.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Kalki Purana describes Kali's lineage starting with the creator-god Brahma, his great-great-grandfather, and ending {{with the birth of}} his children's children. Instead of being born of poison from the churning of the ocean of milk, he {{is the product of a}} long line of incestuous monsters born from Brahma's back. (See Family Lineage below) Kali and his family were created by Brahma to hurry the dissolution of the cosmos after the pralaya period was over. When his family takes human form on earth, they further taint the <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> mankind to bring about the end of Dvapara Yuga and the {{beginning of}} Kali Yuga. During the first stage of Kali-Yuga, the varnashrama breaks down and God-worship is forsaken by man. All through the second, third, and fourth stages, man forgets the name of god and no longer offers Yajna (offerings) to the Devas. It is at this point when God Vishnu reincarnates as Kalki in the name of the Devas and all of mankind to rid the cosmos of Kali's dark influence.|$|E

In the late 1960s, following the last major wave of Finnish immigration to Canada, a new organization called the Finlandia Club of Port Arthur became the majority share holder of the hall. The new wave of immigrants were a generation separated from their Finnish-Canadian brethren and had no connection to the social struggles of the past. In addition, the newly arriving immigrants were either a-political or conservative, associating any left-wing activity with the brutality of Stalinism and the Finnish Winter War; this {{despite the fact that}} the Finnish Wobblies in Canada and the U.S. had actively supported and aided Finland in the war against the Soviet Union and denounced Bolshevism, from a libertarian socialist perspective, since the Kronstadt uprising.|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "The main point was to ease the <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> anyone who have suffered from an unthinkable loss. I also originally wrote the song as comfort to the idea that death is a part of the cycle of life and a loved one's life should be celebrated. In New Orleans, a funeral in some ways is a parade.

[...] Beyoncé explained on her iTunes Radio channel that [...] "Heaven" [...] was about [...] "death and finding the strength in knowing that someone had an incredible life and that giving you some type of closure".
