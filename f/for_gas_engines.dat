40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, {{gas engines}} fueled by natural gas, known as “clean energy, ” have {{attracted}} attention as outstanding power generation systems in addressing global environmental issues. They are increasingly in demand because they emit less carbon dioxide (CO 2), which causes global warming, sulfur oxides (SOx), which are responsible for acid rain, and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which lead to environmental problems. With this background, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) has developed a commercial highly efficient 1 MW class (280 – 1000 kW) gas engine, which is friendly to the global environment. 1. Efficiency improvement of gas engines 1. 1 Features of gas engines The main fuels <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> are natural gas and city gas (13 A). They generate less carbon dioxide (CO 2), which causes global warming, because the main component methane (CH 4) contains four times more hydrogen atoms (H) than carbon atoms (C), which is over twice the ratio of petroleum fuels. Hydrogen becomes water when combusted. They also do not emit sulfur oxides (SOx), which cause acid rain, because the fuel does not contain sulfur atoms...|$|E

Although <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> may resemble other engine types in their appearance and lubricant specifications, they generally benefit {{from the use of}} lubricants developed specifically for them.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this diploma thesis is to investigate the potential of {{combined heat and power}} plants based on gas engine technology in Algeria. This market analysis has been performed in order to identify the key markets for the newly created French subsidiary of Clarke Energy Group to expand its business in North Africa. After analyzing the structure of the Algerian energy sector and the potential of each gas engine application, three key sectors were identified. For each sector, a technical and economical analysis was conducted in order to define its potential, its constraints, and the time frame under which they could become mature markets. With a potential of 300 MW, the first targeted sector is related to the national power utility Sonelgaz and consists in small scale power plants with a nominal power output < 20 MW, in which the use of gas engines instead of gas turbines could reduce up to 50 % the price of kWh generated over the lifecycle of the plant. With a total of 450 MW, the second market representing a great potential <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> development in Algeria is the industrial sector and in particular brick factories, in which cogeneration plants become profitable within 4 years, can save up to 40 % of primary energy and generate electricity whose cost of production is 30 % lower than the average grid price. Finally, the third sector identified is the associated petroleum gas from which 9 % – 5. 10 ⁹ cubic meters – are is still being flared in Algeria while they could be used to generate up to 300 MW for the O&G utilities if only 10 % of them would be recovered, reducing thus CO 2 emissions and diesel costs. This report presents the method and the tools that were developed in order to analyze the economical viability of gas engine based power plants for the three targeted markets in Algeria, and the final results from the study...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in energy cost {{in recent years}} has created a situation where it has become essential to develop alternative energy technologies. Energy efficiency does not only mean reducing environmental degradation and increasing sustainability but also cost savings. Most energy managers employ common solutions to reduce plant inefficiencies in Malaysia such as "Energy Auditing", equipment replacement etc. One other energy efficient system is Cogeneration. Cogeneration can be considered as one of the many indications of progress in a healthy and efficient industrial growth. Cogeneration enables an industry to be not totally dependent on the utility supply but become inter-dependent and hence increasing availability. A well-planned cogeneration system can create a situation where plant operation need not be affected by utility blackouts; i. e. minimum production capacity is maintained. The Malaysian energy environment is a dynamic growth, where present excess capacity is projected to be fully utilised {{by the end of the}} century. The increasing demand for electricity is not evenly distributed in Malaysia and this off balance cause overloading in some areas. By cogenerating, the demand can be reduced and therefore the load on Tenaga Nasional Berhad or TNB transmission lines will also reduce. This would allow TNB to react to load f luctuation more effectively. Cogeneration will be a catalyst for the local natural gas industry since most industrial cogenerators (between 1 MW to 10 MW) will be utilising natural gas as fuel source <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> and gas turbines. Cogeneration will also displace the need to build expensive power plants, which will mean eliminating transmission and distribution losses. Cogeneration will benefit the environment by reducing emissions, improve the use of natural resources, introduce better grid management, provide savings in Ringgit Malaysia, increase efficiency, added reliability and generating growth in the gas industry. The objective of this project was to evaluate the technical and economics viability of cogenerating in Malaysia. Two case studies were selected and evaluated. It was found that the lack of firm regulations and gas prices are the main factors discouraging cogeneration in Malaysia. Local industries were also found to be lacking in commitment towards cogenerating and efficient energy use. This thesis has forwarded recommendations and suggestions that will be required to improve the cogeneration scenario in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{starting}} {{systems for}} marine gas engines. Large combustion engines are usually started {{by means of}} pneumatic starting arrangements. The most common ways of starting a combustion engine with compressed air, are to use a pneumatic engine coupled to the engine flywheel, or to inject the air directly into the engine cylinders through a valve in the cylinder air. Pneumatic starting engines are prefered <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> with a prechamber. The main challenge related to starting of gas fueled engines, is to avoid ignitable consentrations of gas outside the engine cylinders. Gas engines have an increased emission of unburned gas during starting and stoping. If the consentration of unburnes gases in the exhaust system of the combustion engine gets to large, the gas can be ignited by hot spots or sparks. In addition, we are conserned with the air consume of the starting system. The capacity of the starting system is regulated by class rules. To {{reduce the cost of}} the system, we want to reduce the air consume per start. In this thesis, mathematical models of the combustion engine and the starting system are developed and validated against experimental results from starting tests of the real system. The objective is to give means for investigating, by using computer simulations, if the existing starting system can be improved. The validation showed that the model captures the main dynamics of the system. To avoid large concentrations of unburned fuel mixtures in the exhaust system, the starting system is used to purge the engine before allowing fuel to the engine cylinders. In practice, the combustion engine is operated as an air pump which pumps air from the charge air system, via the engine cylinders, and to the exhaust system. A way of improving the safety of the starting sequence by purging the engine for a fixed number of rotations, is proposed. This method gives stricter control of the purged volume, but increases air consume. To reduce air consume, it is advantegous to keep the engine speed low during purging. Three concept for reducing the engine speed are explored. The simulations indicate that the best performance is obtained by using an electrically controlled pressure control valve, in combination with a Proportional-Integral- Derivative feedback controller, to regulate the engine speed. This concept is extensively tested by means of simulations, to evaluate its robustness with regards to system uncertainties and different plant dimensions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Biogas is a {{renewable}} energy source that is produced by anaerobic digestion of organic mate-rial. In Sweden, biogas predominately comes from sewage water sludge and landfills or from organic waste of households and industries. Small scale digestion plants at farms are espe-cially expected to contribute to increased biogas production in the future. Biogas can be ob-tained directly in it’s raw form and used as fuel in a combustion chamber. However, gas en-gines require biogas purification from hydrogen sulphide and drying from water to avoid cor-rosion. In order to increase the calorific value, carbon dioxide is separated and the Swedish Standard Type A requires the methane content to be 97 % for vehicle gas. In the gas treatment process from biogas to vehicle gas, the upgrading step when carbon diox-ide is separated represents the highest cost since conventional upgrading techniques require high investments. This makes the upgrading costs for smaller biogas plants relatively high. In this master thesis, six upgrading methods have been evaluated and four of them {{are expected to be}} commercialized within two years. The following upgrading methods are of interest for Sweden: - In situ methane enrichment; air desorbs carbon dioxide from the sludge in a desorption column. The method is intended for digestion of sewage water sludge and the total upgrading cost is approximately 0, 13 kr/kWh by a raw biogas flow 62, 5 Nm 3 /h. - Small scale water scrubber; carbon dioxide is absorbed in water under enhanced pressure. The upgrading process is very similar to the conventional water scrub-bing technique and the total upgrading cost is approximately 0, 42 kr/kWh by a raw biogas flow of 12 Nm 3 /h. - Cryogenic upgrading; the biogas is chilled to under - 85 °C under a pressure of at least 5, 2 barg and carbon dioxide can be separated in the liquid phase. The total upgrading cost is approximately 0, 12 kr/kWh by a raw biogas flow of 150 Nm 3 /h. The total upgrading cost can be reduced if the recovered liquid carbon dioxide can be sold. - Membrane technique; biogas is upgraded with polymeric membranes that are per-meable for carbon dioxide but not for methane molecules. The method is expected to be adaptable for both smaller and bigger biogas plants and the total upgrading cost is approximately 0, 14 kr/kWh by a raw biogas flow of 180 Nm 3 /h. All above mentioned upgrading techniques have methane losses less than two percent and all methods except for the in situ methane enrichment are expected to upgrade biogas to vehicle gas according to the Swedish Standard. In situ methane is expected to upgrade biogas up to 95 % methane content. By combustion of unpurified landfill gas in a gas engine, corrosive combustion products and white deposits are formed. Purification of landfill gas can decrease maintenance costs <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines.</b> Two landfill gas purification methods have been evaluated and with the first method, contaminants are trapped in ice crystals when the gas is chilled to - 25 °C. The second method purifies landfill gas with condensed carbon dioxide. An important result of the master thesis is that the in situ methane enrichment has a chance to become an interesting alternative for smaller sewage treatment plants but the method requires additional upgrading to reach 97 % methane content. The most important conclusion is that cryogenic upgrading and membrane technique are expected to satisfy the Swedish Standard. The methods have relatively low upgrading costs and the methane losses are less than two percent. This gives them a good chance to establish in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Tar is a viscous black liquid {{derived from}} {{pyrolysis}} {{of organic matter}} and a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. The presence of tar in the product gas may cause blockage and corrosion of equipments and be responsible for fouling or reducing overall efficiency of processes. By far, tar removal is the most problematic during biomass gasification. Hence, a successful implementation of gasification technology <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines,</b> gas turbines or fuel cells based power projects depend much on the effective and efficient removal or conversion of tar from the product gas. Beside that, the catalytic steam reforming tar {{is one of the}} most promising methods to suppress the problems. The biomass product gas is usually low calorific value; therefore, an enhancement of the product gas quality is other important target. We propose a research topic that to utilise nickel–loaded brown coal char as a new catalyst for decomposing tar from biomass gasification in a fluidized bed gasifier. The method is promising to get benefits from the use of low rank coal char as a catalyst support material, a high catalyst activity of nickel and an enhancement of product gas quality. In this study, yallourn brown coal has been selected to prepare the catalyst support. The coal that is a low rank with high moisture content, a low heat value and high oxygen content is hard to use for generating energy. However, it has a lot of outstanding features such as less ash and sulfur content, and with abundant of oxygen–containing functional groups such as carboxyl and phenol groups which are available for ion–exchange with metals. In this study, the nickel–loaded brown coal char (Ni/BCC) was prepared by an ion–exchange method, dried at 380 K in nitrogen for 24 h, and then pyrolysed at 923 K in nitrogen for 90 min. The works have been carried out is the use of the Ni/BCC catalyst to decompose tar in pyrolysis and steam gasification processes. The experiments were performed on a two–stage fixed–bed reactor and a laboratory–scale fluidized–bed gasifier under mild conditions (temperatures, steam, space velocities, operation time). Inside of the gasifier was constructed by two beds, the primary one is a fluidized bed with sand, and the second one is a catalyst bed. The Ni/BCC catalyst has shown high catalytic activity and stable activity and given the high quality of the product gas. In the presence of steam, approximately 90 % of biomass tar was decomposed and useful gas components (CH 4, CO, and H 2) yields were higher than those of a conventional Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The Ni/BCC catalyst was characterized and exhibited a good dispersion of nickel particles, ultra–fine Ni less than 15 nm and a large surface area (Approximately 350 m 2 /g). Moreover, at the end of its life span, the catalyst can be easily disposed by gasifying or burning the coal char, during which the energy value of the char support can be recovered. Further, the agglomerated nickel residues can be also used as functional materials for powder metallurgy and battery development. The general results suggest that the Ni/BCC catalyst offers a potential to be used as a high activity catalyst for steam reforming of tar in biomass gasification. 学位記番号：工博甲 398, 学位の種類：博士（工学）, 学位授与年月日：平成 22 年 3 月 24...|$|E
