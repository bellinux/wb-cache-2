2500|$|After Lincoln's death, Lamon {{published}} {{two books}} (one posthumously) about the late President. The more famous {{of the two}} is a biography that was largely ghostwritten by Chauncey Black, the son of former Attorney General of the United States Jeremiah Black. The elder Black was Lamon's law partner from 1865 until 1879. The book, published in 1872 by James R. Osgood and Company of Boston under the title The Life of Abraham Lincoln; From his Birth to his Inauguration as President, contained allegations and personal information about Lincoln that were deemed scandalous by nineteenth century society. It was a financial failure. One of the most shocking claims was that Lincoln {{was not a man}} of faith: [...] "Mr. Lincoln was never a member of any church, nor did he believe in the divinity of Christ, or the inspiration of the Scriptures in the sense understood by evangelical Christians." [...] The basis of the book was the papers of William Herndon, which Lamon purchased for either $2,000 or $4,000. [...] Shortly after his death, Lamon's daughter collected and edited many of his unpublished writings about Lincoln into a biography of the president, Recollections of Abraham Lincoln (1895). In Recollections, Lamon reversed his earlier denial of the Baltimore plot of 1861, writing, [...] "It is now an acknowledged fact that there was never a moment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> crossed the Maryland line, up until the time of his assassination, that he was not in danger of death by violence, and that his life was spared until the night of the 14th of April, 1865, only through the ceaseless and watchful care of the guards thrown around him." [...] The authenticity of this book is generally more highly regarded by the scholarly community than is the earlier volume by Lamon and Black.|$|E

I can even recall {{that he had a}} trick of keeping a straw {{in the corner of his}} mouth, just where he used afterwards to hold his pipe.

He found, however, the house tenanted by other people. He learned that the last occupants had left years before. The neighbors remembered that one morning early some officers of the law had come to the house, and the man had been seized and carried away. He had been released some months later, only to find that his wife had died of grief and anxiety, and he had then sold off his goods and gone no one knew whither. Malcolm, therefore, returned to Glasgow, with the feeling that he had gained nothing by his journey.|$|E
