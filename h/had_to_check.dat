Thai Airways {{expected to have}} five other international flights departing on 4 and 5 December to New Delhi, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Seoul, and Copenhagen. Passengers for these flights <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> in at a convention centre outside the airport.|$|E
25|$|Before {{internet}} connectivity was widespread, computer viruses {{were typically}} spread by infected floppy disks. Antivirus software came into use, but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time, virus checkers essentially <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> executable files and the boot sectors of floppy disks and hard disks. However, as internet usage became common, viruses {{began to spread}} online.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the limited}} budget, some of the effects seen in the film couldn't be replicated. Stevenson said {{everyone}} [...] "had to be on point", and that any mistakes couldn't be rectified by re-filming. For example, the producers couldn't afford to shoot the film's final scene (in which Greene is killed via a car explosion) twice. Before filming, the production crew and actors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> everything on the set. Time was also lacking, with Stevenson saying everyone [...] "had to be extremely focused".|$|E

500|$|As a child, Tubman {{also worked}} {{at the home of}} a planter named James Cook. She <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the muskrat traps in nearby marshes, even after {{contracting}} measles. She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health. Brodess then hired her out again. She spoke later of her acute childhood homesickness, comparing herself to [...] "the boy on the Swanee River", an allusion to Stephen Foster's song [...] "Old Folks at Home." [...] As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.|$|E
2500|$|Serious Young Insects {{had formed}} in 1980 with Peter Farnan on vocals and guitar, Michael Vallance on vocals and bass guitar and Mark White on vocals and drums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{described}} Serious Young Insects as a [...] "quirky, three-piece Melbourne new wave band". They issued an album, Housebreaking (May 1982), and three singles. Lisa Perry of The Canberra Times praised the album [...] "several times I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the cover {{to see if}} there were not also some session musos or others contributing to the sounds I was hearing. For a three-piece combo, these lads sure make a good sound". Pleasance, a classically trained guitarist, was a fan and briefly joined the group before it broke up in the following year.|$|E

Under “RP”, legal proceedings included witnesses, use of oaths or “ordaliy” (lat. ordalium, or “ordeal” in English, {{a kind of a}} last-resort test used to prove defendant’s innocence or guilt). The search for culprits included listening to witnesses, collecting evidence, or hot pursuit. Investigators <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for false accusations, as well. These were the first steps towards forensic science.|$|E

2500|$|Rehearsals for {{the live}} {{section of the}} episode started on 21 July 2012 and full dress rehearsals on 22 July, though there was some {{tentative}} rehearsal time before that when they were also busy filming other episodes. Fenwick said of his rehearsals, [...] "Summer arrives {{just in time for}} me to complete my 24th circuit of Albert Square and I'm sweltering. On the plus side, I'm starting to see abs, have buns of steel and the show is looking good too!" [...] He explained that he was inspired by Usain Bolt, saying, [...] "I watched a documentary on him [...] and he's inspired me to torch bear. Obviously I won't be going [...] near as fast him!" [...] He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the route for potholes beforehand, as well as making sure he knew his lines, and said he was looking forward to it being over. He practiced the route at least 100 times, using washing line rope instead of the flame, and had cut down on alcohol to prepare. He was worried about sustaining an injury during rehearsals and about carrying the torch during the live broadcast, as he may have dropped it or it could have gone out. He stated that he, as an actor, was feeling more nervous than his character.|$|E

60|$|With {{trembling}} hands he tied Silvermane's bridle to the stern {{seat of the}} boat and pushed off. In his eagerness he rowed too hard, dragging Silvermane's nose under water, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> himself. Time and again he turned to call to the dog. At length the bow grated on the sand, and Silvermane emerged with a splash and a snort.|$|E
60|$|Dalzell {{changed his}} position, and drew up his army {{at the foot}} of the hill, on the top of which were his foes.

60|$|But dear, fat Cordy was {{the most}} {{successful}} of all; and rejoiced greatly {{over the loss of}} a few pounds when she gave up over-eating, long naps, and lazy habits. Exercise became a sort of mania with her, and she was continually trudging off for a constitutional, or trotting up and down the halls when bad weather prevented the daily tramp. It was the desire of her soul to grow thin, and such was her ardor that Miss Orne <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> her sometimes, lest she should overdo the matter.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} feel sorry. She did her utmost to feel sorry; {{presently}} {{when she went}} back into the dépendance, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> her feet to a regretful pace; she dreaded the eyes of the hotel visitors she passed in the garden lest they should detect the liberation of her soul. But the hotel visitors being English were for the most part too preoccupied with manifestations of a sympathy that should be at once heart-felt and quite unobtrusive and altogether in the best possible taste, to have any attention free for the soul of Lady Harman.|$|E
60|$|And Giles {{could only}} afford to bestow a fragmentary glance {{at any time}} on the refractory, for, almost at {{one and the same}} moment he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the impetuous, hold up a warning hand to the unruly, rescue a runaway child from innumerable horse-legs, pilot a stout but timid lady from what we may call refuge-island, {{in the middle of the}} roadway, to the pavement, answer an imbecile's {{question}} as to the whereabouts of the Tower or Saint Paul's, order a loitering cabby to move on, and look out for his own toes, as well as give moderate attention to the carriage-poles which perpetually threatened the small of his own back.|$|E

Paisley was {{inspired}} to write the song from experience working on a farm, “Working {{out here on the}} farm, I literally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for ticks every time I come in from the woods or the fields,” he notes. “Now, if a young guy who lives in the country were to take a girl into the woods for any reason, it would totally cross his mind that she’s going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for ticks when they come back out. So it seems that an enterprising guy would at least consider that he could offer <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for her.” ...|$|R

60|$|If I were to {{describe}} all the incidents {{of the next}} fortnight in their order, my story would never come to an end; and your patience would be exhausted. Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly 'rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together. Wherever I went there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company to and from my hotel. At the Theatre I found them amid the crowd of yelling jhampanies; outside the Club veranda, after a long evening of whist; at the Birthday Ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and in broad daylight when I went calling. Save that it cast no shadow, the 'rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron. More than once, indeed, I have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> myself from warning some hard-riding friend against cantering over it. More than once I have walked down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the unspeakable amazement of the passers-by.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought that}} he ought to condemn it, and he did condemn Mrs. Kenton for {{allowing}} it in one of her daughters, when he came up to her sitting beside another whom he felt inexpressibly incapable of it. Mrs. Kenton could have answered his censure, if she had known it, that daughters, like sons, were not what their mothers but what their environments made them, and that the same environment sometimes made them different, as he saw. She could have told him that Lottie, with her slangy pertness, had the truest and best of the men she knew at her feet, and that Ellen, with her meekness, had been the prey of the commonest and cheapest spirit in her world, and so left him to make an inference as creditable to his sex as he could. But this bold defence was as far from the poor lady as any spoken reproach was from him. Her daughter <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> in her a mechanical offer to rise, as if to give Breckon her place, the theory and practice of Tuskingum being that their elders ought to leave young people alone together.|$|E
60|$|Our only hope, then, is in evolution. We must {{replace the}} {{man by the}} superman. It is frightful for the citizen, as the years pass him, to see his own contemporaries so exactly {{reproduced}} by the younger generation, that his companions of thirty years ago have their counterparts in every city crowd, where he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> himself repeatedly {{in the act of}} saluting as an old friend some young man to whom he is only an elderly stranger. All hope of advance dies in his bosom as he watches them: he knows that they will do just what their fathers did, and that the few voices which will still, as always before, exhort them to do something else and be something better, might as well spare their breath to cool their porridge (if they can get any). Men like Ruskin and Carlyle will preach to Smith and Brown for the sake of preaching, just as St Francis preached to the birds and St Anthony to the fishes. But Smith and Brown, like the fishes and birds, remain as they are; and poets who plan Utopias and prove that nothing is necessary for their realization but that Man should will them, perceive at last, like Richard Wagner, that the fact to be faced is that Man does not effectively will them. And he never will until he becomes Superman.|$|E
