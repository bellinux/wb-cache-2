5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with <b>signal</b> flags (during <b>daylight)</b> and <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> (at night). <b>Signal</b> <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space. A signal laser is coupled into the cavity and provides two output light channels: the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> through the cavity and the reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> from the cavity. We show that with the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency manifested by the free-space control light, the amplitude and the phase of the intra-cavity <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> can be manipulated by the free-space control laser. We analyze the cavity transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> and the cavity reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> and show that the two output channels of the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> are complementary and the cavity-atom system is a versatile system for studies of alloptical switching and cross-phase modulation at low control intensities...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} using non-resonant Raman lidar during daytime hours is presented. A dual (or quadruple) {{arrangement}} of electro-optical channels {{is set up}} in the lidar receiver. Each channel contains its own optical spectral response as determined by an appropriate set of interference filters. The incoming signal is split and fed into two channels, filtered (simultaneously) and then inserted into the input terminals of an operational amplifier. The difference signal is selected and amplified whereas the common portion of the signal is highly attenuated (Common Mode Re. jection Ratio = 75 - 80 db). For the present hardware, daylight intensities 10 (exp 2) - 10 (exp 3) times Raman signals are received simultaneously. Mean values of intensities of <b>daylight</b> <b>signals</b> which give rise to a constant differences merely shift the value of the measured variable at the ground. These mean value signals have their common part highly attenuated. The differences of the fluctuation portions of the <b>daylight</b> <b>signal</b> represents a noise signal. Identical (space-time) optical paths for each component of the <b>daylight</b> <b>signal</b> produce the same fluctuational spectra in each channel. Hence noise levels, much less than signal levels, are anticipated. First a N 2 -H 2) signal pair is differenced. Then an N 2 -O 2 pair is differenced and used for instrumental normalization purposes. Signal levels to be encountered are quite well known as a result of prior field work. Improved optical design of laser system can reduce mean value of daylight intensities by 10 (exp 2). Thus the mean daylight intensity can be set equal to the expected signal levels by more advanced optical design. Performance characteristics of photomultiplier pairs are discussed in this connection...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the worst}} problems in many countries. Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions.
