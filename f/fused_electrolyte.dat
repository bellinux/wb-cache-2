40|$|Bismuth {{has been}} {{deposited}} from a <b>fused</b> <b>electrolyte</b> containing 33 wt % bismuth tri-chloride in a lithium chloride-potassium chloride eutectic mixture as carrier salt at approximately 400 ~ The electrolyte was maintained at the desired temperature by the electrolyzing current, requiring 1. 27 kwhr of power per pound of bismuth deposited. The cathode current efficiency was nearly 100 % {{and the average}} yield was 88. 8 %. The process readily lends itself to continuous operation. ~NTRODUCTION Although the use of aqueous olutions for electrodeposi-tion and electrorefining of bismuth has attracted consider-able attention, very little {{has been reported in}} the litera-ture concerning fused electrolytes. Early attempts to prepare bismuth by fusion electrolysis of bismuth tri-chloride were discouraged by the high solubility of the metal in the molten salt. In 1900 Helfenstein (1) reporte...|$|E
40|$|Work in {{progress}} in this Laboratory (1) has in-dicated that the fused sodium chlor ide-potass ium chloride eutectic displays an ideal behavior; the molten bath is completely ionized and solvation is absent. Electrode reactions tak ing {{place in this}} <b>fused</b> <b>electrolyte</b> are be ing invest igated at present by the method of oscil lographic polarography. The diffu-sion coefficient of the discharging meta l ion can be measured irect ly by this method. In the case of oscil lographic polarography the dis-charge current is given by (2) i = ~r 1 / ~ n F A fl~/ 2 D 1 / ~ C ~ ~ (fit) where A is {{the surface of the}} electrode, D is the dif-fusion coefficient, C ~ is the bulk concentrat ion of the diffusing species, and ~(f i t) is a complex funct ion re lat ing the discharge current, electrode potential, and rate constant. Once the electrode surface and bu lk concentrat ion are known, the diffusion coeffi-cient can be obtained from the polarographic wave and the above equation. Experimental The polarographic reduct ion of Pb + § in the <b>fused</b> <b>electrolyte</b> was fol lowed by means of a polarograph especial ly conceived for this system. The reduct ion cell consists of a cathode {{in the form of a}} microelec-trode, made from a 0. 5 mm p la t inum wire sealed into a quartz tube (A = 1. 89 x 10 - ~ cm~), and the Ag/ AgC 1 electrode of Coriou, Dorian, and Hure (3). The preparat ion and purif ication of the solvent bath have a l ready been described (1). The lead chloride used to make up the electrolyte was purif ied by a flash dist i l lat ion under vacuum. The dissolution of the lead chloride in the purif ied solvent was ac-complished under a r igorously control led inert at-mosphere, and the resul t ing solution was electro-lyzed immediate ly in such a manner that no impur i-ties were introduced from the atmosphere. The po-larographic cell was placed in a graphite resistor furnace where the temperature was regulated to • 176 Polarograms were taken at four different temperatures for a solution (C ~ = 2. 187 x 10 - 2 mmole Pb+*/g solvent) in order to determine the energy of act ivat ion of the diffusion process...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{studies of}} the liquid-metal cell have shown it to possess prom-ising {{characteristics}} for application to the conversion of thermal energy. Polarization effects commonly associated with electrochemical cells are essen-tially absent; charge-discharge curves are straight lines passing through the open-circuit intercept. The conductivity of the <b>fused</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> 2. 3 mhos, pro-vides for low internal losses. Nongalvanic losses occur causing an apparent loss of reactants {{to the extent of}} 0. 018 amp/cm 2. It is shown that a cell constructed of the materials and electrolyte employed in the study should allow operation at 0. 7 amp/cm 2 at maximum power and that the coulombic efficiency would be 95 % when continuously operated at this current density during balanced charge and discharge periods. The thermally regenerative liquid-metal ce l, which has elsewhere been conceived and described (1 - 3), effects the transformation of thermal power to electrical power by the thermal decomposition of the products of electrochemical reaction. The re-actants are liquid metals which combine to form alloys and to produce electrical energy. It is this liquid alloy which is then thermally decomposed, at a higher temperature, to the original iquid-metal reactants. The transducing system is, therefore, lim-ited to Carnot efficiencies. The liquid-metal cell, employing Na and Sn as examples of reactants, may be represented as NalNa + electroly. te[Na. Sn, i which oxidation occurs at the Na electrode. The potential of this cell is greater than that of a simple concentration cell due to the de-crease in Na activity at the Sn cathode due to the formation of compounds represented by Na~. Sny. Since high potentials are desirable, the concentra-tion of Na in the cathode will be maintained at levels usually less than 10 weight per cent (w/o). The electrochemical reaction involves the transfer of Na + formed at the anode, through the electrolyte, to the cathode. Thus, it is desirable to employ elec-trolytes which are chemically stable to Na metal and in which the only cation present is that of Na. Such electrolytes are provided by fused Na salts. The use of a fused-salt electrolyte will further provide hig...|$|E

40|$|Electroreduction f K 2 TaF 7 {{dissolved}} in KC 1 -NaC 1 at 720 ~ was investigated by transient electrochemical techniques. The primary reaction involves a single reversible five electron step Ta(V) + 5 e ~ Ta. In {{addition to the}} metal deposition, other insoluble compounds were generated during the reduction step; their influence increases as the potential becomes more negative. The formation of these compounds was progressively inhibited by addition of sodium fluoride; simulta-neously, a shift of the deposition potential towards more negative values was observed. This result was interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the formation of an increasing amount of fluoride rich complexes such as TaFt- or TaFt-. When oxide ions were present in the bath, perturbations appeared, which indicates that the reduction of electroactive species containing oxygen occurs at a potential more negative than for oxygen free complexes. The diffusion coefficient of the complex ion containing Ta(V), measured by chronopotentiometry andcyclic voltammetry, is about 1. 5 x 10 - 5 cm 2 s- 1.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{model has}} been developed for the calculation of speciation, phase equilibria, enthalpies, heat capacities and densities in mixed-solvent electrolyte systems. The model incorporates chemical equilibria to account for chemical speciation in multiphase, multicomponent systems. For this purpose, the model combines standard-state thermochemical properties of solution species with an expression for the excess Gibbs energy. The excess Gibbs energy model incorporates a long-range electrostatic interaction term expressed by a Pitzer–Debye–Hückel equation, a short-range interaction term expressed by the UNIQUAC model and a middle-range, second virial coefficient-type term for the remaining ionic interactions. The standard-state properties are calculated by using the Helgeson– Kirkham–Flowers equation of state for species at infinite dilution in water and by constraining the model to reproduce the Gibbs energy of transfer between various solvents. The model is capable of accurately reproducing various types of experimental data for systems including aqueous electrolyte solutions ranging from infinite dilution to <b>fused</b> salts, <b>electrolytes</b> in organic or mixed, water+ organic, solvents up to the solubility limit and acid–water mixtures in the full concentration range...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{graphite}} anode {{reaction in}} a <b>fused</b> carbonate <b>electrolyte</b> is studied theoretically and experimentally. Data on open circuit cell potentials indicate, for operation below 900 °C, {{only a small}} fraction of the free energy of reaction is converted to electrical work. Anode polarization measurements were made for current densities of up to 77. 5 ma/cm² for several temperatures between 600 °C and 940 °C. Initial polarization is shown to be capacitive in nature and accounts for up to 75 percent of the anode polarization. The double layer charge capacitance is 308 ± 15 microfarads per square centimeter at 600 °C. A number of chemical analyses of the anode reaction product gases are made for current densities from 13. 7 ma/cm² to 141 ma/cm² and for temperatures from 650 °C to 870 °C. High concentrations of carbon dioxide in the reaction product gas, combined with measured gas evolution rates for various cell currents, show that the main cell reaction corresponds to one which results in the oxidation of carbon electrochemically to carbon dioxide. The presence of carbon monoxide, at all temperatures investigated, indicates that the anode reaction is a multistep process which includes the production of carbon monoxide as an intermediate species...|$|R
