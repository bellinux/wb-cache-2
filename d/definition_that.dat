5|$|The {{definition}} of the ampere is undergoing a major overhaul—the current definition, which is difficult to realise with high precision in practice, is being replaced by a <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> is more intuitive and that is easier to realise.|$|E
5|$|If i < j, {{it follows}} from the <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> s'j ≡ 1 (mod s'i). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's {{sequence}} are relatively prime. The sequence {{can be used to}} prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence. More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).|$|E

5|$|In the 2006 census, {{over five}} million Canadians {{identified}} themselves {{as a member of}} a visible minority. Together, they make up 16.2% of the total population: most numerous among these are South Asian (4.0%), Black (2.5%), and Filipino (1.1%). Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act, and this is the <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> Statistics Canada also uses.|$|E
5|$|Under this definition, the Solar System is {{considered}} to have eight planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as dwarf planets, provided they are not also natural satellites of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion. After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Norman {{included}} Eolambia for {{the first}} time in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts, as part of a chapter focusing on iguanodonts in the second edition of The Dinosauria. He found that Eolambia was the sister group to Altirhinus, with both of them being more basal than Protohadros, Probactrosaurus, or the Hadrosauridae. Within the same volume, Horner, Weishampel, and Catherine Forster conducted a separate phylogenetic analysis of hadrosaurids, likewise including Eolambia. They found Eolambia again as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, albeit as the sister group to Protohadros. Although Head had specifically redefined the Hadrosauridae, based on shared characteristics, to include Protohadros, Horner and colleagues adapted a taxon-based <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> excluded Protohadros and thus Eolambia. They also identified additional characteristics differentiating Eolambia from hadrosaurids: there are coarse denticles on the teeth of the dentary, and the coronoid process is weakly expanded.|$|E

5|$|The sum of a {{geometric}} series {{is itself a}} result even older than Euler. A typical 18th-century derivation used a term-by-term manipulation similar to the algebraic proof given above, and as late as 1811, Bonnycastle's textbook An Introduction to Algebra uses such an argument for {{geometric series}} to justify the same maneuver on 0.999... A 19th-century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the <b>definition</b> <b>that</b> still dominates today: the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; {{it can be found}} in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.|$|E
