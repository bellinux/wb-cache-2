500|$|Critical and {{scholarly}} praise has been unanimous in declaring [...] "To Autumn" [...] {{one of the}} most perfect poems in the English language. A.C. Swinburne placed it with [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as [...] "the nearest to absolute perfection" [...] of Keats's odes; Aileen Ward declared it [...] "Keats's most perfect and untroubled poem"; and Douglas Bush has stated that the poem is [...] "flawless in structure, texture, tone, and rhythm"; Walter Evert, in 1965, stated that [...] "To Autumn" [...] is [...] "the only perfect poem that Keats ever wrote [...] and if this should seem to take from him some measure of credit for his extraordinary enrichment of the English poetic tradition, I would quickly add that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> of absolute perfection in whole poems, in which every part is wholly relevant to and consistent in effect with every other part." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, {{who served}} in the House {{throughout}} Hastert's tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: [...] "Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news. The former speaker should be afforded, like any other American, his day in court to address these very serious accusations. This is a very troubling development that we must learn more about, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> of his family during this difficult time." [...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep our Mission PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E

500|$|In {{his third}} term as Leader, Treatt criticised {{government}} cuts in transport services, but supported reductions in death duty taxes. At a Remembrance Day address in 1952, Treatt criticised radical student politics embodied by the [...] "long-haired intellectual types": [...] "My {{belief in the}} value of university life and in higher education generally is a strong and abiding one...the sort of long-haired type <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> about may not even have a university degree. He is encased in self satisfied assurance of his own mental superiority." [...] In his speech at the Lyceum Hall, Treatt warned of Australia's attitudes on its success: [...] "A sort of mental haze seems to obscure the vision splendid that lies before this country. We are proud of being a British country, a country with British traditions, institutions, and all those things which go to make up what we call our 'British heritage. But this pride is not matched by a pride in being Australian. This seems to me one of the strongest sources of our weakness." ...|$|E
500|$|In the book, {{the narrator}} is not only self-aware, but also alert to every detail around her. Pilgrims second chapter defines two types of seeing: as [...] "verbalization" [...] (active) and as [...] "a letting go" [...] (passive). [...] The narrator refers to the {{difference}} between the two methods as [...] "the difference between walking with and without a camera." [...] Whereas the former requires the need to [...] "analyze and pry", the latter only requires rapt attention. [...] The act of seeing is exhaustive and exhausting, as one of the chapters relates: [...] "I look at the water: minnows and shiners. [...] If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> minnows, a carp will fill my brain till I scream. [...] I look at the water's surface: skaters, bubbles, and leaves sliding down. Suddenly my own face, reflected, startles me witless. [...] Those snails have been tracking my face! Finally, with a shuddering wrench of the will, I see clouds, cirrus clouds. [...] I'm dizzy. I fall in. This looking business is risky." [...] Sandra Johnson refers to the structure of the book itself leading to an epiphany of self-awareness, or a [...] "mystical experience"; as the narrator watches a falling maple key, she feels [...] "lost, sunk ... gazing toward Tinker Mountain and feeling the earth reel down".|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
60|$|In truth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> if girls fall in {{love with}} this sallow hook-nosed, glass-eyed, wooden-legged, dirty, hideous old man, with the sham teeth, they have a queer taste. THAT <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "I don’t know!! (Laughs) I really don’t know. At the time, {{the concept}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of <b>was</b> how far {{we are going to}} go with gangster culture in rap music. That’s really what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about 50 Cent. It started off as Public Enemy and ended with 50 Cent. What was that journey (for rap music) and how did that happen? In London, Bucky is a slang word for gun. It’s a real British, grime word. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> what <b>is</b> the {{aftermath}} of gangster rap? Were they going to get into therapy?" [...] — M.I.A., when asked what [...] "Bucky Done Gun" [...] means by Ashlene Nand.|$|R
6000|$|But you {{stated that}} {{there was much more}} {{interest}} taken in the intellectual developments of the working classes in foreign countries than in England?--Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> of Switzerland or of Zurich. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of France, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of the working classes generally, not specially the manufacturing working classes. I used the words [...] "working classes" [...] generally.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, Seel {{received}} official {{recognition as}} a victim of the Holocaust by the International Organization for Migration's program for aiding Nazi victims. In April 2005, President Jacques Chirac, during the [...] "Journée nationale du souvenir des victimes et des héros de la déportation" [...] (the French equivalent to the Holocaust Memorial Day), said: [...] "In Germany, but also on French territory, men and women whose personal lives were set aside, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> of homosexuals, were hunted, arrested and deported." [...] On 23 February 2008, the municipality of Toulouse renamed a street in the city in honour of Seel. The name plaque reads [...] "Rue Pierre Seel - Déporté français pour homosexualité - 1923-2005".|$|E
2500|$|Many coon {{songs were}} written by whites, but some {{were written by}} African-Americans. [...] Important black composers of coon songs include Ernest Hogan (who wrote [...] "All Coons Look Alike to Me", the most famous coon song); Sam Lucas (who wrote the most racist early coon songs by modern standards); {{minstrel}} and songwriter Sidney L. Perrin (who wrote [...] "Black Annie," [...] "Dat's De Way to Spell Chicken," [...] "Mamma's Little Pumpkin Colored Coons," [...] "Gib Me Ma 15 cents," [...] and [...] "My Dinah"); Bob Cole (who wrote dozens of songs, including [...] "I Wonder What The Coon's Game Is?" [...] and [...] "No Coons Allowed"); and Bert Williams and George Walker. [...] Even classic ragtime composer Scott Joplin wrote at least one coon song (<b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>Thinking</b> of my Pickaninny Days), and may have composed the music for several more, using lyrics written by others.|$|E
2500|$|He went {{to school}} in Turku and in 1939, {{at the age of}} 19, he moved to Helsinki to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure, based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these {{drawings}} hidden, but then destroyed them [...] "at least by the time I went to serve the army." [...] The country became embroiled in the Winter War with the USSR, and then became formally involved in World War II, and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the Finnish Army. He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant. He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German Wehrmacht serving in Finland at that time. [...] "In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> only about the picture itself. The whole Nazi philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway—they had the sexiest uniforms!" [...] After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies.|$|E
