40|$|The Mesabi Range {{along the}} north edge of the Paleoproterozoic Penokean orogen in {{northern}} Minnesota has produced 3. 6 billion metric tons of ore since its discovery in 1890. Of that amount, 2. 3 billion metric tons were extracted from hematite- or goethite-rich deposits generally referred to as "high-grade " ores. The high-grade ores formed as the Biwabik Iron-Formation was oxidized, hydrated, and leached by solutions flowing along open faults and fractures. The source of the ore-forming solutions has been debated since it was first pro-posed that the ores were weathering products formed by descending meteoritic <b>ground-water</b> <b>flowing</b> in late Mesozoic time. Subsequently others believed that the ores were better explained by ascending solutions, poss-bily hydrothermal solutions of pre-Phanerzoic age.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. The formulation and testing of a control-volume finite element method (CVFEM) for the prediction of three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear, diffusion-type phenomena in anisotropic media in irregular calculation domains are presented and discussed in this paper. In this CVFEM, the calculation domain is discretized into four-node tetrahedral elements. Contiguous, non-overlapping, polyhedral control volumes are then associated with each node, and the governing differential equation is integrated over these control volumes. The dependent variable is interpolated linearly in each four-node tetrahedral element. Centroidal values of the diffusion coefficients are stored and assumed to prevail over the corresponding tetrahedral element. The source term is linearized, and nodal values of its coefficients are stored and assumed to prevail over the polyhedral sub-control volumes. Using these interpolation functions, the discretized equations, which are algebraic approximations to the integral conservation equations, are derived. The discretized equations, which in general, are nonlinear and coupled, are solved using an iterative procedure. The proposed CVFEM for the solution of anisotropic diffusion- type problems {{appears to be the}} first such method that is based on tetrahedral elements and vertex-centered polyhedral control volumes. These features make it particularly attractive for amalgamation with adaptive-grid schemes and applications to problems with complex irregular geometries, such those encountered in the general areas of drying, <b>ground-water</b> <b>flows,</b> conduction in composite materials, injection molding in heterogeneous porous media, and solidification.

40|$|The {{water-bearing}} strata in {{the area}} under study consist mainly of fluviatile Pleistocene. The base is formed by the marine Plio-Pleistocene, the top by the Holocene clay and peat deposits. The chemical composition of the ground-water in this aquifer depends on processes related to the geological history, not {{on the type of}} sediment. The most important of these processes is cation exchange, which occurs in two ways. When fresh water replaces salt water in the aquifer, an exchange takes place between the Ca 2 + ions from the ground-water and the exchangeable Na+ ions from the sediments. The reverse process takes place when sea-water infiltrates a sediment with fresh ground-water: the Na+ ions from the sea-water are exchanged for Ca 2 + ions from the sediments. A classification of ground-water according to 8 types was made. These types are indicated on a map and on sections. In {{the western part of the}} area, intrusion of salt water originating from the Eemian transgression can be recognized. During the Calais transgression salt water infiltrated the aquifer; this salt water has gradually been replaced by fresh water. In part of the area salt water also infiltrated during the Duinkerke transgression. In an east-west zone, where the <b>ground-water</b> <b>flows</b> from the high-lying areas in the north and the Pleistocene outcrops in the south converge, the fresh/salt water boundary rises.

40|$|Abstract Develi Basin is a {{semi-arid}} basin {{in central}} Turkey where water sustains both irrigated agriculture and an internationally important wetland, the Sultan Marshes. Agricultural and environmental {{changes in the}} Develi Basin have occurred since irrigation management was transferred in 1994 from a state authority (DSI) to irrigation associations (Kovalı and Ağcaaşar IAs). In this paper we evaluate the practices of the IAs using extensive data from interviews with farmers and IA officials, as well as data from reports prepared by DSI and the IAs, using comparisons with case studies reported in the scientific literature.

40|$|HIG Series, HIG-WRRC - 3 The {{rocks at}} the surface in Anaehoomalu and Lalamilo {{primarily}} are lavas from Mauna Loa which flowed through the saddle between Mauna Kea and Hualalai. These basalt lava flows, partly pahoehoe, but mainly aa, are generally quite permeable. No perched water or dike-impounded water is known in the area, certainly not close to the shore, and the fresh ground water is believed to occur in a thin layer at about sea level. Ground-water flux through the Anaehoomalu and Lalamilo districts {{is thought to be}} quite low, owing to the small recharge which results from the generally low rainfall and the high evapotranspiration. Computations of recharge from annual rainfall and losses from evapotranspiration suggest that the discharge along the shoreline averages only a few million gallons per day per mile. Onshore reconnaissance, which included sampling and electrical resistivity, and an offshore conductivity survey confirm that fresh and brackish water appears to be discharging along the coastline from Hapuna Bay to Keawaiki Bay in quantities too small to be easily detected. No anomalously high ground-water levels which might indicate the presenoe of large <b>ground-water</b> <b>flows</b> were detected. A preliminary survey of salinity of coastal wells, springs, and water hole, and a visual search for ground water discharging at the shoreline did not show any evidence of such discharges on the order of millions of gallons per day. These data prompted an offshore salinity survey and electrical resistivity profiling onshore. The offshore reconnaissance did not detect distinctly fresh water. However, ten areas of discharge of brackish or fresh water were detected. Although it is extremely difficult to determine the exact volume of discharge, a reasonable estimate of the volume of flow of brackish and fresh-water discharges ranges from a few tens of thousands of gallons per day at eight discharge points to perhaps one million gallons per day from each of the two larger discharge zones. No evidence indicates that the flow of brackish and fresh water from the ten discharge points detected by this survey exceeds a few million gallons per day. All of the brackish and fresh-water discharges were detected in bays. It is not known whether this represents the true pattern of discharge or whether water being discharged along headland areas is very rapidly dissipated because of the high concentration of surf energy. Electrical, resistivity profiles using a Wenner spread were taken at 185 locations and electrical resistivity soundings, using a Schlumberger spread, were made at three of these locations. The soundings showed ground water to be very conductive up to sea level, and also indicated that the 70 -foot spacing between sounding sites was appropriate for the profiling. Neither a depression in the fresh-saline interface nor a higher permeability region having fresher water was indicated in the profile. Since profiling data are relative, interpretation is rather simple. By the combined use of sounding and profiling data, a layer of brackish water eight feet thick, equivalent to a head of two-tenths of a foot should have been discernible but no detectable fresh-water body of any thickness was found.

50|$|The primary {{agricultural}} {{nonpoint source}} pollutants are nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), sediment, animal wastes, pesticides, and salts. Agricultural nonpoint sources enter surface water through direct surface runoff or through seepage to ground water that discharges to a surface water outlet.

The sediment produced by erosion can damage fish habitat and wetlands, and often transports excess agricultural chemicals resulting in contaminated runoff. This runoff in turn affects changes to aquatic habitat such as temperature increases and decreased oxygen. The most common sources of excess nutrients in surface water from nonpoint sources are chemical fertilizers and manure from animal facilities. Such nutrients cause eutrophication in surface water. Pesticides used for pest control in agricultural operations can also contaminate surface as well as <b>ground-water</b> resources.

This dissertation analyzes alterations in a closed-basin wetland system {{resulting from the}} construction of a large-scale irrigation project in its catchment. The study was conducted at the Sultan Marshes ecosystem (Develi Basin, Turkey), which has been severely degraded within the last 20 years due to diversion of its major water sources for agricultural irrigation. Spatial changes in the Sultan Marshes from 1980 to 2003 were analyzed using satellite remote sensing. Changes in the areal coverages of lakes, marshes, agricultural, and steppe areas determined by unsupervised classification of four Landsat images showed that both lakes and marshes became smaller after construction of the irrigation project. Steppe areas expanded onto wetlands. Significant portion of northern (Kepir) marshes were converted to agriculture. Hydrologic changes in the Sultan Marshes were analyzed statistically and used to develop a dynamic hydrologic model of the system. Water levels dropped more than one meter in the lakes and marshes from 1993 to 2003, and decreases were observed in ground-water levels and spring flows, although precipitation and evaporation rates remained mostly stable. Simulations with the hydrologic model showed that even if surface water continues to be used for irrigation, reductions in appropriations from ground water and springs would restore and protect water levels in the marshes. Agricultural and environmental changes in the Develi Basin were analyzed after the irrigation management was transferred from state to "irrigation associations" in 1994. The analyses showed that irrigated areas and water use in the Develi Basin showed significant fluctuations. The area allocated to production of high water-consuming plants increased. Water fee collection rates were lower than 100 %. Although soil and water quality in the Develi Basin did not change significantly, <b>ground-water</b> levels, <b>flow</b> rates from springs and water levels in the Sultan Marshes all dropped. Four recommendations were developed that would help to resolve the conflict between agricultural and wetland water requirements: (1) a basin-wide approach water planning, (2) more realistic water pricing, (3) demand-based irrigation scheduling, and (4) rehabilitation of the irrigation system. Economic costs and benefits associated with water diversions from agriculture to the wetlands were estimated, and the optimum or economically-efficient amount of water diversion was determined. When only direct-use values of the wetland (reed cutting, animal grazing and ecotourism) were included, the annual optimum amount of water diversion to the wetlands was found to be 5. 2 million m 3 yr - 1 (165 L s - 1) compared to about 62 million m 3 yr - 1 (1, 957 L s - 1) used in irrigation. Diversion of 5. 2 million m 3 yr - 1 water would be sufficient to restore the conditions in the marshes. The analysis showed that economically-efficient restoration of water levels in the Sultan Marshes is feasible with moderate amounts of water diversion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the palaeohydrographic and geomorphological {{evolution of the}} alluvial plain around Padua during the last millennia, and the relative implications {{for the development of}} early settlements in the present urban area. The first archaeological evidences in Padua date to the late Bronze Age (1400 -– 1000 BC). Since the early Iron Age (9 th century BC) the settlement experienced a progressive expansion and in the 6 th century BC it was already an important urban centre. In the 2 nd century BC Padua became a Roman municipium, being {{one of the most important}} cities in NE Italy. Latin historians wrote that it was crossed by a large river, called the Meduacus, which was identified with the Brenta River in previous archaeological studies. The Brenta River is Latter tThis latter is becomes an important Alpine river which that now flows about 5 km NE of Padua. SAt least since the Middle Ages the Bacchiglione River, a minor course partly fed by <b>ground-water,</b> has been <b>flowing</b> within the city centre along the two characteristic meanders; it was artificially diverted only in the 19 th century in order to protect the city from floodings. As the recent urban expansion limits the possibility to investigate the urban area with remote sensing and field survey, the investigation focuses on the alluvial plain which extends at the western outskirts of Padua. A 70 km 2 area was analysed through the integrated use of vertical and oblique aerial photographs, satellite images, digital terrain models (DTM), field survey and corings. The most ancient Holocene channel belt recognized in the study area is the Mestrino-Rubano (MR) one, which incised the LGM alluvial plain formed during the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) period. It was formed by the Brenta River between the Lateglacial and 6300 cal BP. A palaeochannel named "La Storta" has a high geomorphic evidence and was recognized for a stretch of 13 km; it probably was the last active river bed in the MR channel belt, between 8400 and 6300 cal BP. The present Bacchiglione River follows another, more recent Brenta River channel belt, named Veggiano-Selvazzano (VS) channel belt. The meanders of present in the Padua city centre of Padua most probably belong to this channel belt. Chronostratigraphic data indicate that the VS channel belt was active in the 2 nd millennium BC. This implies that Padua was probably crossed by the Brenta River during the Bronze Age. A single radiocarbon dating suggests that the VS Brenta River was active also in during the 2 nd-– 5 th century AD. Such indication brings about the possibility that the Brenta River may have been flowing through the city also during the Iron Age and in Roman times, and that the Bacchiglione River established its present course in early Medieval times. This hypothesis has important implications for the reconstruction of the topography of ancient Padua, but it is based on a weak chronostratigraphy, which should be better investigated in the future. It contradicts geoarchaeological observations, which indicate no evidences of the sedimentary activity of such a large river in the city centre later than the end of the 2 nd millennium BC. Moreover, previous geomorphological investigations show that the Brenta River was following the present direction since the beginning of the 1 st millennium BC, which means that in the Iron Age and in Roman times the river would flow several kilometres east of the city...|$|R
40|$|The Yucca Mountain area {{is being}} {{evaluated}} by the US Department of Energy for its suitability to store high-level nuclear waste in a mined, underground repository. Hydrologic data are being collected by the US Geological Survey throughout a 150 Km{sup 2 } study area about 15 - Km northwest of Las Vegas in southern Nevada for site characterization studies. Ongoing hydrologic studies are investigating atmospheric precipitation, stream-flow, movement of water through the unsaturated zone, movement of water through the saturated zone, and paleohydrology. This study at Fortymile Wash involves some components {{of each of these}} studies. Fortymile Wash is an ephemeral stream near Yucca Mountain with tributaries draining the east side of Yucca Mountain and then forming a distributary system in the Amargosa Desert. An objective of the study is to determine the amount of recharge from Fortymile Wash to the <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system that has been proposed. Understanding the <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system is important because it is a possible mechanism for radionuclide migration from the repository to the accessible environment. An adequate understanding of the <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system is necessary for an evaluation of the safety issues involved in siting the potential repository...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a new taxonomy for elastic, sedimentary porous media. The taxonomy is synthesized {{for the investigation}} and characterization of <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> from accumulating developments in the genetic analysis of elastic, sedimentary depositional structures. Genetic analysis recognizes spatial associations of elastic, sedimentary structures imposed during genesis. The taxonomy is a nested hierarchy of discrete elastic, sedimentary structures distinguished by the bounding surfaces created during their emplacement and rearrangement. The investigation and characterization of a specific <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system in elastic, sedimentary porous media can be improved by imposing a structural context on lithologie observations, geophysical measurements, head measurements, and hydraulic conductivity estimates. Globally-valid and transferable descriptions of structures in the taxonomy from modern exposures, outcrops, and densely sampled subsurface systems are modified to fit site-specific geologic observations and measurements. A specific procedure is developed for applying the taxonomy in the investigation and analysis of <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow.</b> The procedure quantitatively measures the hydraulic validity of alternative geologic interpretations of site-specific data under the taxonomy. The application of the taxonomy and procedure to a typical set of data types, densities, and quality is illustrated with data from a site of ground-water contamination investigation...|$|E
40|$|By {{coupling}} two {{commonly used}} computer programs, MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988) and MT 3 Dms (Zheng and Wang, 1998), the SEAWAT program {{was developed to}} simulate variable-density, transient <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> in three dimensions. Freshwater head and salt concentration are used as the two principal dependent variables. Major improvements from the previous version of SEAWAT include (1) reformulation of the flow equation based on the conservation of mass, (2) modification of stress packages to allow variable-density sources and sinks, and (3) incorporation of an implicit coupling procedure between the flow and solute-transport equations. These improvements produce more accurate simulation results and extend {{the applicability of the}} code to a wider range of hydrogeologic problems. The SEAWAT program has been widely used in southern Florida by the U. S. Geological Survey and CDM-Missimer International to investigate coastal <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> processes. Seven applications have been completed or are in progress and pertain to the following types of hydrogeologic problems: availability of brackish ground water, saltwater intrusion, surface water and ground-water interactions, submarine ground-water discharge, and effectiveness of salinity barriers. For each application, the SEAWAT program was successfully used to investigate the effects of fluid density variations on <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> rates and patterns...|$|E
40|$|In {{support of}} Yucca Mountain site {{characterization}} studies, a hydrogeologic framework was developed, and a hydrogeologic map was constructed for the Death Valley region. The region, covering approximately 100, 000 km{sup 2 } along the Nevada-California border near Las Vegas, {{is characterized by}} isolated mountain ranges juxtaposed against broad, alluvium-filled valleys. Geologic conditions are typical of the Basin and Range Province; a variety of sedimentary and igneous intrusive and extrusive rocks {{have been subjected to}} both compressional and extensional deformation. The regional <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system can best be described as a series of connected intermontane basins in which <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> occurs in basin-fill deposits, carbonate rocks, clastic rocks, and volcanic rocks. Previous investigations have developed more site-specific hydrogeologic relationships; however, few have described all the lithologies within the Death Valley regional <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system. Information required to characterize the hydrogeologic units in the region was obtained from regional geologic maps and reports. Map data were digitized from regional geologic maps and combined into a composite map using a geographic information system. This map was simplified to show 10 laterally extensive hydrogeologic units with distinct hydrologic properties. The hydraulic conductivity values for the hydrogeologic units range over 15 orders of magnitude due to the variability in burial depth and degree of fracturing...|$|E
40|$|The Cedar River {{alluvial}} aquifer is {{the primary}} source of municipal water in the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, area. Since 1992, the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the City of Cedar Rapids, has investigated the hydrogeology and water quality of the Cedar River alluvial aquifer. This report describes a detailed analysis of the <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system in the alluvial aquifer, particularly near well field areas. The <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> system in the Cedar Rapids area consists of two main components, the unconsolidated Quaternary deposits and the underlying carbonate bedrock that has a variable fracture density. Quaternary deposits consist of eolian sand, loess, alluvium, and glacial till. Devonian and Silurian bedrock aquifers overlie the Maquoketa Shale (Formation) of Ordovician age, a regional confining unit. Ground-water and surface-water data were collected during the study to better define the hydrogeology of the Cedar River alluvial aquifer and Devonian and Silurian aquifers. Stream stage and discharge, ground-water levels, and estimates of aquifer hydraulic properties were used to develop a conceptual <b>ground-water</b> <b>flow</b> model and to construct and calibrate a model of the flow system. This model was used to quantify the movement of water between the various components of the alluvial aquifer flow system and provide an improved understanding of the hydrology of the alluvial aquifer...|$|E
