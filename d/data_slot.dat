40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that CSMA-type random access {{algorithms}} can achieve the maximum throughput in wireless ad hoc networks. Central to these results is a distributed randomized algorithm which selects schedules according a product-form distribution. The product-form distribution is achieved by considering a continuous-time Markov model of an idealized CSMA protocol under which collisions cannot occur. In this paper, we present an algorithm which achieves the same product-form distribution in a discrete-time setting where collision of data packets is avoided through the exchange of control messages (however, the control messages are allowed to collide as in the 802. 11 suite of protocols). In our discrete-time model, each time slot consists of a few control mini-slots followed by a <b>data</b> <b>slot.</b> We show that two control mini-slots are sufficient for our distributed scheduling algorithm to realize the same steady-state distribution as in the continuous-time case.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} a new synchronous and distributed {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol for multihop wireless networks that provides bandwidth guarantees to unicast connections. Our MAC protocol {{is based on a}} slotted time division multiple access (TDMA) architecture, with a multi-mini-slotted signaling phase scheduling data transmissions over slots in the following data phase. Resolving contentions {{at the beginning of a}} frame allows for effective utilization of bandwidth. Our protocol essentially combines the benefits of TDMA architecture with the distributed reservation mechanism of IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol, thereby performing well even at high loads. We implement a two-way handshake before each <b>data</b> <b>slot</b> to avoid deadlocks, a phenomena that plagues 802. 11. Through theoretical analysis, we derive the system throughput achieved by our MAC protocol.

40|$|In a {{wireless}} network using CSMA for MAC, packet collisions can result {{either because of}} the vulnerability stemming from the idle channel detection delay of the radio device or because of the hidden terminal problem. Both of these collision scenarios can be addressed by applying some additional structure to carrier sense-based channel access, sacrificing throughput to improve collision protection. Specifically, we assign a unique time slice to each contending transmitter {{that is designed to}} allow collision-free access to each <b>data</b> <b>slot</b> while still using carrier sense as the mechanism to determine channel state. The width of each time slice is equal to the idle channel detection delay of the radio.

We discuss this method of channel access including tradeoffs and requirements, and analyze the performance in comparison with existing MAC strategies...|$|E

This paper studies the performance of a-persistence Slotted Aloha contention resolution algorithm (CRA), subject to extreme interstation correlation, {{by means of a}} discrete-time Markov chain analysis. We examine in detail the conditions leading to a deadlock—a situation where the time to collision resolution becomes unacceptably high and the system is practically unstable. We analyze two disaster scenario deadlock models, and study the effect of channel error probability, signalling traffic load, and the contention resolution algorithm used. We show that the key factor of the CRA is the collision rate and not channel errors. We propose and test three signalling channel capacity allocation schemes. We identify the best-performing of these three schemes as the cyclic contention mini-slot (CMS) sharing employing multiple CMSs per <b>data</b> <b>slot.</b> Finally, we demonstrate the need for implementation of an added scheme, which dynamically adjusts the-persistence parameter.

30|$|A {{preamble}} (PRE) is newly introduced {{within the}} broadcasted feedback frame, concretely between the ACK and the FPB, to enable synchronization after power-sleep modus (i.e., either idle or shutdown, see [19, 22]). The intuitive reasoning is the following: (i) the feedback frame is an aggregation of an ACK and the FBP {{in order to}} save PHY header overhead and therefore energy consumption at reception, that is, the ACK is essential only to the body sensor, which transmitted in the previous contention-free <b>data</b> <b>slot.</b> Hence, body sensors can prolong their power-sleep modus until the immediate reception of the FBP; (ii) the precise position of the PRE between the ACK and the FBP is mainly due to scalability in terms of energy efficiency. This means that in a future system design, several ACKs may be aggregated just before the preamble (PRE). Body sensors within the DQ-MAC system not being addressed in this multicast/aggregated communication shall only receive the FBP. This is the reason why a preamble is suitable in this explicit position.|$|E
