The performances of conventional high strength steels are not sufficient. It has been found out that bake hardenable steel sheets are an excellent solution to the above problem. These steels offer good formability (low yield strength for good shape fixability) during press operations and also higher final yield strength during paint baking operations for good dent resistance. Paint <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> is essentially the strain aging increment found after forming and aging for 20 minutes at 180 °C. It is commonly assumed in the steel industry that the carbon and nitrogen in solution in the ferrite at the time of paint <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> is responsible for the <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> strengthening increment observed.

In this work, the effect of pre-straining and bake-hardening on the microstructure and mechanical properties has been investigated in thermomechanically processed CMnSi Transformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels with and without additions of Nb and Mo. The steels were characterised before and after <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> at 180 oC for 30 min. by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atom probe tomography (APT), and tensile tests.

40|$|<b>Bake</b> <b>hardening</b> {{effect is}} a {{phenomenon}} of static strain aging and utilized in the manufacturing of automotive components. <b>Bake</b> <b>hardening</b> occurs at elevated temperature of around 170 °C during the paint-baking cycle of the formed components. It leads to the strength increment by the diffusion of carbon atoms to the dislocations during the drying of paint. Steels with ferritic microstructure {{are known to be}} susceptible to aging phenomenon. In addition, low carbon steels and ferritic stainless steels are used to produce certain automotive components. The aim of this work is to study the static strain aging phenomenon of two low carbon steels and a ferritic stainless steel, more importantly, by means of <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> tests. This thesis consists of two parts, namely literature study and research parts. The literature study covers the topics like carbon steel, ferritic stainless steel, strain aging, and <b>bake</b> <b>hardening.</b> Two low carbon steels with small difference of production history and EN 1. 4003 ferritic stainless steel were used for the experiments. <b>Bake</b> <b>hardening</b> (BH) tests, consisting of pre-straining to 0 %, 2 %, 6 %, and 10 % and following heat-treatments of 170 °C/ 20 min and 230 °C/ 20 min, respectively, were conducted. The purpose of the heat treatments was to simulate the paint baking process after press forming. In addition, to evaluate the aging behavior during storage, a heat treatment of 100 °C/ 30 min (boiling water) was carried out and was followed by tensile testing, respectively. The study indicates that two low carbon steels have very similar initial properties and behavior in the experiments. The 170 °C/ 20 min heat treatment increased 41 MPa and 230 °C/ 20 min increased around 130 MPa in yield strength of the low carbon steels, while for EN 1. 4003 ferritic stainless steel, these two numbers are 20 and 8 MPa, respectively. The yield strength generally increased and elongation decreased with the increase of heat-treatment temperature and pre-strain. The higher baking temperature led to greater BH index generally. The BH index of low carbon steel increased from 19 MPa to around 54 MPa along with the pre-strain increasing from 0 % to 10 % when baked at 170 °C, while it decreased from 72 MPa to 58 MPa when baked at 230 °C. The 100 °C/ 30 min aging treatment did not produce significant influence on the properties of three investigated ferritic steels. It can be concluded that the bake-hardening is the main mechanism of achieving strength increase, and it heavily depends on the dislocation caused during pre-strain...|$|R

Once <b>baked,</b> it can be cut, drilled, painted, sanded, and sliced thinly.According to information from Staedtler, Fimo contains polyvinyl chloride (PVC), but has not contained any phthalates since 2006.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ultra-rapid {{annealing}} (URA) {{experiments were}} carried out to study the effect of heating rate on the recrystallization kinetics, grain size and Bake-hardening (BH) properties of Ultra-low carbon <b>Bake</b> <b>Hardening</b> Steel annealing with different heating rates followed by gas cooling (about 100 ℃/s) with variation of soaking times. It was shown {{that the degree of}} grain refinement is controlled by the parameters of heating rates and soaking time of the Ultra-rapid annealing cycles. For the steels investigated, the final grain size decreases with increasing heating rate and increases with increasing soaking time. The effects of dislocation density, varied by means of non-temper rolling reduction and a temper rolling reduction of 1 % on the Bake-hardening properties were investigated within an aging temperature of 170 ℃ for 20 min...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of martensite during tempering or ageing {{is an important}} phenomenon as it leads {{to changes in the}} mechanical properties. These changes could take place during both steel manufacturing or in-service. Thus, their understanding is required to predict the material performance. Recent advances in the development of local electrode atom probes has led to {{a significant increase in the}} analysed volume of material (up to 100 millions of atoms) and at the same time reduced the acquisition times. This allows improvement in data statistics when investigating fine nanoscale features, such as solute segregation, clustering and ultrafine precipitation. Selected results of atom probe studies on the {{decomposition of}} martensite from <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> of a pre-strained Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel and ageing of FeNiTiMnAl maraging steel are presented...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{vehicle bodies}} make {{intensive}} use of {{high strength steel}} grades to improve the weight and the mechanical performance simultaneously. A broad range of medium and extra high strength steel grades is available. These steel grades have different characteristics concerning strength, formability and weldability. For many steel grades microalloying by niobium {{is the key to}} achieve their characteristic property profile. In HSLA steels niobium enhances the strength primarily by grain refinement. In interstitial free high strength steels niobium serves as a stabilizing element and also assists in obtaining the <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> effect. Some modern multiphase steels rely on niobium to achieve additional strength via grain refinement and precipitation hardening. Microstructural control provides a way to further optimize properties relevant to automotive processing such as cutting, forming and welding. The relevance of niobium microalloying in that respect will be outlined...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{material}} screening tests with different, labory-prepared steel samples, three steels presenting different types strengthening mechanisms have been selected for a detailed characterization concerning the applicability as a motorcar body sheet material and have been compared with the conventional steel FePO 4 : a phosphorus-silicon alloyed steel with solution strengthening, a dual phase steel with microstructure hardening and a niobium-microalloyed steel with precipitation hardening. In addition, these steels exhibit the <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> effect. In all tests on static and dynamic strength, fatigue life, shaping, resistance spot welding and riveting the dual phase steel proved to be superior to the FePO 4 steel. Using this steel a weight reduction of 20 - 25 % can be achieved.

40|$|The {{effect of}} prestraining (PS) and <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> (BH) on the microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties {{has been studied}} in transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and dual-phase (DP) steels after intercritical annealing. The DP steel showed {{an increase in the}} yield strength and the appearance of the upper and lower yield points after a single BH treatment as compared with the as-received condition, whereas the mechanical properties of the TRIP steel remained unchanged. This difference appears to be because of the formation of plastic deformation zones with high dislocation density around the “as-quenched” martensite in the DP steel, which allowed carbon to pin these dislocations, which, in turn, increased the yield strength. It was found for both steels that the BH behavior depends on the dislocation rearrangement in ferrite with the formation of cell, microbands, and shear band structures after PS. The strain-induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite in the TRIP steel contributes to the formation of a complex dislocation structure. <br /...|$|R
