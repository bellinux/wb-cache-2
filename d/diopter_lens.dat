40|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} dyslexic children present systematic postural deficiency. Clinicians {{use a combination of}} ophthalmic prisms and proprioceptive soles to improve postural performances. This study examines the effects of convergent prisms and spherical lenses on posture. Fourteen dyslexics (13 - 17 years-old) and 11 non dyslexics (13 - 16 years-old) participated in the study. Quiet stance posturography was performed with the TechnoConcept device while subjects fixated a target at eye-level from a distance of 1 _m. Four conditions were run: normal viewing; viewing the target with spherical lenses of - 1 diopter (ACCOM 1) over each eye; viewing with - 3 diopters over each eye (ACCOM 3); viewing with a convergent prism of 8 diopters per eye. Relative to normal viewing, the - 1 lenses increased the surface of body sway significantly whereas the - 3 <b>diopter</b> <b>lenses</b> only resulted in a significant increase of antero-posterior body sway. Thus, adolescents would appear to cope more effectively with stronger conflicts rather than subtle ones. The prism condition resulted in a significant increase in both the surface and the antero-posterior body sway. Importantly, all of these effects were similar for the two groups. Wavelet analysis (time frequency domain) revealed high spectral power of antero-posterior sway for the prism condition in both groups. In the ACCOM 3 condition, the spectral power of antero-posterior sway decreased for non dyslexics but increased for dyslexics suggesting that dyslexics encounter more difficulty with accommodation. The cancelling time for medium range frequency (believed to be controlled by the cerebellum), was shorter in dyslexics, suggesting fewer instances of optimal control. We conclude that dyslexics achieve similar postural performances albeit less efficiently. Prisms and lenses destabilize posture for all teenagers. Thus, contrary to adults, adolescents do not seem to use efferent, proprioceptive ocular motor signals to improve their posture, at least not immediately when confronted to convergence accommodation conflict...|$|R

METHODS: An analysis was made of 30 patients(30 eyes) who received cataract surgery combined with silicone oil removal in our hospital from June 2012 to December 2012. Before the operation and one month afterwards, the axial length was measured by both IOL-Master and A-scan, and all the results {{were divided into two}} groups: A-scan group and IOL-Master group. Then we used IOL-Master to calculate the intraocular <b>lens</b> <b>diopter</b> and to estimate the postoperative refraction.

40|$|BACKGROUND Panretinal {{photocoagulation}} (PRP) is {{done for}} severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). When it {{is done for}} patients without macular oedema PDR may induce a macular oedema which may worsen the visual acuity. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted for one year with minimum follow up period of 6 months. Seventy eyes of 41 patients who were undergoing PRP for severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy were studied. These eyes had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 0. 6 and no macular oedema as determined by clinical examination using 78 <b>diopter</b> <b>lens</b> and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)) (Zeiss Cirrus HD OCT). The BCVA was determined using decimal charts and converted into logarithm of minimal angle of resolution scale for statistical analysis. Visual acuity and macular thickness at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post PRP were studied. RESULTS The Central Macular Thickness (CMT) measurements (mean±standard deviation) were 160 ± 15 before PRP and 176 ± 16, 178 ± 20, 189 ± 30, 187 ± 25 µm at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after PRP respectively (P 0. 05 for each).

40|$|Masayo Kimura, Miho Nozaki, Munenori Yoshida, Yuichiro Ogura Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan Purpose: Optical {{coherence}} tomography angiography (OCTA) is a {{newly developed}} technology which {{allows us to}} reconstruct the three-dimensional chorioretinal vasculature without dye injection. OCTA is a noninvasive, rapid, and reproducible method to assess retinal ischemia. However, one of its limitations {{is the size of}} scanning area. A novel yet simple technique to expand the scan length on optical coherence tomography has been reported as an extended field imaging (EFI) technique. It involves imaging the posterior pole through trial frames fitted with a + 20 <b>diopter</b> <b>lens.</b> We applied this technique to OCTA to evaluate retinal vein occlusion. Materials and methods: Ten eyes of nine patients with retinal vein occlusion were studied. The average age was 69. 0 years (range: 49 – 93 years). We obtained OCTA images by using RTVue XR Avanti OCT with AngioVue®. The images of OCTA with scan size of 8 × 8 mm were obtained with and without EFI, and then they were compared. Results: OCTA with EFI technique was performed successfully in all eyes. The nonperfusion area was well defined in superficial capillary plexus layer. The images with EFI were able to capture the larger area of the fundus by an average of 188. 5 % than those without EFI. The posterior pole inside the vascular arcade was well covered with this technique. The area of the fundus imaged by OCTA with EFI technique was even larger than that of fluorescein angio­graphy using Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2, which captured a 30 ° field. Conclusion: Our results suggested that OCTA with EFI technique is very useful to evaluate the retinal ischemia in retinal vein occlusion.

40|$|Objective: Presbyopia is {{a common}} age-related {{condition}} that prevents people from focusing on near objects. The etiology of presbyopia continues to be debated, but the end effect of all postulated mechanisms {{is the lack of}} deformation of the human lens. Using our understanding of the biomechanical properties of the natural human lens, we created a unique accommodating intraocular lens. Although this lens can be used for lenticular disease such as myopia and hyperoperopia, this study addresses the needs of cataract patients with presbyopia. Methods: The lens was implanted into presbyopic human cadaver eyes. Focal length of the lens was measured with simulated muscle contraction. Lens dimensions were measured using artificial tissue and a finite-element analysis (FEA) to simulate accommodation. Lens power was measured at various fill volumes. Accelerated soak testing for an equivalent of 7. 4 years was performed and lens weight and optical transmittance were measured. Results: Previously presbyopic human eyes were able to accommodate between 2. 0 and 7. 4 <b>diopters</b> after <b>lens</b> implantation. FEA and lens measurements demonstrated a change in curvature of the anterior and posterior portions of the lens during accommodation. After accelerated aging, lens weight remained unchanged and optical transmission was 96 %. Lens power increased with fill volume.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the individual effects of forward light scatter (FLS) and refractive blur on low-contrast {{vision and the}} size of the disk halo produced in response to an external glare source. Methods: Monocular disk halo radius, high- and low-contrast distance visual acuity (HCVA, LCVA), and contrast sensitivity (CS) were determined in 25 eyes of 25 healthy subjects under normal, FLS, and blur conditions. FLS was induced using the filter Black ProMist 2 to simulate an early cataract. Blur was induced using a + 1. 00 <b>diopter</b> <b>lens</b> to simulate an uncorrected refractive error. Results: Similar significant mean increases in halo radius were observed for the FLS (0. 32 ± 0. 10 log arc min; P <. 0001) and refractive blur (0. 40 ± 0. 18 log arc min; P <. 0001). Under induced blur, 3 lines of HCVA (0. 32 ± 0. 15 logMAR; P <. 0001) and 4 lines of LCVA (0. 39 ± 0. 16 logMAR; P <. 0001) were lost. FLS had a minimal (but significant) effect on HCVA, but worsened mean LCVA by more than 1 line (0. 13 ± 0. 10 logMAR; P <. 0001). Similar significant mean CS reductions of 0. 17 ± 0. 12 (P <. 0001) and 0. 14 ± 0. 12 log units (P <. 0001) were produced in response to FLS and refractive blur, respectively (approximately 1 triplet). Conclusions: Forward light scatter and refractive blur contributed to an increased size of the disk halo produced by a glare source in similar proportion. Although defocus blur has a substantial effect on LCVA, a loss of more than 1 line of LCVA after best refractive correction would be indicative of FLS...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple method to assign {{a diagnosis of}} cataract to patients with obscurely impaired vision {{as well as to}} those with mild lens opacities. When the narrowest slit is used in a slitlamp examination, a small beam of light appears on the macula. Routine fundoscopy with the 78. 0 <b>diopter</b> <b>lens</b> or a 3 -mirror glass is appropriate. If a cataract is present, the beam of light is scattered into several straight lines, distorted lines, or both. This has proved a useful diagnostic tool when the lens appears clear but the patient’s vision is impaired, and extensive examinations such as computer tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance tomography for impaired vision may be avoided. The beam-deflection method uses de-vices that are generally available and can detect cataract {{in the early stages of}} develop-ment. J Cataract Refract Surg 2001; 27 : 994 – 999 © 2001 ASCRS and ESCRS In cases of mild cataract with faint lens opacities, itmay be difficult to find the cause of obscurely im-paired vision. The ophthalmologist may fail to recognize zones of increased light scattering in the nuclear region of the crystalline lens when brunescence is not present. Thus, unremarkable morphology of the eye compart-ments calls for intensive evaluation including perimetry, electrophysiology, and neuroradiology. These examina-tions may be avoided by using a simple method we de-veloped to clarify the diagnosis of impaired vision caused by cataract. This beam-deflection approach comple-ments the classic methods of investigation, which typi-cally consist of slitlamp examination with lateral light, Scheimpflug imaging, 1 and laser scattering. 2 During fundus examinations with the 3 -mirror glass, we observed that the slitlamp’s beam was de-formed by lens opacities.

Intervention: Bimanual phacoemulsification. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were far, near, and intermediate visual acuity of the 4 IOL-implanted groups. Secondary outcomes were defocusing curves, contrast sensitivity, patients' {{quality of life}} (7 -item visual function questionnaire [VF- 7], halos and glare presence, overall satisfaction), and spectacle independence. Snellen visual acuity was measured as uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA), best distance corrected near visual acuity (BDCNVA), best corrected near visual acuity (BCNVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA), and best distance corrected intermediate visual acuity (BDCIVA).

The 8 -Br-cAMP significantly inhibited development of lens-induced myopia (group 1 : 0. 1 mM versus vehicle: + 1. 71 ± 1. 22 D versus 8. 00 ± 2. 19 D; 1 mM versus vehicle: + 1. 38 ± 1. 34 D versus 9. 96 ± 1. 14 D, mean ± SEM, P < 0. 01 for both); 1 mM, but not 0. 1 mM 8 -Br-cAMP increased expression of retinal ApoA 1 levels in right eyes (P < 0. 01). The 8 -Br-cAMP had minimal effect on normal eye growth. Both retinal cAMP and ApoA 1 levels were significantly increased only in hyperopic eyes (group 4). CONCLUSIONS. The 8 -Br-cAMP robustly inhibited development of lens-induced myopia. The increase in retinal ApoA 1 observed in cAMP-treated and hyperopic eyes suggested a possible interplay between ApoA 1 and cAMP in regulating eye growth. School of Optometr...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. The {{immediate}} {{early gene}} Egr- 1 is thought to form part of the pathway that mediates abnormal ocular growth. This study investigated whether the mRNA expression levels of Egr- 1 in a mammalian retina are modulated differentially, depending on the direction of ocular growth. METHODS. To induce accelerated growth and myopia, guinea pigs wore a - 5 <b>diopter</b> (D) <b>lens</b> over one eye from 4 to 11 days of age. To induce inhibited growth, the lens was removed after 7 days of - 5 D lens wear, and the eye allowed to recover from myopia for 3 days. Ocular parameters and Egr- 1 mRNA levels were subsequently assessed, and compared to untreated fellow eyes and eyes from untreated littermates. Possible circadian changes in Egr- 1 mRNA levels were also determined in 18 additional animals by taking measures every 4 hours during a 24 -hour cycle. RESULTS. Ocular compensation to a - 5 D lens occurred after 7 days (Delta - 4. 8 D, Delta + 147 mu m growth, N = 20). In 5 highly myopic eyes (Delta - 7. 4 D), Egr- 1 mRNA levels in the retina were significantly downregulated relative to contralateral control (51 %) and age-matched untreated (47 %) eyes. Three days after the - 5 D lens was removed, eyes had recovered from the myopia (Delta - 0. 5 D, relative change of + 2. 9 D, N = 4) and Egr- 1 mRNA levels were significantly elevated relative to contralateral (212 %) and untreated (234 %) eyes, respectively. Normal Egr- 1 mRNA expression was higher {{in the middle of}} the day than {{in the middle of the}} night. Immunolabeling showed strong Egr- 1 reactivity in cell bodies in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. CONCLUSIONS. Egr- 1 mRNA levels in a mammalian retina show a bi-directional persistent response to opposing ocular growth stimuli. This suggests retinal Egr- 1 might act as a signal for the direction of ocular growth in different species. School of Optometr...|$|R
40|$|Background: Assessment of {{optic disc}} size is an {{important}} component of optic nerve head examination. Agreement between different methods of disc size measurements is not very good. Purpose: To assess the agreement between the disc size assessed by Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) and stereobiomicroscopy with a 90 <b>diopter</b> (D) <b>lens.</b> To report the clinical (measured by biomicroscopy) disc diameters of small, average and large optic discs categorized by HRT disc areas. Setting and Design: Observational study of subjects examined in the glaucoma clinic of a tertiary eye institute. Materials and Methods: Seventy-five eyes of 75 glaucoma subjects were studied. Disc diameter was measured using stereobiomicroscopy and HRT. The agreement between the two sets of measurements was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Discs were classified into small (&# 60; 1. 6 mm 2), average (1. 6 - 2. 6 mm 2) and large (> 2. 6 mm 2) depending on cutoffs provided by the manufacturers of HRT. The means (95 &#x 0025; CI) of the corresponding vertical disc diameter in these groups were assessed. Statistical Analysis: ICC, Bland and Altman plots. Results: ICC for measurements of clinical and HRT horizontal disc diameter was 0. 518 and for vertical disc diameter measurement was 0. 487. The mean difference between the clinical and HRT measurements as analyzed by the Bland and Altman plot was 0. 17 (95 &#x 0025; CI, 0. 13 - 0. 47) for horizontal and 0. 22 (95 &#x 0025; CI, 0. 11 - 0. 54) for vertical disc diameter. Of the 75 eyes, 3 eyes had small discs, 54 average and 18 large discs. The mean clinical vertical disc diameter for small discs was 1. 55 mm (95 &#x 0025; CI, 1. 2 - 1. 7), for average discs was 1. 91 mm (95 &#x 0025; CI, 1. 87 - 1. 96) and for large discs was 2. 15 mm (95 &#x 0025; CI, 2. 03 - 2. 27). Conclusion: The agreement between clinical and HRT disc diameter measurements is moderate. Disc diameter measurement on stereobiomicroscopy can be used to categorize discs into small, average and large discs...|$|R
