5|$|Noether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927) {{characterized}} the rings {{in which the}} ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0 or 1-dimensional, and <b>integrally</b> closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.|$|E

25|$|Mormonism {{arose in}} the 1820s {{during a period of}} radical reform and {{experimentation}} within American Protestantism, and Mormonism is <b>integrally</b> connected to that religious environment. As a form of Christian primitivism, the new faith was one among several contemporary religious movements that claimed to restore Christianity to its condition {{at the time of the}} Twelve Apostles.|$|E
25|$|Paraguay {{also lost}} its {{financial}} independence {{as it became}} deeply indebted to foreign creditors. Moreover, those foreign creditors (mainly British) also took over critical infrastructures which had been developed <b>integrally</b> by the state without any kind of external financing, such as the railroad system. The imposition of those predatory practices {{under the banner of}} free trade curtailed the incipient development of Paraguay's economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{algebraic}} number theory, the rings of algebraic integers are Dedekind rings, which constitute therefore an important class of commutative rings. Considerations related to modular arithmetic {{have led to}} the notion of a valuation ring. The restriction of algebraic field extensions to subrings has led to the notions of integral extensions and <b>integrally</b> closed domains as well as the notion of ramification of an extension of valuation rings.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} new rings out of given ones. The aim of such constructions is often to improve certain properties of the ring so as to make it more readily understandable. For example, an integral domain that is <b>integrally</b> closed in its field of fractions is called normal. This is a desirable property, for example any normal one-dimensional ring is necessarily regular. Rendering a ring normal is known as normalization.|$|E
25|$|The engine's design {{concentrated}} on the reduction of moving parts. The cooling fan and dynamo were built <b>integrally</b> with the one-piece crankshaft, removing the need for drive belts. The use of gaskets, seen as another potential weak point for failure and leaks, was also kept to a minimum. The cylinder heads are mated to the cylinder barrels by lapped joints with extremely fine tolerances, as are {{the two halves of}} the crankcase and other surface-to-surface joints.|$|E
25|$|The museum {{archives}} contain private {{papers and}} records originating from individuals, usually artists or photographers, {{that are often}} <b>integrally</b> connected to the museum's art collection. Among these records are the personal archives of photographers Laura Gilpin (1891–1979), Eliot Porter (1901–1990), and Karl Struss (1886–1981). The archives also house the business records of the Roman Bronze Works (est. 1897-closed 1988) of Queens, New York, long one of America’s premier art bronze foundries, {{and a range of}} documents related to the ACMAA's institutional history.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the soundboards of both {{northern}} and Italian virginals were pierced with a rose, sometimes {{two or three}} in early days. The rose had no acoustic function, and was purely decorative. Although these were {{a throwback to the}} rose in the medieval lute, they were never carved <b>integrally</b> as part of the soundboard. In Italian instruments they were usually constructed by combining multiple layers of pierced parchment, so that the final result looked like a gothic rose window, or an inverted wedding cake. In Flemish instruments, the rose was usually cast from lead and gilded, and usually incorporated the maker's initials.|$|E
25|$|The {{lightweight}} demand helmets {{in general}} use by surface-supplied divers are <b>integrally</b> ballasted for neutral buoyancy in the water, {{so they do}} not float off the diver's head or pull upwards on the neck, but the larger volume free-flow helmets would be too heavy and cumbersome if they had all the required weight built in. Therefore, they are either ballasted after dressing the diver by fastening weights to the lower parts of the helmet assembly, so the weight is carried on the shoulders when out of the water, or the helmet may be held down by a jocking strap and the harness weights provide the ballast.|$|E
25|$|Although, due to {{the humid}} climate of Central America, {{relatively}} few Mayan paintings have survived {{to the present day}} <b>integrally,</b> important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of Calakmul; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucatán's and Belize's east coast (Tancah, Tulum, Santa Rita).|$|E
25|$|The rise of Islamic civilization coincides {{strongly}} with {{the spread of}} Sufi philosophy in Islam. The spread of Sufism has been considered a definitive factor in the spread of Islam, and {{in the creation of}} <b>integrally</b> Islamic cultures, especially in Africa and Asia. The Senussi tribes of Libya and the Sudan are one of the strongest adherents of Sufism. Sufi poets and philosophers such as Khoja Akhmet Yassawi, Rumi, and Attar of Nishapur (c. 1145 – c. 1221) greatly enhanced the spread of Islamic culture in Anatolia, Central Asia, and South Asia. Sufism also played a role in creating and propagating the culture of the Ottoman world, and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South Asia.|$|E
25|$|New York grew in {{importance}} as a trading port while under British {{rule in the}} early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, {{more than any other}} city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became <b>integrally</b> tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, {{although}} also <b>integrally</b> {{connected to}} unimodal AES neurons, {{are not directly}} connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected {{in other areas of}} the cortex, resulting in the observation that cortical and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated. Stein, London, Wilkinson and Price (1996) analysed the perceived luminance of an LED in the context of spatially disparate auditory distracters of various types. A significant finding was that a sound increased the perceived brightness of the light, regardless of their relative spatial locations, provided the light's image was projected onto the fovea. Here, the apparent lack of the spatial rule, further differentiates cortical and tectal multisensory neurons. Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy. Nevertheless, cortical neurons governing perception, and a separate sub cortical system governing action (orientation behavior) is synonymous with the perception action hypothesis of the visual stream. Further investigation into this field is necessary before any substantial claims can be made.|$|E
500|$|Zen, {{the name}} of which derives from the Sanskrit [...] "dhyāna" [...] via the Chinese [...] "ch'an" [...] {{is a form of}} Mahayana Buddhism. The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its {{proximity}} with yoga. In the west, Zen is often set alongside yoga; the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances. This segregation deserves attention because yogic practices <b>integrally</b> exist within the Zen Buddhist school. Certain essential elements of yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular.|$|E
500|$|Among the precepts which Itanhaém and Friar Pedro Mariana {{sought to}} instill in Pedro II were: that all human beings should be {{considered}} as his equals, that he should seek to be impartial and just, that public servants and ministers of state should be carefully watched, that he should not have favourites, and that his concern should always be for the public welfare. Both had as an objective [...] "to make a human, honest, constitutional, pacifist, tolerant, wise and just monarch. That is, a perfect ruler, dedicated <b>integrally</b> to his obligations, above political passions and private interests." [...] Later, in January 1839, Itanhaém called Cândido José de Araújo Viana (later Marquis of Sapucaí) to be instructor of Pedro II's education, and he and the emperor also got on very well.|$|E
500|$|The present {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and {{a partner in the}} business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as a girder supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the rail chairs are <b>integrally</b> cast. [...] Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by dovetail and mortise and tenon joints commonly used in wooden structures.|$|E
500|$|Italy has {{a strong}} sense of {{national}} identity through distinctive culture - a sense of an appreciation of beauty and emotionality, which is strongly evidenced in the music. Cultural, political and social issues are often also expressed through music in Italy. Allegiance to music is <b>integrally</b> woven into the social identity of Italians but no single style has been considered a characteristic [...] "national style". Most folk musics are localized, and unique to a small region or city. Italy's classical legacy, however, is an important point of the country's identity, particularly opera; traditional operatic pieces remain a popular part of music and an integral component of national identity. The musical output of Italy remains characterized by [...] "great diversity and creative independence (with) a rich variety of types of expression".|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are <b>integrally</b> related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|The white-bellied sea eagle was {{important}} to different tribes of indigenous people across Australia. The guardian animal of the Wreck Bay aboriginal community, {{it is also the}} official emblem of the Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens in the Jervis Bay Territory. The community considered localities around Booderee National Park to be connected with it. A local Sydney name was gulbi, and the bird was the totem of Colebee, the late 18th century indigenous leader of the Cadigal people. The white-bellied sea eagle is important to the Mak Mak people of the floodplains to the southwest of Darwin in the northern Territory, who recognised its connection with [...] "good country". It is their totem and <b>integrally</b> connected to their land. The term Mak Mak is their name for both the species and themselves. The Umbrawarra Gorge Nature Park was a Dreaming site of the bird, in this area known as Kuna-ngarrk-ngarrk. It was similarly symbolic to the Tasmanian indigenous people—Nairanaa was one name used there.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, LeMond, Bernie Boglioli {{and others}} founded LeMond Fitness, Inc. [...] "to help {{individuals}} achieve their fitness and performance goals and train more effectively." [...] The company's primary business {{is the development}} and manufacture of bicycle trainers and indoor exercise bikes for consumers in the United States and internationally. LeMond himself serves as Chairman of the Board, and, according to company sources, [...] "is <b>integrally</b> involved {{in the development and}} design of our products and programs." [...] In 2012, Hoist Fitness negotiated to purchase an interest in the company and announced plans to move its headquarters to Hoist's offices in San Diego, CA. In late 2012, Greg LeMond purchased the LeMond Revolution from Hoist, relaunching with a new management team in Minneapolis. He also formed LeMond LLC to introduce a suite of brands in late 2013, early 2014. Professional cycling's [...] team recently renewed its sponsorship with LeMond to use its Revolution trainers for another three seasons. The team has won several stages of the Tour de France, plus the general classification of the 2012 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
500|$|Periyar's {{ideas on}} Tamil {{alphabet}} reforms and his reasons {{were for the}} following such as the vowel 'ஈ' (i), having a cursive and looped representation of the short form, 'இ' (I). In stone inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago, many Tamil letters are found in other shapes. As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology, Periyar {{thought that it was}} sensible to change a few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. He further explained that the older and the more divine a language and its letters were said to be, the more they needed reform. Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' கா ', ' கே ' (kA:, kE:), Periyar argued why should not other compound characters like ' கி ', ' கீ ', 'கு ', ' கூ ' (kI, ki:, kU, ku:) (indicated <b>integrally</b> as of now), also have separate signs. Further, changing the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are redundant, were quite essential according to Periyar. Thus, the [...] and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else" ...|$|E

2500|$|Yoav Peled (1992) sees Marx [...] "shifting {{the debate}} over Jewish {{emancipation}} from the plane of theology ... to the plane of sociology", thereby circumventing one of Bauer's main arguments. In Peled's view, [...] "this {{was less than a}} satisfactory response to Bauer, but it enabled Marx to present a powerful case for emancipation while, at the same time, launching his critique of economic alienation". He concludes that [...] "the philosophical advances made by Marx in 'On the Jewish Question' were necessitated by, and <b>integrally</b> related to, his commitment to Jewish emancipation".|$|E
