5|$|Another area of <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> {{assessing}} whether {{keyhole surgery}} (laparoscopy) {{would be better}} than Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E

25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the sample.|$|E

He expressed his disapproval of Amitabh's inaugurating a girls' school named after his daughter-in-law, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, at Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, rather than in Maharashtra. Bachchan was also criticised for choosing to run elections from his native state. On 2 February at a party function at Dharavi in Mumbai, Raj said, [...] "Though he [...] has become a star in Mumbai, his <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Uttar Pradesh.

500|$|In 1980, {{poet and}} essayist Adrienne Rich {{expanded}} upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing {{a continuum of}} lesbian existence based on [...] "woman-identified experience". All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: mothers and daughters, women who work together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men. Several years earlier, DOB founders Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is, by providing their definition: [...] "a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed".|$|E

Although the [...] "Submariner" [...] society from Pula was interested in accepting the donation and exhibiting it in a museum, the Croatian MoD responded with a statement that accepting the donation is against national interests; since most of the fleet of the former Yugoslav Navy was relocated to Montenegro {{at the beginning of the}} Croatian War of Independence, Croatia claims the military equipment of the former joint armed forces was stolen, and should be a subject of succession. The MoD further explains that the state <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> compensation for that equipment, not returning [...] "obsolete, damaged and corroded equipment which nowadays Serbia and Montenegro are unsuccessfully trying to sell".|$|E

2500|$|The Lie algebra of any compact Lie group (very roughly: one {{for which}} the symmetries form a bounded set) can be {{decomposed}} as a direct sum of an abelian Lie algebra and some number of simple ones. The structure of an abelian Lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting (since the Lie bracket is identically zero); the <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the simple summands.

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy about the philosophical nature of Dupin's method.

However, Krutch has been accused elsewhere of a [...] "lazy reading" [...] of Poe. According to Krutch, Dupin's deductive prowess is first exhibited when he appears to read the narrator's mind by rationally tracing his train of thought for the previous fifteen minutes. He employs what he terms [...] "ratiocination". Dupin's method is {{to identify with the}} criminal and put himself in his mind. By knowing everything that the criminal knows, he can solve any crime. His attitude towards life seems to portray him as a snob who feels that due to his aptitude normal human interaction and relationships are beneath him. In this method, he combines his scientific logic with artistic imagination. As an observer, he pays special attention to what is unintended, such as hesitation, eagerness or a casual or inadvertent word.|$|E

This right is expanded by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention, which states that [...] "Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." [...] Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public <b>interest,</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of taxes.

[...] In later works, the critic believed, Sadoveanu moved away from depicting isolation as the escape of primitives into their manageable world, but as [...] "the refinement of souls whom civilization has upset." [...] These views are echoed by Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who believes that, unlike other Romanian Realists, Sadoveanu was able to show a peasant society that was not merely the prey of modern corruption or historical oppression, but rather refusing all contacts with the wider world—even to the point of Luddite-like hostility in front of new objects. Some of the early stories, Crohmălniceanu argues, do follow the moralizing Sămănătorist pattern, but part with it when they refuse to present the countryside in [...] "idyllic" [...] fashion, or when they adopt a specific [...] "mythical realism".|$|E
