She never met her father and grew up watching her mother violently abused by her boyfriends. Reynolds soon became a single mother herself and the patterns in her mother's life began repeating themselves in her own life as well. These circumstances inspired her to enter law where she earned three degrees, all with honors. When Hollywood came a calling, Reynolds was in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> her seminary studies where she was earning her Master of Divinity degree. She told TV producers any future show would have to wait until she finished seminary. The cases on the court show involved matters that affected families, from husbands vs. wives to parents suing children.

However, this is misleading as it was emphasized by Einstein or Planck. On one hand it's true that space and time became relative, and the inertial frames of reference are handled on equal footing.

6000|$|The elder Neuchatel {{departed}} {{this life}} a little before the second French Revolution of 1830, which had been so fatal to Mr. Ferrars.

This was a large fish for the new Liberal Treasury to capture; their triumph was great, and they determined to show that they appreciated the power and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> their new ally. At <b>the</b> dissolution <b>of</b> 1831, Adrian Neuchatel was a candidate for a popular constituency, and was elected at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poll.

It appeared to him, I think, {{that if we could}} only write near enough to the facts, and yet with no pedestrian calm, but ardently, we might transfer <b>the</b> glamour <b>of</b> reality direct upon our pages; and that, if it were once thus captured and expressed, a new and instructive relation might appear between men's thoughts and <b>the</b> phenomena <b>of</b> nature. This was the eagle that he pursued all his life long, like a schoolboy with a butterfly net. Hear him to a friend: [...] "Let me suggest a theme for you - to state to yourself precisely and completely what that walk over the mountains amounted to for you, returning to this essay again and again until you are satisfied that all that was important in your experience is in it.

6000|$|This correspondence, by {{a meeting}} between some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties, and a {{separation}} between the others, could not, to <b>the</b> great detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Post Office revenue, be continued any longer. Very little assistance to the State could be derived from <b>the</b> epistolary intercourse <b>of</b> Mrs. Vernon and her niece; for the former soon perceived, by <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> Frederica's letters, that they were written under her mother's inspection! and therefore, deferring all particular enquiry till she could make it personally in London, ceased writing minutely or often. Having learnt enough, in the meanwhile, from her open-hearted brother, of what had passed between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower than ever in her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get Frederica removed from such a mother, and placed under her own care; and, though with little hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing unattempted that might offer a chance of obtaining her sister-in-law's consent to it. Her anxiety on the subject made her press for an early visit to London; and Mr. Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared, lived only {{to do whatever he}} was desired, soon found some accommodating business to call him thither. With a <b>heart</b> full <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> Mrs. Vernon waited on Lady Susan shortly after her arrival in town, and was met with such an easy and cheerful affection, as made her almost turn from her with horror. No remembrance of Reginald, no consciousness of guilt, gave one look of embarrassment; she was in excellent spirits, and seemed eager to show at once by ever possible attention to her brother and sister her sense of their kindness, and her pleasure in their society. Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same restrained manners, the same timid look in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> her mother as heretofore, assured her aunt of her situation being uncomfortable, and confirmed her in <b>the</b> plan <b>of</b> altering it. No unkindness, however, on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> Lady Susan appeared. Persecution on <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> Sir James was entirely at an end; his name merely mentioned {{to say that he was}} not in London; and indeed, in all her conversation, she was solicitous only for the welfare and improvement of her daughter, acknowledging, in terms of grateful delight, that Frederica was now growing every day more and more what a parent could desire. Mrs. Vernon, surprized and incredulous, knew not what to suspect, and, without any change in her own views, only feared greater difficulty in accomplishing them. <b>The</b> first hope <b>of</b> anything better was derived from Lady Susan's asking her whether she thought Frederica looked quite as well as she had done at Churchhill, as she must confess herself to have sometimes an anxious doubt of London's perfectly agreeing with her. Mrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt, directly proposed her niece's returning with them into the country. Lady Susan was unable to express her sense of such kindness, yet knew not, from a variety of reasons, how to part with her daughter; and as, though her own plans were not yet wholly fixed, she trusted it would ere long be in her power to take Frederica into the country herself, concluded by declining entirely to profit by such unexampled attention. Mrs. Vernon persevered, however, in <b>the</b> offer <b>of</b> it, and though Lady Susan continued to resist, her resistance in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> a few days seemed somewhat less formidable. <b>The</b> lucky alarm <b>of</b> an influenza decided what might not have been decided quite so soon. Lady Susan's maternal fears were then too much awakened for her to think of anything but Frederica's removal from <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> infection; above all disorders in the world she most dreaded the influenza for her daughter's constitution! ...|$|R

6000|$|Not {{long since}} I passed {{half an hour}} on the terrace, an amused witness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perils <b>of</b> a voyage across the Seine in a punt.

There was much demurring, and many doubts about encountering the risk; and more than once the women would have receded, had not the man treated <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> as a trifle. He affirmed parole d'honneur that his father had crossed the Maine a dozen times, and no harm had come of it! This encouraged them, and, with many pretty screams, mes fois, and oh, Dieu, they finally embarked. The punt was a narrow scow that a ton weight would not have disturbed, the river was so low and sluggish that it might have been forded two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance, and the width was not three hundred feet. Pierre protested that the danger was certainly not worth mentioning, and away he went, as philosophical in appearance as his punt. The voyage was made in safety, and <b>the</b> bows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat had actually touched the shore on its return, before any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passengers ventured to smile. The excursion, like most travelling, was likely to be most productive <b>of</b> happiness by <b>the</b> recollections. But the women were no sooner landed, than that rash adventurer, the husband, brother, and father, seized an oar, and began to ply it with all his force. He merely wished to tell his confrères <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rue Montmartre how a punt might be rowed. Pierre had gallantly landed to assist the ladies, and <b>the</b> boat, relieved <b>of</b> its weight, slowly yielded to <b>the</b> impulse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oar, and inclined its bows from the land. [...] "Oh! Edouard! mon mari! mon frère!--que fais-tu?" [...] exclaimed the ladies. [...] "Ce n'est rien," [...] returned the man, puffing, and giving another lusty sweep, by which he succeeded in forcing the punt fully twenty feet from the shore. [...] "Edouard! cher Edouard!" [...] "Laisse-moi m'amuser,--je m'amuse, je m'amuse," [...] cried the husband in a tone of indignant remonstrance. But Edouard, a tight, sleek little épicier, of about five-and-thirty, had never heard that an oar on each side was necessary in a boat, and the harder he pulled the less likely was he to regain <b>the</b> shore. <b>Of</b> this he began to be convinced, as he whirled more into <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current; and his efforts now really became frantic, for his imagination probably painted <b>the</b> horrors <b>of</b> a distant voyage in an unknown bark to an unknown land, and all without food or compass. The women screamed, and the louder they cried, the more strenuously he persevered in saying, [...] "Laisse-moi m'amuser--je m'amuse, je m'amuse." [...] By this time the perspiration poured from <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> Edouard, and I called to the imperturbable Pierre, who stood in silent admiration of his punt while playing such antics, and desired him to tell the man to put his oar on the bottom, and to push the boat ashore. [...] "Oui, Monsieur," [...] said the rogue, with a leer, for he remembered the francs, and we soon had our adventurer safe on terra firma again. Then began the tender expostulations, the affectionate reproaches, and the kind injunctions for the truant to remember that he was a husband and a father.
