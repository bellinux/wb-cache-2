Profiles of total thickness (snow plus ice thickness) were measured, together with some snow-thickness measure-ments. Total thicknesses were measured with a portable <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instrument</b> and at selected sites by drilling. The three fjords show some differences in measured thicknesses, connected to individual conditions. However, total thickness does not differ substantially between the three fjords before melt onset.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an open-source system for virtual bronchoscopy used in combination with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instrument</b> tracking. The end application is virtual navigation of the lung for biopsy of early stage cancer nodules. The open-source platform 3 D Slicer was used for creating freely available algorithms for virtual bronchscopy. Firstly, {{the development of an}} open-source semi-automatic algorithm for prediction of solitary pulmonary nodule malignancy is presented. This approach may help the physician decide whether to proceed with biopsy of the nodule. The user-selected nodule is segmented in order to extract radiological characteristics (i. e., size, location, edge smoothness, calcification presence, cavity wall thickness) which are combined with patient information to calculate likelihood of malignancy. The overall accuracy of the algorithm is shown to be high compared to independent experts 2 ̆ 7 assessment of malignancy. The algorithm is also compared with two different predictors, and our approach is shown to provide the best overall prediction accuracy. The development of an airway segmentation algorithm which extracts the airway tree from surrounding structures on chest Computed Tomography (CT) images is then described. This represents the first fundamental step toward the creation of a virtual bronchoscopy system. Clinical and ex-vivo images are used to evaluate performance of the algorithm. Different CT scan parameters are investigated and parameters for successful airway segmentation are optimized. Slice thickness is the most affecting parameter, while variation of reconstruction kernel and radiation dose is shown to be less critical. Airway segmentation is used to create a 3 D rendered model of the airway tree for virtual navigation. Finally, the first open-source virtual bronchoscopy system was combined with electromagnetic tracking of the bronchoscope {{for the development of a}} GPS-like system for navigating within the lungs. Tools for pre-procedural planning and for helping with navigation are provided. Registration between the lungs of the patient and the virtually reconstructed airway tree is achieved using a landmark-based approach. In an attempt to reduce difficulties with registration errors, we also implemented a landmark-free registration method based on a balanced airway survey. In-vitro and in-vivo testing showed good accuracy for this registration approach. The centreline of the 3 D airway model is extracted and used to compensate for possible registration errors. Tools are provided to select a target for biopsy on the patient CT image, and pathways from the trachea towards the selected targets are automatically created. The pathways guide the physician during navigation, while distance to target information is updated in real-time and presented to the user. During navigation, video from the bronchoscope is streamed and presented to the physician next to the 3 D rendered image. The electromagnetic tracking is implemented with 5 DOF sensing that does not provide roll rotation information. An intensity-based image registration approach is implemented to rotate the virtual image according to the bronchoscope 2 ̆ 7 s rotations.

An ice roughness criterion was applied to distinguish between level and rough or ridged ice. Ice thickness modes in the probability density functions (PDFs) derived from drill-hole and IEM measurements agreed well, with modes at 1. 5 - 1. 6 m and 1. 8 - 1. 9 m for all data from level ice. The PDFs derived from SEM measurements show that the primary modes are at 0. 1 and 1. 1 m in 2003 and 0. 7 m in 2004. In 2002 and 2004, significant fractions (between one third and one half) of level ice were found to consist of rafted ice segments.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{developed}} an inversion process of electromagnetic induction (EMI) data based on a two-step approach with 1 D inversion of the entire studied surface and a fast 3 D inversion applied over limited areas. This process {{is similar to that}} formerly used in resistivity prospection. For the study of soil (environmental, engineering, or archaeological explorations), low-frequency <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instruments</b> (referred to as Slingram EMI) have highly useful specificities. They are light, are easy to move in the field, and can simultaneously measure the ground’s electric conductivity and magnetic susceptibility; they have thus been used to map these properties over large surface areas, within relatively short periods of time, and at reasonable expense. The possibility of combining several coil geometries has opened up the potential for multidepth techniques and systematic 1 D inversion, which are found to be sufficiently revealing to allow larger portions of surveyed areas to be analyzed. In the “targeted areas” selected for 3 D inversion, the geometries of the 3 D features and the resistivity and/or susceptibility contrasts are determined. This step is based on the method of moments, where only 3 D heterogeneities are meshed, and {{only a small number of}} major characteristics, such as contrast, thickness, width, etc., are sought. We first applied this process to synthetic data, then to data acquired at an experimental test site, and finally to field cases.

The selection of an appropriate {{reference standard}} is a crucial point in the performance evaluation of wire rope <b>electromagnetic</b> testing (EMT) <b>instrument.</b> In this paper, a 3 -D finite element model (FEM) has been developed to study three reference standards. The effects of the magnetizing ampere-turn, the loss of metallic cross-sectional area on the main magnetic flux and the structure have been addressed. Comparison analyses have been made of the simulation results of the three reference standards...|$|R
40|$|International audienceProximal sensing of soil {{electromagnetic}} properties {{is widely}} used to map spatial land heterogeneity. The mapping instruments use galvanic contact, capacitive coupling or electromagnetic induction. Regardless {{of the type of}} instrument, the geometrical configuration between signal transmitting and receiving elements typically defines the shape of the depth response function. To assess vertical soil profiles, many modern instruments use multiple transmitter-receiver pairs. Alternatively, vertical electrical sounding can be used to measure changes in apparent soil electrical conductivity with depth at a specific location. This paper examines the possibility for the assessment of soil profiles using a dynamic surface galvanic contact resistivity scanning approach, with transmitting and receiving electrodes configured in an equatorial dipole-dipole array. An automated scanner system was developed and tested in agricultural fields with different soil profiles. While operating in the field, the distance between current injecting and measuring pairs of rolling electrodes was varied continuously from 40 to 190 cm. The preliminary evaluation included a comparison of scan results from 20 locations to shallow (less than 1. 2 m deep) soil profiles and to a two-layer soil profile model defined using an <b>electromagnetic</b> induction <b>instrument...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractTaking {{the small}} fault as {{research}} background, which existence ahead of fully mechanized coal face, the roadway stability were {{monitored by the}} means of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation <b>instrument.</b> Combining with X-Ray Diffraction experiments, the changes of roadway's coal and rock mass energy were achieved from the microscopic view. The results of X-Ray Diffraction experiments show that coal and mass microcosmic composition were silicate minerals which have lower conductivity and loss smaller energy than a true reflection of the monitoring results when the electromagnetic wave propagation, meanwhile, monitoring results can be more true reflection of the electromagnetic radiation energy changes in the coal and rock mass. And the monitoring results of electromagnetic radiation energy show that little or no energy accumulation in fault location while the distance between working face and the fault more than 70 m, but the energy dramatic changes while the distance within 10 m. Electromagnetic radiation energy value through steady-increase-the maximum-decreases, which indicates a larger energy accumulation appear in front zones as the value increases again. Base on principal component method, the monitoring points which arranged 20 m in front of fault can fully obtained the coal and rock mass internal energy accumulation and release rules...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{monitoring}} and {{early detection of}} pits and wall thinning for casing pipes are considerably important to gas and petroleum industries since the frequently occurring corrosion at the internal or external parts of those steel casing pipes used in underground gas storage or oil fields causes production and environmental protection problems. In this paper, {{a new version of}} the direct current (dc) electromagnetic induction system is introduced in which a sensor system, based on the dc <b>electromagnetic</b> induction <b>instrument,</b> is coupled with an updated data acquisition system. Unlike the conventional dc induction instrument, the new system can achieve a full-signature logging response by providing all the measured flux leakage (FL) signals and eddy current (EC) signals to the computer logging system (CLS) on the surface. To transmit the information represented by large amounts of data acquired by downhole instruments to the CLS on the surface, a wavelet data compression technique has been incorporated. A VLSI integrated circuit (IC) which realizes the wavelet transform has been designed so that the real-time mode can be achieved during the logging operation. The circuit has been designed using CMOS n-well 2 -µm technology and has been fabricated by MOSI...|$|R
