25|$|Modern pillar {{sections}} use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, {{which can}} prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment {{have left a}} work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Brown and Jones were still playing trains on the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Uncle Roger {{had gone}} to the station to meet the travellers, and the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> was spread with a feast of fat things.|$|E
60|$|He welcomed Walstein with warmth. Mr. Revel led Madame to the <b>dining-room.</b> The <b>table</b> was round, and Walstein seated {{himself at}} her side.|$|R
60|$|In the <b>dining-room,</b> the <b>table</b> {{had only}} dirty plates and empty dishes on it. However the party--with the {{addition}} of a gentleman, as good-natured, and as rosy, as the children--seated themselves at it very contentedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "(4) More {{attractive}} <b>dining-rooms.</b> Esp. small <b>tables</b> for 2 and 4. Cater more {{to local}} customers with à la carte menus--not long but good.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{found it}} {{lying on the}} <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> last evening, when I came from my room. You see, I had been lying down with a headache." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Lookaloft {{soon found}} herself on a sofa, and the Miss Lookalofts on two chairs, while Mr. Augustus {{stood near the}} door; and here they {{remained}} till in due time they were seated, all four together, {{at the bottom of}} the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Story Girl {{chose the}} latter alternative. She was highly indignant. I verily {{believe that to}} sit at the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> in that shabby, outgrown dress, {{conscious}} of looking her ugliest, and eating only bread and water before the critical Millwards would have been positive bliss to her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} {{what they were}} going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of [...] "playing charades," [...] but in my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the <b>dining-room</b> <b>tables</b> wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," [...] {{said the}} lady {{as we entered}} a well-lit <b>dining-room,</b> upon the <b>table</b> of which a cold supper had been laid out, [...] "I should {{very much like to}} ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aöh! That's her name. It's {{a pretty}} name." [...] He {{looked through the}} open door into the <b>dining-room,</b> where the <b>table</b> was set for breakfast, with the usual water-goblet at each plate. [...] "I see you have beer for breakfast. There's nothing so nice, you know. Would you--would you mind giving me a glahs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, {{you come}} look, miss," [...] and Jeekie propped {{up the case}} upon {{the end of the}} <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b> As from its height and {{position}} she could not see its contents very well whilst standing above it, Barbara knelt down {{to get a better view}} of it.|$|E
6000|$|Did Aunt Jane repent of her {{decision}} on the Thursday half-holiday granted to Mrs. Edgar's pupils, when, {{in the midst of}} the working party round the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> in a pause of the reading, some one said, 'What's that!'---and a humming, accompanied by a drip, drop, drip, drop, became audible? ...|$|E
60|$|The pain of {{the fumes}} was bad enough, but the real {{hardship}} was the dizziness I suffered. I blundered into the steward's pantry, and out of it, missed the cross-hall, stumbled through the next starboard opening in the long hall, and found myself bent double by violent collision with the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles... I seem to remember enormous <b>dining-room</b> <b>tables</b> in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|R
60|$|There {{were other}} drawings, {{if not all}} by the same hand, at least by the same school; one, sketched in bold strokes, of a dinner party in a stately neo-classic <b>dining-room,</b> the <b>table</b> laden with flowers and silver, the bare-throated women with jewels. A more {{critical}} eye than Lise's, gazing upon this portrayal of the Valhalla of success, might have detected in the young men, immaculate in evening dress, a certain effort to feel at home, to converse naturally, which their square jaws and square shoulders belied. This was no doubt {{the fault of the}} artist's models, who had {{failed to live up to}} the part. At any rate, the sight of these young gods of leisure, the contemplation of the stolid butler and plush footmen in the background never failed to make Lise's heart beat faster.|$|R
6000|$|Again in the Gilbeys' <b>dining-room.</b> Afternoon. The <b>table</b> is not laid: it is {{draped in}} its {{ordinary}} cloth, with pen and ink, an exercise-book, and school-books on it. Bobby Gilbey {{is in the}} arm-chair, crouching over the fire, reading an illustrated paper. He is a pretty youth, of very suburban gentility, strong and manly enough by nature, but untrained and unsatisfactory, his parents having imagined that domestic restriction {{is what they call}} [...] "bringing up." [...] He has learnt nothing from it except a habit of evading it by deceit.|$|R
60|$|What Dick {{said was}} almost wholly true. The rascals had stolen {{everything}} of value {{that they could}} possibly carry, leaving behind little outside of the things already mentioned. Not only was the piano mutilated, but also the chairs, the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> and the berths in the stateroom. All of the lanterns but one were missing, and the small rowboat resting on the rear deck of the houseboat had its side stove in from an ax-blow.|$|E
60|$|An evening {{newspaper}} {{was on the}} <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b> The candles were lit. He sat down, and tried to read. No! There {{was nothing in the}} newspaper that he cared about. The time for hearing from the lawyer was drawing nearer and nearer. Reading was of no use. Sitting still was of no use. He got up, and went out {{in the front of the}} cottage--strolled to the gate--opened it--and looked idly up and down the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word!" [...] {{commanded}} Norcross; and {{the girl}} with a smile submitted to his guidance, and thereafter his efficiency, his self-possession, his tact delighted her. He persuaded the sullen landlady to get them supper. He secured the best rooms in the house, and arranged {{for the care of}} the team, and when they were all seated around the dim, fly-specked oil-lamp {{at the end of the}} crumby <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> he discovered such a gay and confident mien that the women looked at each other in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|They {{began with}} the office and the parlor, where they flung up the windows, and opened the doors, and then they opened the <b>dining-room,</b> where the <b>tables</b> stood in long rows, with the chairs piled on them legs upward. Cynthia went about with many sighs for the dust on everything, though to Westover's eyes it all seemed frigidly clean. [...] "If it goes on {{as it has for}} the past two years," [...] she said, [...] "we shall have to add on a new dining-room. I don't know as I like to have it get so large!" ...|$|R
60|$|It is now {{the last}} day, and the desolation is {{thickening}} upon our hotel. This morning the door-posts {{up and down my}} corridor showed not a single pair of trousers; not a pair of boots flattered the lonely doormats. In the lower hall I found the tables of the great dining-room assembled, and the chairs inverted on them with their legs in the air; but decently, decorously, not with the reckless abandon displayed by the chairs in our Long Island hotel for weeks before it closed. In the smaller <b>dining-room</b> the <b>table</b> was set for lunch as if we were to go on dining there forever; in the breakfast-room the service and the provision were as perfect as ever. The coffee was good, the bread delicious, the butter of an unfaltering sweetness; and the glaze of wear on the polished dress-coats of the waiters as respectable as it could have been {{on the first day of}} the season. All was correct, and if of a funereal correctness to me, I am sure this effect was purely subjective.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then without it." [...] With a quick {{movement}} Holmes {{pushed the}} fellow {{to one side}} and passed into the hall. A door half opened stood immediately before us. We entered. It was the <b>dining-room.</b> On the <b>table,</b> under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and raised the lid. Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure. The glare from the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes's face showed his amazement, and also his relief.|$|R
60|$|Honora {{walked through}} the rooms. There was nothing {{intricate}} about the house; it was as simple as two times four, and really too large for her and Howard. Her presents were installed, the pictures and photograph frames and chairs, even Mr. Isham's <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> and Cousin Eleanor's piano. The sight of these, and of the engraving which Aunt Mary had sent on, and which all her childhood had hung over her bed in the little room at home, brought the tears once more to her eyes. But she forced them back bravely.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went in {{and there}} was my father fallen forward on the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> with blood coming from his lips, though I believe this {{was caused by a}} crushed wineglass. His pocket-book was open beneath him, in which he had been writing figures of his estate, and, I think, {{headings}} for the will he meant to make, but these I could not read since the faint pencilling was blotted out with blood. He was quite dead from some kind of a stroke followed by heart failure, as the doctors said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There will {{be about}} sixty guests, all told," [...] she said, {{as if she were}} {{thinking}} of nothing else. [...] "We must move the furniture out of this room and set the supper-table here. The dining-room is too small. We must borrow Mrs. Bell's forks and spoons. She offered to lend them. I'd never have been willing to ask her. The damask table cloths with the ribbon pattern must be bleached to-morrow. Nobody else in Avonlea has such tablecloths. And we'll put the little <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> on the hall landing, upstairs, for the presents." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dosson {{had opened}} the door; he made his {{companion}} pass into the small <b>dining-room</b> where the <b>table</b> was spread for the noonday breakfast. [...] "Where are the chickens?" [...] he disappointedly asked. His visitor at first supposed him to have missed a customary dish from the board, but recognised the next moment his usual designation of his daughters. These young ladies presently came in, but Francie looked away from the suitor for her hand. The suggestion just dropped by her father {{had given him a}} shock--the idea of the newspaper-man's personal success with so rare a creature was inconceivable--but her charming way of avoiding his eye convinced him he had nothing to really fear from Mr. Flack.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{historical}} {{evidence from the}} Byzantine and Medieval periods also show that Khirbet Kana was regarded as the true site of New Testament Cana from a very early period. A guidebook written by a certain Theodosius between 517-527 CE titled The Layout of The Holy Land identifies Khirbet Kana, and indicates {{that two of the}} vessels were still at the location. A pilgrim account written by Saewulf in 1101-1103 CE also identifies the site, as do Belard of Ascoli (c. 1155 CE) and Dominican friar Burchard of Mount Sion (1283 CE), and a map by noted cartographer Petrus Vesconte in 1321 CE. Burchard of Mount Sion also describes a cave complex located there which was used as a veneration site where [...] "the place is shown at this day where the six water pots stood, and the <b>dining-room</b> where the <b>tables</b> were placed." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tupper and I {{waited a}} good while, and then Bennoch and Tupper came back, without having found Mr. ------. Tupper wished {{very much to}} show the prayer-book used by King Charles at his execution, and some curious old {{manuscript}} volumes; but the servant said that his master always kept these treasures locked up, and trusted the key to nobody. We therefore had to take our leave without seeing them; and I have not often entered a house that one feels to be more forlorn than Wooton,--although {{we did have a}} glimpse of a <b>dining-room,</b> with a <b>table</b> laid for three or four guests, and looking quite brilliant with plate and glass and snowy napery. There was a fire, too, in this one room. Mr. ------ is making extensive alterations in the house, or has recently done so, and this is perhaps one reason of its ungenial meagreness and lack of finish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lovely, lovely Ophelia!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What a {{wonderful}} power it is--poetry! I {{wake up in}} the morning all bedraggled; there's a yellow fog outside; little Emily turns on the electric light when she brings me my tea, and says, 'Oh, ma'am, the water's frozen in the cistern, and cook's cut her finger to the bone.' And then I open a little green book, and the birds are singing, the stars shining, the flowers twinkling--" [...] She looked about her as if these presences had suddenly manifested themselves round her <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It was {{cruel to}} see the {{enjoyment}} {{he got out of}} teasing this woman by an ironical jargon which mystified her into madness. This time he went too far. With an inarticulate snarl of passion she lifted a knife that lay on the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> and made for him. But this time, being prepared, he was not alarmed; nay, he seemed to take leasure in the success of his plan of tormenting. The heavy escritoire at which he sat was a breastwork between him and the angry woman. He coolly opened a drawer; produced a revolver, and remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{assistant}} engineer's bungalow Spurstow and Hummil smoked the pipe of silence together, each narrowly watching the other. The {{capacity of a}} bachelor's establishment is as elastic as its arrangements are simple. A servant cleared away the <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> brought {{in a couple of}} rude native bedsteads made of tape strung on a light wood frame, flung a square of cool Calcutta matting over each, set them side by side, pinned two towels to the punkah so that their fringes should just sweep clear of the sleepers' nose and mouth, and announced that the couches were ready.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{brings me}} to the romantic part of my letter, and I will say at [...] once that we found your friend Mr. Durgin in Florence, in the very [...] hotel we went to. We all met in the <b>dining-room,</b> at the <b>table</b> [...] d'hote one evening, and Genevieve and he took to each other at once. [...] He spent the evening with us in our private drawing-room, and she [...] said to me, after he went, {{that for the first time}} in years she felt [...] rested. It seems that she had always {{secretly}} fancied him, and that [...] she gave up to me in the matter of marrying poor Gigi, because she [...] knew I had my heart set upon it, and she was not very certain of her [...] own feelings when Mr. D. offered himself in Boston; but the [...] conviction that she had made a mistake grew upon, her more and more [...] after she had married Gigi.|$|R
6000|$|Halleck and Bartley {{had some}} talk about college days, from which their eyes wandered at times; and then Marcia excused herself to Atherton, and went out, reappearing after an {{interval}} at the sliding doors, which she rolled open between the parlor and <b>dining-room.</b> A <b>table</b> set for supper stood behind her, {{and as she}} leaned a little forward with her hands each on a leaf of the door, she said, with shy pride, [...] "Bartley, I thought the gentlemen would like to join you," [...] and he answered, [...] "Of course they would," [...] {{and led the way}} out, refusing to hear any demur. His heart swelled with satisfaction in Marcia; it was something like: having fellows drop in upon you, and be asked out to supper in this easy way; it made Bartley feel good, and {{he would have liked to}} give Marcia a hug on the spot. He could not help pressing her foot, under the table, and exchanging a quiver of the eyelashes with her, as he lifted the lid of the white tureen, and looked at her across the glitter of their new crockery and cutlery. They made the jokes of the season about the oyster being promptly on hand for the first of the R months, and Bartley explained that he was sometimes kept at the Events office rather late, and that then Marcia waited supper for him, and always gave him an oyster stew, which she made herself. She could not stop him, and the guests praised the oysters, and then they praised the dining-room and the parlor; and when they rose from the table Bartley said, [...] "Now, we must show you the house," [...] and persisted against her deprecations in making her lead the way. She was in fact willing enough to show it; her taste had made their money go to the utmost in furnishing it; and though most people were then still in the period of green reps and tan terry, and of dull black-walnut movables, she had everywhere bestowed little touches that told. She had covered the marble parlor-mantel with cloth, and fringed it; and she had set on it two vases in the Pompeiian colors then liked; her carpet was of wood color and a moss pattern; she had done what could be done with folding carpet chairs to give the little room a specious air of luxury; the centre-table was heaped with her sewing and Bartley's newspapers.|$|R
60|$|There {{was much}} more {{to see in the}} house than I had any {{previous}} notion of; but except the two chambers already noticed, nothing remained the least as Byron left it. Yes, another place there was,--his own small <b>dining-room,</b> with a <b>table</b> of moderate size, where, no doubt, the skull-goblet has often gone its rounds. Colonel Wildman's dining-room was once Byron's shooting-gallery, and the original refectory of the monks. It is now magnificently arranged, with a vaulted roof, a music-gallery at one end, suits of armor and weapons on the walls, and mailed arms extended, holding candelabras. There are one or two painted windows, commemorative of the Peninsular war, and the battles in which the Colonel and his two brothers fought,--for these Wildmen seem to have been mighty troopers, and Colonel Wildman is represented as a fierce-looking mustachioed hussar at two different ages. The housekeeper spoke of him affectionately, but says that he is now getting into years, and that they fancy him failing. He has no children. He appears to have been on good terms with Byron, and had the latter ever returned to England, he was under promise to make his first visit to his old home, and it was in such an expectation that Colonel Wildman had kept Byron's private apartments in the same condition in which he found them. Byron was informed of all the Colonel's fittings up and restorations, and when he introduces the Abbey in Don Juan, the poet describes it, not as he himself left it, but as Colonel Wildman has restored it. There is a beautiful drawing-room, and all these apartments are adorned with pictures, the collection being especially rich in portraits by Sir Peter Lely,--that of Nell Gwynn being one, {{who is one of the}} few beautiful women whom I have seen on canvas.|$|R
