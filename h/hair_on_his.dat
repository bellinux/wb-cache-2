5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted <b>hair)</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, {{adorned with}} a {{crescent}} moon. Sometimes the jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes {{the shape of the}} halo may differ on either side.|$|E
5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot {{tell if he}} is man or beast.|$|E
50|$|Nero is {{a middle}} aged, fairly obese {{man who is}} bald except for two long <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head. Furthermore, he wears a huge red bow tie and has laurel leaves behind his ears, in {{reference}} to the Roman emperor Nero after whom he was named.|$|R

25|$|Gorillas live {{in groups}} called troops. Troops {{tend to be}} made of one adult male or silverback, {{multiple}} adult females and their offspring. However, multiple-male troops also exist. A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch of silver <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks also have large canine teeth that also come with maturity. Both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups. For mountain gorillas, females disperse from their natal troops more than males. Mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groups.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the principal technicians and actors, a crew of 400, including light men, carpenters, and painters, worked on Mayabazar during production. For the Dvaraka set, 300 unique miniature houses were created in an approximately [...] electrified space at Vauhini Studios {{under the supervision of}} Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar. The desired effect in the [...] "laddoo gobbling" [...] shots of Ghatotkacha in the song [...] "Vivaha Bhojanambu" [...] took four days to film. The entire song was filmed using stop motion animation. In the scene where Ghatotkacha (disguised as Sasirekha) stamps Lakshmana Kumara's foot with his own, the expression is Savitri's; the stamping foot belongs to choreographer Pasumarthy Krishnamurthy, who pasted false <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> foot to make it appear demonic.|$|E
500|$|In the Vishnu Purana, Varaha {{represents}} yajna (sacrifice), as {{the eternal}} upholder of the earth. His feet represent the Vedas (scriptures). His tusks represent sacrificial stakes. His teeth are offerings. His mouth is the altar with tongue of sacrificial fire. The [...] <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head denotes the sacrificial grass. The eyes represent {{the day and}} the night. His coarse hair represents sexual prowess. The head represents the seat of the Brahmin (priest). The mane represents the hymns of the Vedas. His nostrils are for oblation. His joints represent the various ceremonies. The ears are said to indicate rites (voluntary and obligatory). Thus, Varaha is the embodiment of the Supreme Being who brings order amidst chaos in the world by his sacrifice.|$|E
5000|$|A {{panel of}} {{biologists}} and physicists on the History Channel's Spider-Man Tech suggested the barbed <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> fingertips (as {{depicted in the}} 2002 Spider-Man film) could {{have the same effect}} as the miniature scopulae <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the ends of a spider's feet. Spiders are able to climb up seemingly impossible surfaces like glass because the scopulae interact with the glass's atoms causing a form of atomic static cling via the Van der Waals force.|$|R
60|$|In {{the kitchen}} were several people sipping maté, Lucero's {{children}} and grandchildren, also his wife, a grey old dame with dim-looking eyes. But then my host was old in years himself, only, like Ulysses, he still possessed the unquenched fire and energy of youth in his soul, while time bestowed infirmities together with wrinkles and white <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> helpmate.|$|R
60|$|He {{considered}} his throat, epidermis, and the hairs {{of his head}} as the three principal seats of emotion. When Kala had been slain a peculiar choking sensation had possessed his throat; contact with Histah, the snake, imparted an unpleasant sensation to {{the skin of his}} whole body; while the approach of an enemy made the <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> scalp stand erect.|$|R
500|$|In April 1925, back in Paris, Scott met Ernest Hemingway, {{whose career}} he {{did much to}} promote. Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald became firm friends, but Zelda and Hemingway disliked each other from their very first meeting, and she openly {{described}} him as [...] "bogus," [...] "that fairy with <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest" [...] and [...] "phoney as a rubber check." [...] She considered Hemingway's domineering macho persona to be merely a posture; Hemingway in turn, told Scott that Zelda was crazy. Her dislike was probably not helped by Scott's repeated insistence that she recount {{the story of her}} affair with Jozan to Hemingway and his wife, Hadley. In an embellishment, the Fitzgeralds told the Hemingways that the affair ended when Jozan committed suicide. It was through Hemingway, however, that the Fitzgeralds were introduced to much of the Lost Generation expatriate community: Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Robert McAlmon and others.|$|E
500|$|A young four-armed Shiva and a {{beautiful}} two-armed Parvati should be the central figures, performing the panigrahana ("accepting the hand") ritual of a Hindu wedding, where the groom accepts the bride by taking her right hand in his. Shiva stands in tribhanga posture, {{with one of his}} legs straight and firmly on the ground and the other one slightly [...] bent. Shiva wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted <b>hair)</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, adorned with a crescent moon. He wears serpents as earrings, as a waist band and as a necklace. Various gold ornaments adorn his body. His back hands carry a parashu (axe) and a mriga (deer). His front left hand makes the varada mudra ("blessing-giving gesture") and his front right hand is stretched ahead to receive the hand of the bride. A dark-complexioned Parvati, adorned in silk and gold finery, stands to the left of Shiva, blushing with her head bent slightly as she extends her right arm to hold Shiva's right hand. She holds a nilotpala (blue lotus) in her left arm.|$|E
2500|$|When urine marking, {{the male}} elk advertises {{this with a}} {{specialised}} vocalisation called the [...] "bugle". [...] During [...] the last phase of the bugle, the bull rubs (palpates) his belly in rhythm with [...] "yelps". [...] He then directs a spray of urine towards his stomach or the ground. [...] The <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach {{in front of the}} penis becomes soaked with urine and gains a dark brown tint.|$|E
5000|$|A cryptic line in Akutagawa's classic {{short story}} [...] "Rashōmon" [...] says 「旧記の記者の語を借りれば、『頭身の毛も太る』ように感じたのである。」 (To borrow {{a phrase from}} the writers of the chronicles of old, {{he felt as if}} 'even the <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head and body had grown thick'.) This is a {{reference}} to a line from the Konjaku Monogatarishū, the last part figuratively meaning that he was scared; he felt as if <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was standing <b>on</b> end.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Lavender Cowboy" [...] was {{originally}} a 1923 humorous poem by Harold Hersey about an unmanly cowboy [...] "with only two <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest" [...] who comes out a hero. It was then set {{to music and}} appeared in the 1930 Western film Oklahoma Cyclone. Several versions have since been recorded, {{and it has been}} banned from radio airplay because the lyrics are considered suggestive of homosexuality.|$|R
5000|$|Mort's {{partner and}} friend. He only has two <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head and wears {{a white shirt}} with a black bowtie and red trousers. He usually insults Mort because Mort is quite clumsy, but is often at the {{receiving}} end of any mishaps which come their way, mostly in the shape of their outraged boss. Mortadelo habitually addresses him as [...] "Jefe" [...] (Spanish for [...] "chief" [...] or [...] "boss").|$|R
2500|$|Since Gravano's {{imprisonment}} on drug charges, he {{has been}} diagnosed with Graves' disease, a thyroid disorder that can cause fatigue, weight loss with increased appetite, and hair loss. Gravano appeared at his drug trial missing <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head and eyebrows and appeared to have lost weight. In Philip Carlo's book Confessions of a Mafia Boss, mobster Anthony [...] "Gaspipe" [...] Casso, also imprisoned at Florence, claims that Gravano only ventures out of his cell to get food and that Casso has only seen him in the mess hall a couple of times.|$|E
2500|$|Both a {{necessity}} for work and a defining attribute of the breed, the Leonberger has a water-resistant double coat on his body that is complemented by the shorter, fine <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> muzzle and limbs. The long, profuse, outer coat is durable, relatively straight, lies flat, and fits close. Mature, masculine Leonbergers exhibit a pronounced mane. Similarly, his tail is very well furnished from the tip to the base where it blends harmoniously with the breech's furnishings. Climate permitting, his undercoat is soft and dense. Apart from a [...] of the feet, the Leonberger is presented untrimmed.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of May 21, 1832, a party of about forty to eighty Potawatomis, with three Sauks from Black Hawk's band accompanying [...] them, approached the Davis cabin, vaulted the fence and sprinted forward to attack. Several male settlers were {{working in the fields}} and in the blacksmith's shop, rushed to the house during the attack and were killed. Six of the young men escaped the slaughter by fleeing. Fifteen settlers were killed and scalped. [...] One victim was scalped twice, from the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, to his beard. [...] "The men and children were chopped to pieces," [...] writes historian Kerry Trask, [...] "and the dead women were hung up by their feet" [...] and their bodies mutilated in ways too gruesome for contemporary observers to record in writing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another little {{member of}} the Mouse family found clear across the country is the Harvest Mouse. He is never bigger than Nibbler the House Mouse and often is much smaller. In fact, {{he is one of}} the {{smallest}} of the entire family. In appearance he is much like Nibbler, but his coat is browner and there are fine <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> tail. He loves grassy, weedy or brushy places.|$|R
50|$|Monroe is {{a teenage}} boy with two antennae-like <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{otherwise}} bald head. Originally he was a preteen, but as the series progressed he became a teenager. Most gags center around Monroe failing to impress his schoolmates, the girls he adores and/or his parents. He often ends up being mocked or even beaten up by the local bullies. The style of humor {{can be described as}} black comedy and gross-out humor.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about Ivan's appearance, as {{virtually}} all existing portraits were made after his death and contain uncertain amounts of artist's impression. In 1567, ambassador Daniel Prinz von Buchau described Ivan as follows: [...] "He is tall, stout and full of energy. His eyes are big, observing and restless. His beard is reddish-black, long and thick, but most other <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head are shaved off according to the Russian habits of the time".|$|R
2500|$|In September 2013, {{tensions}} {{were reportedly}} growing between Cameron and Larry. It {{was reported that}} Cameron objected to cat <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> suit, {{and the smell of}} cat food had to be disguised by air freshener when Downing Street had visitors. The Camerons were said not to like Larry, amid suggestions that the pet was a public relations prop. Cameron posted to Twitter saying that he and Larry got on [...] "purr-fectly well". Nevertheless, bookmakers Ladbrokes made Cameron the odds-on (1/2) favourite to leave Downing Street first, with Larry as the 6/4 outsider. The Daily Telegraph suggested that Cameron never really liked cats but that spin doctors believed Larry could make the PM appear more friendly. When leaving office in 2016, Cameron spoke of his [...] "sadness" [...] that he could not take Larry with him. When Theresa May became Prime Minister in 2016, there were concerns that Larry was stressed and could be missing the Cameron family.|$|E
2500|$|Talcott's {{complaint}} against {{the leader of}} a [...] "love cult" [...] drew coverage in newspapers across the country, with Talcott billed as the [...] "nemesis of the love cult," [...] and the [...] "leader of the famous 'husband's rebellion.'" [...] At the resumed hearing on August 22, Judge John Henderson heard testimony from several witnesses. [...] Hattie Cartwright testified that Moore was a fake healer, noting that he claimed to be [...] "greater than Christ" [...] and {{to have the ability to}} raise the dead, yet he [...] "couldn't raise <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own bald spot." [...] Another witness testified that his wife referred to Moore as [...] "my master." [...] Mrs. Talcott's sister testified as to the hold Moore held over her sister:"Mrs. Talcott and Mr. Moore and I went to lunch at the Hamilton club. [...] He informed me it was only a courtesy when people talked to you to look them in the eyes. [...] I said to myself right then, 'hypnotism.' [...] My sister sat as a broken flower. [...] I'll never forget how she looked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the characters, props, {{and ideas}} in the novel were drawn from Baum's experiences. As a child, Baum {{frequently}} had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field. Moments before the scarecrow's [...] "ragged hay fingers" [...] nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow. According to his son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a washboiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and {{from the bottom of}} a saucepan he made a face. Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman. John D. Rockefeller was the nemesis of Baum's father, an oil baron who declined to purchase Standard Oil shares in exchange for selling his own oil refinery. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz posited that Rockefeller inspired one of the Wizard's numerous faces. In one scene in the novel, the Wizard is seen as a [...] "tyrannical, hairless head". When Rockefeller was 54 years old, the medical condition alopecia caused him to lose every strand of <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, making people fearful of speaking to him.|$|E
6000|$|His hand strayed {{up to the}} straggling yellow <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{upper lip}} once more, and he smiled again, {{this time with a}} curious {{undercurrent}} of foolish craftiness. 'That's a good one,' he answered. 'Georgey told me you were original. Marmy's a millionaire, and many people love millionaires for their money. But to love Marmy for himself-- I do call that originality! Why, weight for age, he's acknowledged to be the most portentous old boah in London society!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Yet, upon {{arriving}} on the Groves, the King was suddenly overcome with worry and doubt. The <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> body even stood {{up as he}} felt an agonizing fear. He asked his physician nervously and suspiciously, [...] "Are you not deceiving me, Jivaka? Do you not betray me and hand my life to the enemies? How come it happens {{that there is not}} a single sound heard at all, not even coughs or sneezes in the huge group of 1,250 Sangha monks?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{study group}} {{discusses}} moving their meeting time to avoid {{issues with the}} back door of the library being locked after 5 pm, but both Troy (Donald Glover) and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) say that they have a commitment that precludes meeting earlier. When Jeff (Joel McHale) arrives, Britta notices numerous similar long <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat, revealing that Jeff has been seeing the same woman more than once, counter to Jeff's usual one-night stands. Jeff remains quiet on the identity of this woman.|$|R
2500|$|... "But the Persians {{were deeply}} vexed at the outcome and sent forth another {{horseman}} {{for the same}} purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, {{for some of the}} <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the whip with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by Hermogenes. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the paean, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark. Thus both armies passed that night." ...|$|E
