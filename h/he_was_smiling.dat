5|$|The inquest {{opened on}} 14 August 1985. The police gave {{evidence}} {{that it was a}} murder–suicide, and the bodies were released. The Bambers and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried. Bamber's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved. He sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by his girlfriend. Several family members and friends alleged that, later at the wake, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> and joking.|$|E
5|$|The sinking smack was {{abandoned}} by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered {{that he should be}} thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. The Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as the Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson's lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{sentencing}} inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction {{while he had}} a {{grin on his face}} while chewing chewing-gum. They later aired the video-tape during the evening news, after Kristiansens lawyer told the media that Kristiansen had been [...] "absolutely devastated" [...] by the verdict. In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> at the mere [...] "absurdity of the situation", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a [...] "cold-blooded monster without emotions". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court-rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E
60|$|Waldron looked with amazement {{along the}} line of professors upon the {{platform}} until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger, who {{leaned back in his chair}} with closed eyes and an amused expression, as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>smiling</b> in his sleep.|$|R

60|$|Blanca knew {{quite well}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> at this {{distinction}} between ladies and other women, and understood that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling,</b> {{not so much}} at her, but at himself, for secretly agreeing with the distinction she had made.|$|E

The album was donated to Cory Library by Mariaan George of Roeland Street, Cape Town.

40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of P. G. Wooster, {{a pioneer of}} Pasadena, ca. 1880 - 1900. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> wearing a three-piece suit with a long checkered tie. He has a short graying beard with moustache. His short dark hair is parted on his left. The skin {{at the corner of}} his left eye is wrinkled as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>smiling</b> (his mouth <b>is</b> not visible behind his moustache). <b>He</b> <b>is</b> turned slightly to his right...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> rather foolishly, and {{he spoke}} eagerly, with an insinuating determination.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling,</b> yet {{he meant}} every word. Helen felt {{the truth as}} {{something}} she feared.|$|E

50|$|The voice falls {{silent and}} the image fades out. Joe has finally rid himself of her. As his face vanishes we realise <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>smiling,</b> an {{important}} addition Beckett made to the play but which was never incorporated in the printed text. “Here, for the first time, Joe looks at the camera”. This may not represent a final victory but he has silenced her for now.|$|R

60|$|I wandered {{across the}} Broad Walk {{to have a}} look at Irene, and she was wearing an unmistakable air. It set me {{reflecting}} about Mary's husband and his manner the last time we met, for though I have had no opportunity to say so, we still meet now and again, and he has even dined with me at the club. On these occasions the subject of Timothy is barred, and if by any unfortunate accident Mary's name is mentioned, we immediately look opposite ways and a silence follows, in which I feel sure <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>smiling,</b> and wonder what the deuce <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> at. I remembered now that I had last seen him when I was dining with him at his club (for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> become member of a club of painter fellows, and Mary is so proud of this that she has had it printed on his card), when undoubtedly he had looked preoccupied. It had been the look, I saw now, of one who shared a guilty secret.|$|R
60|$|Only Oros ate nothing, but {{remained}} where <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>smiling</b> at us benignantly, nor did Ayesha touch any food.|$|E
60|$|Mr Meggs went on smiling. You cannot {{classify}} smiles. Nothing {{lends itself}} {{so much to}} a variety of interpretations as a smile. Mr Meggs thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> the sad, tender smile of a man who, knowing himself to be on the brink of the tomb, bids farewell to a faithful employee. Miss Pillenger's view was that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> like an abandoned old rip who ought to have been ashamed of himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling,</b> but wanly. Nobody but a {{professional}} fasting man could have looked unmoved into the Inferno she had pictured. Then he rallied.|$|E

60|$|Claus {{wrapped a}} warm blanket around {{the little one}} and rubbed the frost from its limbs. Before long the child opened his eyes and, seeing where <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>smiled</b> happily. Then Claus warmed milk and fed it to the boy slowly, while the cat looked on with sober curiosity. Finally the little one curled up in his friend's arms and sighed and fell asleep, and Claus, filled with gladness {{that he had found}} the wanderer, held him closely while he slumbered.|$|R
60|$|Jack was {{standing}} in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip could see <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> just as jovially as ever.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head, {{and even in}} the gloom I could see that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he asked, {{stopping}} {{beside the}} pond and thrusting {{his hands in his}} pockets. He looked very solemn, but she knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> inwardly.|$|E
60|$|Ruth laughed. She saw <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not <b>smiling</b> and his graveness {{gave her}} a sense of power. He had owned, with typical frankness, that she had moved him.|$|R

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>smiling.</b> Keith {{could make}} nothing of that smile, nor of the {{expression}} in the girl's eyes. And saying: [...] "I have your promise, I rely on it!" [...] he went.|$|E
2500|$|Thomson's {{painting}} shows Serota, {{the director}} of the Tate gallery. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> behind a large pair of red knickers on a washing line, saying [...] "is it a genuine Emin (£10,000)" [...] and thinking, [...] "or a worthless fake?". This is a reference to Tracey Emin's My Bed, literally a display of her (dishevelled) bed with detritus which included a pair of her knickers, shown in the 1999 Turner Prize at Tate Britain. [...] The image was painted over a few days and in a final 24-hour non stop stint.|$|R
5000|$|Frost {{describes}} the murders to Brass: [...] "I watch the life {{go out of}} their eyes. Life drains. That's how you can tell that they're dead - they have empty eyes." [...] Why did he kill them? [...] "I saw this girl I liked at the bar. I followed her home. I knew she wanted to party... She was flirting with me. I just gave her the party of her life." [...] Brass asks him why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> - does <b>he</b> feel good about this? Frost replies, [...] "I don't feel anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} rearranged by Theron [...] "Neff-U" [...] Feemster for the Michael album, as [...] "Neff-U" [...] mentioned, [...] "Michael would express {{to me the}} {{importance}} of giving the world a gift. Giving them songs that would last forever. This song was released {{in its early stages}} of development. He wanted to revisit, nurture, and define the song more because MJ was a perfectionist at everything and nothing is ever done until <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> and dancing! It was like watching a flower grow and blossom in the spring." ...|$|R
