40|$|The {{installation}} of <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> in the W 7 -AS stellarator has allowed attainment {{of a high}} energy confinement regime at high density, where the radiation profiles reached steady state. In this regime, the radial profile of the radiated power is hollow. Raising the density {{to the point where}} the radiated power approached the input power led to plasma detachment and a decrease in diamagnetic energy. This defines the density limit in a stellarator and a scaling law for this maximum density can be heuristically derived on the basis of power balance considerations. The {{installation of}} two bolometer cameras away from the <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> and three bolometer cameras in the vicinity of the <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> has provided insight into the features of high density operation of a divertor in a stellarator. In the main chamber, tomographic inversion at the density limit has shown that a poloidally asymmetric radiation profile developed as the density limit was approached. In the divertor, radiation in front of the <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> occurred while the plasma was attached and this radiation zone vanished at plasma detachment.

Comparisons between the simulation and an experiment on the DIII-D tokamak are made with the heat flux to the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate,</b> and temperature and density profiles at the SOL midplane.

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} scaling of the peak {{divertor}} heat flux and total <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> power in partially detached divertor (PDD) discharges in DIII-D, {{as a function}} of input power and radiated power. The peak divertor heat flux in the attached plasma increases linearly with input power, but saturates in the detached cases. The total <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> power remains linear with input power in both the attached and detached plasmas. This is consistent {{with the fact that the}} heat flux peak is reduced from the attached case but other areas receive increased radiant heating from the detached plasma. The <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> radiant heating is linear with input power because the total radiated power from the entire plasma is a linear function of input power in both attached and detached plasma. In the private flux region, radiated heat flux absorbed on the target plate calculated from bolometer data is enough to account for the measured plate heating. Approximately half of the overall plate heating power in detached plasma is due to absorbed radiation. By mapping the divertor heat flux before and during the PDD to flux coordinates, and comparing with a flux mapping of inserted bolometer and tangential TV data, they have verified that the radiated power is emitted from the same flux surfaces on which heat flux is reduced...|$|E

This system has measured the toroidal and poloidal distributions {{of the energy}} deposition by monitoring the temperature rise of the cooling water in 80 separate cooling units in the <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> and the central heat shield. The measurements show, that there exist no toroidal asymmetries in the energy deposition on the <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> {{for all kinds of}} ohmic discharges and for ICRH discharges with a toroidal magnetic field directed opposite to the plasma current. However, Neutral Beam Injection causes a toroidal asymmetric energy deposition profile. Furthermore the reduction of the poloidal in-out asymmetry of the energy load at the <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> due to magnetic field reversion was detected.

At the inner <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> and the early stage of discharge, the number of mobile D atoms reaches a steady-state value due to the balance between implanted and re-emitted atoms.

40|$|In the Large Helical Device (LHD), plasma {{experiments}} with an intrinsic helical divertor (HD) {{and a local}} island divertor (LID) have been performed, respectively. The HD is an open divertor at this stage, and the LID is a closed divertor equipping a baffle structure and a pump-system. Particle balance study has been conducted in these two divertor configurations. In the LID configuration, the substantial part of fuelled particles is evacuated during discharge. On the other hand, in the HD configuration, the most part of fuelled particles are retained in the vacuum vessel. Therefore the discharge history strongly affects the density control in the HD configuration. The difference in the neutral particle behavior between the HD and the LID configurations {{is considered to be}} explained by following conditions in the LID configuration: (1) The low charge exchange particle flux to the first wall due to the relatively low edge neutral density reduces the amount of implantation of the neutral particles in the first wall. (2) The small carbon amount released by physical and chemical sputtering from the helical <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> due to the small ion flux to the plates in the LID configuration leads the co-deposited particles to be small. (3) For the high operational temperature (over 1000 K) of the LID <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> in the LID configuration, the amount of retained particle in the plates is small. On the contrary, in the HD configuration, the operational temperature of the helical <b>divertor</b> <b>plates</b> is typically less than 600 K, and it is too low for the particle desorption from the carbon <b>divertor</b> <b>plates.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|A {{divertor}} configuration {{that leads}} edge plasma into a divertor region {{plays an important}} role in plasma particle control and impurity control. The plasma conducted by the divertor magnetic field is neutralized on the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate.</b> Because of the high heat load, it is apprehended that the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> becomes a primary impurity source. So, the study of impurity behavior in divertor region is of great interest. We simulated a divertor region experimentally using a linear plasma device, and studied transport properties of impurities, which produced on a target plate. The experiments were carried out in the TPD-II (Test Plasma produced by Direct current discharge) device at National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS). To study the behavior of carbon produced from the graphite target, carbon emissions were observed with 0. 5 m Czerny-Turner Monochromator.

Non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations are added by external coils, similar to the correction coils installed at the tokamak DIII-D and those that will be installed at ITER. To show the influence of magnetic perturbations on the field line escape, we integrate numerically the field line differential equations and obtain the footprints and deposition patterns on the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate.</b> Moreover, we show that the homoclinic tangle describes the deposition patterns in the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate,</b> agreeing with results observed in sophisticated simulation codes. Additionally, we show that while chaotic lines escape to the divertor plates, some of them are trapped, for many toroidal turns, in complex structures around magnetic islands, embedded in the chaotic region, giving rise to the so called stickiness effect characteristic of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we introduce a random collisional term to the field line mapping to investigate stickiness alterations due to particle collisions. Within this model, we conclude that, even reduced by collisions, stickiness still influences the field line transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} a <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> has usually {{a certain degree of}} ''roughness. '' Depending on the {{material}} and the exposure time, the size of surface features may range from submicrons to a fraction of a millimeter, covering a range of spatial scales from well below the electron gyroradius, {rho}{sub e} to significantly above the ion gyroradius, {rho}{sub i}. The plasma approaches the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> along a magnetic field which forms a shallow angle, {alpha} << 1, with the plate surface. Under such circumstances, a significant ''shadowing'' effect takes place, with {{only a small part of}} the surface being accessible to the plasma particles. A methodology is presented that allows one to find the fraction ({var_epsilon}{sub e} and {var_epsilon}{sub i}) of the surface geometrically accessible for the electrons and the ions. At small {alpha}, {var_epsilon}{sub e,i} are typically small, meaning a strong local enhancement of heat and particle fluxes. In a broad range of parameters, {var_epsilon}{sub e}, is also much smaller than {var_epsilon}{sub i}. As the surface features are usually greater than the Debye radius, this leads to the formation of an ambipolar potential which causes reflection of part of the ions from the surface. The resulting albedo of the <b>divertor</b> <b>plate</b> for the plasma ions can be as high as 50 %. Gradual diffusion of the plasma electrons into the zones reflecting the ions, reduces ambipolar fields and brings the ion albedo back to very small values. We present estimates of the time scales governing the neutralization process. This time scale shows itself up in the sheath boundary conditions for non-steady-state perturbations. The effect of surface roughness on secondary electron emission is discussed and it is shown that, depending on the surface structure, it may be smaller or greater than for a perfectly flat plate. We consider modifications of the sheath current-voltage characteristics by particle drifts. The presence of reflected ions reduces the ion diamagnetic current in the ion sub-sheath and significantly changes the ion response.
