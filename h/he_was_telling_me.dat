500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' {{or anything like that}} at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 13, 2006, Knight {{was shown}} {{allegedly}} hitting player Michael Prince under the chin {{to get him}} to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, [...] "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> {{to go out there and}} don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace somewhere down the crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of like a guy with a deep voice telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart. His follow-up single there, [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] (also from the album), reached number 95.|$|E

The {{story of his}} life is mine, could I but understand. It's right here pouring into my miserable {{inadequate}} ears, only I can't catch it." ...|$|R
500|$|... "If the {{director}} tells the producer {{that he wants}} 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{have been}} having a chat with Mr. Fink-Nottle, and <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about this Mephistopheles scheme of yours." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 24 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili had {{a lengthy}} televised speech. He remembered that after 2004 Adjara crisis he phoned President Putin and thanked him. [...] "I remember that conversation very well; {{in response to}} my polite remarks, he said roughly: ‘Now remember, in Adjara we did not intervene, but you won’t have any gifts from us in South Ossetia or Abkhazia.’ That’s {{what he said to}} me." [...] He then said [...] "I suppose that Russia started thinking about military intervention in Georgia sometime in 2007." [...] " [...] Russia announced a withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, limiting military forces in [...] and the Caucasus." [...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," [...] Saakashvili said.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Appleby is very {{enthusiastic}} about you. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> just now about his trip in Upper Egypt. He's tremendously impressed. He said I {{ought to be}} very proud of you.|$|E
60|$|Alicia {{had noticed}} our aside--when did {{anything}} ever escape her?--and when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gone she asked, significantly, what secret <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' said she, 'this {{creature}} says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> our lost son. <b>He</b> has <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stolen {{seven years}} ago, and bewitched by a fairy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{had begun}} to walk away with this, but my {{companion}} pulled up {{at the door of}} the room. [...] "I'm sure <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> She <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> near." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} once <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about Snake Anson's gang. He mentioned you. Said {{you were}} a real gun-fighter. And what a shame it was {{you had to be}} an outlaw." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked across}} {{at him a}} little incredulously. This was a strange story which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> and I knew very well, from the growing {{excitement}} of his manner, that its culmination was to come.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, by the way,' said Norris, 'I {{was talking}} to young Wilson {{yesterday}} evening. Or rather he {{was talking to}} me. Decent kid, isn't he? <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about Farnie. The M.C.C. match, you know, and so on.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] he said, not unkindly. [...] "I want to {{have you}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about my son. <b>He</b> has <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> all about you. Now let's have {{your side of the}} story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you {{are this}} boy's father,' said Nicholas, 'look at the wreck <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that you purpose {{to send him}} back to that loathsome den from which I brought him.' ...|$|R
60|$|He rose again. The nearer <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> {{all that}} he had kept {{concealed}} from me thus far, the harder {{it seemed to be}} to him to say the first words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Last week I met Cousin Dick in town," [...] said May, [...] "and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> {{how that}} Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell {{had left the}} Hall. He said the pair were terribly down on all you Rovers." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} me that he was asking me a good deal more than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> and I said to him: [...] "That is what I want to find out. What is the family home of the Dorkminsters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... --He {{had a good}} {{slice of}} luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me...</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's possible. But I {{should not}} think he knew him. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> just <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the news that came to him by way of business. How would he know this Pinkerton man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{no fear of}} his {{spending}} all his money,' said their host, 'for the young man has brought me such a letter that if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to rebuild the temple, I must do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that I <b>am</b> doing well," [...] he said. [...] "Have {{you only}} just come? I have been {{wondering}} what had {{had become of}} you. You looked so pale, yesterday, that I was afraid you might be ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't be him, Pierre. I saw Louis Godier yesterday, he {{has come}} home on leave--he belongs to this town, you know--wounded at Lille. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about the siege, {{and he said that}} the marquis was taken {{prisoner}} by the English." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{remember}} now. It's {{just that}} {{you remind me of}} a man I met at Roville. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the story of his life, and how he had made a hash of everything. Well, that took all you had, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It isn't diffidence exactly. Talking of old Nutcombe, I was {{speaking}} to Gates again the other night. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about America. There's {{a lot of money}} to be made over there, you know, and the committee owes me a holiday. They would give me a few weeks off any time I liked.|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes! 'Tis thoughted {{that great}} things may come o't. No doubt a mampus of volk {{of our own}} rank will be down here in their {{carriages}} as soon as 'tis known. Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston, and <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the whole pedigree of the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{crashed on}} {{me like a}} {{thunderbolt}} last night after dinner. We were walking in the garden, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> how <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> bitten by a poisonous zongo, when I seemed to go all giddy. When I came to myself I was in Eddie's arms. His face was pressed against mine, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gargling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{possible}} that we might deal," [...] Laverick remarked, kicking the revolver a little further away. [...] "Unfortunately, I am {{too much in the}} dark. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> the real position of the murdered man? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> murdered? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> the contents of this document and why it was in his possession? Perhaps I may then be inclined to treat with you." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE (laughing). We're {{supposed}} to be fighting a war for democracy. I was talking to old Bains yesterday,--he's still able to run a lathe, {{and he was in}} the Civil War, you know. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> how the boys in his regiment stopped to pick blackberries {{on the way to the}} battle of Bull Run.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! we were talking. I'd {{been telling}} him about leaves and things, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> some of his queer plays. Now, then, Major, fish away;" [...] and Dan {{finished}} off his work by putting a big blue fly on the bent pin which hung {{at the end of}} the cord he had tied to the willow-rod.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} doubt that the scoundrel has passed his whole existence in misdirecting travellers!" [...] returned the other. [...] "By my soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood before that fellow face to face and didn't knock his brains out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in love," [...] cried Lady Narborough, [...] "and that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{afraid to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> for fear I should <b>be</b> jealous. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> quite right. I {{certainly}} should." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Why in {{the world}} shouldn't your analogy have put me?" [...] He spoke with gaiety, but with lucidity. [...] "I'm not an idiot either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah me, where shall I go?" [...] And she put {{the hand}} which was at liberty up to her temple, {{brushing}} back her hair as though she might thus collect her thoughts. [...] "Where shall I go? But {{he does not know}} it yet. I will go now to Orley Farm. When must <b>he</b> <b>be</b> told? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> that. When must he know it?" ...|$|R
