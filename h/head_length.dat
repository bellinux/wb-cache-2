This species is difficult to distinguish from the better-known frilled shark (C. anguineus), but is smaller at maturity and differs in several proportional measurements including <b>head</b> <b>length</b> and mouth width.

25|$|The bludger has a {{body shape}} {{very similar to}} the yellowspotted trevally, being more {{elongated}} and subcylindricall than most of the genus Carangoides. As a juvenile, the fish is ovate, becoming more elongated with age, with the convex dorsal profile of the head and nape becoming less steep with age also. The dorsal fin is in two distinct parts, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second is composed of 1 spines and 28 to 32 soft rays, with the anterior lobe of this fin being shorter than the <b>head</b> <b>length.</b> The anal fin has two anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine attached to 24 to 26 soft rays and the pelvic fin has 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The lateral line has a gentle anterior arch which is slightly longer than the straight section of the lateral line, with the intersection below the sixteenth to twentieth soft ray of the dorsal fin. The curved section contains 78 to 80 scales while the straight section consists of 15 to 19 scales and 21 to 27 scutes. The breast is scaleless until the origin of the pelvic fins and up to the origin of the pectoral fins. In adults, the mouth cleft is level with the eye, with the both jaws containing bands of villiform teeth which become wider anteriorly. There are 27 to 31 gill rakers in total and 25 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|As worker ants grow {{to larger}} sizes, {{the shape of}} the head changes, due to the <b>head</b> <b>length</b> growing {{at the same time as}} the total body length, and the head width may grow by 20%. The length of the {{antennae}} only grows slowly; the antennae may only grow 60% longer by the time the body doubles its length, thus the relative antennal length decreases by 20% as the length of the body doubles. All individual legs of the body are isometric with body length meaning that even when the length of the body doubles, the legs will also double. However, not all of the legs are the same length; the prothoracic portion accounts for 29% of leg length, the mesothoracic 31%, and the metathoracic 41%. The first two pairs of legs are of equal length to one another, whereas the final pair is longer. Overall, the morphological appearance of a worker changes dramatically when it grows larger. The head exhibits the greatest shape change and the height of the alinotum grows quicker than its length, where a height/length ratio of 0.27 in minor workers and 0.32 in major workers is seen. Due to this, larger workers tend to have a humped-shape and robust alinotum in contrast to smaller workers. No petiole segment exhibits any change in shape as the size of the body changes. The width of the gaster grows more rapidly than its length, where the width may be 96% of its length but increases to 106%.|$|E
25|$|The yellowspotted {{trevally}} {{is a large}} fish, {{growing to}} at least 1.2 m in length and reaching a recorded maximum weight of 18kg. Its body shape is like the jacks of the genus Caranx, being more elongated and subcylindrical {{than most of the}} othe species of Carangoides. As a juvenile, the fish is more subovate, becoming more elongated with age, with the dorsal profile of the head and nape becoming steeper with age also. The dorsal fin is in two distinct parts, the first consisting of eight spines, while the second is composed of one spine and 25 to 30 soft rays, with the anterior lobe of this fin being shorter than the <b>head</b> <b>length.</b> The anal fin has two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine attached to 21 to 26 soft rays and the pelvic fin has one spine and 18 to 19 soft rays.

The curved section contains 80 to 88 scales, while the straight section consists of 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is scaleless until the origin of the pelvic fins and up to the origin of the pectoral fins, although some individuals have a narrow band of scales separating the pectoral fins. In adults, the mouth cleft is directly beneath the eye, with the both jaws containing bands of villiform teeth. It has 22 to 27 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] {{species was}} {{described}} {{from a pair}} of wingless females, assumed to be workers. [...] There is a covering of tapered setae along the upper surface of the clypeus, and the front corners of the clypeus cover the bases of the mandibles. [...] There is a row of over 20 denticles along the front edge of the clypeus. [...] Small ocelli are positioned just above and between the rear margins of the compound eyes. [...] Due to the incomplete preservation of the head, the total length of the antennae could not be determined. [...] Carinae formed from raised cuticle ridges run from the outside edges of the compound eyes to between the antennae bases. [...] The mesosoma is notably elongated, being more than twice as long as high. The elongation of the mesopleuron results in a wide gap between the fore legs and the middle plus hind legs. [...] While the metanotal spiracle is slightly raised from mesosoma on a turret like projection, the metapleural gland is placed in a slight depression in the mesosoma. [...] The gaster is about half of the overall body length with a sting present in the holotype. [...] The proportions of the <b>head</b> <b>length</b> and width are approximately even, as is seen in the species G. robustus, G. spiralis, and G. subcuspis.

The thorax is almost identical, but the clear space between the metapleural striate area and propodeal spiracles is either a narrow crease or not present. The side portions of the petiole are punctate. The sides of the postpetiole are opaque with punctures present, but no irregular roughening is seen. The anterior of the dorsum is shagreen, and the middle and rear regions bear transverse puncto-striae. All these regions have erect hairs. The anterior portions of both the petiole and postpetiole have appressed pubescence that is also seen on the propodeum. The colour of the queen {{is similar to that}} of a worker: the gaster is dark brown and the legs, scapes, and thorax are light brown with dark streaks on the mesoscutum. The head is yellowish or yellowish-brown around the central regions, the occiput and mandibles are a similar colour to the thorax, and the wing veins range from colourless to pale brown. Males appear similar to S. richteri, but the upper borders of the petiolar scales are more concave. In both species, the postpetiole's and petiole's spiracles strongly project. The whole body of the male is concolorous black, but the antennae are whitish. Like the queen, the wing veins are colourless or pale brown.|$|E

Unlike most of the Carangoides, however, the blue trevallyâs snout is bluntly rounded, resembling the snouts of the pompanos of the genus Trachinotus and the lips of adults are notably fleshy. Two separate dorsal fins are found, the first having eight spines, while the second consists of one spine and 26 to 34 soft rays; more than any other species in Carangoides. In young adults, the lobe of the second dorsal fin is often falcate, but usually shorter than the <b>head</b> <b>length.</b> The anal fin has two anteriorly [...] detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 21 to 26 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has one spine attached to 20 or 21 soft rays.

The curved section of the lateral line contains 82 to 90 scales, while the straight section has 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is naked ventrally to origin of the pelvic fins and the base of the pectoral fins, but is interrupted laterally by a moderate band of scales.
