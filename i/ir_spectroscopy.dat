25|$|Baltic amber {{yields on}} dry {{distillation}} succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest {{in the pale}} opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via <b>IR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. <b>IR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> can detect the relative age of an amber sample.

Over the past few decades, Raman and <b>IR</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> with the development of more sophisticated instruments can provide high-resolution spectral data from heterogeneous biological samples, which consisting of large amount of biochemical information, is complex. Therefore, computational analysis is employed to process and analyse the data for obtaining meaningful information and getting deeper insight into the wavenumbers-related biochemical alterations. Carbon-based nanoparticles (CNPs) are most widely used novel nanomaterials. With their widespread application, concerns emerge on their potential risk to the health of organism and human, and investigation on their possible toxicity is urgently required. This thesis is contributing to the toxicity assessment of CNPs by using spectroscopic techniques coupled with computational analysis.

The method or technique of infrared spectroscopy is conducted with an instrument called an infrared spectrometer (or spectrophotometer) to produce an infrared spectrum.

Typical units of frequency used in IR spectra are reciprocal centimeters (sometimes called wave numbers), with the symbol cm−1. Units of IR wavelength are commonly given in micrometers (formerly called [...] "microns"), symbol μm, which are related to wave numbers in a reciprocal way. A common laboratory instrument that uses this technique is a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Two-dimensional IR is also possible as discussed below.|$|E
