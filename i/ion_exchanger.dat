50|$|A lab scale {{synthesis}} of 1,4-butanesultone starts from 4,4'-dichlorodibutyl ether (accessible from tetrahydrofuran treated with phosphorus oxychloride and concentrated sulfuric acid), which reacts with sodium sulfite forming the corresponding 4,4'-butanedisulfonic disodium salt. By passing it through an acidic <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger,</b> the disodium salt is converted into the disulphonic acid which forms two molecules of 1,4-butanesultone at elevated temperature and reduced pressure under elimination of water.

5000|$|In ion {{exchange}} chromatography, the Gibbs-Donnan effect is observed when the pH of the applied buffer and the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> differ, even {{up to one}} pH unit. For example, in anion-exchange columns, the {{ion exchange}}rs repeal protons so the pH of the buffer near the column differs {{is higher than the}} rest of the solvent.

50|$|Pendrin is an <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{found in}} many types of cells in the body. High levels of pendrin {{expression}} {{have been identified in}} the inner ear and thyroid. In the thyroid, pendrin mediates a component of the efflux of iodide across the apical membrane of the thyrocyte, which is critical for the formation of thyroid hormone. The exact function of pendrin in the inner ear remains unclear; however, pendrin {{may play a role in}} acid-base balance as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, regulate volume homeostasis through its ability to function as a chloride-formate exchanger or indirectly modulate the calcium concentration of the endolymph. Pendrin is also expressed in the kidney, and has been localized to the apical membrane of a population of intercalated cells in the cortical collecting duct where it is involved in bicarbonate secretion.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "strong" [...] <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{will not}} lose the charge on its matrix once the column is equilibrated {{and so a}} wide range of pH buffers can be used. [...] "Weak" [...] ion {{exchangers}} have a range of pH values in which they will maintain their charge. If the pH of the buffer used for a weak ion exchange column goes out of the capacity range of the matrix, the column will lose its charge distribution and the molecule of interest may be lost. Despite the smaller pH range of weak ion exchangers, they are often used over strong ion exchangers due to their having greater specificity. In some experiments, the retention times of weak ion exchangers are just long enough to obtain desired data at a high specificity.|$|E

5000|$|Radioactive {{waste is}} {{generated}} from the nuclear weapons program, commercial nuclear power, medical applications, and corporate and university-based research programs. Some of the materials LLW consists of are: [...] "gloves and other protective clothing, glass and plastic laboratory supplies, machine parts and tools, and disposable medical items that have {{come in contact with}} radioactive materials". Waste is generally categorized as high level waste (HLW) and low-level waste (LLW). LLW contains materials such as irradiated tools, lab clothing, <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> resins, animal carcasses, and trash from defense, commercial nuclear power, medical, and research activities. These materials usually have radioactivity that have short half lives—from ranges of multiple days to several hundred years. In 1990, 1.1 million cubic feet of LLW was produced. Currently, U.S. reactors generate about 40,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste per year, including contaminated components and materials resulting from reactor decommissioning.|$|E
50|$|Cardiac glycosides {{affect the}} sodium-{{potassium}} ATPase pump in cardiac muscle cells {{to alter their}} function. Normally, these sodium-potassium pumps move potassium ions in and sodium ions out. Cardiac glycosides, however, inhibit this pump by stabilizing it in the E2-P transition state, so that sodium cannot be extruded: intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases. With regards to potassium ion movement, because both cardiac glycosides and potassium compete for binding to the ATPase pump, changes in extracellular potassium concentration can potentially lead to altered drug efficacy. Nevertheless, by carefully controlling the dosage, such adverse effects can be avoided. Continuing on with the mechanism, raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit the function of a second membrane <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger,</b> NCX, {{which is responsible for}} pumping calcium ions out of the cell and sodium ions in at a ratio of 3Na/Ca. Thus, calcium ions are also not extruded and will begin to build up inside the cell as well.|$|E
50|$|In biomolecules, {{proteins}} can {{be separated}} by ion exchange chromatography. Biological proteins {{are made up}} of zwitterionic amino acid compounds; the net charge of these proteins can be positive or negative depending on the pH of the environment. The specific pI of the target protein can be used to model the process around and the compound can then be purified {{from the rest of the}} mixture. Buffers of various pH can be used for this purification process to change the pH of the environment. When a mixture containing a target protein is loaded into an <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger,</b> the stationary matrix can be either positively-charged (for mobile anions) or negatively-charged (for mobile cations). At low pH values, the net charge of most proteins in the mixture is positive - in cation exchangers, these positively-charged proteins bind to the negatively-charged matrix. At high pH values, the net charge of most proteins is negative, where they bind to the positively-charged matrix in anion exchangers. When the environment is at a pH value equal to the protein's pI, the net charge is zero, and the protein is not bound to any exchanger, and therefore, can be eluted out.|$|E
50|$|Polystyrene {{is used as}} {{a medium}} for ion- exchange. It is made from the {{polymerization}} of styrene with the use of divinylbenzene and benzoyl peroxide. Such exchangers form hydrophobic interactions with proteins which can be irreversible. Due to this property, polystyrene <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> are not suitable for protein separation. They are used on the other hand for the separation of small molecules in amino acid separation and removal of salt from water. Polystyrene <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> with large pores can be used for the separation of protein but must be coated with a hydrophillic substance.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>ion</b> <b>{{exchange}}rs</b> are <b>ion</b> exchange resins (functionalized porous or gel polymer), zeolites, montmorillonite, clay, {{and soil}} humus. <b>Ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> are either cation exchangers that exchange positively charged ions (cations) or anion exchangers that exchange negatively charged ions (anions). There are also amphoteric exchangers that {{are able to}} exchange both cations and anions simultaneously. However, the simultaneous exchange of cations and anions can be more efficiently performed in mixed beds that contain a mixture of anion and cation exchange resins, or passing the treated solution through several different ion exchange materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{level of}} heavy metals {{in the environment}} is a serious environmental problem. Various methods {{have been developed to}} remove these metals from aqueous systems, but these methods have limitations. Because of the limitations, researchers prompted to exploit inorganic materials as <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers.</b> These inorganic <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> are able to obtain specific metal ions/anions or organic molecules. Following research in 2010, there has been a synthesis and analytical application on a new thermally stable composite cation exchange material: poly-o-toluidine stannic molybdate. This material showed a high selectivity for Pb2+ and Hg2+ metal ions.|$|R
50|$|Ion {{chromatography}} (or ion-exchange chromatography) is a chromatography {{process that}} separates ions and polar molecules {{based on their}} affinity to the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger.</b> It works on almost any kind of charged molecule—including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. The two types of ion chromatography are anion-exchange and cation-exchange. It is often used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control. The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase. The equilibrated stationary phase consists of an ionizable functional group where the targeted molecules of a mixture to be separated and quantified can bind while passing through the column—a cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations. Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions. The bound molecules then can be eluted and collected using an eluant which contains anions and cations by running higher concentration of ions through the column or changing pH of the column. One of the primary advantages {{for the use of}} ion chromatography is only one interaction involved during the separation as opposed to other separation techniques; therefore, ion chromatography may have higher matrix tolerance. However, there are also disadvantages involved when performing ion-exchange chromatography, such as constant evolution with the technique which leads to the inconsistency from column to column.|$|E
