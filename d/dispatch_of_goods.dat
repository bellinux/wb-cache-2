50|$|The {{building}} is of Federation Free Classical style, containing French Renaissance elements with a skyline of a 70 ft tower, gables. turrets and ornamental chimneys. The dominant feature on the skyline is the circular, domed, dragon's scale copper clad, turret. The general {{layout of the}} {{building is}} a U-shape with the open end of the U facing away from Cliff Street. It rests on a wide foundation of concrete, above which is Melbourne bluestone. Between the base and the first floor is Cottesloe stone; above this is constructed from brick and cement dressings.When constructed the building had 30000 sq ft of floor space. The floorboards were made of 2 in jarrah supported on 12 in jarrah joists. The basement floor was made of cement.The warehouse had three floors and was 215 ft long and 57 ft wide with large sliding doors that opened directly onto the railway line side. Large flanking windows provided light for the interior. The warehouse was fitted with an electric wool press, three electric lifts and four travelling cranes to allow for swift <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Abstract: For {{logistics}} centers {{the disposition}} and <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{has reached a}} high standard of automation. However, the trucks and trailers bringing and taking the goods are driven manually. This can at least be improved for the non-public traffic in the scope of logistics centers by autonomous forward and backward motion control for standard transportation vehicles. By an experimental system {{it has been shown}} that truck and trailer can be maneuvered autonomously at a high degree of precision. For purposes of safety it is necessary to guarantee that at any instant of time the vehicle is within some predefined area. Therefore this paper introduces the principle of safe cover segments which are never left by the vehicle in motion and defines rules for the connection of such segments forming a safe corridor...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Bachelor Thesis is the designof the Lahofer winery in Dobšice,a new building near Znojmo. The Bachelor Thesis expands and specifies an architectural study which I drafted as my AG 33 subject during the summer semester of my second year (i. e. up {{to the level of}} Documentation for Planning Permission and Documentation for Execution of the Project). The tasked assignment is to design a winemaking house with amain production part, which allows for production from 750 thousand to 1 million bottlesper year, and to design an administrative part with premises for temporary workers. Other part includes a restaurant and public accommodations. A sloping terrain influences the whole design. So as not to give the impression of monumental dimensions the object is embedded into the ground as well. The exterior of the building appears as three interlocking blocks where in each block has its own purpose. The original idea was to construct the building parallel to the major axis, which is formed by the road. The production part meets this requirement. The administrative part is situated such that a partly roofed handling courtyard is created. From this courtyard, there is an entry point for employees and temporary workers {{as well as for the}} <b>dispatching</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and purchasing. The third part, where the restaurant and guest accommodations are situated, makes up the first floor. This block is situated such that a view of the surrounding vineyards is offered and simultaneously creates a terrace with entry to the restaurant. There is a fire escape going from the main production part as well. The façade is a combination of two contrasting materials,(i. e. structured concrete slabs and facade panels known as “Cor-ten”). Lastly, a staircase sheathing offers space for the company name and logo, “Vinařství Lahofer“, which can plainly be seen directly from the access road...|$|R

Yet, these inspections, that guarantee the product is released under the necessary conditions, do not add value to it {{and this is where}} reducing inspection costs is no longer useless and contributes enormously to the final price of the product satisfying both the business and the customer. The purpose of this investigation is to design a supply chain model, where the buying-selling relationship of both client and supplier are shown, under regular transactions and sampling plans both for acceptance of the final product by the client and for the <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by the supplier.

The range of Web-based applications varies enormously, from simple static Web {{sites that are}} essentially hypertext document presentation applications, to sophisticated high-volume e-comtnerce applications often involving supply, sourcing, ordering, payment tracking and <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> or the provision of services. In other words, it provides users with business logic facilities, navigational structure, and also presentational aspects. In the context of presentational design, Web applications often contain significant multimedia content such as images, movie clips, sound clips and text, requiring specialist mechanism for their development. These elements of presentational need for mechanisms {{that can be used}} to support the modeling of user interfaces, which showing how navigational is presented to the user. We choose UML as modeling tool for presentational design, based on two important advantages. First, UML has been become a de facto standard for the design of object oriented systems. Second, and the most important one. CASE tools supporting UML can be used in the Web application development process. Note, UML can be used to model different kinds of systems such as software systems, hardware systems, and real-world organizations. The purpose of this paper is to show how UML notation and UML modeling techniques can be used in the Web application presentational modeling. UML stereotypes are specified for presentational design, according to the UML extension mechanisms defined in UML...|$|E

Tea and chocolate, eggs, ham, and pastry, not forgetting the broiled fish, disappeared with a celerity which seemed to astonish the good-humoured Quakers, who kept loading my plate with supplies, as if desirous of seeing whether they could, by any possibility, tire me out. One hint, however, I received, which put me in mind where I was. Miss Geddes had offered me some sweet-cake, which, at the moment, I declined; but presently afterwards, seeing it within my reach, I naturally enough helped myself to a slice, and had just; deposited it beside my plate, when Joshua, mine host, not with the authoritative air of Sancho's doctor, Tirteafuera, but in a very calm and quiet manner, lifted it away and replaced it on the dish, observing only, 'Thou didst refuse it before, friend Latimer.' ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the experience of}} redesigning in-plant logistics operations of a large petrochemical complex in India. The complex under reference {{is expected to have}} a traffic volume of one truck per one minute by 2005. The existing systems and procedures to receive and inspect a truck, load material, and complete commercial formalities are designed with a target truck turnaround time of 82 minutes. However, in reality the actual truck turnaround time is significantly higher than the target turnaround time. The plant is located in a growing industrial area. Inordinate delay in truck turnaround time is a major demotivating factor for the truck companies to place their trucks with this complex. Consequently, there is a significant variation between the planned and actual <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>goods.</b> This investigation systematically analyzes the reasons for significant departure in the truck turnaround time. A truck driver survey is used to identify and prioritize areas of delay. As a consequence of this analysis, it is argued that deployment of additional resources, optimizing the activity processing time, sub-contracting some of the activities and extensive automation of the process would only marginally improve the performance of the turnaround time. In order to improve the turnaround time substantially, {{there is a need to}} redefine work, and fundamentally change the underlying process. Accordingly, several initiatives are identified to ensure dramatic reduction in the truck turnaround time. ...|$|R
40|$|A. Trade {{and balance}} sheet data The Intrastat {{databank}} collects information and produces statistics on <b>dispatches</b> and arrivals <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in European Union countries and replaced customs declarations {{as the source of}} trade statistics. In particular, the national authorities collect data on the identification number allocated to the party responsible for providing information, the reference period, the flow (arrival, dispatch), the value and quantity <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> in net mass (weight excluding packaging) and the supplementary unit (litre, m, number of items, etc.) if relevant, and their destination. Firms whose annual trade amount is above a certain value are responsible for providing information and this threshold value is re-defined so that a minimum amount of data is collected for each trade flow. Each year, national authorities define their thresholds, set in such a way so as to collect data relating to at least 97 % <b>of</b> all <b>dispatches.</b> The classification <b>of</b> all reported exported goods (approximately 2500 products) follows the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) system. Our dataset consists of products in the following manufacturing categories: chemicals (Section 5), machinery and transport equipment (Section 7), other manufactured goods (Sections 6 and 8). We calculate unit prices using the following rule for quantities. If the number of non-available observations for each product is smaller (exceeds...|$|R
50|$|The railway saw {{significantly}} less transport than estimated. There {{was very little}} lumber transport from Messel, in part because a timber slide had been built at Rykene in 1902. The factory at Rykene also chose to build an aerial tramway to transport its wood pulp instead of sending it via the railway. Passenger traffic was limited on the inner parts of the line; particularly the detour via Rorevann was a disadvantage, as people from Fjære were 3 km from the center via the road, but 8 km by rail. From 1 July 1910 to 31 June 1911, the line transport 40,077 people, of which 152 traveled on second class and the rest in third class.

In a letter dated 28 May, NSB proposed closing the line from 1 October 1958, and received support from the Ministry of Transport and Communications. However, Grimstad would need new and better roads should it lose the railway line, particularly the road from Grimstad to Blakstad. Because it took time to organize a new such road, the date of closing the line was delayed. Nic.
