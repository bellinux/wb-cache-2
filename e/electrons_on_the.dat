5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
25|$|Ethers are {{slightly}} polar. The C–O–C bond angle in the functional group is about 110°, and the C–O dipoles do not cancel out. Ethers are more polar than alkenes {{but not as}} polar as alcohols, esters, or amides of comparable structure. The presence of two lone pairs of <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding with water molecules possible.|$|E
25|$|Alcohols can be {{oxidised}} to give aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic acids, or {{they can}} be dehydrated to alkenes. They can react with carboxylic acids to form ester compounds, and they can (if activated first) undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. The lone pairs of <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles. For more details, see the reactions of alcohols section below.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} tyrosine residue {{in the active}} site of aldehyde reductase. The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that grabs the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group.

25|$|Unlike most amines, indole is not basic: {{just like}} pyrrole, the {{aromatic}} {{character of the}} ring means that the lone pair of <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nitrogen atom is not available for protonation. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can, however, protonate indole. Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of {{the portion of the}} molecule located outside of the benzene ring. The protonated form has an pKa of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., tryptamines) under acidic conditions is caused by this protonation.|$|E
25|$|Once the electron's spin was discovered, it {{was clear}} that the {{magnetism}} should be due to a large number of electrons spinning in the same direction. It was natural to ask how the electrons all know which direction to spin, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with the <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electrons could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.|$|E

25|$|The fourth box is Step 3, {{which is}} the {{saturation}} of the alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

25|$|Plants use {{carbon dioxide}} {{gas in the}} process of photosynthesis, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The {{chemical}} equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to use it.|$|E
25|$|When {{placed in}} the sun, photons of the {{sunlight}} can excite <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> p-type side of the semiconductor, {{a process known as}} photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy valence band into the higher-energy conduction band. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow out of the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then flow back into the p-type material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.|$|E

2500|$|At present, {{approximately}} {{fifteen percent}} of electricity consumed {{on the island}} is generated from renewable energy (largely wind turbines); the provincial government has set renewable energy targets as high as 30-50% for electricity consumed by 2015. Until wind generation, the province relied entirely on electricity imports on a submarine cable from New Brunswick. A thermal oil-fired generating station in Charlottetown is also available. Electricity rates in the province were in 2011 the highest in Canada, at a domestic rate of 0.161 $/kWh. The province imports about 85 per cent of its power through New Brunswick. The maintenance shutdown of Point Lepreau nuclear plant forced the province to acquire most of its <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> expensive open market.

2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is a floating gate (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM). Counter-intuitively, placing <b>electrons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E
