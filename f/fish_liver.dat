However. {{the effects of}} TBT, TPT, and a mixture of the two on DNA methylation in marine <b>fish</b> <b>livers</b> and the mechanism involved remain to be elucidated. Previous study have proved that abnormal methylation patterns are induced by the balance of transmethylation reaction including the tissue level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or the activity of DNA (cytosine- 5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT 1). Therefore, in the present study, we assessed their ability to cause hepatic DNA hypomethylation in Sebastiscus marmoratus liver and the related mechanism. The results showed that TBT, TPT, and a mixture of the two significantly induced DNA hypomethylation in the <b>fish</b> <b>livers</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, we identified strong linear correlations between S-adenosylhomocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, or the SAM to SAH ratio and the hepatic genome-wide 5 -methylcytosine content of the DNA, but no correlation between the latter and the DNMT 1 expression level. It is therefore proposed that the organotins hypomethylation induced in the marine <b>fish</b> <b>livers</b> was due to altering {{the balance of the}} substrate and the product in transmethylation reactions.

The results showed that TBT, TPT and the mixture significantly decreased liver DNA integrity in a dose-dependent manner. Using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, we identified that the hepatic total tin concentration was significantly correlated with hepatic DNA integrity after exposure to TBT alone and combined exposure to TBT and TPT. In order to clarify the mechanism which influences DNA repair, the mRNA levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes were determined using real-time PCR analysis. The results showed that NER gene expression levels were disturbed. The expression of XPB, ERCC 1, and DNA Pole epsilon was significantly decreased after treatment with TBT, TPT and the mixture, while the expression of PCNA, HR 23 B, XPG, and DNA lig III was significantly increased in treated-groups compared to the control. Based on this, we proposed that TBT, TPT and a mixture of the two induced DNA damage in marine <b>fish</b> <b>livers</b> by altering the transcription levels of the NER genes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Fractionation of trace metals {{in the river}} sediments, the risk to water column contamination and the levels of the six trace metals in Clarias gariepinus and Oreachromis niloticus samples were established. There was considerable risk to river water contamination based on the calculated individual trace metal average contamination factors (IACF) obtained for the river sediments from the trace metal sequential extractions. Also, the distribution and concentration of trace metals obtained in liver, gill, muscle and bone of C. gariepinus and O. niloticus showed that the human health risk for trace metals in muscles of fish were low, but individuals consuming <b>fish</b> <b>livers</b> might be at risk from ingestion of toxic metals at unacceptable concentrations...|$|R
