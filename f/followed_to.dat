5|$|Elias C. Laycock was his 'chief rival'. Just a year {{younger than}} Rush, and like him, a large and {{powerful}} man, Laycock came {{to live on the}} Lower Clarence River around 1874. The two scullers met first at the Queen's Birthday regatta in Grafton in May 1874. Laycock, untried at boat racing, was beaten, though undeterred. During the following years, Laycock challenged Rush and others to sculling matches, until in April 1879, he beat World Champion Trickett at a State regatta. A series of matches <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> determine the current Australian sculling Champion, who would defend the World Title. Laycock beat Rush again and again, but Trickett eventually beat Laycock. Trickett once more went to the Thames to row against Ned Hanlan, but these preliminary contests in Sydney marked the end of Rush's World Championship ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E

US-62 {{followed}} Newcastle Boulevard {{into the}} city and turned eastbound onto S.E. 29th Street, which it <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> Robinson Avenue. It then turned north onto Robinson, which was also US-77, towards downtown. Through downtown, US-62 followed Robinson, while US-77 paralleled it one block to the east on Broadway. At N.E. 23rd Street, US-62 turned east, concurring with US-270, US-66 CITY, and the second State Highway 1. US-77 also ran along 23rd Street from Broadway to Lincoln Boulevard, where it split off to the north, along with US-66 CITY. US-62/270/SH-1 then continued along 23rd Street to Spencer.|$|E

5|$|This final Confederate assault {{through the}} Wheatfield {{continued}} past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat {{in the summer}} heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.|$|E
5|$|What is now US 1 Bus. {{north of}} the Brunswick Circle was {{chartered}} {{as part of the}} Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike in 1803. This turnpike became a public road in 1903. In 1926, the U.S. Highway System was created and US 1 was designated to run through the Trenton area from the Lower Trenton Bridge north to Pre-1927 Route 13, which it <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> New Brunswick. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, pre-1927 Route 13 became Route 27 and the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, which ran parallel to pre-1927 Route 13 in Trenton, became Route 26. By the 1930s, US 1 was rerouted to follow Route 26 between Trenton and New Brunswick, with US 206 being designated along Route 27 in Trenton.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the late}} 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden, the main source for {{information}} on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> record the payments, which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts. These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.|$|E
5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it {{was in the}} best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were <b>followed</b> <b>to</b> Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E

Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is seen by a technician. He manages to evade the security guards by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make {{their way back to}} Las Vegas; they are seen there by the Las Vegas police, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade all the cars.|$|E
