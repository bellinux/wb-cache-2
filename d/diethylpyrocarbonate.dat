Distinct and incremental changes in the UV absorption, emission fluorescence, and near UV-CD spectra of the enzyme upon its titration with increasing concentrations of <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> or N-bromosuccinimide may be ascribed to modification and/or changes in the microenvironment of aromatic amino acid residue(s) such as tryptophan in the enzyme...|$|E

40|$|Using {{site-specific}} intercalation {{directed by}} intermolecular triplex formation, the conformation of an intercalation site in DNA was examined by footprinting with the purine-specific (A {{much greater than}} G) reagent <b>diethylpyrocarbonate.</b> Site specific intercalation was achieved by covalently linking an intercalator to the 5 ' end of a homopyrimidine oligodeoxynucleotide, which bound to a homopurinehomopyrimidine stretch in a recombinant plasmid via intermolecular triplex formation. This directs intercalation to a single site in 3 kb of DNA at the 5 ' triplex-duplex junction. Footprinting with <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> and dimethylsulphate revealed strong protection from modification of adenine residues within the triple-helix in concordance with their Hoogsteen pairing with the third strand, and a strong hypersensitivity to <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> at the first adenine of the duplex. This result indicates that intercalation at this site induces a conformational change at the 5 ' triplex-duplex junction. Furthermore, the same diethlypyrocarbonate hypersensitivity was observed with an unmodified triple-strand forming oligonucleotide {{and a range of}} intercalating molecules present in solution. Thus the 5 ' triplex-duplex junction is a strong binding site for some intercalating molecules and the junction undergoes a conformational change which is sensitive to <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> upon insertion of the planar aromatic chromophore.

Incubation of the enzyme with <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> at 25 degrees C and pH 7. 0 irreversibly inhibits enzyme activity by a pseudo first-order kinetics process.

Reconstitution experiments of apochloroperoxidase by vanadate at different pH values showed that in the pH 6 – 7 range an acid/base group is present which affects the binding of the vanadate. It is proposed that this group is a histidine. This hypothesis was tested by specifically modifying this residue using <b>diethylpyrocarbonate.</b> In the apo-enzyme 9 histidines were modified, whereas in the holo-enzyme 6 histidines were modified. Modification with <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> {{had no effect on}} the chlorinating activity of the holo-enzyme, but when the apo-enzyme was modified the reactivation by vanadate was strongly inhibited.

Desensitization of the enzyme to the inhibitor malate and the activator glucose 6 -phosphate was accompanied by the appearance of a peak in the ultraviolet difference spectrum at 240 nanometers, indicating the formation of ethoxyformylhistidyl derivatives. Hydroxylamine reversed part of the spectral change under native conditions, and almost all of the change under denaturing conditions, but failed to restore sensitivity to effectors. The pH profiles of desensitization to malate and glucose 6 -phosphate indicated the involvement of groups on the enzyme with pK, values of 6. 8 and 6. 4, respectively. Under denaturing conditions, a total of 15 histidine residues per subunit were modified by <b>diethylpyrocarbonate,</b> whereas for the native enzyme nine histidines were modified per subunit. Effector desensitization occurs after the modification of two to three histidyl residues per subunit. The presence of malate reduced the apparent rate constant for desensitization by 60 %, suggesting that the modification occurred at the malate binding site. <b>Diethylpyrocarbonate</b> treatment also eliminated the kinetic lag caused by malate.

Scatchard analysis of the binding data shows that 50 mM 2, 3 -butanedione decreases the binding capacity of [H- 3]nitrendipine from a control value of 71 +/- 6 fmol/mg of protein to 40 +/- 3 fmol/mg of protein. Complete and selective protection against inactivation is provided by nifedipine. No decrease of [H- 3]nitrendipine binding occurs when membranes are pretreated with selective histidine reagent <b>diethylpyrocarbonate.</b> The results indicate that arginine but not histidine residue in L-type calcium channel domain is critical for [H- 3]nitrendipine binding.

We explain these phenomena by suggesting that echinomycin binds to the dinucleotide step ApT in a cooperative fashion. The cooperative effects can be transmitted through the dinucleotide step GC but not CC or AA. No such repetitive patterns are seen with surrounding regions of (ATT). (AAT).

40|$|The {{potential}} role of histidine residues of RecA {{protein in}} binding DNA {{has been investigated}} by monitoring their accessibility to <b>diethylpyrocarbonate.</b> In the absence of both DNA and cofactor, only one of two histidine residues is modified by the reagent, indicating that the other residue is buried. However, both histidine residues become accessible after addition of cofactor analog adenosine 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (ATP[S]) indicating {{a change in the}} organization of the RecA filament and/or a change in the conformation of protein. The diethylpyrocarbonate-modified RecA is found to be able to polymerize just as the unmodified protein. The binding of double-stranded DNA, in the presence of ATP[S], reduces the reactivity of both histidine residues to <b>diethylpyrocarbonate.</b> The binding of single-stranded DNA (with ATP[S]) has a similar, though smaller, protective effect. However, no significant dissociation of either of the complexes {{as a result of the}} modification was observed and a RecA molecule which had been modified in the absence of DNA could still bind DNA. A protection of the histidine residues is also effected by high salt concentration which promotes, just as DNA binding, ATPase and coprotease activity in RecA. The protection of histidine residues to <b>diethylpyrocarbonate</b> upon DNA binding probably relates to a conformational change of RecA and may not be any direct effect of shielding by the DNA. Nonetheless, the domains including the histidine residues could be centers of allosteric effects and are concluded to be close to the DNA binding site...|$|E

Phosphate is absolutely required for the dehydrogenase activity. NADP can be utilized by the dehydrogenase with a low turnover rate.
