50|$|The use of {{ferromagnetic}} nanowires for {{the operation}} of magnetic tweezers enlarges their <b>experimental</b> <b>application</b> range. The length of these wires typically is {{in the order of}} tens of nanometers up to tens of micrometers, which is much larger than their diameter. In comparison with superparamagnetic beads, they allow the application of much larger forces and torques. In addition to that, they present a remnant magnetic moment. This allows the operation in weak magnetic field strengths. It is possible to produce nanowires with surface segments that present different chemical properties, which allows controlling the position where the studied molecules can bind to the wire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) {{are very important}} for engineering systems in industrial applications. One {{of the most popular}} approaches is model-based fault detection. Recently, many techniques have been proposed in the FDD area. However, there are still very few reported applications or real-time implementations of the schemes. This paper presents online sensor FDD based on the model-based approach using a Luenberger observer and <b>experimental</b> <b>application</b> on a permanent magnet DC motor. Dierent kinds of faults are simulated on the motor and experiments are performed to detect the faults. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach could signicantly detect the time and size of the faults.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} an <b>experimental</b> <b>application</b> of an inverse method {{leading to the}} identifica-tion of the elastic and damping material properties of isotropic vibrating plates. The theory assumes that the searched parameters can be extracted from curvature and deflection fields measured on the whole sur-face of the plate at two particular instants of the vibrating motion. The <b>experimental</b> <b>application</b> consists in an original excitation fixture, a particular adaptation of an optical full field measurement technique, a data preprocessing giving the curvatures and deflection fields and finally in the identification process using the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). The principle of the deflectometry technique used for the mea-surements is presented. First results of identification on acrylic plates are presented and compared to reference values.
