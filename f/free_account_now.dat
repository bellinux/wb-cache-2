50|$|The WELL was {{frequently}} {{mentioned in the}} media in the 1980s and 1990s, probably disproportionately {{to the number of}} users it had relative to other online systems.

As a result, for many journalists it was their first experience of online systems and, later, the Internet, even though other systems existed.
