5|$|The {{cohabitation}} {{lifestyle is}} becoming more popular in today's generation. It is more convenient for couples not to get married {{because it can be}} cheaper and simpler.

5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on the wagon her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E

5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who {{wanted to create a}} scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue had been the one who had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had become much more successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E

Although Kate defends Janet, it is no use. Many people ridicule Janet and seem to have no <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to know her better.|$|E

Burley won a {{unanimous}} {{decision in the}} 15-round bout, knocking Hardwick to the canvas three times and defeating him decisively, taking his title. Burley never defended the title, probably out of a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a title shot with Armstrong. To fill the vacant title, Hardwick and Holman Williams met in a rematch on January 11, 1940 at the Coliseum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|Plex {{began as}} a {{freeware}} hobby project in December 2007 when the developer Elan Feingold {{was looking for a}} media centre application for his Apple Mac, better than Front Row. Feingold came out of the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> XBMC (now known as Kodi) code running on a more powerful machine that could handle higher resolution media than the devices on which XBMC was usually running. According to Feingold, the perfect platform seemed to be the Mac, especially with the form factor of the Mac Mini.|$|E
25|$|Having seen Schiller's play in Milan in an Italian translation, Donizetti {{approached}} the famed librettist Felice Romani, {{who had written}} a successful libretto in 1830 for Anna Bolena, the opera which secured the composer's place {{as one of the}} leaders of his day. Wanting a strong and powerful subject for his new work, the composer's idea was to have Romani prepare a libretto about Mary Stuart, but the librettist appears to have ignored him, perhaps because of his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from writing for the theatre, which he increasingly found to be distasteful.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln had no {{military}} experience {{when he was}} elected captain of his company, but a large number of sources have described him as a capable commander and a popular leader. Lincoln himself expressed a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into combat, though his company has been described as wild and the outcome of such a fight may not have been positive for Lincoln. John Todd Stuart noted that during Lincoln's Black Hawk War service, he stood out for his great strength and athletic ability, as well as his kind manner and as a story teller.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen's move to Ferrari in 2007 saw him secure {{his first}} Formula One World Drivers' Championship, beating McLaren drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso by one point, {{as well as}} {{becoming}} one of the few drivers to win in their first season with Ferrari. In 2008 he equalled the record for fastest laps in a season, for the second time. However, with Ferrari's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Fernando Alonso into the team with his Santander sponsorship, Räikkönen left Scuderia Ferrari and the sport in 2009, after only winning one race in that season due to an uncompetitive car.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Justice made {{indications}} of its <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved, and the FBI {{was called in}} to assist the investigation. One hundred FCC field offices and monitoring stations across the United States were actively involved in the investigation, with no less than six FCC employees working on the case. Oliver Long, the head engineer of the FCC's Texas field office bureau, oversaw the investigation, and the commission assigned agent George Dillon to the case. The case first led investigators from the FCC to focus on the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, after an anonymous tip accused an amateur radio operator residing in Lewisville, Texas, of being the culprit.|$|E

25|$|Increasingly, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle became {{possessed of}} a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Confederate capital, Richmond, and from there attempt to locate the Army of Northern Virginia, with whom he {{intended}} to journey for a while. From Tennessee, he travelled through Augusta and Atlanta, before arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, {{the birthplace of the}} war, on 8 June. The English tourist was keen to inspect the defences of the city, and remained there until 15 June, inspecting Fort Sumter and visiting Morris Island in the company of General Roswell S. Ripley, commander of South Carolina's First Military District. During this stay, Fremantle also met General PGT Beauregard, and a member of Captain Raphael Semmes' crew from the CSS Sumter, whom Fremantle had first met in Gibraltar in 1862.|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{visit to}} Richmond changed him. He {{returned}} to Warrenton morose and introspective. Historian Michael W. Kauffman argues that Powell saw a Baltimore acquaintance in Richmond, and that turned his thoughts {{back to the}} time he'd spent in September 1863 romancing Margaret Branson and her sister, Mary, at the Branson boarding house. Powell biographer Betty Ownsbey, however, argues that his Richmond trip made him aware that the Confederate cause was lost, and his depression was caused by his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the fighting. Several other historians claim that the Confederate Secret Service had already recruited him into its ranks during the previous year (with Mosby's consent), and that Powell's moodiness came from moral misgivings he had as he contemplated being sent north to assist with various kidnap plots against Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|The facade {{is often}} cited as the least {{satisfactory}} part of the design of St. Peter's. The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are {{that it was not}} given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo {{at the other end of}} the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the façade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the attic story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.|$|E

It is performed in the key of C major and Lovato's vocals span from the note of B3 to the note of G5. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the song's sound to works by Tommy Tutone. Lyrically, the song is about a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back together with an old boyfriend, demonstrated in the lines [...] "I {{want to get back}} to the old days", and [...] "Kiss me like you mean it".|$|E
