5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a {{historic}} district {{is a group}} of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within {{a historic}} district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size: some have hundreds of structures, while others <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few.|$|E
25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{feature of}} red giants is that, unlike Sun-like stars whose photospheres {{have a large}} number of small convection cells (solar granules), red-giant photospheres, {{as well as those of}} red supergiants, <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few large cells, the features of which cause the variations of brightness so common on both types of stars.|$|E

25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani {{said his}} {{political}} career was not necessarily over, and did not rule out a 2010 New York gubernatorial or 2012 presidential bid. A November 2008 Siena College poll indicated that although Governor David Paterson—promoted to the office via the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal a year before—was popular among New Yorkers, he would <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> slight lead over Giuliani in a hypothetical matchup. By February 2009, after the prolonged Senate appointment process, a Siena College poll indicated that Paterson was losing popularity among New Yorkers, and showed Giuliani with a fifteen-point lead in the hypothetical contest. In January 2009, Giuliani {{said he would not}} decide on a gubernatorial run for another six to eight months, adding that he thought it would not be fair to the governor to start campaigning early while the governor tries to focus on his job. Giuliani worked to retire his presidential campaign debt, {{but by the end of}} March 2009 it was still $2.4 million in arrears, the largest such remaining amount for any of the 2008 contenders. In April 2009, Giuliani strongly opposed Paterson's announced push for same-sex marriage in New York and said it would likely cause a backlash that could put Republicans in statewide office in 2010. By late August 2009, there were still conflicting reports about whether Giuliani was likely to run.|$|E

2500|$|The Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (or TIP) {{published}} by the Geological Society of America and the University of Kansas Press, is a definitive multi-authored work of some 50 volumes, written by more than 300 paleontologists, and covering every phylum, class, order, family, and genus of fossil and extant (still living) invertebrate animals. [...] The prehistoric invertebrates are described as to their taxonomy, morphology, paleoecology, stratigraphic and paleogeographic range.

[...] This way information on retrapped birds is more readily available and easy to access.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant and James [...] {{believed}} the 2012 team would win against the Dream Team, the 1992 Olympic team {{considered by some}} the greatest sports team ever assembled.

Dream Team member Charles Barkley said that he [...] "just started laughing" [...] upon hearing Bryant's comment and thought the 1992 team would win by double digits. Michael Jordan added: [...] "For [...] to compare those two teams {{is not one of the}} smarter things he ever could have done... Remember now, they learned from us. We didn't learn from them". Bird joked, [...] "They probably could. I haven't played in 20 years and we're all old now." [...] Bryant later clarified that he thought the 1992 team was better, but it was [...] "ludicrous" [...] to think his team could not beat the Dream Team in one game. [...] "You didn't ask me if we could beat them in a 7-game series", he said.|$|E
