5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland,</b> secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
25|$|In mammals, insulin is {{synthesized}} in {{the pancreas}} within the beta cells. One million to three million pancreatic islets form the endocrine {{part of the}} pancreas, which is primarily an <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland.</b> The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.|$|E
25|$|The preorbital gland is a paired <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland</b> {{found in}} many species of hoofed animals, which is {{homologous}} to the lacrimal gland found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial canthus of each eye. They are lined {{by a combination of}} sebaceous and sudoriferous glands, and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> are glands {{that produce}} and secrete {{substances}} onto an epithelial surface {{by way of}} a duct. Examples of <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. <b>Exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> because they secrete products—bile and pancreatic juice—into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to investigate the possibility of Fas ligand protein abnormalities in certain types of Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands.</b> Fas ligand expression by lymphocytes infiltrating the lachrymal glands and by peripheral blood monocytes in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> was assessed immunohistologically and by immunoblotting. Cytotoxicity of peripheral blood monocytes and sensitivity to steroids in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> were studied by functional assay. Minimal Fas ligand expression was detected in the lymphocytes of the lachrymal glands and a decreased level of Fas ligand was found in peripheral blood monocytes as assessed by immunoblotting. Functional assay confirmed the decreased cytotoxicity of lymphocytes in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands,</b> and that it is not affected by anti-Fas ligand antibody. By contrast, the sensitivity of lymphocytes in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> to steroids was increased. These observations suggest that abnormal expression and function of Fas ligand occurs in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R

25|$|The most {{prominent}} effect of JBS is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Varying degrees of decreased secretion of lipases, pancreatic juices such as trypsin, trypsinogen and others, {{as well as}} malabsorption of fats and disruptions of glucagon secretion and its response to hypoglycemia caused by insulin activity are major concerns when JBS is diagnosed. Associated with developmental errors, impaired apoptosis, and both prenatal and chronic inflammatory damage, necrosis and fibrosis of the pancreatic acini (clusters of pancreatic <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland</b> tissue, where secretion of pancreatic juice and related enzymes occurs), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in JBS can additionally stem from congenital replacement of the acini with fatty tissue. Near total replacement of the entire pancreas with fatty tissue has also been reported. This is a progressive, sometimes fatal consequence of the disorder.|$|E
500|$|The green-head ant {{is known}} for its rarity of virgin queens, with some nests {{occasionally}} producing winged females; queens are able to establish their own colonies in captivity, but out in the wild they have never been seen to establish a colony, suggesting that the species is losing its queen caste. The majority of observations show males mating with workers, but not queens. One factor further suggesting the loss of the queen caste is that the green-head ant is going through an evolutionary process where queens are a rare morphological form with little significance, so workers usually replace the queens and take on the reproductive role. Queens still undertake the role of nuptial flight as some have been seen mating with males. They are known to release a sex pheromone from the pygidial gland, an <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland</b> found between the last two abdominal segments. The ergatoid (wingless reproductive females) queens emerge from their nest and, like the workers, appress their head onto the ground and elevate their gaster, from which the intersegmental membrane {{at the back of the}} abdomen extends. The queens then release the sex pheromones, which attracts the males, who frantically search for the queens through agitated locomotion. The males may attempt to copulate with workers that did not [...] "call" [...] for them, suggesting that workers might be able to release these pheromones. When a male makes contact with a queen, the male touches her with his antennae and grasps the female's thorax with his mandibles. A queen is ready to mate when she turns her abdomen to the side, where the male will search for the genitalia with his copulatory apparatus (parts of the organ involved with copulation). The pair may copulate for several minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{salivary glands}} in mammals are <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands,</b> glands with ducts, that produce saliva, which is {{composed}} of several components including amylase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose.

2500|$|By {{virtue of}} such large numbers, swarm-founding members must {{necessarily}} have {{a method of}} communication {{that will allow the}} entire nest to coordinate movements efficiently. In a swarm-founding species like A. pallipes, the main conduit of communication is through the use of pheromones. Most individuals of the tribe Epiponini have a Richard’s gland to release the pheromones, which is an <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland</b> located on the underside the abdomen. However, it is absent in Agelaia and instead, it is hypothesized that the van der Vecht’s gland is the alternative source for the communicative pheromone. By rubbing their gastral on objects, they leave a pheromone trail for their worker counterparts to follow suit.|$|E

40|$|Melanocortins (MSH and ACTH-related peptides) {{influence}} the physiological functions of certain peripheral organs, including <b>exocrine</b> and endocrine <b>glands.</b> This {{study was designed}} to determine the identity and anatomical localization of the melanocortin receptors (MC-R) expressed in these organs in the rat. MC 5 -R messenger RNA was found in <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands,</b> including lacrimal, Harderian, preputial, and prostate glands and pancreas, as well as in adrenal gland, esophagus, and thymus, as demonstrated by ribonuclease protection assays. In <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands,</b> MC 5 -R messenger RNA expression was restricted to secretory epithelia. MC-R protein was likewise present in secretory epithelia of <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands,</b> as determined by 125 I-labeled [Nle 4,D-Phe 7]MSH ([125 I]NDP-MSH) binding and autoradiography in tissue sections. Specific [125 I]NDP-MSH binding was also observed in adrenal cortex, thymus, spleen, and esophageal and trachealis muscle. MC receptors in these sites are accessible to circulating MC-R agonists in vivo, as specific binding of [125 I]NDP-MSH was observed in <b>exocrine</b> and adrenal <b>glands</b> after systemic injection in vivo. Taken together, these findings show that the MC 5 receptor is commonly and selectively expressed in <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> and other peripheral organs. Based on these findings and compelling evidence from other studies, a functional coherence is suggested between central and peripheral actions of melanocortins and melanocortin receptors in physiological functions, including thermoregulation, immunomodulation, and sexual behavio...|$|R

50|$|Biting {{has been}} found to be a {{frequent}} occurrence between nestmates. The individuals that do the most foraging in a multi-foundress colony were found to be the least aggressive individuals of the group. It was also found that the individuals with the least developed ovaries were the individuals that did the most foraging of the group. Additionally, there has been speculation that M. mexicanus individuals accumulate a particular odor as they age, which is consistent with the observation that older females are more often rejected by foreign nests. Males were found to have <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland</b> cells in their gastral sternites, though they have very few ducted <b>exocrine</b> <b>gland</b> cells when compared to other species of Mischocyttarus. However, these observations are consistent with the idea that M. mexicanus, like other wasps, use chemicals to communicate through nestmate recognition, pheromone signaling, etc.|$|E

Relatively modest but functionally significant expression levels of major histocompatibility complex class II and class II transactivator molecules were observed in the <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> of ovariectomized (Ovx) C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice, but were not seen in the <b>exocrine</b> <b>glands</b> of control B 6 mice.
