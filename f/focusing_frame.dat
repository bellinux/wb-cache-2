30|$|Modification is {{generally}} necessary for human writing. Therefore, we also provide similar editing tools as those provided by most texting systems. First, we provide a “undo” function to unwind {{back to the}} latest saved point. In order to provide smooth writing experiences to users, our system records the <b>focusing</b> <b>frame</b> position of each written character along with all strokes written in the frame position {{to ensure that the}} “undo” function can bring back to the same previous writing position. For example, after writing a character and sliding to write another, he/she suddenly finds the incorrectness of the previous character and wants to remove the character with the “undo” function. Our system first slides the <b>focusing</b> <b>frame</b> back and removes all the stroke information recorded along with the same frame position to let him/her continue their writing seamlessly. Second, we also provide a “redo” function to recover the steps saved in the “undo” stack. Third, we also provide an “eraser” function to let users use one-finger dragging gesture to remove the undesired strokes because users sometimes want to erase those strokes and characters written long time ago, and the “undo” function no longer works. The “eraser” function is also redoable and undoable. For instance, if users find that they mistakenly remove desired strokes, they can also use the “undo” function to restore those removed strokes. As a result, users can edit the writing message everywhere in our system.|$|E
3000|$|Swimming {{velocity}} of the microswimmer along the Z-axis is measured by a fixed distance Δ z divided by time Δ t. It follows three steps. First, the focal plane of the microscope is set on the substrate, followed by recording and turning the magnetic field on. This step aims to record the starting time. Then, the focal plane is adjusted to 20  m above the substrate. The microswimmer swimming across the focal plane is observed as it became in focus gradually and then out of focus. Finally, we find the best <b>focusing</b> <b>frame</b> from the recorded video to count the time Δ t. Using this method, swimming {{velocity of}} the microswimmer in the space 0 to 20 [...] m above the substrate (bottom space) is measured. The velocity in the space 20 – 40  m (upper space) above the substrate is measured using the same method. After turning off the magnetic field, the microswimmer will gradually sink onto the substrate due to gravitational force. The swimming velocity against frequency in the bottom and upper space is depicted in Fig. 10.|$|E
40|$|Given a {{stack of}} {{registered}} images acquired using a range of focus settings (focal stack images), we propose a new focus measure to identify the most focused image. Although, most of the paper {{is concerned with the}} new focus measure, for evaluation purposes, we will present {{it in the context of}} an application to generating omnifocus images. An omnifocus image is the composite image in which each pixel is selected form the frame in the stack in which it appears to be in best focus. Conventional focus measures usually maximize some measure of image gradient in a window. They tend to fail when one of the edges of the window lies near the boundary of an intensity edge, or the pixel is near other complex edge patterns. This leads to the misidentification of the <b>focused</b> <b>frame</b> and formation of artifacts in omnifocused image. Our proposed measure does not attempt to identify the <b>focused</b> <b>frame</b> by calculating the degree of defocus, like the gradient based methods. Rather, it hypothesizes that a specific <b>frame</b> is in <b>focus</b> and then validates or rejects this hypothesis by recreating the defocused frames in the vicinity, and comparing them with the observed defocused frames. This forward generative process leads to correct <b>focus</b> <b>frame</b> selection in regions where typical measures fail. This is because the conventional measures try to identify the <b>focused</b> <b>frame</b> from its distorted version which is the result of a complex convolution process. This involves a backward estimation for a many-to-one transformation. On the other hand, the generation of defocused frames from a hypothesized <b>focused</b> <b>frame</b> is more accurate since it involves applying an operator in the forward direction. We analytically show that under ideal imaging conditions, the proposed focus measure is unimodal in nature. This makes the search for the best focused image unambiguous. We evaluate our focus measure by generating omnifocus images from real focal stack images, and show that it performs better than all the existing focus measures. 1...|$|R

Camera designers have learned to overcome SLR mirror-slap by including a mirror lock-up feature in some cameras. This removes the camera-shake from the large slapping mirror inside the camera, but does not prevent camera-shake caused by the shutter mechanism itself. Mirror-lock-up introduces yet another problem: with the mirror locked-up out of the way the optical viewfinder cannot be used for <b>focussing,</b> <b>framing,</b> or exposure metering. Newer DSLR cameras include a [...] "live preview" [...] where the image from the main imaging sensor is displayed directly on an LCD display, so it is still possible to focus (manually or in newer models by contrast detection) and frame.

To answer the research question, key aspects of the coverage like <b>foci,</b> <b>framing,</b> sources, narratives, actors and agency, and criticisms are closely examined.
