50|$|The basic hangul letters {{have been}} {{simplified}} graphically, retaining the <b>essential</b> <b>shape</b> of Phagspa {{but with a}} reduced number of strokes. For example, the box inside Phagspa g is not found in hangul ㄱ k. This simplification allowed for complex clusters, but also left room for an additional stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, ㅋㅌㅍㅊ. On the other hand, the non-plosives, nasals ng (see below) ㄴㅁ and the fricative ㅅ, were derived by removing {{the top of the}} tenuis letter. (No letters were derived from ㄹ.) This clears up a few points. For example, it's easy to derive ㅁ from ㅂ by removing the top of ㅂ, but it's not clear how you'd get ㅂ by adding something to ㅁ, since ㅂ is not analogous to the other plosives: if they were derived, as in the traditional account, we'd expect them all to have a similar vertical top stroke.|$|E

Furthermore, she noted that it was reasonable that Rosemary (Zoe Saldana) would be naive and dependent because of her unfamiliarity with Paris as a newcomer. Stanley wrote that the host couple, French sophisticates Margaux (Carole Bouquet) and Roman Castevet (Jason Isaacs), were completely {{different from the one}} in Roman Polanski's original. Although she said the adaptation took liberties with the source material, James Poniewozik of Time said the adaptation [...] "keeps its <b>essential</b> <b>shape</b> and plot" [...] in comparison to the original film, an opinion shared by Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, who wrote that the new adaptation was [...] "surprisingly and even satisfyingly true to the old movie". Poniewozik stated that although director Holland had successfully directed complex and lively episodes of The Wire and Treme, this adaptation was [...] "leaden and slack", which may have been due to an attempt to fill two two-hour time slots. Stuever also wrote that it was [...] "way too long", and added that the show lacked suspense. Poniewozik characterized Rosemary and Guy (Patrick J. Adams) as [...] "anesthetically generic" [...] without a [...] "complex relationship"; he likened the miniseries to a [...] "lifestyle show" [...] that becomes a [...] "slasher movie". Despite some [...] "redeeming notes", he ultimately called it [...] "too dull". Stuever noted that the 2014 adaptation was set in [...] "the hyper-aware boutique pregnancy" [...] era, and pointed out one modernization that eased Rosemary's burden: Google image searches on Satan. David Bianculli of NPR felt the shift to Paris was unnecessary and that the adaptation was [...] "neither refreshing nor original"; he summed it up as [...] "just dreadful". He described Saldana's Rosemary as more appealing but no smarter than Mia Farrow's.|$|E

It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; <b>essential</b> <b>shapes</b> are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{skeleton}} is an <b>essential</b> <b>shape</b> descriptor {{providing a}} compact {{representation of a}} shape {{that can be used}} in the context of real object recognition. However, due to the discretization, the required properties to use it for graph matching (homotopy to the shape, consequently connectivity, thinness, robustness to noise) may be difficult to obtain simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new skeletonization algorithm having all these properties, based on the Euclidean distance map. More precisely, the algorithm cleverly combines the centers of maximal balls included in the shape and the ridges of the distance map. Post-processing is then applied to thin and prune the resulting skeleton. We compare the proposed method to three fairly recent methods and demonstrate its good properties...|$|E

40|$|Bartók’s two- and three-part choruses for children’s {{and female}} voices are his best-known choral works worldwide. Nevertheless, the cycle {{as a whole}} does not enjoy a wide {{popularity}} outside of Hungary. The reason for this {{lies in the fact}} that, being a textually inspired composition written in an inaccessible language, it is internationally rarely performed due to difficulties of pronunciation and accentuation – not to mention the difficulties of translation. Text has a very special role in Bartók’s vocal works, where words do not act only through their meaning, nor do they function merely as a supplementary element of music, but are both an <b>essential</b> <b>shaping</b> force in the field of rhythm and a fundamental factor of timbre.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the protection of}} fundamental rights, democracy and {{rule of law in}} the European Union, and the challenges that arise in reflecting on ways to strengthen EU competences in these contested terrains. It provides a ‘state of play’ and critical account of EU-level policy and legal mechanisms assessing the relationship between rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in the member states of the Union. The cross-cutting challenges affecting their uses, effective implementation and practical operability constitute a central point of the analysis. The study argues that the relationship between rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights is co-constitutive. Any future rule of law-related policy discussion in the EU should start from an understanding of the triangular relationship between these dimensions from the perspective of ‘democratic rule of law with fundamental rights’, i. e. the legally based rule of a democratic state that delivers fundamental rights.
