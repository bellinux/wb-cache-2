5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state <b>government</b> <b>shutdown</b> was a <b>government</b> <b>shutdown</b> {{affecting}} the U.S. state of Minnesota. The shutdown {{was the result}} of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded some tax increases. The shutdown started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20.|$|E

Under the Antideficiency Act, they must cease operations, except in certain emergency situations or when law authorizes continued activity. Failure of the President and Congress to reach agreement on interim or full-year funding measures occasionally has caused <b>government</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> the longest of which lasted 21 full days, from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996. <b>Government</b> <b>shutdowns</b> have necessitated furloughs of several hundred thousand federal employees, required cessation or reduction of many government activities, and affected numerous sectors of the economy.

5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the <b>government</b> <b>shutdown,</b> Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E

This was due to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.|$|E

40|$|In {{nearly every}} area of law and governance, default {{policies}} exist when lawmakers cannot pass new legislation — typically, the status quo simply remains in effect. To its detriment, U. S. budget making at {{both the state and}} federal levels lacks effective defaults. If a new budget isn’t passed by year end, there is no budget, and the government shuts down. This lack of defaults, coupled with a dysfunctional era of budgetary politics, has led to a number of recent high-profile and costly state and federal <b>government</b> <b>shutdowns</b> at the state and federal levels. To date, legal scholarship has failed to address both the causes and costs of <b>government</b> <b>shutdowns</b> and near-shutdowns, and thus has also failed to consider possible solutions to prevent them. This Article takes up this cause, exploring the history and sources of recent <b>government</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> <b>Government</b> <b>shutdowns</b> are the result of a perfect storm of contemporary politics: acrimonious budget making characterized by partisan brinkmanship, game-of-chicken-style negotiation strategies, and strong anti-tax sentiment among many conservative legislators. Drawing on political science work on legislative negotiation theory, this Article explains how these new fiscal politics result in regular budget negotiation failures, greatly increasing the risk of costly <b>government</b> <b>shutdowns</b> or near-shutdowns. From this diagnosis of budgetary dysfunction, this Article advocates for the adoption of default budget policies to maintain government operations in the event that legislators fail to pass a timely budget. This Article explains how default budget policies might be implemented to avert shutdowns and to stabilize the budget-making process. Drawing upon the experiences of several states with automatic continuing appropriations provisions, and the federal experience with sequestration, we explore how default budget policies might work in practice. Properly enacted, default budget policies have the potential to mitigate the harmful consequences of budget negotiation failures and to restore sanity to this era of new fiscal politics. ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the debate}} on health care reform, Franken {{was one of the}} strongest {{supporters}} of a single-payer system. He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, rising to 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill. Although Franken says he is in favor of the provision, he disagreed with it being used as a condition in preventing the 2013 federal <b>government</b> <b>shutdown.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The <b>government</b> <b>shutdown</b> ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state <b>government</b> <b>{{shutdown}}</b> was {{the first}} shutdown {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.|$|E

25|$|As House Majority Leader, Cantor {{was named}} in House Resolution 368, which {{was passed by}} the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 <b>government</b> <b>shutdown</b> began, as {{the only member of the}} House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both {{chambers}} of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial <b>government</b> <b>shutdown</b> and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the <b>government</b> <b>shutdown.</b>|$|E
