2500|$|The <b>extra</b> <b>section</b> of the non-canon game [...] {{contains}} the supposed [...] "Origin of the Borg", which {{tells the story}} of V'ger being sucked into a black hole. V'ger was found by a race of living machines which gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all carbon-based life an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of V'gers purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective consciousness. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. However, with thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve V'ger.|$|E
2500|$|Sources vary on {{when the}} present meeting house was built to replace it. [...] A date of 1748 is usually claimed, but other sources give 1715 as the year (suggesting a new meeting house was built {{immediately}} after the trustees took ownership of the Mill House); {{and it is also}} claimed that [...] "the red brick, Bargate stone, tiled roof and lattice windows of the meeting house are consistent with a late-17th-century date", suggesting the Mill House itself was remodelled rather than being demolished and replaced. [...] In 1752 a burial ground was created behind the meeting house, replacing the old graveyard at Binscombe. [...] In about 1772 an <b>extra</b> <b>section,</b> consisting of a narrow wing separate from the main meeting house, was added. [...] Minor repairs to the building were carried out in 1776–77, for which the debt was paid off in 1778. [...] At this time, and until about 1800, the main monthly meeting alternated between Godalming and the Friends meeting house at nearby Guildford. [...] Quarterly meetings covering the whole of Surrey were also occasionally held at Godalming. [...] The close links with Guildford were strengthened in 1803 when [...] "Godalming Quakers subscribed generously to the fund" [...] for Guildford's new meeting house, under construction at the time: more than £100 was raised by the nine members of the Godalming 50-strong congregation. [...] As well as the monthly meetings shared with Guildford, there were regular meetings for worship on Sunday mornings and during the week, although minutes kept during the 19th century suggest the latter were not well attended.|$|E
