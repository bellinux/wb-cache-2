5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Nevins, Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Fire Department, {{arrived at}} the theatre around 11:26pm; he decided {{immediately}} that the building was lost and his job was one of confinement. Dieter Hotel, {{on the corner of}} Washington and Johnson streets, was lower than the theatre, its broad flat roof was an inviting target for flaming debris. The First Police Precinct station house, south of the theatre, was an old brick building with dry wooden support beams. Ramshackle wooden frame buildings stretched <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> on Flood's Alley opposite the burning theatre. At that point, the prevailing wind was from the west, carrying smoke and cinders east, dropping firebrands onto these old structures. The Post Office, south of the police station house, was filled with paper mail. Nevins had called {{in the second and third}} alarms while on the way to the fire; when the additional equipment arrived, he deployed the engines around the block to keep adjoining buildings free of sparks and burning debris.|$|E
25|$|When the {{inspectors}} finally entered the premises for their daily inspection, an angered but calm-appearing Alexander would then proceed to retrieve {{one of his}} guns from his office drawer, re-enter the lobby room, then shot and killed the two USDA inspectors and a state inspector. U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors Jean Hillery, 56, and Thomas Quadros, 52, and state Department of Food and Agriculture Inspector William Shaline, 57, were killed. One California State Inspector, Earl Willis, 51, managed to escape into a nearby bank located there on Washington Street as a now fuming Alexander chased after him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> which was recorded on camcorder by the proprietor {{of one of the}} nearby businesses. After Alexander's failed attempt to shoot Willis, he immediately went back to his linguisa factory lobby and emptied three more shots into the heads of the victims, making sure that they were dead. The police would soon finally arrive upon the scene within a few minutes only after someone in the bank notified the police department; they would arrive to see a waiting Alexander standing in front of his factory, admitting to the murders and ready to be taken into custody.|$|E

Next door, 170 and 172-74 show signs of the Neo-Grec style with the latter also having some Queen Anne elements. The last building in the carriage house row on the south side, 178 East 73rd, combines Beaux Arts decor with neo-Georgian brickwork.|$|R
50|$|Power gating affects design {{architecture}} {{more than}} clock gating. It increases time delays, as power gated modes {{have to be}} safely entered and exited. Architectural trade-offs exist between designing {{for the amount of}} leakage power saving in low power modes and the energy dissipation to enter and exit the low power modes. Shutting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> can be accomplished either by software or hardware. Driver software can schedule <b>the</b> power <b>down</b> operations. Hardware timers can be utilized. A dedicated power management controller is another option.|$|R

500|$|Route 59, at [...] long, is the {{shortest}} state highway in New Jersey, United States. The route consists entirely of a short block of Lincoln Avenue from Union County Route 610 (known locally as South Avenue) in Cranford to New Jersey Route 28 (known locally as North Avenue) along the Cranford–Garwood border. The route functions as an underpass under the Raritan Valley Line of New Jersey Transit, under which it crosses about halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> along the municipal border. Route 59 was originally a proposed alignment of Route 22, {{which was supposed to}} head from an intersection with current day New Jersey Route 159 in Morris County at the Pine Brook Bridge before heading through several counties, terminating at an intersection with New Jersey Route 27 in Rahway. Most of the route was not constructed, and a portion in Garwood and Cranford was re-designated Route 59 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953.|$|E

Just <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> from the Cyclorama building, the firm designed the Tremont Livery Stable at 439 Tremont Street.

Eltinge himself never performed in his namesake building. [...] After serving as a legitimate theater for many years, it became a notorious burlesque house and was shut down during a [...] "public morality" [...] campaign in 1943, before becoming a cinema the next year.
