500|$|Gilbert finally {{called on}} Sullivan {{and read the}} {{libretto}} to him on 20 February 1875. [...] Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, [...] " [...] read it through ...in {{the manner of a}} man considerably disappointed with what he had written. [...] As soon as he had come to the last word, he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious {{of the fact that he}} had achieved his purpose so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> inasmuch as I was screaming with laughter the whole time." [...] Trial by Jury, described as [...] "A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata" [...] in the original promotional material, was composed and rehearsed in a matter of weeks.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s and 50s, Unwin had {{developed}} [...] "Unwinese", a nonsense language that distorted {{words and phrases}} into a form of gibberish, that sounded unintelligible but which in fact retained some fragments of meaning. Recalling Unwin's radio and television performances, Anderson thought that the self-made language would suit the character of an eccentric undercover operative, and could produce humour if demonstrated to have a confusing effect on enemies. He elaborated, [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> Stanley came first and then the idea had to accommodate him. It wasn't that the story called for someone who could speak gobbledegook, {{it was a question}} of how we could fit him into the storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Champions League final on 19 May 2012, Drogba {{scored the}} {{equaliser}} from Juan Mata's {{corner in the}} 88th minute, taking Chelsea into extra time and then penalties. He also scored the winning penalty in the 4–3 penalty shootout that led Chelsea to the victory over Bayern Munich. Sir Alex Ferguson remarked: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> he [...] won the Champions League for Chelsea." [...] Drogba's headed effort marked his ninth goal in nine cup final appearances for Chelsea, Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola spoke after the match about Drogba's ability in big games: [...] "In all their very important matches he has put a stamp on it." [...] In November 2012 Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by Chelsea Magazine.|$|E

500|$|Woo {{was also}} {{pressured}} by Universal to tone-down {{the violence and}} body count that they had seen in his Hong Kong films. As Woo had not mastered the English language yet, it took time for {{the cast and crew}} to get used to working with him. When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer Russell Carpenter, he would resort to simple statements such as [...] "this will be the Sam Peckinpah shot" [...] to get his message across to Carpenter. Actor Lance Henriksen recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film. Producer James Jacks recalled that Woo was not [...] "the most powerful person on the set but as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> he was certainly the most respected".|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that Bismarck could still have floated {{for at least}} a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving [...] on the destroyer [...] at the time). Kennedy stated, [...] "That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." [...] When asked whether Bismarck would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied [...] "Sure. But it might have taken half a day." [...] In Mearns' subsequent book Hood and Bismarck, he conceded that scuttling [...] "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes." [...] Ballard later concluded that [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> I thought that I was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing. And I was quite nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until II." ...|$|E

500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E
2500|$|On February 18, several CCNY {{players that}} had just gotten off of a train at Penn Station after playing in Philadelphia that night were arrested. Police and detectives had {{researched}} and followed the previous several years' games and the CCNY players, respectively, that led to their arrests. Two days later, police arrested Sherman White at the Carlton YMCA in Brooklyn. White later said, [...] "I {{knew it was a}} matter of time. I was in a fog. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> my life was shot." [...] Bigos and Smith were also arrested that day.|$|E
2500|$|A survey {{published}} by Radio Times magazine in March 2004 revealed that Casualty has featured more future stars {{than any other}} UK soap or drama series. Actors who appeared in the show prior to becoming famous include Kate Winslet, Orlando Bloom, Minnie Driver, Christopher Eccleston, Tom Hiddleston, Parminder Nagra, Sadie Frost, Ray Winstone, David Walliams, Jonny Lee Miller, Martin Freeman, Helen Baxendale, Robson Green and Brenda Fricker. Discussing her 1993 appearance in Casualty, Winslet told the Radio Times: [...] "In England, it almost seems {{to be part of}} a jobbing actor's training [...] As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> it was a great episode, a great part. Appearing in Casualty taught me a big lesson in how to be natural in front of the camera." [...] In addition, the series has featured a variety of more established stars, including Norman Wisdom, Amanda Redman, Anita Dobson, Jenny Seagrove, Rula Lenska, Prunella Scales, [...] Celia Imrie, Toyah Willcox, Maureen Lipman, [...] Frances Barber, Andrew Sachs, Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, Honor Blackman and Michelle Collins in cameo roles.|$|E

2500|$|Interviews {{conducted}} by Martin Middlebrook for his book, Argentine Fight For The Falklands, indicated that Argentine naval officers understood {{the intent of}} the message was to indicate that any ships operating near the exclusion zone could be attacked. Argentine Rear Admiral Allara, {{who was in charge of}} the task force of which General Belgrano was part, said, [...] "After that message of 23 April, the entire South Atlantic was an operational theatre for both sides. We, as professionals, said it was just too bad that we lost the Belgrano". Captain Bonzo also told Middlebrook that he was not angry about the attack on his ship and [...] "The limit [...] did not exclude danger or risks; it was all the same in or out. I would like to be quite precise that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the 200-mile limit was valid until 1 May, that is while diplomatic negotiations were taking place and/or until a real act of war took place, and that had happened on 1 May".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's bandmates {{and father}} Murry resented {{that he was}} singled out as a [...] "genius". A 1971 article by Nolan {{reflected}} that at a certain point, the group's scene was not [...] "happening" [...] anymore, and that Wilson [...] "made it very clear" [...] to then-business partner David Anderle [...] "that it {{was always going to}} be the Beach Boys, that Brian wouldn't do it alone. God knows he could have ... But the Beach Boys ... his family." [...] Mike Love recalls: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> Brian was a genius, deserving of that recognition. But the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian's music machine ... This frustrated all of us but infuriated [...] Carl ... It didn’t feel to us as if we were just riding on Brian’s coattails." [...] In a 1966 article that asks [...] "Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?" [...] Carl rejected the notion, explaining that every member of the group contributes ideas, although Brian was most responsible for their music. Bruce Johnston remembers: [...] "we wanted to be a band again. The whole [...] thing had wiped everyone out, and we wanted to play together again." [...] Dennis Wilson stated: [...] "Brian Wilson is the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E
