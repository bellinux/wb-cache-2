30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  4 a, the tip is {{initially}} placed above the vacancy site {{with the tip}} height of 8  Å at which the tip-surface interaction is almost negligible. As the tip approaches the surface step by step, the tip apex atom, i.e., the <b>dopant</b> <b>atom,</b> relaxes toward the up terrace due to the strong attraction. When the tip reaches the height of 7.1  Å, as demonstrated in Figure  4 b, the <b>dopant</b> <b>atom</b> shows an obvious movement toward the up terrace since the attraction is strong enough.

40|$|To {{achieve and}} utilize the most exotic {{electronic}} phenomena predicted for the surface states of 3 D topological insulators (TI),it {{is necessary to}} open a "Dirac-mass gap" in their spectrum by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Use of magnetic <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> to generate a ferromagnetic state is {{the most widely used}} approach. But it is unknown how the spatial arrangements of the magnetic <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> influence the Dirac-mass gap at the atomic scale or, conversely, whether the ferromagnetic interactions between <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> are influenced by the topological surface states. Here we image the locations of the magnetic (Cr) <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> in the ferromagnetic TI Cr_ 0. 08 (Bi_ 0. 1 Sb_ 0. 9) _ 1. 92 Te_ 3. Simultaneous visualization of the Dirac-mass gap Δ(r) reveals its intense disorder, which we demonstrate directly is related to fluctuations in n(r), the Cr atom areal density in the termination layer. We find the relationship of surface-state Fermi wavevectors to the anisotropic structure of Δ(r) consistent with predictions for surface ferromagnetism mediated by those states. Moreover, despite the intense Dirac-mass disorder, the anticipated relationship Δ(r) ∝ n(r) is confirmed throughout, and exhibits an electron-dopant interaction energy J^*= 145 meV· nm^ 2. These observations reveal how magnetic <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> actually generate the TI mass gap locally and that, to achieve the novel physics expected of time-reversal-symmetry breaking TI materials, control of the resulting Dirac-mass gap disorder will be essential...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments on the electronic properties of individual shallow <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> in silicon. Shallow <b>dopants</b> are impurity <b>atoms</b> that bind either a single electron or hole and can therefore be con- sidered as the solid state analogue to the hydrogen atom. As the transistor density increases, critical device dimensions are fast approaching the effective Bohr radius of shallow <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms.</b> This offers the compelling possibility to utilize the quantum nature of <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> to enhance the functionality if semiconductor nano-devices. The emphasis of the experimental work described in this thesis is on the interaction between single <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> and their environment. When <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> are embedded within a nano-structure quantum confinement at the interface will strongly perturb the wavefunction of the dopant-bound electron (or hole), as a consequence the wavefunctions and energies {{will no longer be}} that of hydrogenic states. Moreover, dielectric mismatch between the semicon- ductor and its surroundings will influence the energy spectra of <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> near the interface. Generally speaking, the presence of interfaces will break the tetrahedral symmetry of the silicon crystal and will cause degeneracies to be lifted, drastically shifting the electronic states of <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> with respect to dopant-bound states in bulk silicon. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) is a unique method that allows for the spatially resolved investigation of the electronic structure of sub-surface <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms.</b> Unlike in other transport measurements, both lateral position and depth of single <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> can unambiguously be determined. Chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis describe experiments aimed at studying the energy spectra as a function of depth of individual sub-surface <b>dopant</b> <b>atoms</b> by means of electron transport through the localized dopant states. Interface enhancement of the ionization energy, and as a consequence deactivation of dopants near the interface, is a major concern for doping nano-structures. Chapter 3 describes the experimental investigation of the effect of the interface on the ionization energy of single sub-surface acceptors. It is worthwhile mentioning here that the vacuum-silicon interface yields the largest possible dielectric mismatch attainable for silicon. The depth of individual ac- ceptors is measured by the influence of the ionized acceptor nucleus on the local density of valence band states. The ionization energy is determined from the voltage at which resonant tunneling through the localized acceptor state occurs. An absolute energy scale is provided by the thermal broadening of the conductance peaks. It is explicitly demonstrated that acceptors in silicon less than a Bohr radius away from the interface maintain a bulk-like ionization energy. Building on the methods described in Chapter 3, measurements of the excited state spectra of single sub-surface acceptors are presented in Chapter 4. Interface induced spin-orbit splitting of the four-fold degenerate ground state of boron in silicon results in the formation of two Kramers doublets. The observed enhancement of this splitting for acceptors close to the interface, and moreover the ability to controllably tune this splitting will have strong implications for quantum computation schemes based on the spin of acceptor-bound holes. One of the key challenges in single atom electronics is the strict require- ments for dopant placement. Recent developments in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) based bottom-up fabrication have paved the way for atomically precise dopant based electronic devices. Chapter 5 illustrates, for the first time, how low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy can be used in conjunction with bottom-up dopant engineering. Transport measurements on single phosphorus donors deliberately placed five monolayers beneath the surface of a p-type silicon substrate serve as a proof-of-principle for STS studies on atomically precise dopant structures. Chapter 6 {{describes a}}n experiment where, for the first time, the quantum states of a single arsenic donor embedded in a nano-scale field-effect transistor are utilized to increase the device functionality of the transistor.
