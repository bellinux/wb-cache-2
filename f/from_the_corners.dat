5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners,</b> the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across {{the length of the}} table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes {{on either side of the}} mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E

25|$|At St John's {{the design}} is even more complex, because, {{near the top of}} the upper window, the tower itself {{suddenly}} appears to become octagonal in horizontal section, before the spire is reached. The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> at this point, as if they were sitting on the buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling battlement which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter coat}} {{consists}} of long, coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur. The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around {{the face and}} limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males, and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around Lake Balkhash are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from Belarus and Ussuriland can be black. Some subspecies sport a light coloured patch running backwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the mouth. Coat colour also varies with age, with piglets having light brown or rusty-brown fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and back.|$|E
25|$|The banded {{sandstone}} plinth of {{the memorial}} has square planned piers projecting slightly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> which continue the decorative banding and are surmounted by pyramidal pinnacles. This {{section of the}} memorial features AIF badges, and a marble plaque, which in leaded lettering lists the 122 local soldiers who fell in the First World War. Resting on this section is the recessed sandstone shaft of the memorial, the entablature of which is supported at each corner on four polished granite columns with Corinthian capitals. The shaft has a carved wreath, carved lettering The Honoured Dead and Roman fasces on each corner. The entablature comprises a simply moulded architrave, a more elaborate cornice with dentils and a recessed frieze on which the dates 1914 - 1918 are carved in relief. Surmounting the entablature are three sandstone steps on which rest a carved sandstone Celtic cross.|$|E

25|$|Islamic {{rule over}} {{northern}} and central India {{brought with it}} the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used {{at the base of}} domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the room to the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.|$|E
25|$|During the Portuguese Renaissance, {{the largest}} center of {{learning}} and arts was Lisbon, which thrived as a great city of Europe, because of its privileged position as a major trading center, open to a constant flow of new information, cultures, and finance. Lisbon was a true center of the European Renaissance, where artists and scholars <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of Europe came {{to try to make}} it rich. The rich Lisbon nobility funded countless paintings, often for either religious institutions in Lisbon or in their feudal estates. The Portuguese royal court often transferred between Lisbon, Coimbra, a former capital of Portugal, and Évora, which allowed these three cities to establish themselves as the largest centers of the Portuguese Renaissance. In Coimbra, the School of Coimbra was founded by Vicente Gil and his son, Manuel Vicente. In Évora, Manuel I of Portugal established a rich court, which would see its height under his son, Cardinal Infante Henrique of Aviz, Archbishop of Évora, who founded the University of Évora and its school of arts.|$|E

500|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} reaches [...] {{long and}} has a thin, deep, and firm body. The narrow head makes up slightly under one-sixth of the total length, and is two-thirds as wide as it is long. The snout is short and rounded. The large nostrils are preceded by small, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the wide mouth. The medium-sized eyes are horizontally oval, equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids), and followed by moderate spiracles. There are no grooves between the nostrils and the mouth. There are furrows extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the mouth over the lower jaw only. The small teeth have a long central cusp typically flanked by two pairs of cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the fourth pair over the pectoral fin origins.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} existing of Justinian's domed buildings is {{the central}} plan Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, completed by 536. It is called the [...] "Little Hagia Sophia" [...] mosque today, but was actually begun five years earlier than that building. The dome rests on an octagonal base created by eight arches on piers and is divided into sixteen sections. Those sections above the flat sides of the octagon are flat and contain a window at their base, alternating with sections <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the octagon that are scalloped, creating an unusual kind of pumpkin dome. The building was built within the precinct of the Palace of Hormistas, the residence of Justinian before his {{ascension to the throne}} in 527, and includes an inscription mentioning the [...] "sceptered Justinian" [...] and [...] "God-crowned Theodora".|$|E
500|$|The {{larger scale}} of some Byzantine {{buildings}} of the 12th century required a more stable support structure for domes than the four slender columns of the cross-in-square type could provide. The domes of the churches now called Kalenderhane Mosque, Gül Mosque, and the Enez Fatih mosque all had domes greater than [...] in diameter and used piers as part of large cruciform plans, a practice that {{had been out of}} fashion for several centuries. A variant of the cross-in-square, the [...] "so-called atrophied Greek cross plan", also provides greater support for a dome than the typical cross-in-square plan by using four piers projecting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of an otherwise square naos, rather than four columns. This design was used in the Chora Church of Constantinople in the 12th century after the previous cross-in-square structure was destroyed by an earthquake.|$|E

500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower façade was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.|$|E
500|$|Bacon Academy {{is named}} for Pierpoint Bacon, a prosperous farmer who died childless in 1800. Bacon bequeathed most of his {{property}} and assets to the First Society of Colchester to support schooling. The trustees decided to build an academy, an institution to have young men be educated, and then go directly into the workforce. Completed in 1803 {{for the cost of}} $7000, the main Bacon Academy structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. The foundation of the academy is made of fieldstone with a facing of dressed granite blocks. The bricks were produced on a local farm for the purpose building Bacon Academy. The front facade has 26windows arranged in 9bays with gaps for the chimneys in between the second and third bay <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> The sash is 6-by-6 and was noted to appear original in the nomination form. Originally the hipped roof had four chimneys, with two matching chimneys on each the west and east sides. Only the east chimneys remain. Facing the front entrance, the chimneys are spaced about [...] from the side corners. In the 1982nomination, the hipped roof was reported to have asphalt shingles.|$|E
500|$|The pyjama shark is {{the larger}} and thicker-bodied {{of the two}} Poroderma species, growing to [...] long and [...] or more in weight. Both sexes grow to roughly the same maximum size. The head and snout are short and {{slightly}} flattened, with a narrowly parabolic outline when viewed from above or below. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a flap of skin in front; the flap has a three-lobed shape with the central lobe forming a long, conical barbel. The barbels are thicker than in the leopard catshark, and do not reach the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed rather high on the head, with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and a thick ridge running underneath. The sizable mouth forms a broad arch, with short furrows extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> onto both {{the upper and lower}} jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1825 and 1424 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively. The teeth have a slender central cusp flanked by a pair of small cusplets; those of adult males are slightly thicker than those of females.|$|E
