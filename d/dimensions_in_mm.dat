40|$|Here are {{guidelines}} for deembedding the mounting pads in standard component models to achieve accurate EM simulation By default, Modelithics library models include mounting pad effects. Hence, when performing full wave electromagnetic (EM) analyses the pad geometries {{should not be}} included in the geometry setup used to define the EM analysis. However, there are reasons to include the pads in the EM simulation instead of having them inside the components models. Some of these reasons are: • Use of a pad size different from the one included with the model, or outside the range of pad dimensions if using a padscalable model. • Including the step effect when the feed line is different from the pad width. This step can also be included using an analytical model in a circuit simulation. • Including the effects of coupling between the pads and another part of the circuit. • Desire to simulate the pads along with other printed circuit patterns as a standard practice. Modelithics models include a feature that allows the pads to be deembedded from the model, thus leaving the part effectively without the pads. This feature, named simulation mode 2, is useful in the case that the pads need to be included in an EM simulation. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide some {{guidelines for}} the use of Modelithics models when the effect of the pads is included in EM simulations. The EM simulation examples shown here were performed using the Figure 1 · (a) the mounting pad used to extract the model; (b) different mounting pad used for validation.

40|$|The {{existence}} {{and stability of}} discrete breathers (DBs) in one-dimensional and two-dimensional magnetic metamaterials (MMs), which consist of periodic arrangem ents (arrays) of split-ring resonators (SRRs), is investigated numerically. We consider different configurations of the SRR arrays, which {{are related to the}} relative orientation of the SRRs <b>in</b> the <b>MM,</b> both <b>in</b> one and two spatial <b>dimensions.</b> <b>In</b> the latter case we also consider anisotropic MMs. Using standard numerical methods we construct several types of linearly stable breather excitations both in Hamiltonian and dissipative MMs (dissipative breathers). The study of stability in both cases is performed using standard Floquet analysi s. In both cases we found that the increase of dimensionality from one to two spatial dimensions does not destroy the DBs, which may also exist in the case of moderate anisotropy (<b>in</b> two <b>dimensions).</b> <b>In</b> dissipative <b>MMs,</b> the dynamics is governed by a power balance between the mainly Ohmic dissipation and driving by an alternating magnetic field. In that case it is demonstrated that DB excitation locally alters the magnetic response of MMs from paramagnetic to diamagnetic. Moreover, when the frequency of the applied field approaches the SRR resonance frequency, the magnetic response of the <b>MM</b> <b>in</b> the region of the DB excitation may even become negative (extreme diamagnetic).

40|$|Among {{different}} factors – such as {{food characteristics}} and ingesta retention time -, ingesta particle size (measurable in the faeces) is an important parameter that influences digestion in herbivores. In the literature, there are only four comparative studies on the faecal particle size in herbivores. These studies either concentrate on only a few different species, or are restricted to one taxonomic order. Comparative data on reptiles and birds are totally lacking. Thus the present study represents the first attempt to quantify the faecal particle size across broad range of herbivore species within all three taxonomic classes, and to investigate {{whether there is an}} allometric relationship to body mass. Relevant factors influencing ingesta particle size, such as body mass, type of dentition, phylogenetic affiliation and digestive strategy, are discussed in context. In total, more than 1100 faecal samples from herbivorous mammals (205 species), reptiles (12 species) and birds (14 species) are analysed with a standardized wet-sieving procedure using nine sieves ranging from 0, 063 mm to 16 mm mesh size. For the description of faecal particle size two different particle <b>dimensions</b> (<b>in</b> <b>mm</b> particle length) are used, the mean particle size (“Mittelwert”: MW) obtained by curve fitting, and the weighted average (WA) obtained by calculation. The following results are obtained: It is confirmed that faecal particle size is a reliable measure for the extent to which food is processed by mastication. However, this only applies to terrestrial forage plants. Faecal particle size increases with increasing body mass in all three classes. For all mammal groups faecal particle size scales positively to body mass to the power of 0. 34 (MW) or 0. 31 (WA), respectively. Given the literature assumption that tooth size scales isometrically to body mass, these results underline {{the fact that there is}} a functional relationship between tooth size and the achieved ingesta particle length. Considering their body mass range, ruminants - and also equids - achieve particularly small faecal particles and therefore are peculiar among the mammals. Species adapted to grazing (Przewalski horse, auerochs) showed comparable faecal particle sizes in the wild and in captivity, whereas species adapted to browsing (tapir, giraffe) had smaller faecal particles in the wild compared to captivity. Reptiles have distinctively higher mean faecal particle sizes than mammals and birds. Ingesta comminution in the gizzard of herbivorous birds is comparable to that achieved by chewing in non-ruminant mammals, as faecal particle size does not differ between these two groups. Before it enters the gizzard, however, bird ingesta have a similar particle size as reptile faeces. With respect to the ongoing paleobiological discussion on the competition of two dinosaur groups – the sauropods and ornithopods – the present study supports the theory that comminution by gizzard is not less effective than comminution by mastication. The differences in the comminution efficiency between and within mammal groups can partly be related to the evolutionary success of certain species...|$|E

Drop-on-demand inkjet printing {{can be used}} for additive deposition of functional materials onto substrates. Cantilever bending actuators with lateral <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> the <b>mm</b> range are described here. A commercially available solution of electroactive polymers is dispensed onto metalized polycarbonate substrates using inkjet printing. These polymers exhibit piezoelectric behavior. Multiple layers are printed resulting in a film thickness of 5 to 10 ?m. After printing, the polymer layers are annealed thermally at 130 °C. Top electrodes are deposited onto the EAP layer by inkjet printing a silver nanoparticle ink. The as-printed silver layers are sintered using an argon plasma - a recently developed sintering technique that is compatible with low TG polymer foils. After printing the EAP layers are poled. When applying an electric field across the polymer layer, piezoelectric strain in the EAP leads to a bending deflection of the structures. With driving voltages of 200 V the actuators generate displacements of 20 ?m and blocking forces of approximately 3 mN. The first resonance frequency occurs at 230 Hz...|$|R
