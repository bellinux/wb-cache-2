More than 20,000 storm refugees crowded into the arena seeking sanctuary from the winds and waters of Katrina, <b>filling</b> seats, <b>ramps,</b> corridors, and the artificial turf field. The refugees were met with a myriad of new challenges, including stifling heat, stench, filth, unsanitary facilities, and a shortage of food and drinking water. Violent assaults and rapes were reported, as well as one unconfirmed suicide.|$|R
40|$|The {{planning}} and designing of steep channels suitable for fish passage {{has become increasingly}} common {{as an alternative to}} structural fish ladders at dams. They are found at dam removal sites, naturalistic bypass channels that allow fish to swim around and past dams, and at created <b>fill</b> <b>ramps</b> that allow fish to swim over dams. Each of these three steep channel types have unique features such as entry and exit needs; partial or full river flow design criteria; and rigid, threshold, or mobile beds. All three types of steep fish passable channels have a common feature in the main channel segment. To be fish passable, the depth of flow, velocity, and cover must be scaled to the swimming and biological characteristics of one or more fish species or assemblages. Steep channels have the potential for high velocity and high turbulence flow, plus supercritical conditions that are difficult to analyze. A design protocol is presented, drawing upon classic hydraulics; use of analog reference reaches with similar slopes; and geomorphic relationships between slope, discharge, and profile type. Steep mobile bed channel types are also discussed with basic techniques to analyze sediment continuity. Numerous examples of constructed steep fish passable channels are used to illustrate the discussion...|$|R

50|$|Hard wood paving cobbles, {{that were}} {{originally}} used for roading {{on the waterfront}} of Auckland, were in the 1970s dumped on {{the eastern edge of}} the park in preparation to <b>filling</b> in a <b>ramp</b> that would carry a road through to Dominion and New North Road. One source states that the intention of the Auckland City Council was to build a fly-over the Park. Because of Industrial zoning there was an uneasy co-existence between industry and housing. This is alluded to in copies of Flash, the Grey Lynn, Westmere, Newton Community newsletter/newspaper, of the late 1970s when the reserve was to the southern edge of a wasteland of old housing that was deliberately allowed to decay so that the North Western Motorway could be put through without opposition.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sediment}} transport on both morphology and energy dissipation in presence of non conventional stream rehabilitation structures, such as block ramps or rock chutes, is a not well explored topic on hydraulic engineering. Namely, in normal functioning conditions, {{these types of}} structures are generally located in mountain rivers, which are characterized by an elevated sediment transport which can be deposited and trapped between the rocks constituting the ramp. This causes {{a change in the}} bed roughness and in the energy dissipation process that is present on a block ramp. This occurrence was experimentally investigated at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Pisa. Different experimental conditions were tested and the main hydraulic and geometric parameters controlling the filling phenomenon and its effects were highlighted. Namely, it was experimentally proved that both the median diameters of the filling material and of the ramp blocks, the ramp slope and the discharge are the most relevant parameters governing the <b>ramp</b> <b>filling.</b> Thus, experimental formulae were derived to foresee the ramp morphological changes and the interaction between the filling process and the geometric and hydraulic parameters. Moreover a comparison of the energy dissipation on block ramp was conducted and the energy recovery in presence and absence of filling material was compared...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies of}} the {{evolution}} of surface gravity waves near shoals are very important for the management and control of coastal environments. The processes may include beach erosion, sediment transport, and pollutant dispersion, which are critical for the design of coastal structures to minimize the environmental impact. The dynamics may include the transmission, reflection, absorption and dissipation of the wave energy when interacting with the bottom/beach. Theoretical investigations of the problem of wave-bottom interactions were largely based on a mild slope approximation where the change in water depth (or bottom) in the horizontal direction is assumed to be very small. Approximated solutions for the wave field can be obtained analytically only if the bottom slope is constant, while for general variable slopes the solutions are obtained through numerical simulation. Only few laboratory experiments were performed to address the problem with specific coastal geometry. In this study, the propagation of surface gravity waves from deep water to shallow water through a continuous ramp was investigated experimentally in a wave tank to explore the interaction of the waves with the bottom. The experiments were carried out in a water tank of 6. 5 m long and 0. 4 m wide with a maximal water depth of 0. 3 m. A flap-type wave-maker is installed at the upstream end of the tank and a wave absorbing beach at the downstream end. A continuous ramp (breakwater) varying from the tank bottom to a height of 0. 2 m is installed at the middle of the tank. The ramp was continued with a horizontal solid platform to maintain the same height until reaching the beach end. The setup forms a deep water region of 0. 3 m depth in the upstream and creates a shallow water region of 0. 1 m depth at the downstream of the ramp. Hence, when the water depth in the upstream varies from 0. 3 m to 0. 275 m and 0. 250 m, the water depth in the shallow water region drops from 10 cm to 7. 5 cm and 5. 0 cm to reach the condition of shallow water waves has been reached. In this experiment, two types of the same ramp shape but of different materials were used: one is permeable and the other is impermeable. The permeable ramp was constructed by <b>filling</b> the <b>ramp</b> volume with porous foam materials and using a wire screen to define the shape of the ramp. The impermeable ramp is a solid construction. Monochromatic surface gravity water waves with frequency at 1. 4 Hz was generated by the wave-maker. The waves will become established in the deep water region, propagate over the ramp, attenuate in the shallow water region and then dissipate at the beach. A capacitance wave height gauge was utilized to measure the surface displacement of the waves along the tank to characterize the evolution of wave field. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was employed to analyze the time-sequence data to determine the energy (amplitude) and phase angle of the waves. The variations of wave energy with space are then further analyzed by implementing Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). With these transforms, it is possible to separate the contributions due to incident and reflected waves respectively. The wave reflection coefficients, the decay of incident wave, as well as the variations of wave number along the propagation direction of incident waves are then determined experimentally. The experimental results of wave number are compared with those obtained from the theoretical dispersion relation, and they are in good agreement. The effects of water depths, as well as of a <b>ramp</b> <b>filled</b> with porous materials, on the wave evolution were also investigated...|$|R
40|$|It {{is not a}} {{coincidence}} that over half the world‟s population live in coastal areas using the sea {{as a mean to}} develop its industry, thus the sea is present in most aspects of daily life. Because of the vital relationship with the marine environment, for many years mankind is aware of the high energy potential contained in waves. During the last hundred years, thousands patents of devices for the extraction of the energy from waves have been published. However, the researching still faces the challenge of develop the optimal wave energy converter that matches robustness, to withstand extreme marine conditions, and sensitivity, to respond the different sea states. In this thesis a scale model of a wave overtopping converter has been designed, built and tested. In this type of wave electricity converter the waves ascend a <b>ramp,</b> <b>filling</b> a reservoir located at a certain height above sea level. The stored water in the reservoir is discharged back into the sea, powering a turbine, thus generating electricity. The system is composed of a wave energy converter, at a scale of 1 : 100 without turbine, a test channel and a plunger type wave maker. Different sea conditions have been simulated, to assess how the different configurations of the device influence the obtained hydraulic power and flow. It has been concluded that there is an appropriate configuration of the wave electricity converter for each wave period and height. The simulated sea conditions were composed of wave periods of around a second and wave heights of about two centimeters. Finally by applying scale transformations, an estimation of the hydraulic power that the wave electricity converter would extract with this configuration in the deep waters of Tenerife South has been calculated. Summarizing, in this thesis the methodology of testing and the comparison with real conditions has been developed...|$|R
40|$|Loss of Landau damping {{leading to}} a single bunch longi-tudinal {{instability}} has been observed in the LHC during the ramp and on the 3. 5 TeV flat top for small injected longitu-dinal emittances. The first measurements are in reasonable agreement with the threshold calculated for the expected longitudinal reactive impedance budget of the LHC {{as well as with}} the threshold dependence on beam energy. The cure is a controlled longitudinal emittance blow-up during the ramp which for a constant threshold through the cycle should provide an emittance proportional to the square root of energy. FIRST OBSERVATIONS IN 2010 In one of the <b>fills</b> with acceleration <b>ramp</b> in LHC in May 2010 single bunches of both Beam 1 and Beam 2 with the nominal intensity of ∼ 1. 1 × 1011 became unstable dur-ing ramp, Fig. 1. These bunches had a small longitudinal emittance ε of 0. 38 eVs (2 σ, Gaussian shape) in compari-son with nominal injected emittance of 0. 7 eVs in the LHC Design Report [1]. In the next fill increasing emittances to 0. 5 eVs (Beam 1) and 0. 6 eVs (Beam 2) was sufficient to stabilise the beams during the ramp, but bunches became unstable on the flat top (3. 5 TeV). Losses were observed at the energy E of 1. 8 TeV with the onset of the instability around 1. 5 TeV, seen from the bunch length measured by the LHC Beam Quality Monitor (BQM) [2], Fig. 1. Ob-servations of bunch profiles during the ramp suggested that this could be also non-rigid dipole instability. During these measurements a rigid dipole motion was stabilised by the phase loop. The criterion of the loss of Landau damping due to the low frequency (reactive) impedance ImZ/n derived in [3] for the azimuthal mode m can be written in the form |ImZ|/n <...|$|R
40|$|The Latium-Abruzzi {{carbonate}} platform constitutes the sedimentary record fromthe Triassic to the lateMiocene {{of the southern}} Tethyan margin outcropping in the Apennines. This sedimentary succession is punctuated by an important hiatus {{between the end of}} the Cretaceous and the earlyMiocene. This Paleogene hiatus has long been interpreted as the result of prolonged subaerial exposure. However, no evidence of such exposure has ever been documented on the Latium-Abruzzi platform. This is contrary to the coeval and adjacent Apulia and Lessini {{carbonate platform}}s where a broadly-developed paleokarst system formed between the Eocene and the earlyMiocene. The assumption that theMiocene marine transgression deeply eroded a karstified Cretaceous substrate on the Latium-Abruzzi platform is not supported because this surface appears in the field as a perfectly flat, bioeroded paraconformable surface. In this work, a marine origin is proposed for this unconformity. Fromlate Paleocene to early Miocene, the Latium-Abruzzi carbonate platform was a shaved isolated platform exposed to wave action {{in the middle of the}} proto-Mediterranean area. Bioclastic sediment accumulated during transgressive and sea-level highstand phases, whereas in the following falling and lowstand stages, sediment was eroded as the seafloor came into the zone of wave abrasion. The sediment eroded from the platform was shed into the basin where it produced coarse bioclastic intercalations in the hemipelagites of the Scaglia Formation. At the end of the Oligocene, when the adjacent basin was <b>filled,</b> a small <b>ramp</b> was established in the transitional zone between the platform and the basin. There, cross-bedded carbonates accumulated inmiddle to outer ramp environments. The inner ramp remained within the zone of wave abrasion such that sediment generated there was washed out into the middle and outer ramp environments. Finally, in the early Burdigalian, the Mediterranean progressively evolved into closed sea during the initial stages of the closure of Indo-Pacific connection. The reduction of the wave-base depth, typical of an enclosed sea, created increased accommodation space allowing sediments to accumulate and form the complete inner to outer ramp facies belts of the Miocene Latium-Abruzzi ramp...|$|R
40|$|That {{the extreme}} {{northeast}} {{section of the}} citadel of Mycenae was a later addition was pointed out by Tsountas in 1895, but the date of that addition and the purpose it served remained uncertain. The extension {{became the subject of}} our investigation for 1964 and then the method of its construction was especially studied. Its south wall, left in its original state (it is nowhere restored), stands to a height of 8 m. (Fig. 87) and was built of large stones leaving wide interstices between them. Often these spaces are too large and are filled by rectangular blocks set on edge (Fig. 88). The stones of the inner face around the so-called «Sally Port» are smaller, better worked, and present very narrow interstices (Fig. 87); this difference {{is due to the fact}} that the inner face was constructed with blocks taken from the demolished Northeast Cyclopean Wall of the first citadel. The removal of the fill of the core of the walls in three areas (Fig. 89) and the investigation of the interstices yielded a number of painted sherds (Fig. 97) sufficient to prove that the Northeast Extension was constructed towards the end of the LH III B period, perhaps at its very end. The foundation courses of the outer southeast corner of the Extension (Fig. 90), some blocks remaining in situ beyond it to the south (PI. 27), and the formation of the rocks beyond the east corner of the extension (Pis. 28 and 30) indicate the existence towards the ravine of an outer platform along the southeast side of the Extension. The so-called «Sally Port» (Fig. 87) was but a passage to that platform and should therefore be called the «Southeast Passage». On the north wall of the Extension and some 4. 50 m. from the opening of the subterranean cistern (Fig. 91) exists another passage (Plan B) running diagonally through the wall. This was believed to have been a drain. The clearing of the area proved it to be a real «Sally Port», to be known as the «North Sally Port» constructed most strategically (Fig. 92). A ramp from the interior of the Extension led to its entrance (Fig. 93). Further clearing of the area proved that the foundations revealed by Tsountas and believed to belong to the Hellenistic period belonged in the main to Mycenaean times and to a large structure(Building B, Plan B, composed of a number of rooms on the floors of which were found crushed a number of vases and vessels of lead proving its date (Fig. 94). Building B occupies almost half of the area of the extension, while on the south side stood another structure, Building A,, of the same Mycenaean period. Of Building A survive a basement room, actually found below the so-called Cyclopean retaining wall (Fig. ι,α. β), containing the remnants of 6 pithoi and a quantity of shattered pottery, and part of another room in which were found in situ threefourths of a bath tub (Plan B and Fig. 95). Apparently the rest of the tub was destroyed by Schliemann’s laborers in 1874 when they dug a trench across the area. The study of the buildings and the pottery will appear at a later time. We can conclude here that these buildings prove that the area of the extension was not an open court where people and animals took refuge in times of war, as it was assumed until today, but that it was occupied by public buildings. This proves that the main reason for the building of the Northeast Bxtension was to secure an adequate supply of water in times of war or siege. This was attained by the construction of the subterranean cistern with its approach and opening in the citadel. Sherds found in the <b>fill</b> of the <b>ramp</b> to the North Sally Port (Fig. 98) prove that it as well as the Extension and its subterranean cistern were constructed in the closing years of the LH III B period...|$|R
