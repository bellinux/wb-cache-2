In experiment 1, 6 - 7 months old Karayaka male lambs (7 light and 7 heavy) were used. Sugar beet pulp, perennial ryegrass and alfalfa straw were used to feed lambs in the research lasting for 28 days. In experiment 2, 7 - 8 months old Karayaka male lambs (7 light and 7 heavy) were used. The ground barley, wheat bran, expeller cottonseed meal and alfalfa straw were used to feed. The second experiment was continued for 42 days. In roughage selection, <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> consumed more feed (54 %) than light lambs in total consumption (experiment 1). Besides, the Sugar beet pulp and alfalfa straw consumption of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> were higher than that of light lambs 64 and 30 %, respectively.

40|$|The Zeri ewe is an {{indigenous}} Italian breed that is {{spread throughout the}} homonymous area located in northwest Tuscany. This article presents the history and evolution of Zerasca sheep, describes the breed’s characteristics in terms of somatic and productive traits, managerial and health practices, meat quality; moreover it underlines its contribution {{to the preservation of}} the rural land and population of the Zeri district. First documentation on this breed dates back to the 19 th Century (Antonelli, 1845). Zerasca breed has a medium-large size with white fleece. Males present horns while in females can be absent. Currently Zerasca ovine population totals more than 2, 000 heads. Sheep husbandry is currently predominant in Zeri area thanks to the great availability of woody vegetation (oak, chestnut, hazel, alder and beech trees), meadows and pastures. Animals’ nutrition depends mostly on grazing pastures, infact flocks are generally supported only with a little nutritional supplementation. The first typical production is the <b>heavy</b> <b>lamb</b> that is gaining more and more relevance thanks to its excellent meat quality, unique in taste; infact, Zeri lamb is included in the list of Slow Food Presidia, reflecting the recognized quality of this product in the world. Most of shepherds jointed in a consortium for the valorization and safeguarding of Zerasca sheep and lambs, whose regulation points towards the implementation of extensive farming systems with an optimal exploitation of local pasture resources. One of the most important problem that Zerasca sheep farmers often complain is represented by gastrointestinal parasitism, almost endemic in sheep husbandry and particularly in sheep raised under extensive systems. Today, “Zeri lamb” has a considerable economic impact on its territory, ensuring increasing profits for shepherds. The aim of this review is to collect information about a native breed in endangered status that it is gaining importance thanks to the high-quality of products...|$|E
40|$|Lamb {{producers}} {{have the option}} to market lambs at a range of slaughter weights. However, there are limited price premiums for heavier carcasses on a per kilogram basis. Any economic advantage of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> is realised by extra weight and not price. Both genetic and on-farm factors contribute to extra weight gain. Firstly, lamb weight and growth is correlated to its mature size and lambs from larger parents grow faster and reach heavier weights, but also have greater feed requirements. Secondly, stocking and reproductive rate account for the majority of variation in whole-farm profit, but increasing these also increases feed requirements. The production of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> is therefore a trade-off with maximising stocking and reproductive rate within the pool of available feed resources. We hypothesise that slaughter weight does not increase with mature size, due to the priority to increase stocking and reproductive rate for profit maximisation...|$|R

40|$|The rugged {{beauty of}} the Iveragh {{peninsula}} has fascinated many a passing visitor and never fails to make some of us linger or stay for good. For those who need proof of the area’s uniqueness, a variety of national and European designations provide ample attestation of the splendour of Iveragh’s scenery, the diversity of its landscape and its heritage. Being surrounded on three sides by the Atlantic, Iveragh is {{the largest and most}} geographically isolated peninsula in Ireland whose western extremity, the Great Skellig, forms the westernmost point of Europe. Despite its maritime location, Iveragh’s character is fundamentally determined by the mountains, valleys and streams that form the peninsula’s interior—the bequest of a landscape sculpted by ice thousands of years ago (Crowley and Sheehan, 2009). Distinctive mountain scene in the Bridia Valley, Glencar Perhaps most distinctive, however, are the extensive blanket bogs and upland heather moorlands that cover most of the peninsula and captivate the imagination with the wild and austere appeal of an area where life did not change much for man and beast until relatively recently. Having come into existence in the wake of woodland clearances, the cutting of vegetation for fuel and the harvesting of crops for food and fiber by Neolithic farmers in the first and second millennium BC, this unique cultural landscape continues to be managed by traditional farmers and their animals to the present day. The value of areas such as Iveragh as repositories of a unique flora and fauna has long been recognized, but they have entered a period of major transformation as the agricultural economy that lay behind them no longer exists (Webb, 1998). The single largest danger is that farming communities may not survive the present discussion of how competitive European agriculture should be, as under present market conditions they are unable to compete without fundamentally changing their way of farming (Luick, 1998). The last 10 years have seen a growing debate over the future of areas like the Iveragh peninsula that may be ‘marginal’ in agricultural terms, but that are quite essential to life in Europe as we know and cherish it. Upland farmed landscapes provide clean water, maintain a rich plant and animal life and help to keep families in regions that offer few alternative employment opportunities – {{at the same time as}} attracting millions of tourists each year. The Caragh in Glencar—one of Europe’s cleanest rivers. Such areas, also termed high nature value farmland, cover about 25 % of all agricultural land in Ireland and include, besides Iveragh, other parts of Kerry, Connemara, Mayo, Donegal, the Comeraghs, Wicklow, the Burren and the offshore Islands. The farming systems of these areas are characterised by extensive mixed livestock grazing and little agro-chemical inputs combined with labour-intensive management practices. Without dedicated farmers and their families, the character of these areas would change completely leading to the disappearance of unique cultural landscapes with effects such as rural depopulation and the loss of local communities. Already farming systems have changed substantially with livestock being concentrated on better quality land while marginal areas are being abandoned. Along with this, there are changes in the animals being farmed. The traditional Scotch Blackface sheep are increasingly crossed with or replaced by lowland breeds to satisfy market demands for <b>heavy</b> <b>lamb.</b> This has led to a softening in sheep and the fear among farmers that the traditional grazers of the uplands may be extinct in years to come. Going, too, is the use of the native rustic Kerry cow that grazed the rough Farming the Iveragh Uplands grasses, bracken, gorse and soft rushes in the winter - growth that sheep cannot control. Unsurprisingly, this disruption over a relatively short time, in what was formerly a sustainable relationship between farming and nature, will have implications for the area’s flora and fauna. Some of the repercussions are obvious; others need to be researched in more depth if appropriate solutions are to be formulated. It is now a stated objective of EU environment and rural development policy to maintain and conserve traditional farming systems like the one practised on Iveragh. Beyond acknowledging the importance of traditional farming for nature conservation and local livelihoods, it is necessary to understand how such farming systems function and to determine how the inevitable process of change can be redirected to provide a way of life that is socially and economically rewarding for farm families while preserving the farming practices necessary for Iveragh’s unique landscape to persist into the future. In this light, University College Cork (UCC) in conjunction with the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) and funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) initiated BioUp, a 3 year research programme to investigate the upland farming system and rich biodiversity associated with it. Managing rural change in the uplands calls for the active involvement of many stakeholders, including farmers and agricultural advisory groups, land owners, conservation groups, forestry, tourism, and local authorities. In the BioUp project, researchers and stakeholders worked closely together. It is hoped that this will help to obtain a better understanding of the social, economic and environmental challenges facing Iveragh and promote greater public appreciation of the indispensable contributions made by farm families to maintaining our unique heritage - a service that has gone unappreciated too long...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} 3 days of life, triplet lambs, {{especially}} the smaller triplets, are less capable of surviving than twins and singles. However, whether differences in behaviour and survival of lambs within triplet litters persist after this period is unknown. This trial examined {{the differences in}} sucking behaviour and milk intake between the light, medium and <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> within a triplet litter at 8 - 17 days of age, with the lamb rank based on birth weight. Of 28 triplet carrying ewes, only 10 complete litters survived to at least 8 days of age and {{could be used for}} this trial. After 4 hours of separation, the lambs were returned to the ewe and the behaviour of the lambs and ewe was observed for a period of 15 minutes. The abdominal girth and body weight of the lambs were measured before and after the sucking period. At 8 - 17 days of age, triplet lambs still differed in terms of weight (P= 0. 001) and abdominal girth (P= 0. 002); the triplet lambs born lightest were still lightest and had the smallest abdominal girth. However, there were no statistical relationships between lamb rank and sucking behaviour. Light, medium and <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> did not differ in the number of sucking bouts, number of attempted bouts, total sucking duration, mean sucking bout duration, relative sucking duration, teat fidelity or number of butts. Nor did lamb rank affect the behaviour of the ewes (kicks or butts, walking away from lambs) or measures of milk intake such as relative weight gain or girth gain. However, there was a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on one measure of milk intake (weight gain) (P= 0. 09). The lambs that were lightest at birth tended to gain less weight during the observation period than <b>heavier</b> <b>lambs,</b> particularly those of medium birth weight. There was also a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on relative girth gain (P= 0. 08). The lambs born lightest tended to gain more girth relative to their original girth than the <b>heaviest</b> <b>lambs.</b> The only measure of sucking behaviour that tended to differ with lamb rank was the frequency of teat switching (P= 0. 09); medium lambs tended to switch teats more often than the <b>heaviest</b> <b>lambs.</b> Overall, weight gain {{is likely to be the}} most accurate indicator of milk intake; based on this variable, lambs born lightest appear to have ingested less milk than their heavier siblings, despite the lack of differences in sucking behaviour. These lambs were still lighter and smaller at 8 - 17 days of age, suggesting that they had lower growth rates and potentially lower chances of survival. Further research should aim to determine whether ewes and lambs can adapt their sucking behaviour to cope with triplet litters, instead of twins or singles, or whether ewes should be selected for higher milk production. In addition, the effect of different management strategies (e. g. fostering or weaning of the lightest lamb or providing milk supplement) on triplet lambs’ milk intake, growth and survival should be tested...|$|R

40|$|Sheep {{production}} {{is the only}} animal production in Sweden that is increasing. Therefore, increasing knowledge of the {{production is}} of great interest. In order to run a viable sheep production, producers needs {{to be successful in}} the breeding of the animals and achieve an economic surplus in the end. Lambs that are born healthy and vital have greater conditions to perform high lamb weight gains and thus a successful production. There are many factors affect the survival, birth weight and early weight gain of the new born lamb. The most important factors regarding the maternal influence and the environmental factors that affect the lambs survival and early life weight gain was explored in this paper. Weight at birth is positively correlated to survival, weight gain, adult weight and maternal traits. Litter size affects the birth weight and is explained by that the uterus is a limited space. Birth weight of lambs is lower in first parity ewes. Birth weight of lambs increases with the ewe’s age up to the fourth parity when it declines again. The foetus grows rapidly during the last weeks of gestation and the newborn lamb weight can be affected by feeding. Feeding regime in early gestation does not affect the growth of the foetus. The milk production of the ewe is of great significance for the lambs’ early weight gain. Lambs that have restricted access to milk in early life have a low correlation between birth weight and early life weight gain. A minor investigation was made to study the influence of birth weight on early weight gain in post natal lambs. The study included 53 lambs of different breeds. The weights of the lambs were registered at as close to birth as possible and as close to 120 hours after the first occasion as possible. An hourly weight gain was calculated in order to calculate a corrected weight at 120 hours. Litter size, sex of the lamb, age and the maternal behavior of the ewe and occurrence of complications during parturition were also registered. The study showed that birth weight affects the early weight gain. Lambs with higher birth weights had higher early weight gains than lambs that were smaller at birth. The results confirmed earlier studies. A likely explanation is that small lambs have a lower early weight gain due to their smaller potential to feed as much as <b>heavier</b> <b>lambs.</b> However, lambs which were smaller at birth had relatively, to the birth weight, a higher growth rate than the <b>heavier</b> <b>lambs.</b> The study also showed that male <b>lambs</b> were <b>heavier</b> and had a higher weight gain than female lambs. Triplets had lower birth weights and grew less than twins and single born lambs. There was only a marginal difference between twins and single born lambs. Adult ewes had the <b>heaviest</b> <b>lambs</b> and the highest weight gains of their lambs. Crossbreeds lambs had higher weights at birth than the purebreds. The study suffered from the relatively low number of lambs which makes extensive conclusions difficult to make except for the correlation between birth weight and early weight gain. It is suggested that birth weight and early weight gain can be used for selecting ewes in the herd as this parameter may well reflect the ewes’ success potential, including, foetus growth, maternal instincts and behaviour and milk production. But this has to be further investigated...|$|R

30|$|Although pastoralists {{have tried}} out several {{measures}} to combat livestock losses, resistance exists, as they feel restricted from utilizing the pasture {{areas where they}} traditionally have had access. However, certain pastoralists have found ways forward {{to respond to the}} threat the carnivores entail. The reindeer herding district that tends their herd closely throughout winter has experienced fewer reindeer losses (see also Risvoll 2015). They have calm animals due to frequent stock handling with carefully selected husbandry methods; thus, tending and moving their herd when needed is also more manageable. However, this strategy comes with a price, as it is difficult to carry off with limited number of herders available, and other chores must then be placed on hold, for instance, participation in various meetings and boards. Sheep farmers who have traditional Norwegian breeds that tend to stay more in flocks have experienced declined losses to carnivores, to a certain extent.
