5|$|On {{reaching}} Jejuri, Khandoba {{was greeted}} by Mhalsa's fury and her strong protest of his second marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} the hill to Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train {{on the top of the}} tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> The knoll is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins to slope downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the knoll, so as to reduce the steepness of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit.

Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent.

5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> after taking their weapons and valuables.

5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{acquired}} the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. He used the unique honey-coloured Bath stone, {{used to build}} the Georgian city, {{and as a result}} made a second fortune. Allen built a railway line from his mine on Combe Down which carried the stone <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport stone to London. Following a failed bid to supply stone to buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would show off the properties of Bath stone as a building material.|$|E

5|$|American air, artillery, mortar, and {{tank fire}} now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made slow progress and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to I Company's position without orders.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} to Besserud. One of the line's main revenue sources was {{transporting}} city-dwellers to the recreational area of Nordmarka {{where they would}} go skiing. An alternative activity was tobogganing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> back to Majorstuen. The operator Holmenkolbanen immediately started plans to extend the line. There were two proposals: {{a continuation of the}} line past Holmenkollen and a branch from Midtstuen up Korketrekkeren to Frogneseteren. However, the latter required the use of a rack railway, as it would give a 1:8 gradient. The former route was selected and the line was extended to Frogneseteren in 1916. Holmenkolbanen started renting out sleds at Frogneseteren, which could be returned at most stations. To save the return ticket, many chose to continue the tobogganing ride to Majorstuen.|$|E
5|$|Several {{residential}} squares with terraces of three-storey {{houses were}} laid out around central gardens.

In the 1830s, much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol Riots, and {{to the north of}} the city, Kings Square. The most fashionable areas were at the top of the hill, as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Further development, though in a less formal manner, continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham, towards Horfield and in the St Phillips, Redcliffe and Bedminster areas.|$|E
