40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the Yangshanchong tailings reservoir to determine the migration of heavy metals in mine tailings. By paralleling to tailings discharge direction, we set 4 sampling profiles, open channel excavation sampling. The {{results showed that the}} transfer rates of Cu, As, Hg, Cd, and Pb are relatively fast, while that of Zn is slower. Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn secondary enrichment appear at 40 ~ 80 cm. There are some discrepancies in the heavy metal migration characteristics in different places. At the highest part of the tailings reservoir, heavy metal element's content is higher than the other sampling points, heavy metals leaching quantity is small, while in the low-lying areas, Zn, Cu and Cd form a local enrichment in the surface, and also part of heavy metal elements secondary enrichment in less than 100 cm shallow tailings.

Post-storm construction of two sacrificial dunes along approximately 4 miles of the barrier resulted in dune construction design standards that satisfied the interests of storm and flood protection to landward development and threatened shorebird habitat criteria. The design standards ultimately resulted in a 10 foot wide crest and 10 : 1 front and back fore-dune slopes.

30|$|Elevated {{root zone}} CO 2 may have {{potential}} effects on plant growth and vegetation succession in the revegetated desert areas. In the present study, a closed-air CO 2 enrichment (CACE) system {{was designed to}} simulate elevated CO 2 concentrations in the root zones. The physio-ecological characteristics of two typical xerophytic shrubs, C. korshinskii and A. ordosica were studied. Results showed that plant growth, phenophase, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and water use efficiency for the two xerophytic shrubs were all increased {{at first and then}} decreased with increasing soil CO 2 concentrations, and the optimal soil CO 2 concentration thresholds for C. korshinskii and A. ordosica were 0.554 and 0.317 %, respectively. And A. ordosica was more tolerate to root zone CO 2 variation when compared with C. korshinskii, which means that root zone CO 2 concentration was one of the potential driving factors in plant succession in revegetated desert areas at smaller spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, we predicted that <b>grass</b> <b>planting</b> patterns or minor human disturbances are effective in enhancing sustainability and management of desert ecosystems in future ecological constructions in sandy areas.|$|E
30|$|Early surface-mine {{reclamation}} laws required some soil, subsoil, or overburden {{be placed}} {{back in the}} excavated area, but little emphasis was given to revegetation. Conifers and some hardwood trees were planted {{on some of the}} regraded areas (Limstrom 1960; Brown 1962; Plass 2000; Ashby 2006). At the time, reclamation was intended only to reshape the land and to establish readily available trees or shrubs from nearby sources. The trees planted on these early reclamation attempts were mostly pines (Pinus spp.) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) - if anything was planted at all. Species such as the non-native exotic autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata Thumb.) and the native Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana Mill.), red pine (P. resinosa Ait.), and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) were transplanted as seedlings and grew well in many early reforestation studies (Minkler 1941; Chapman 1947; Mickalitis and Kutz 1949; Tryon 1952; Brown 1962). It has been estimated that approximately 60  % of the land disturbed by mining between 1940 and 1971 was reclaimed in some fashion by industry (Limstrom 1960; Keys et al. 1971). This reclamation probably included backfilling and some type of tree or <b>grass</b> <b>planting.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this {{research}} we studied {{the feasibility of}} applying phytoremediation in the mine tailings at La Concha site. The extraction efficiency of heavy metals was studied, {{as well as the}} tolerance to high pollution and biomass generation of Lolium multiflorum, known as Italian ryegrass, in the aggressive soils composed almost entirely by mine wastes. Ryegrass seeds were grown in mine tailings containing Cu, Mn, Zn, and Pb concentrations of around 800, 4600, 3200, and 5400 ppm respectively. Triplicate analyses of soils without treatment and with treatments consisting in organic matter (OM) additions were carried out during 90 days. Italian ryegrass has a high tolerance to polluted mine tailings, although the addition of small quantities of organic matter improves the extraction of metals. The highest metals uptake from tailings was achieved through treatment with 20 % OM additions, with varying efficiencies of around 50 % for Zn and Pb in 90 days, although for Cu and Mn these were smaller, namely of 28 and 14 % respectively. These results show that phytoremediation of mine tailings is possible through <b>grass</b> <b>planting</b> that was able to remove the heavy metals...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, the {{measured}} annual river {{flow of the}} Yellow River has declined significantly. After adding the diverted water back to get the 'natural' annual river flow, the tendency of decrease can still be seen. This indicates that the river flow renewability of the Yellow River has changed. The river flow renewability is indexed as the ratio of annual 'natural' river flow to annual precipitation over a river drainage basin, where the 'natural' river flow is the measured annual river flow plus the annual 'net' water diversion from the river. By using this index, based on {{the data from the}} drainage area between Hekouzhen and Longmen stations on the middle Yellow River, a study has been made of the river flow renewability of the Yellow River in the changing environment of the past 50 years. The river flow renewability index (I rr) in the drainage area between Hekouzhen and Longmen in the middle Yellow River basin has been found to decline significantly with time. In the meantime, annual precipitation decreased, annual air temperature increased, but the area of water and soil conservation measures has been increased. It has been found that I rr is positively correlated with the areal averaged annual precipitation, but negatively correlated with annual air temperature. There is close, negative correlation between I rr and the area of water and soil conservation measures including land terracing, tree and <b>grass</b> <b>planting</b> and checkdam building, implying that water and soil conservation measures have reduced the river flow renewability.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, the {{sediment}} flux of the Yellow River {{to the sea}} has shown a marked tendency to decrease, which is unfavorable for wetland protection and oil extraction in the Yellow River delta. Thus, an effort {{has been made to}} elucidate the relation between {{the sediment}} flux to the sea and the drainage basin factors including climate and human activities. The results show that the sediment flux to the sea responds to the changed precipitation in different ways for different runoff and sediment source areas in the drainage basin. If other factors are assumed to be constant, when the annual precipitation in the area between Longmen and Sanmenxia decreases by 10 mm, the sediment flux to the sea will decrease by 27. 5 million t/yr; when the precipitation in the area between Hekouzhen and Longmen decreases by 10 mm, the sediment flux to the sea will decrease by 14. 3 million t/yr; when the precipitation in the area above Lanzhou decreases by 10 mm, the sediment flux to the sea will decrease by 17. 4 million t/yr.

40|$|Rapid {{colonization}} by invasive {{plants can}} lead to failures of wetland restoration, particularly in forested wetlands where mature plant communities are slow to develop. To develop more effective methods for reducing the spread of invasive plants, I tested the hypothesis that planting native shrubs {{during the early stages}} of wetland creation can provide an alternative to herbicides by enhancing competition for light and other resources with invasive herbaceous plants, such as Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary <b>grass).</b> <b>Planting</b> native shrub live stakes in two created forested wetlands in Western New York State, USA, increased overall native herbaceous plant cover and biodiversity relative to plots without shrubs over a four-year period. Invasive species richness was lowest in plots containing Cephalanthus occidentalis, while other planting combinations showed lower invasive species richness but less difference in invasive species richness relative to neighboring plots without shrubs. This finding was confirmed in a controlled greenhouse experiment, where shrubs limited growth of P. arundinacea, without negative reciprocal effects on the shrubs. One mechanism for the reduction in invasive plant cover was likely the significantly reduced light availability beneath shrubs. Shrub health varied among species over time, with a substantial reduction in survivorship following a winter with extreme low temperatures. Overall health was highest for the winter-hardy shrub species C. occidentalis. All species tested had higher survival rates and health assessment when planted in single-species plots rather than in combination with other shrub species and plantings in varying hydrological settings indicated that C. occidentalis and Cornus amomum drier soil than Salix sericea. This work shows the potential for native live stakes to deter pernicious invaders such as P. arundinacea and enhance the success of wetland restoration projects, but that plantings must be selected to ensure survival in variable hydrological and climate conditions...|$|E
