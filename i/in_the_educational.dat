5|$|Although {{the economy}} of Moncton was traumatized twice—by the {{collapse}} of the shipbuilding industry in the 1860s and by the closure of the CNR locomotive shops in the 1980s—the city was able to rebound strongly on both occasions.

The strength of Moncton's economy has received national recognition and the local unemployment rate is consistently less than the national average.|$|E
