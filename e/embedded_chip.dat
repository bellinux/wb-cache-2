40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for the efficient compiler management of software-exposed heterogeneous memory. In many lower-end <b>embedded</b> <b>chips,</b> {{often used in}} micro-controllers and DSP processors, heterogeneous memory units such as scratch-pad SRAM, internal DRAM, external DRAM and ROM are visible directly to the software, without automatic management by a hardware caching mechanism. Instead the memory units are mapped to different portions of the address space. Caches are avoided because of their cost and power consumption, and because they {{make it difficult to}} guarantee real-time performance. For this important class of <b>embedded</b> <b>chips,</b> the allocation of data to different memory units to maximize performance {{is the responsibility of the}} softwar...|$|R

40|$|Debugging {{applications}} {{running on}} an embedded system is very difficult. Often the chips inconsideration {{has very little}} or no support for interactive debugging.

This paper will present each and every one of the difficulties associated with a non-general purpose limited power chip then show how to work around it. The topics analyzed include the need and lack of debugger, communication facilities, operating system support, and intuitive perhaps visual interfaces. The paper revolves around a project that simulate these problems using a virtual x 86 processor with bare environmental support as a target machine. Using examples, this paper will demonstrate each problem along with its workaround. The goal of this paper is to present approaches taken to deal with specific yet promiscuous problems relating to a certain chip’s deficiency.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present results from the EC funded project SHIFT (Smart High Integration Flex Technologies) on the {{embedding}} in and the assembly on flex substrates of ultrathin chips. Design/methodology/approach - Methods to <b>embed</b> <b>chips</b> in flex include flip-chip assembly and subsequent lamination, or the construction of a separate ultra-thin chip package (UTCP) using spin-on polyimides and thin-film metallisation technology. Thinning and separation of the chips is done using a "dicing-by-thinning" method. Findings - The feasibility of both <b>chip</b> <b>embedding</b> methods has been demonstrated, as well as that of the chip thinning method. Lamination of four layers of flex with ultrathin chips could be achieved without chip breakage. The UTCP technology results in a 60 mu m package where also the 20 mu m thick chip is bendable. Research limitations/implications - Further development work includes reliability testing, embedding of the UTCP in conventional flex, and construction of functional demonstrators using the developed technologies. Originality/value - Thinning down silicon chips to thicknesses of 25 mu m and lower is an innovative technology, as well as assembly and <b>embedding</b> of these <b>chips</b> in flexible substrates...|$|R
