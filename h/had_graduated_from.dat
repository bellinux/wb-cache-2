5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} on 4 August 1914, Gellibrand offered his {{services}} to the commandant of the 6th Military District (Tasmania). On 20 August 1914, he {{was appointed to the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a captain, and given the post of Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General (DAQMG) {{on the staff of the}} 1st Division. Staff college graduates like Gellibrand were scarce in Australia; only six Australian Army officers <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> staff colleges. There were also four of the British Army's graduates on secondment. For the 1st Division's General Staff (G) Branch, the division commander, Major General William Bridges, chose two of Gellibrand's Camberley classmates, Lieutenant Colonel Brudenell White from the Australian Army, and Major Duncan Glasfurd from the British Army, and Captain Thomas Blamey, an Australian Army officer who <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> the Staff College, Quetta. The Administration (A) Branch was headed by the AA & QMG, Colonel Victor Sellheim. Lieutenant Colonel W. G. Patterson was his deputy, the DAA & QMG. As DAQMG, Gellibrand was responsible for logistics; Major Cecil Foott, an Australian 1913 Camberley graduate, was the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), responsible for personnel matters.

5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|From 1895 to 1899, William Wurtenburg {{served as}} the {{head coach of the}} Dartmouth Big Green {{football}} program, which represented Dartmouth College in collegiate football competitions. Dartmouth had adopted football as a school sport in 1881 when the team went 1–0–1. Prior to Wurtenburg's hiring, the team had won two consecutive Triangular Football League championships under coach Wallace Moyle. Wurtenburg had been a highly successful player at Yale, where he had played at quarterback on teams that went 46–1–1 in a four-year span. He <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> the school in 1893 and coached the Navy Midshipmen football program for a year before his hiring by Dartmouth.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E
5|$|Stojanović was {{the third}} child and the first son of Serbian Orthodox priest Simo Stojanović and his wife Jovanka. He was born in Prijedor on 7April 1896.

Stojanović's father {{was the third}} generation of his family {{to serve as a}} Serbian Orthodox priest. He <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> a theology faculty, becoming the first in the family to attain a higher level of education. Simo was active in the political struggle for ecclesiastical and educational autonomy for the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mladen Stojanović's maternal grandfather was a Serbian Orthodox priest from Dubica, Teodor Vujasinović; he had participated in Pecija's revolt against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Dobell {{launched}} the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 {{with a full}} scale frontal assault supported by naval gunfire, tanks and poison gas. It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of lieutenant general. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine, General Sir Edmund Allenby took over the EEF from Murray. Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines. Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed, XX Corps under Chetwode and XXI Corps under Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin. The three corps commanders were professional soldiers, none of whom <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> a military college or a staff college, {{they had all been}} commissioned from the militia or volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{instruction}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World WarII, {{in response to a}} vast {{increase in the number of}} aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, No.1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS). The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, {{he enjoyed}} polo and boxing. He led a polo team {{known as the}} Zardari Four. His father owned Bambino—a famous cinema in Karachi—and donated movie {{equipment}} to his school. He also appeared in a movie, Salgirah, as a child artist. Zardari's academic background remains a question mark. He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 1973–74; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he <b>had</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> the London School of Business Studies with a {{bachelor of education degree}} in the early 1970s. Zardari's official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain. His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London. The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold a college degree, but the rule was overturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court in April 2008.|$|E
