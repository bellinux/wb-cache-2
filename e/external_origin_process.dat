Based on my estimates, I conclude that under normal circumstances a temporarily more aggressive interest policy alone does not help cushion shocks, and that the sensitivity of domestic prices to the exchange rate is similar in these countries irrespective of the interest rate policy they adopt. By contrast, price stability and the fact that inflation expectations are firmly anchored may reduce exchange rate pass-through considerably, which, in terms of inflation, offers better protection against external shocks. However, the results are not valid under circumstances where the central bank is experiencing severe market disturbances or panicky behaviour; firm interest measures in these cases may be appropriate and serve the intended purpose. monetary policy, risk premium shocks, exchange rate pass-through, structural VAR, sign restriction. ...|$|R

CO sources can be either of internal or of <b>external</b> <b>origin.</b> Methods. We recorded broad multi-band spectra of Saturn and Uranus at the frequencies of the J= 1 " 0 and J= 2 " 1 CO lines, at the IRAM 30 m-telescope, Spain, using Lellouch et al. (2005) and Hesman et al.

The value we obtain for Saturn (6. 3 × 10 − 8, restricted to the stratosphere) is larger than the value of the CO mixing ratio in the <b>external</b> <b>origin</b> model of Noll & Larson (1991). New observations with better sensitivity and/or more observing time should enable us to state on the CO external source strength. The upper limit we derive on Uranus is slightly lower (2. 7 × 10 − 8, restricted to the stratosphere) than the value derived from the first observation of CO on Uranus, at infrared wavelength, by Encrenaz et al.
