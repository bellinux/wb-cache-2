30|$|Increasing {{demand for}} crude oil is {{promoting}} the development <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> extraction technologies. Among these, microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a promising tertiary oil recovery technology for depleted oil fields (Brown 2010; Sen 2008). Indigenous microorganisms, which naturally inhabit oil reservoirs, show a greater metabolic activity than exogenous ones {{due to their}} long-term adaptation (Castoren-Cort√©s et al. 2012; Lazar et al. 2007). Therefore, indigenous microorganisms activated MEOR (IMEOR) has greater efficiency than using exogenous ones (Yao et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012). Stimulation, growth and propagation of beneficial microorganisms that can contribute to producing effective metabolites are critical to the application of IMEOR (Zhang et al. 2010). The metabolites mainly include gases, acids and emulsifiers (Gao and Zerki 2011). Gases can pressurize the oil reservoir and reduce the viscosity <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> (Kobayashi et al. 2012; Spirov et al. 2014). Acids may increase carbonate rock porosity and permeability, thereby promote the <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> remained <b>oil</b> (Sen 2008). Emulsifiers can emulsify crude oil, lower its viscosity and improve its fluidity (Banat et al. 2010; Dastgheib et al. 2008; Kitamoto et al. 2009; Sarafzadeh et al. 2013; She et al. 2011). The multiple effects of various metabolites improve oil flooding and thus enhance crude oil recovery.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Topical {{application}} of nicotine and stimulation of tachykinin containing sensory nerves {{have been shown}} to produce mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma and derangement of the epithelial lining in guinea pig and rat airways. If this occurred in man these effects might contribute to the pathogenesis of airway disease. This study, performed in healthy volunteers without atopy, examined whether nicotine affects the plasma exudation response and the mucosal absorption permeability of the human nasal airway. METHODS [...] The acute effects of increasing topical doses of nicotine (0. 08 - 2. 0 mg) were examined (n = 8) on nasal symptoms (pain), mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma (albumin), mucosal secretion of mucin (fucose), and mucosal exudative responsiveness (histamine induced mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> albumin). A separate placebo controlled study was carried out to determine whether frequent applications of the high dose of nicotine (2. 0 mg given eight times daily for nine days) had any deleterious effects on the airway mucosa detectable as altered responses to histamine challenge. Both mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma (n = 12) and mucosal absorption of chromium- 51 labelled EDTA (n = 8) were thus examined in nasal airways exposed to both nicotine and histamine. RESULTS [...] Nicotine caused nasal pain and produced dose dependent mucosal secretion of fucose but failed to produce any mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> albumin. The exudative responsiveness to histamine was, indeed, decreased when the challenge was performed immediately after administration of acute doses of nicotine, whereas the responsiveness was unaffected when histamine challenges were carried out during prolonged treatment with nicotine. The nasal mucosal absorption of 51 Cr-EDTA in the presence of histamine did not differ between subjects receiving either placebo or nicotine treatment for nine days. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results indicate that nicotine applied to the human airway mucosa produces pain and secretion of mucin, but inflammatory changes such as mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma and epithelial disruption may not be produced. Neurogenic inflammatory responses, which are so readily produced in guinea pig and rat airways, may not occur in human airways...|$|R

40|$|Soils in {{plantations}} of Cryptomeria japonica in Japan {{have similar}} to threefold more exchangeable Ca compared with soils in {{other types of}} forest vegetation even in a Ca-poor environment. To explain mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we determined the effect <b>of</b> root <b>exudation</b> rate <b>of</b> low-molecular-mass organic acids (LMMOAs) on exchangeable cations in soil. We conducted a pot experiment using C. japonica and five dominant tree species in Japan, and measured the root <b>exudation</b> rates <b>of</b> LMMOAs and exchangeable nutrient concentrations in the soils. To estimate whether the root <b>exudation</b> rate <b>of</b> LMMOAs is elevated in response to Ca deficiency, we created variation in Ca availability by adding different amounts of crushed oyster shells. The root <b>exudation</b> rates <b>of</b> LMMOAs were two to five times higher for C. japonica than for other tree species, but {{did not differ significantly}} among the different quantities of oyster shell.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Mucosal <b>exudation</b> (luminal entry) <b>of</b> bulk plasma is a {{key feature}} of airway defence and inflammation. In guinea pig and rat airways this {{response}} is readily produced by neurogenic irritants, notably capsaicin. Thus "neurogenic airway inflammation" has become an established concept. The present study examines whether capsaicin also produces mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma in human nasal airways both in health and disease (seasonal allergic rhinitis). METHODS [...] Pain-producing concentrations of capsaicin (30 - 300 ng/ml) were applied to the nasal mucosal surface both before and late into the pollen season. Levels of albumin in nasal lavage fluid were measured as an index <b>of</b> mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma. In a separate group of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis nasal challenge with an exudative concentration of histamine was carried out before the birch pollen season and concentrations of albumin in lavage fluid were measured. RESULTS [...] Pollen counts and symptom scores revealed a mild pollen season. Capsaicin produced considerable nasal pain and this response was augmented late into the season when capsaicin also produced nasal blockage. However, capsaicin failed to produce any mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma either before or late into the pollen season. The exudative effect of histamine was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS [...] The augmented pain response to capsaicin suggests that a sensory nerve hyperresponsiveness may characterise allergic airways disease. In contrast to the effects on animal airways, capsaicin failed to produce mucosal <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> plasma in the human nasal airway. The animal based neurogenic inflammation concept is therefore not valid for the human nasal airway, not even in inflamed airways when a neural hyperresponsiveness has developed...|$|R

40|$|Keywords : {{aluminium}} (Al), base cations, BC :Al ratio, magnesium (Mg), organic anions, oxalate, malonate, ectomycorrhizal fungi, Paxillus involutus, Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) The {{finding of}} microscopic-small tunnels in mineral grains in podzol soils was {{the incentive for}} a research programme on rock-eating mycorrhizae. The research described in this thesis {{was part of that}} program. The tunnels were thought to be created by ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi through <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> low molecular weight organic anions (LMWOA). LMWOA can detoxify Al by forming stabile non-toxic complexes and can enhance mineral weathering, thereby mobilising base cations for plant and fungus. In this study we demonstrated that a role for EcM-fungi in detoxification of Al and in mobilisation of base cations from mineral grains is likely since both toxic Al levels and low base cation supply induced LMWOA exudation by ectomycorrhizae. The risk for Al toxicity is often assessed by regarding the ratio of base cations (BC) to Al in the soil solution. Adverse effects on tree growth are expected at BC :Al < 1. We demonstrated that Al toxicity is not determined by the BC :Al ratio. Growth reductions in Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies seedlings were better predicted by the concentration of BC and Al in solution than by the BC :Al ratio. At a constant BC:Al ratio of 1, shoot growth decreased with increasing concentrations of Al. Seedlings of P. sylvestris responded to Al by the <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOA. Indeed, EcM fungi enhanced this exudation, suggesting a role for EcM-exuded LMWOA in detoxifying Al. The exudation was further enhanced when levels of toxic Al were combined with deficient Mg and P supply. EcM fungi did not physically hinder Al uptake and did not improve uptake of Ca or Mg under Al toxicity. Ectomycorrhizae affected the <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOA and weathering of minerals when plants were deficient in Mg, K or P. The <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOA (mainly oxalate and malonate) was nutrient-specific and EcM species-specific. <b>Exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOA by the EcM symbiosis could not be predicted from the <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOA by seedlings or EcM fungi grown in pure culture. The oxalate exudation by ectomycorrhizae in response to Mg and K deficiencies correlated well with the ectomycorrhizal induced weathering of minerals containing K and Mg. Weathering of the K-containing muscovite was almost doubled if seedlings were colonised by P. involutus compared to seedlings colonised by other EcM fungi or without mycorrhizae. There was no effect of EcM fungi on the weathering of Mg-containing hornblende. Localised Mg addition stimulated EcM foraging under Mg deficiency. Hyphal foraging and transport of Mg to the roots was independent of P supply or P transport...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} were to determine (1) if lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants respond similarly to low zinc (Zn) and phosphorus (P) availability by increased root <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> low-molecular weight organic anions (LMWOAs) and (2) if genotypic variation in tolerance to low soil supply of either Zn or P is related to LMWOA <b>exudation</b> rates. <b>Exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOAs can increase bioavailability of both Zn and P to the plant, through partly similar chemical mechanisms. We used seven lowland rice genotypes and showed in two experiments that genotypes that grow relatively well on a soil with low Zn availability also grow well on a sparingly soluble Ca-phosphate (r = 0. 80, P = 0. 03). We measured <b>exudation</b> rates <b>of</b> LMWOAs on nutrient solution and found that both Zn and P deficiency induced significant increases. Among the LMWOAs detected oxalate was quantitatively the most important, but citrate is considered more effective in mobilizing Zn. Citrate exudation rates correlated with tolerance to low soil levels of Zn (P= 0. 05) and P (P = 0. 07). In a low-Zn-field we found an increased biomass production at higher plant density, which is supportive for a concentration-dependent rhizosphere effect on Zn bioavailability such as LMWOA exudation. We, for the first time, showed that tolerance to low Zn availability {{is related to the}} capacity of a plant to exude LMWOAs and confirmed that <b>exudation</b> <b>of</b> LMWOAs must be regarded a multiple stress response...|$|R

However, within the silicicolous ecotype seed samples showed marked differences in exudation pattern and seed phosphorus content depending on origin along the soil acidity gradient.
