5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; <b>even</b> <b>close</b> family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or <b>even</b> <b>close</b> the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped the water out of the hold, repairing the ship so {{that she was able to}} continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E

25|$|Even though several {{translations}} {{and interpretations}} exist, the overall {{meaning of the}} prayer remains obscure. The terseness of the prose, elaborate arrangement and poetical techniques make a translation from the Old Avestan difficult (See also: difficulties in translating the Gathas). Given its syntactic density, scholarly agreement on a definitive translation, or <b>even</b> <b>close</b> approximation of its meaning, remains unlikely. Translations based on Middle Persian translations (and commentaries) of the hymn also exist and can differ greatly from those based on the Avestan original.|$|E
25|$|Perković's {{good form}} in 2010 culminated at the European Championships in Barcelona, where {{she won a}} gold medal in discus throw. Perković {{struggled}} in the qualification and was <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to elimination as she failed to make the qualifying norm of 60.00m, placing only 10th out of 12 athletes to advance to the final. However, in the final she made a strong opening round throw which kept her in silver medal position until the last, 6th round, when she made a winning throw of 64.67m, becoming the youngest ever European champion in women's discus throw.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 {{a meeting}} of fusion {{researchers}} took place in Novosibirsk, where, to everyone's astonishment, the Soviet hosts introduced their work on their tokamak designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to matching. The latest of their designs, the T-3, was producing electron energies of 1000eV, compared to about 10eV in ZETA. This corresponded to a plasma temperature of about 10 million K. Although the Soviet team was highly respected, the results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem {{like the one that}} had occurred with ZETA. Spitzer, once again, expressed his scepticism rather strongly, sparking off an acrimonious debate with Artsimovitch.|$|E

25|$|This remark refers {{among other}} things to Newton's finding, {{supported}} by mathematical demonstration, that if the inverse square law applies to tiny particles, then even a large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external to its surface, <b>even</b> <b>close</b> up, exactly as if all its own mass were concentrated at its center. Thus Newton gave a justification, otherwise lacking, for applying the inverse square law to large spherical planetary masses {{as if they were}} tiny particles. In addition, Newton had formulated in Propositions 43-45 of Book 1, and associated sections of Book 3, a sensitive test of the accuracy of the inverse square law, in which he showed that only where the law of force is accurately as the inverse square of the distance will the directions of orientation of the planets' orbital ellipses stay constant as they are observed to do apart from small effects attributable to inter-planetary perturbations.|$|E
25|$|One major {{hallmark}} of McNamara's cost reductions was {{the consolidation of}} programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX dual service F-111 project. It was to combine Navy requirements for an Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience {{in the corporate world}} led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD's preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike, and <b>even</b> <b>close</b> air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.|$|E

500|$|The Young Artist Awards, {{formerly}} known as the Youth in Film Awards, are presented annually by the Young Artist Association. The awards honor outstanding performances by young performers in films and television and provide scholarships for other artists. Performers are eligible to receive a nomination if they are under 21. The awards have been presented since 1979 and are held in Studio City, California. The series received two nominations.

500|$|In {{spite of}} the lower {{likelihood}} of giant planet formation, just such an object {{has been found in}} the globular cluster Messier 4. This planet was detected orbiting a pulsar in the binary star system PSR B1620-26. The eccentric and highly inclined orbit of the planet suggests it may have been formed around another star in the cluster, then was later [...] "exchanged" [...] into its current arrangement. The likelihood of close encounters between stars in a globular cluster can disrupt planetary systems, some of which break loose to become free floating planets. <b>Even</b> <b>close</b> orbiting planets can become disrupted, potentially leading to orbital decay and an increase in orbital eccentricity and tidal effects.|$|E
500|$|... "There {{are certain}} movies {{that serve as}} a {{standard}} bearer for a genre – a high water mark that filmmakers always try to hit, but seem to always come up short.

In the 21 years since the film was released, so many filmmakers have {{tried so hard to}} copy Goodfellas success, and so few have gotten <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to capturing the magic that Scorsese did in one of his very best films. The 21 years have been littered with a bunch of pale imitations. To that list, you can add Jonathan Hensleigh’s Kill the Irishman, which wants so desperately to be Goodfellas, and comes up so very, very short." ...|$|E
