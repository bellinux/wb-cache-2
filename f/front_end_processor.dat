40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{expanding}} {{requirement in}} Modern Telemetry Systems for Real-Time Data Processing has necessitated the commutation {{of a vast}} majority of the data processing functions into <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> <b>Processors.</b> Even the fastest of Host Processors has proven incapable of keeping pace with high speed data rates (up to 4 Megawords). The commutation of processing power into the telemetry <b>front</b> <b>end</b> has elicited the employment of distributive processing techniques in order to attain the desired throughput. A distributive processing system architecture achieves high processing throughput by apportioning data analysis functions. By defining and programming unique processing nodes to selectively acquire, distribute, compress, and/or convert data, extensive simultaneous operations are executable. Hardware merged bus structures have lent themselves conveniently to this method of data distribution and control. Conversely, conventional software structures are unsuited to distributive processing architectures which must support a broad spectrum of modular configurations. Primarily, this is evidenced when the composite system software must be repetitively customized as additional processing power or new capabilities are incorporated. Composite software that delivers a high degree of system configuration adaptability is nominally large and complex, is limited in application, depletes system memory resources and complicates sustaining software maintenance. In addition, an undesirable human interface is normally unavoidable with composite software since it requires that the user learn the specific <b>front</b> <b>end</b> system’s terminology and individual components. Bus Structure Software consigns itself to effectively support distributive processing techniques providing for adaptive system configurations. This disquisition will address the concepts of bus structured software and its application to distributive processing. Furthermore, this paper will discuss the architectural capability to service a wide range of telemetry users without specialized system tailoring. A typical implementation of this convention, the Advanced Decommutation System (ADS) designed by LORAL DATA SYSTEMS, San Diego, California will also be presented...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Multi-Vehicle Metric & Telemetry System (MMTS) is a {{complete}} range system which performs real-time tracking, command destruct, and telemetry processing functions for support of range safety and the test and evaluation of airborne vehicles. As currently configured, the MMTS consists of five hardware and software subsystems with the capability to receive, process, and display tracking data from up to ten range sensors and telemetry data from two instrumented vehicles. During a range operation, the MMTS is employed to collect, process, and display tracking and telemetry data. The instrumentation sites designated for operational support acquire tracking and telemetered data and transmit these data to the MMTS. The raw data is then identified, formatted, time tagged, recorded, processed, and routed for display to mission control and telemetry display areas. Additionally, processed tracking data is transmitted back to instrumentation sites {{as an aid to}} acquire or maintain vehicle track. The mission control area consists of a control and status console, high resolution color graphics stations, and large screen displays. As the mission controller observes mission progress on the graphics stations operational decisions can be made and invoked by activation of the appropriate console controls. Visual alarms provided my MMTS will alert mission control personnel of hazardous conditions posed by any tracked vehicle. Manual action can then be taken to activate transmission of the MMTS vehicle destruct signal. The telemetry display area consists of ten fully-functional, PC compatible computers which are switchable to either of two telemetry <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>processors.</b> Each PC can be independently set up by telemetry analysts to display data of interest.

40|$|This new {{implementation}} of the PROgramming System for Structural Synthesis (PROSSS- 2) combines a general-purpose finite element computer program for structural analysis, a state-of-the-art optimization program, and several user-supplied, problem-dependent computer programs. The results are flexibility of the optimization procedure, organization, and versatility of the formulation of constraints and design variables. The analysis-optimization process results in a minimized objective function, typically the mass. The analysis and optimization programs are executed repeatedly by looping through the system until the process is stopped by a user-defined termination criterion. However, some of the analysis, such as model definition, need only be one time {{and the results are}} saved for future use. The user must write some small, simple FORTRAN programs to interface between the analysis and optimization programs. One of these programs, the front processor, converts the design variables output from the optimizer into the suitable format for input into the analyzer. Another, the <b>end</b> <b>processor,</b> retrieves the behavior variables and, optionally, their gradients from the analysis program and evaluates the objective function and constraints and optionally their gradients.

40|$|This paper investigates three {{software}} {{standards and}} applies {{them to the}} use case of setting up a C 2 to RF (end-to-end) satellite ground system. It can be shown that {{through the use of}} these standard interfaces, flexible, multi-mission ground system architectures can be operationally capable in a fraction of the time when compared to traditional satellite missions. In addition to the shortened timetable, integration and operational costs are reduced through the use of this approach. Today 2 ̆ 7 s satellite industry has seen advances in technologies, driven by design and manufacturing advances, allowing for the introduction of Small Satellites and forcing ground system architectures to shift from static, program oriented architectures to flexible, multi-mission architectures. Similar to large, satellite program ground architectures, Small Satellites require complete C 2 to RF solutions, yet many do not have the budget or schedule for a traditional approach. These constraints have facilitated the use of software standards to decrease timetables and reduce both integration and operational costs. Representational State Transfer (REST) is an adaptive software architecture used in the development of higher-performing and more maintainable communications architectures. Leveraging common interfaces, REST allows an open, web-based approach to communicate with ground system equipment and satellite busses. The XML Telemetric and Command Exchange (XTCE) standard is used for defining and sharing telemetry and command (T 2 ̆ 6 C) data streams using Extensible Markup Language (XML). Through the use of XTCE, Small Satellite mission no longer rely on proprietary C 2 databases or complex, negotiated Factory to Ground ICDs to share and store telemetry and commands. Use of the XTCE standard allows developers, operators and integrators the ability to construct and test their own satellite databases using unifying database formats across satellites and ground systems. The Ground Equipment Monitoring Service (GEMS) standard creates an interface for ingesting telemetry, sending commands, and controlling ground system equipment. Interfaces to <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> <b>Processors,</b> Modems, AFSCN Interfaces and Antenna Control Units no longer need to be custom processes, but are available for use out-of-the-box using GEMS-compliant equipment. Using GEMS, new equipment can be readily adopted, tested and incorporated into the existing ground system. As part of a flexible ground system architecture, use of REST, XTCE and GEMS standards allow for operational capabilities in weeks instead of months or years, filling the Small Satellite need for shorter timetables compared to traditional architectures. Through the use of these standards, programs can focus on the development of payloads and mission unique applications instead of integration of ground system components. This paper will detail the three standards, their use and applicability in the Small Satellite industry and how Small Satellite missions can benefit by incorporating a standards based approach in their ground system architecture...|$|R
40|$|To achieve high {{instruction}} throughput, instruction schedulers must {{be capable}} of producing high-quality schedules that maximize functional unit utilization {{while at the same}} time enabling fast instruction issue logic. Many solutions exist to the scheduling problem, ranging from compile-time to run-time approaches. Compile-time solutions feature fast and simple hardware, but at the expense of conservative schedules. Dynamic schedulers produce high-quality schedules that incorporate run-time information and dependence speculation, but implementing these schedulers requires complex circuits that can slow processor clock speeds. In this paper, we present the Cyclone scheduler, a novel design that captures the benefits of both compileand run-time scheduling. Our approach utilizes a listbased single-pass instruction scheduling algorithm, implemented by hardware at run-time in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the <b>processor</b> pipeline. Once scheduled, instructions are injected into a timed queue that orchestrates their entry into execution. To accommodate branch and load/store dependence speculation, the Cyclone scheduler supports a simple selective replay mechanism. We implement this technique by overloading instruction register forwarding to also detect instructions dependent on incorrectly scheduled operations. Detailed simulation analyses suggest that with sufficient queue width, the Cyclone scheduler can rival the instruction throughput of similarly wide monolithic dynamic schedulers. Furthermore, the circuit complexity of the Cyclone scheduler is much more favorable than a broadcast-based scheduler, as our approach requires no global control signals. ...|$|R
