25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
500|$|All {{the other}} Beatles went on record about the {{dismissal}} of Best. McCartney stated that Best was [...] "good, but a bit limited." [...] Harrison said that [...] "Pete kept being sick and not showing up for gigs" [...] and admitted, [...] "I was quite responsible for stirring things up. I conspired to get Ringo in for good; I talked to Paul and John until they came round to the idea." [...] For his part, Starr said: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a much better drummer than he [...] was." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

[...] "I could have wept with rage... I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here... I yelled against the wind...I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen."

I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish."

500|$|Four screenwriters {{worked on}} the property. Peter Hedges wrote the first draft, but didn't think he could do more; another writer passed. Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda's scenes, {{followed}} by a Don Roos rewrite. After that, Aline Brosh McKenna, {{who was able to}} relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story, produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version, rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda. She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship [...] "very liberating ... I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> allowed to do what the movie wanted to be, a Faust story, a Wall Street for ladies." ...|$|E

500|$|She then won a {{supporting}} role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of [...] "Jet Girl" [...] after nine auditions. While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it {{has gone on to}} become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: [...] "there were always little bites. Whenever I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{at the end of my}} rope, something would come up. Something bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto." [...] In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in , in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.|$|E
500|$|By 1962, Glock {{had persuaded}} the BBC {{management}} {{to increase the}} orchestra's budget to allow for joint principals in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having {{to give up their}} solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage joint principals for the wind section, including as Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham's celebrated [...] "Royal Family" [...] in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO {{was the only one of}} the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO's constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting too secure ... the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you're on time and never moan at the conductor … you'll have no trouble... I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.|$|E
500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> deceived. When you feel that you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E

500|$|The reforms {{enacted by}} Thomas Arnold, famed headmaster, made Rugby the {{crucible}} of muscular Christianity, a [...] "cult of athleticism" [...] into which Wills was inculcated. Wills took up cricket {{within a week}} of entering Evans House. At first he bowled underhand, but it was considered outdated, so he tried roundarm bowling. He clean bowled a batsman with his first ball using this style and declared: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bowler." [...] Wills soon topped all of his house's cricket statistics. At bat he was a [...] "punisher" [...] with a sound defence; however, in an era when stylish stroke-play was expected of a gentleman cricketer, he was said to have no style at all. In April 1852, aged sixteen, Wills joined the Rugby School XI, and on his debut at Lord's a few months later, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he took a match-high 12 wickets. That year his bowling was vital in establishing Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket. In a prelude to his colonial career, critics stated that Wills ought to be no-balled for throwing—an illegal bowling action. Rugby coach John Lillywhite, the umpire who famously no-balled professional Edgar Willsher, defended his protégé. Wills survived the scandal. He played with, and attracted praise from the leading cricketers of the age, including Alfred Mynn. William Clarke, his hero, invited him to join the All-England Eleven in 1854, but he remained at school. The next year, he became Rugby XI captain.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the return}} series in Australia Trott made 19 {{runs in the}} first Test at Brisbane, before {{returning}} home due to a stress related illness. In his autobiography, he cites his increasing struggles facing the short ball as a principal cause of his problems: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being questioned as a man. I felt my dignity was being stripped away with every short ball I ducked or parried. It was degrading." ...|$|E

2500|$|Malone {{was picked}} in that season's Australian squad {{to play the}} West Indies for the third Test at Adelaide, {{replacing}} Terry Alderman, but was 12th man. He was discussed as a possibility for the 1982 tour of New Zealand. He did not tour, and announced his retirement from first class cricket. His final game was a one day match against Victoria where Malone took 3-19 off seven overs. Malone said [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> struggling {{to get into the}} Shield team and I just thought it was time to retire. I have no qualms about my decision and I could not have finished off on a better note by getting a wicket on the last ball I bowled." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{having done}} acting for some years, Chang went into {{directing}} theatre. She made the career change because [...] "it {{was a chance}} to work on projects that resonate deeply and personally and highlighted my world [...] of coming from a divided China that was still in the throes of revolution but steeped in culture and history. As a director, I had more autonomy in choosing projects, and <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> contributing to American theatre with stories drawn from China's vast literary legacy. I had been acting and dancing professionally for 10 years on and off-Broadway, so I had a very good immersion into mainstream theatre. With directing, I can help shape what the audience experiences and walks away with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indian singer Asha Puthli {{recorded}} [...] "I Dig Love", {{creating a}} version that Jon Pareles of The New York Times describes as [...] "a wild, post-psychedelic artifact, complete with sound effects, soul horns and Ms. Puthli alternately breathy and giggling". The recording appeared on her self-titled debut album, released in 1973. Speaking to Pareles in 2006, Puthli {{explained that she}} had viewed Harrison's reading of [...] "I Dig Love" [...] as a [...] "spiritual song", adding: [...] "They did it like a bhajan, an Indian religious song. In 1973, when I did it, I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already Indian, and the spirituality was inside me. I was trying to become Western, so I brought out the material aspect, the sexual aspect." [...] In 2005, Puthli's recording was sampled on the Kano track [...] "Reload It".|$|E
2500|$|Koop {{was active}} in {{publishing}} articles in the medical literature. [...] Koop later wrote that Each day of those early years in pediatric surgery I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the cutting edge. [...] Some of the surgical problems that landed {{on the operating table}} at Children's had not even been named. [...] Many of the operations I performed had never been done before. [...] It was an exuberant feeling, but also a little scary. [...] At times I was troubled by fears that I wasn't doing things the right way, that I would have regrets, or that someone else had performed a certain procedure successfully but had never bothered to write it up for the medical journals, or if they had I couldn't find it. [...] Koop helped rectify this by publishing his own findings and results. [...] Additionally, he became the first editor of the Journal of Pediatric Surgery when it was founded in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|Petrelis {{returned}} to New York City a year later, {{where he was}} one of 111 protesters arrested in a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 11, 1989. The demonstration was among ACT Up's most controversial, but Petrelis almost didn't participate; none of the other activists wanted to include him in their affinity groups for that demonstration because, he recalled, [...] "People <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too angry." [...] Petrelis said he nonetheless felt driven to go and changed his mind. Arriving early before the police had established barricades, Petrelis was able to enter the church, and sit on the aisle {{in the middle of the}} cathedral. As other protesters stage silent die-ins, or calmly read prepared statements, Petrelis stood on the pew and screamed, [...] "O'Connor, you're killing us! You're killing us, just stop it! Just stop it!" [...] Before officers removed him from the cathedral, Petrelis screamed, [...] "We will not be silent. We will fight O'Connor's bigotry." ...|$|E
