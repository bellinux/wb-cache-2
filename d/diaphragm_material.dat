2500|$|A horn {{loudspeaker}} is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a folded horn speaker. The horn serves to improve the coupling efficiency between the speaker driver and the air. The horn {{can be thought of}} as an [...] "acoustic transformer" [...] that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense <b>diaphragm</b> <b>material</b> and the less-dense air.

5000|$|Dome-based {{diaphragms}} {{are similar}} to the 1920s Thuras/Wente patents, and are still in common use today. Phase plugs that interface with dome-type diaphragms include a wide variety: designs with radial slots, designs with concentric annular ring slots, and hybrid designs with a combination of annular and radial slots. Altec engineer Clifford A. Henricksen reported on the differences between radial and [...] "circumferential" [...] types of phase plugs at Audio Engineering Society conventions in 1976 and 1978. The radial design is easier to produce, but it does not differentiate between sound waves from the perimeter of the diaphragm and sound waves from the center. At high frequencies, the diaphragm does not act as a perfect piston; instead, it displays rippling, modal properties related to its stiffness and density. Because of the speed of wave propagation through the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>material,</b> the center of the diaphragm moves slightly later than the perimeter. Radial slots in the phase plug do not correct for this small time difference, which affects the highest frequencies. Concentric circular slots may be able to correct for the diaphragm's rippling behavior but the positioning of the slots is critical. Circular slots may allow resonances to build up between the diaphragm and the phase plug—resonances which cause wave cancellations and a corresponding reduction in frequency response at the resonance frequency.|$|E

The material selection is based on performance metrics estimated using simple closed form solutions for classical linear elastic theory for axisymmetric plates/membranes and lumped heat capacity thermal models. Although the elastic moduli of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>materials</b> dictate the volume expansion for a given temperature rise, their influence on the achievable pressure difference is much less. It is found that engineering polymers are most suitable for thermopneumatically actuated diaphragms for delivering large displacements and work for the achievable pressures at frequencies of a few hundreds of Hertz. The membrane stresses due to in-plane pre-tension are found to have an adverse effect on the actuator performance. The material issues which constrain the performance limits of phase change actuators are also assessed, and the promising characteristics of paraffin waxes for microsystem applications are discussed...|$|R

Each patient underwent an ultrasound-guided RF ablation using inter-nally cooled electrodes for the first-line treatment. We divided patients into two subgroups based on whether the index tumor was abutting (less than 5 mm) the diaphragm or not: group A (abutting; n = 31) versus group B (non-abutting; n = 49). We compared the two subgroups for complications and therapeutic efficacy using image and the review of medical records. The statistical assessment included an independent t-test, Fisher’s exact test, and chi-square test.

The influence of the light diaphragm on test flow generation has long been recognised, however the diaphragm rupture mechanism is less well known. It has been previously postulated that the diaphragm ruptures around its periphery due to the dynamic pressure loading of the shock wave, with the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>material</b> at some stage being removed from the flow to allow the shock to accelerate to the measured speeds downstream. The images obtained in this series of experiments {{are the first to}} show the mechanism of diaphragm rupture and mass removal in an expansion tube.

Average diffusion rates up to 1 ml per day through currently used elastomeric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>materials</b> have been measured during static in-vitro and in-vivo tests.

40|$|Capacitive {{pressure}} sensors {{have lots of}} potential for commercial applications. However, successful commercial exploitation of highly miniaturized capacitive sensors is often inhibited {{by the presence of}} parasitic effects such as environmental noise and parasitic capacitances. Therefore, to alleviate the problems encountered in the capacitive pressure sensor approach, it is important to integrate the sensors and the circuitry as directly as possible. This paper builds on preliminary work reported previously by us [Sens. Actuators A 101 (2002) 231] and focuses on direct integration of read-out circuitry with microfabricated microsensors.

40|$|Results {{of a trade}} {{study for}} the {{development}} of pressure and acoustic sensors for use on the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) are summarized. Pressure sensors are needed to operate to 100 psia; acoustic sensors are needed that can give meaningful information about a 200 dB sound pressure level (SPL) environment. Both sensors will have to operate from a high temperature of 2000 F down to absolute zero. The main conclusions of the study are the following: (1) <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>materials</b> limit minimum size and maximum frequency response attainable. (2) No transduction is available to meet all the NASP requirements with existing technology. (3) Capacitive sensors are large relative to the requirement, have limited resolution and frequency response due to noise, and cable length is limited to approximately 20 feet. (4) Eddy current sensors are large relative to the requirement and have limited cable lengths. (5) Fiber optic sensors provide the possibility for a small sensor, even though present developments do not exhibit that characteristic. The need to use sapphire at high temperature complicates the design. Present high temperature research sensors suffer from poor resolution. A significant development effort will be required to realize the potential of fiber optics. (6) Short-term development seems to favor eddy current techniques with the penalty of larger size and reduced dynamic range for acoustic sensors. (7) Long-term development may favor fiber optics with the penalties of cost, schedule, and uncertainty...|$|R

The whole nucleus was then digested to various degrees with ribonuclease or trypsin, followed by washing and fixation in either osmium tetroxide or potassium permanganate. The nuclear envelope was dissected off, {{placed on a}} grid, air dried, and compared with undigested controls in the electron microscope. Some envelopes were dehydrated, embedded in methacrylate, and sectioned. Annuli around "pores " are composed of a substance or substances, at least partially fibrillar, which is preserved by osmium but lost during permanganate fixation. Material within the "pores " is also preserved by osmium but partially lost after permanganate. No evidence of granules or tubules in the annuli was found in air dried mounts although a granular appearance {{could be seen in}} tangentially oriented thin sections. Thin sections of isolated envelopes give evidence of diffuse material within the "pores " as well as a more condensed diaphragm across their waists. In whole mounts of the envelope the total density within "pores " is relatively constant from "pore " to "pore.
