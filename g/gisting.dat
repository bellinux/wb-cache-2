40|$|This {{thesis is}} about whether imatinib, a {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor, is successful enough {{as a treatment}} for gastro intestinal stromal tumor (<b>GIST)</b> patients. Of all <b>GISTs</b> 70 - 80 % harbor mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, 5 - 8 % in the platelet derived growth factor α tyrosine kinase (PDGFRA) and 12 - 15 % do not harbor any KIT- or PDGFRA mutations (wild-type <b>GISTs).</b> The KIT- or PDGFRA mutations are oncogenic driver mutations, that lead to constant activation of the downstream pathways, which leads to <b>GIST</b> progression.

40|$|Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<b>GISTs)</b> are {{the most}} common mesenchymal tumors in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Approximately 85 % of <b>GISTs</b> harbor activating mutations in the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene and approximately 95 % of <b>GISTs</b> are positive for KIT (CD 117) by immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless, approximately 5 % of <b>GISTs</b> lack KIT expression. Inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA by tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of <b>GISTs</b> and demands accurate tumor classification. DOG 1. 1 is a recently described mouse monoclonal antibody reported to have superior sensitivity and specificity compared with KIT (CD 117) and CD 34. We evaluated this new antibody on a group of 81 <b>GISTs</b> obtained from 74 patients with special regard to KIT-negative <b>GISTs</b> (n= 28), pediatric <b>GISTs</b> (n= 11), and <b>GISTs</b> associated with neurofibromatosis type I (NF 1) (n= 16). Conventional <b>GISTs</b> (n= 26) were also included. All conventional KIT-positive <b>GISTs,</b> all NF 1 -associated <b>GISTs,</b> and 9 / 11 pediatric <b>GISTs</b> expressed DOG 1. 1. DOG 1. 1 was expressed in 10 / 28 (36 %) of KIT-negative tumors. The staining pattern was cytoplasmic and/or membranous. This study demonstrates that DOG 1. 1 is a sensitive immunohistochemical marker for <b>GIST,</b> comparable with KIT, with the additional benefit of detecting 36 % of KIT-negative <b>GISTs.</b> DOG 1. 1 is also a sensitive marker for unusual <b>GIST</b> subgroups lacking KIT or PDGFRA mutations.
