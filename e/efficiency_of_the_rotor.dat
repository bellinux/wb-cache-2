40|$|A {{method for}} {{transonic}} compressor multi-objective design optimization {{was developed and}} applied to the NASA rotor 37, a test case representative of complex three-dimensional viscous flow structures in transonic bladings. The optimization problem considered was to maximize the isentropic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> and to maximize its pressure ratio at the design point, using a constraint on the mass flow rate.

40|$|Wind {{power is}} {{currently}} responsible for about 1 : 5 % of the world’s electricity use. Because of this high interest in wind energy, {{it becomes more}} and more important to increase the efficiency of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) Such a system consists of a rotor to capture the energy in the wind, a gearbox configuration to speed up the rotational speed of the shaft and a generator to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy. Blade pitch control is used to control the aerodynamic power captured from the wind. By pitching the rotor blades along their longitudinal axis, the aerodynamic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> is changed. A disadvantage of using blade pitching below rated speed is that less energy is extracted from the wind, decreasing the efficiency of WECS. Power electronics widely used in the wind turbine industry to improve the performance of wind turbines. The biggest disadvantage of power electronics is reliability. Mechanical components show wear & tear and therefore any failures in these components can be predicted, maintenance can be scheduled before failure occurs. Unfortunately power electronics do not show signs of degrading, therefore failures cannot be predicted and these sudden failures are very expensive to repair...|$|E

40|$|Brake disc cooling is an {{important}} area of research for high-performance brake disc manufacturers, users as well as academia. In high-demand braking applications, vented discs are increasingly being used as these are considered to have high heat-dissipating characteristics. The cooling efficiency of ventilated brakes depend on three key characteristics: the mass flowrate through the disc, i. e. the pumping <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor,</b> the average heat transfer coefficient {{on the surface of}} the disc, and the wetted area of the rotor. Recent research has shown that the pin-vented discs have high heat transfer rates because of an increase in turbulence which results in a higher heat transfer coefficient. The pin-vented discs also have a higher resistance to thermal deformation owing to the more even distribution of material, resulting in lower thermal stress build-up within the rotor. The pin-vented discs in general have multiple rows of pins. In this paper an optimal configuration of various rows has been found for the maximum heat transfer rate. It has also been found that the ratio of wetted area of the disc to the frontal area of pins defines the heat transfer rate from the disc uniquely and can be used as a design parameter for the optimal design of a brake dis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define an optimal {{pitching}} profile for the blades of a cycloidal rotor which minimizes the mean power consumption for a given mean thrust of the rotor. Design/methodology/approach: A simple analytical model of the kinematics and aerodynamics of a cycloidal rotor is defined first to obtain expressions for thrust and power depending on the pitching profile and geometrical parameters of the rotor. Then, Lagrange optimization is applied to obtain the optimal pitching schedule under hovering conditions. Finally, results of the theoretical analysis are compared with those of a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Findings: Results of the optimization suggest that the optimal profile is a combination of sinusoidal functions. It is shown that the adoption of the optimal pitching schedule could improve the power <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> by approximately 25 per cent. Practical implications: The possibility to increase the efficiency of a cycloidal rotor by acting on its pitching schedule could be a significant factor of success for this alternative propulsion concept. Originality/value: The present work represents the first attempt at a definition of an optimal pitching profile for a cycloidal rotor. Moreover, although being carried out on the basis of simplified analytical considerations, the present investigation sets a methodological framework which could be successfully applied to the design of similar kinds of systems...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in many cases that a notable {{aerodynamic}} stability enhancement can be achieved using circumferential grooves on transonic compressors. This advantage, however, often involves degradation in efficiency at design point conditions. In order to analyze the correlations between efficiency, surge margin and other flow quantities {{on the one hand and}} the geometric parameters related to circumferential grooves on the other, an automated multi objective geometry optimization of circumferential grooves for a transonic compressor has been performed. For the surge point determination an iterative approach was used to change the static back pressure until the numerical surge limit was determined with a sufficiently small uncertainty. As a result of the optimization two different types of grooves have been identified. The first type is comparatively small and located only little downstream the leading edge of the rotor. It is capable of increasing the surge margin, while only slightly decreasing efficiency. The second groove type is located more towards the trailing edge and significantly bigger in cross sectional size. It can improve the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor,</b> but at the same time blockage is generated. Combining the two groove types, also the effects combine, resulting in an increased surge margin and increased efficiency. Applying more than one groove of type one further increases the surge margin compared to a single groove, however the gain is limited. Important groove parameters of optimized grooves are further studied, regarding their sensitivity. The working principles and flow phenomena of the grooves increasing the surge margin are analyzed in detail...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} the aerodynamics of the straight-bladed VAWTs was performed by RNG k − ε and S-A turbulence models. Three different rotor types with NACA 0022, NACA 0018, and S 1223 blade profiles were studied. The main objective was to numerically analyze the torque and the highly unsteady wake dynamics of the VAWTs by RANS turbulence models. The effect of increasing the blockage of the free-stream wind by the rotor on the generated torque, the influence of different turbulence models on the results, {{and the performance of}} the downwind rotor in a row of two VAWTs were analyzed as well. The results indicate that the ducted VAWTs are more efficient than the regular VAWTs. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> is overestimated by the 2 -D geometry. This is mainly related to the negative influence of the tip vortices on the torque. The velocity magnitude in the wake recovers 50 % of its inlet value within 2 D downstream distance. In a row of 2 VAWTs, due to the disturbances in the flow generated by a turbine placed 15 D upwind, the efficiency of the downstream VAWT varies in each revolution of the rotor. Comparison between the values of torque obtained by the RNG k − ε and S-A turbulence models reveals that the RNG k − ε model reports higher values of torque. In a direct relation, the values of torque obtained by the second-order-accurate solver are generally higher than those given by the first-order solvers. It can be argued that although the RANS turbulence models overestimate the efficiency, they can be appropriately used as CFD design tools...|$|E

Limited resources are available on land; however, large amount of ocean energy is available and can be exploited for power generation. PICs have more sea-area than land-area. Tidal current energy is very predictable and large amount of tidal current energy can be extracted using tidal current energy converters. A 10 m diameter, 3 -bladed horizontal axis tidal current turbine (HATCT) is designed in this work. Hydrofoils were designed for different blade location; they are named as HF 10 XX. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the hydrofoils were analyzed. A thick hydrofoil with a maximum thickness of 24 % and a maximum camber of 10 % was designed for the root region. The maximum thickness of hydrofoils was varied linearly from the root to the tip for easier surface merging. For the tip region, a thinner hydrofoil of maximum thickness 16 % and maximum chamber 10 % was designed.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{studying}} possible requirements for high-speed rotorcraft and studying many high-speed concepts, a new high-speed rotorcraft concept, designated as M- 85, was derived. The M- 85 is a helicopter that is reconfigured to a fixed-wing aircraft for high-speed cruise. The concept was derived as an approach to enable smooth, stable conversion between fixed-wing and rotary-wing while retaining hover and low-speed flight characteristics of a low disk loading helicopter. The name, M- 85, reflects the high-speed goals of 0. 85 Mach number at high altitude. For a high-speed rotorcraft, {{it is expected that}} a viable concept must be a cruise-efficient, fixed-wing aircraft so it may be attractive for a multiplicity of missions. It is also expected that a viable high-speed rotorcraft concept must be cruise efficient first and secondly, efficient in hover. What makes the M- 85 unique is the large circular hub fairing that is large enough to support the aircraft during conversion between rotary-wind and fixed-wing modes. With the aircraft supported by this hub fairing, the rotor blades can be unloaded during the 100 percent change in rotor rpm. With the blades unloaded, the potential for vibratory loads would be lessened. In cruise, the large circular hub fairing would be part of the lifting system with additional lifting panels deployed for better cruise efficiency. In hover, the circular hub fairing would slightly reduce lift potential and/or decrease hover <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> system. The M- 85 concept is described and estimated forward flight performance characteristics are presented in terms of thrust requirements and L/D with airspeed. The forward flight performance characteristics reflect recent completed wind tunnel tests of the wing concept. Also presented is a control system technique that is critical to achieving low oscillatory loads in rotary-wing mode. Hover characteristics, C(sub p) versus C(sub T) from test data, is discussed. Other techniques pertinent to the M- 85 concept such as passively controlling inplane vibration during starting and stopping of the rotor system, aircraft control system, and rotor drive technologies are discussed...|$|E

They burn fuel for electricity and daily lighting. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to look for alternative energy sources. Wind turbine technology has developed over the past years and is suitable for generating electricity by tapping wind energy. However, turbines designed to operate at higher wind speed do not perform well in Fiji, because Fiji’s average wind velocity is around 5 - 6 m/s. A 10 m, 3 -bladed horizontal axis wind turbine is designed to operate at low wind speed, cut in speed of 3 m/s, cut off speed of 10 m/s and rated wind speed of 6 m/s. The blade sections were designed for different locations along the blade. The airfoil at the tip (AF 0914) a has maximum thickness of 14 % and maximum camber of 9 %; the thickness varies linearly to the root, at the root the airfoil (AF 0920) has a maximum thickness of 20 % and maximum camber of 9 %. The aerodynamic characteristics of airfoil AF 0914 were obtained using Xfoil and were validated by experimentation, at turbulence intensities (Tu) of 1 % and 3 %, and a Reynolds number (Re) of 200, 000.

Data are presented for blade tip Mach numbers M(t) of 0. 29 to 0. 74 with corresponding values 6 6 of tip Reynolds number of 2. 59 x 10 (exp 6) and 6. 58 x 10 (exp 6). Comparisons are made between the data from the present rotor with results previously obtained from two other rotors: one having NACA 0012 airfoil sections and the other having an NACA 0009 airfoil tip section. At low tip Mach numbers, the maximum mean lift coefficient for the blade having the NACA 64 (1) AO 12 section was about 0. 08 less than that obtained with the blade having the NACA 0009 tip section and 0. 21 less than the value obtained with the blade having the NACA 0012 tip section. Blade maximum mean lift coefficient values were not obtained for Mach number values greater than 0. 47 because of a blade failure encountered during the tests. The effective mean lift-curve slope required for predicting rotor thrust varied from 5. 8 for the tip Mach nuniber range of 0. 29 to 0. 55 to a value of 6. 65 for a tip Mach number of 0. 71. The blade pitching-moment coefficients were small and relatively unaffected by changes in thrust coefficient and Mach number. In the instances in which stall was reached, the break in the blade pitching-moment curve was in a stable direction. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> decreased with an increase in tip speed. Expressed as figure of merit, at a tip Mach number of 0. 29 the maximum value was about 0. 74.

Synthesized section lift and profile-drag characteristics for the rotor-blade airfoil section are presented as an aid in predicting the high-tip-speed performance of rotors having similar airfoils...|$|E
40|$|Micro {{turbines}} are touted {{to become}} the prime system for the combined heat and power(CHP) applications {{in light of their}} significant advantages in terms of performance, size, costs and reduced CO 2 emissions [1]. Micro Turbine Technology B. V. (MTT) is currently developing a 3 KW recuperated micro turbine for such applications. Commercially available off the shelf turbocharger components are used since they provide high performance with relatively low costs since they are mass produced. The drawback in using these components is that they are manufactured for the automotive sector and inherently operate at different conditions than the MTT operating point. Here in lies an interesting scope for performance improvement by optimizing the turbine and within the current work the focus is on aerodynamic optimization of the radial inflow turbine used in the MTT system. This study is a follow-up from the recommendations provided in [2] and [3]. A goal driven optimization is performed on the rotor geometry using ANSYS DesignXplorer and a total of four design solutions were obtained. The most important findings from the response surfaces, sensitivity analysis from the optimization were: 9 ̆ 5 From the parametric sensitivity it was clear that all of the six design variables {{have a significant impact on}} efficiency. The exducer angles have the most predominant effect on efficiency with that of shroud larger than hub. 9 ̆ 5 All of the optimal candidates exhibited an increase in the total-to-total efficiency ranging from a minimum of 6. 38 percentage points to a maximum of 7. 90 percentage points as compared to the baseline geometry. This efficiency improvement was accompanied by an increase in mass flow rate with a minimum value of 69. 15 g/s and a maximum of 73. 51 g/s. These design solutions are then coupled with the diffuser domain to study the performance characteristics and the interaction between the components. The most important outcomes from these simulations were: The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> drops by 3 percentage points on an average due to the additional pressure losses introduced when coupled with the diffuser. 9 ̆ 5 The diffuser performance has improved and the Cp experiences a maximum increase of 17. 63 percentage points (Candidate D) and a minimum of 12. 70 percentage points (Candidate B). The swirl coefficient for optimum diffuser performance is found at values close to 0. 22. If the swirl coefficient is increased or decreased from this optimum, diffuser performance drops. The best design solution in terms of rotor efficiency and overall total-to-static efficiency is Candidate C. However it exhibits a poorer diffuser performance than the other optimal candidates. From this study, it is apparent that there is compromise between rotor and diffuser performance. 9 ̆ 5 The improvement in rotor efficiency(<tt, 5 ax) ranges from a minimum of 6. 16 (Candidate A) percentage points to a maximum of 8. 54 percentage points (Candidate C) as compared to the baseline which is more or less similar to the case with the individual rotor domain simulations. The improvement in total-to-static efficiency (<ts, 9) achieves only a maximum of 3. 23 percentage points(Candidate C) as compared to the baseline. In other words,whatever is gained in rotor total-to-total efficiency from the design optimization, less than half of it is utilized when coupled with the diffuser(Cp< 50...|$|E

Later aircraft feature automatic stabilisation equipment; functions such as auto-hover are optionally installed on some Lynx.|$|R

This study {{was done to}} investigate the design and development of a micro Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) -Savonius Type. In regions where wind speed is limited Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) {{do not have a}} practical application due to high wind speed requirement. VAWT provide operational abilities at lower speeds and do not require an alignment mechanism. Through an exhaustive bibliographical research, it is possible to identify the influence parameters, and to show that <b>the</b> aerodynamic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Savonius <b>rotor</b> can be notably improved via a judicious choice of its geometrical parameters.

40|$|A new forward-swept rotor {{designed}} by Allison Engine Company was tested in NASA Lewis Research Center's CE- 18 facility. This testing was a follow-on project sponsored by NASA Lewis to study range enhancements in small turbomachinery. The test was conducted against a baseline rotor design {{that was also}} tested in CE- 18. The design point for <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> was a rotor pressure ratio of 2. 69, a mass flow of 10. 52 lbm/sec, and an adiabatic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> 89. 1 percent. Test data indicate that <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> met <b>the</b> pressure ratio <b>of</b> 2. 69 with a 10. 77 lbm/sec flow rate, a 87. 5 -percent adiabatic efficiency, and a 19. 5 -percent stall margin. <b>The</b> baseline <b>rotor</b> achieved a pressure ratio of 2. 69 at a 10. 77 lbm/sec flow rate with a stall margin of only 9. 2 percent and an adiabatic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> 87. 0 percent. The major differences are the significant stall margin increase and the substantially higher off-design peak <b>efficiencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward-swept <b>rotor.</b> <b>The</b> substantially higher performance over <b>the</b> baseline <b>rotor</b> design makes <b>the</b> new design a viable technology candidate for future products...|$|R

40|$|Aspiration in an axial {{compressor}} is normally regarded as sucking out the low momentum boundary layer from blade suction surface, thus lowering <b>the</b> chances <b>of</b> flow separation and consequently that of stall under off-design operation. However, the suction mass flow {{does not take}} part in useful work and leads to loss of engine power output. This paper deals with a new concept of natural aspiration to energize blade suction surface boundary layer by injecting some fluid from pressure to suction side through a part span slot on the blade. The energized boundary layer has lesser tendency to separate, thus enhancing stall margin. Numerical simulations were carried out to study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> aspiration slot location and geometry on the performance and stall margin of a transonic {{axial compressor}} <b>rotor.</b> <b>The</b> computational results without aspiration slot were in fair agreement with the published experimental data. <b>The</b> modified <b>rotor,</b> with part span aspiration, showed ~ 3. 2 % improvement in stall margin at design rotational speed. The pressure ratio and <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspirated <b>rotor</b> dropped by ~ 1. 42 % and ~ 2. 0 %, respectively, whereas the structural analysis did not indicate any adverse effect on the blade stress distribution in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> aspiration slot...|$|R
40|$|A passive twist {{control is}} {{proposed}} as an adaptive way to maximize <b>the</b> overall <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small-scale <b>rotor</b> blade for multifunctional aircrafts. Incorporated into {{a database of}} airfoil characteristics, Blade Element Momentum Theory is implemented to obtain the blade optimum twist rates for hover and forward flight. In order to realize <b>the</b> required torsion <b>of</b> blade between hover and forward flight, glass/epoxy laminate blade is proposed based on Centrifugal Force Induced Twist concept. Tip mass is used to improve the nose-down torsion and <b>the</b> stabilization <b>of</b> rotating flexible blade. The laminate blades are tested in hover and forward flight modes, with deformations measured by Laser Displacement Sensor. Two Laser Displacement Sensors are driven by the tracking systems to scan the rotating blade from root to tip. The distance from blade surface to a reference plane can be recorded section by section. Then, a polynomial surface fitting is applied to reconstruct <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> rotating blade, including <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> measurement precision based on the Kline–McClintock method. The results from deformation testings show that nose-down torsion is generated in each flight mode. The data from a Fluid Structure Interaction model agrees well with experimental results at an acceptable level in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trend predictions...|$|R
40|$|Oil-gas {{separation}} {{is a key}} process in an aero-engine lubrication system. This study reports an innovative development in oil-gas separation. A honeycomb-structured rotor with hexagonal cone-shaped pore channels has been designed, additively manufactured from Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using selective electron beam melting (SEBM) and assessed for oil-gas separation for aero-engine application. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V honeycomb structure showed a high compressive strength of 110 MPa compared to less than 20 MPa for metal foam structures. <b>The</b> oil-gas separation <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> honeycomb-structured separation <b>rotor</b> achieved 99. 8 % at <b>the</b> rotation speed <b>of</b> 6000 rpm with much lower ventilation resistance (17. 3 kPa) than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separator <b>rotor</b> constructed using a Ni-Cr alloy foam structure (23. 5 kPa). The honeycomb-structured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V separator rotor produced by SEBM provides a promising solution to more efficient oil-gas separation in the aero-engine lubrication system...|$|R
40|$|Component {{performance}} and seasonal operational experiences have been analysed for desiccant cooling systems powered by solar air collectors. Measurements during the commissioning phase in Spain (public library) and in Germany (production hall) showed that <b>the</b> dehumidification <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sorption <b>rotors</b> was 80 % and <b>the</b> humidification <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact evaporators was 85 - 86 %. Only in a two-stage desiccant system monitored in China (laboratory building), a dehumidification <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> 88 % was reached. The rotary heat exchangers only had 62 - 68 % measured heat recovery efficiency, which {{is lower than}} specified. Seasonal performance monitoring {{carried out in the}} German installation showed that average seasonal COP's were close to 1. 0, when related to all operation hours. COP's increase if low regeneration temperatures are used with low dehumidification rates, which is often sufficient for moderate German climatic conditions, but much less so in the humid Chinese climate. Electrical COP's for the German system including air distribution were between 1. 7 and 4. 6 and reach values of 7. 4, when only additional pressure drops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desiccant unit are considered. It could be shown that conventional control strategies lead to high auxiliary energy consumption, for example if fixed heating setpoint temperatures are used. Furthermore the solar air collector energy yield was very low in the German system, as regeneration was only used when all other options such as humidification at high air volume flows did not reduce the room air temperature enough. The studies showed that the measured auxiliary energy consumption could be reduced to near zero, if regeneration temperature setpoints were not fixed to constant values. The solar air collector efficiency was good at about 50 % both for the flat plate collectors used in Spain and Germany and the Chinese vacuum tube solution. A cost analysis demonstrated <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept, if some funding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high investment costs is provided.
