5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} <b>head.</b> <b>Each</b> otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|In {{those areas}} which the Red Army had {{captured}} {{and before the}} fighting in {{the centre of the}} city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport {{in and out of the}} city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to <b>head</b> <b>each</b> city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen.|$|E
5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route {{from a particular}} coral <b>head.</b> <b>Each</b> shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and {{are unlikely to be}} stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.|$|E

25|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is highly}} {{responsive}} to olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey. Its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency {{sounds in the}} 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish. They hunt primarily at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, a group of sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route from a particular coral <b>head.</b> <b>Each</b> shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. They feed mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes, and goatfishes, as well as octopus, spiny lobsters, and crabs. Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks.|$|E
25|$|The bluegrey carpetshark has a stout {{body with}} a long, {{slightly}} flattened head. The snout is blunt and looks wedge-shaped from the side. The large eyes are horizontally oval and placed high on the <b>head,</b> <b>each</b> with a strong ridge underneath and a large, round spiracles following immediately behind and below. The nostrils are preceded {{by a pair of}} long barbels, which have an enlarged posterior flap halfway along their lengths. There are well-developed skin flaps and grooves around the incurrent nostril opening, as well as a pair of grooves connecting them to the small, almost transverse mouth. The tooth rows number 3234 in the upper jaw and 2129 in the lower jaw; each tooth has an upright, awl-like central cusp and two lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the fourth and fifth pairs more closely spaced than the others.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} also nominally appoints, upon {{recommendation of the}} prime minister, the individual ministers to <b>head</b> <b>each</b> of the government departments. The cabinet is selected from {{among the members of}} the House of Representatives. The Constitution provides for general elections to be held at least every five years. Candidates are elected by the Single Transferable Vote system. The entire territory is divided into thirteen electoral districts each returning five MPs to a total of 65. Since 1987, in case a Party obtains an absolute majority of votes without achieving a Parliamentary majority a mechanism in the Constitution provides for additional seats to that Party to achieve a Parliamentary majority (Act IV of 1987). To date this mechanism, intended to counteract gerrymandering, came into effect twice: for the Sixth and the Eighth Parliaments. A similar mechanism was introduced in 1996 so that additional seats would be given to that Party obtaining a relative majority of votes but not a parliamentary majority with only two parties achieving Parliamentary representation. This mechanism was first applied in the 2008 general election.|$|E

500|$|The SSEM's 32-bit {{word length}} was {{increased}} to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit words– known as pages– backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store. The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write <b>head.</b> <b>Each</b> track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2×32×40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as Manchester coding.|$|E
500|$|Banksia ilicifolia has a stout trunk up to [...] in diameter, and rough, fibrous, grey bark {{which is}} up to [...] thick. New growth takes place mainly in summer. Young branchlets are covered in hair which they lose {{after two or three}} years. Leaves grow on stems less than two years of age, and are {{arranged}} in a scattered pattern along the stems although crowded at the apices (branchlet tips). Resembling those of holly, its leaves are a dark shiny green colour, and variously [...] (egg-shaped), elliptic, [...] or [...] (wavy) in shape, and [...] long. Generally serrated, the leaf edges have up to 14 prickly [...] "teeth" [...] separated by broad v- to u-shaped sinuses along each side, although some leaves have margins lacking teeth. The leaves sit atop petioles [...] in length. The upper and undersurface of the leaves are initially covered in fine hairs but become smooth with maturity. Flowering takes place from late winter to early summer. The inflorescences are dome-shaped flower heads rather than spikes as many other banksias, and arise from stems that are around a year old. No lateral branchlets grow outwards from the node where the flower head arises. The flower heads measure [...] in diameter, and bear 60 to 100 individual flowers. The inflorescences pass through three colour phases, being initially yellow, then pink, then finally red, before falling away from the head. One to three follicles develop from fertilised flowers, and remain embedded in the woody base of the flower <b>head.</b> <b>Each</b> follicle bears one or two seeds.|$|E

2500|$|The nritta [...] {{performance}} {{starts off}} with a thàth sequence, which is a slower graceful movement of wrists, neck and eyebrows. Thereafter, the dancer gradually increases speed and energy, while completing a sequence of bol (mnemonic syllables in Indian tradition). Each bol has short sections, similar to technical exercises in western dance traditions, wherein the dancer engages the audience with tora, tukra, parhant, paran and others stressing footwork, gestures and turns. Each section when completed has a punctuation mark, usually a sharp turn of the <b>head.</b> <b>Each</b> ankle is adorned with small bells (ghungroo), which may have just one bell or hundreds. The dancer's rapid movements and footwork in a nritta is perfectly timed to the musical beats (tala) and tempos, and the footwork sequences are called tatkars.|$|E
2500|$|Producers later made {{a series}} of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they {{introduced}} a new hairstyle, which has been described as an [...] "enormous bouffant hair-do". Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an Inside Soap reporter that [...] "as soon as I got this big hair, I felt the character get bigger. She strutted about more, and it brought a bit of comedy to her." [...] The actress has admitted that it took time for her make-up team to perfect Grace's look. She was unhappy with Grace's shot in the Hollyoaks opening title sequence because the hair was not big enough. But over time she began to leave the make-up department with almost square hair as it grew. Wall is supplied with an additional hair piece which is applied to her <b>head</b> <b>each</b> morning. It takes the make-up department two hours daily to wash, dress and curl it and an additional forty minutes to style it onto Wall's head. Grace's hair is very big and is often seen with differing styles, but always with plenty of volume in the roots to achieve her signature look. The hair style became known as [...] "Beryl Bouffant" [...] on the Hollyoaks set. The hair got so big that directors would sometimes complain that it was blocking views of other characters during filming.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for Nils Ericsons sluss ("Lock of Nils Ericson") he made detailed studies and minute calculations in 1845–1846. He concluded there were insufficient stonemasons in the Stockholm area, and therefore had limestone and granite {{brought in from}} other parts of Sweden, quarries Ericson knew well from his earlier projects. He constructed a circular saw turned inwards to cut the <b>head</b> <b>each</b> stock at equal level for the bottom of the caisson, an instrument which was, like virtually all heavy tasks during the project, hand operated by several men. [...] Empty barrels were used as rafts. Ericson gave directions for all sorts of tasks, including dredging, securing the rabbeting of planks, earth fillings, and determining the inclination of the caisson walls {{in order for them to}} withstand the pressure from the levees. [...] He had to use an expensive steam dredger, but could avoid a machine for the drainage which saved a lot of money. He also made great efforts to make the extensive piling for the foundation more efficient; the drop forge of the pile driver should hit the pile with a constant effect, why Ericson had the labourers lower the device as the pile sunk. The timbered caisson was built as a huge box on Djurgården, just north-east of the bridge Lilla Sjötullsbron, slightly more than 79 meters long, 16,5 meters wide and 6,2 meters high (266½×56×21 feet), subsequently towed into place before the ends were removed. [...] The temporary drydock on Djurgården is still discernible as a depression in the landscape. The construction work on the caisson began in May 1847 with the construction of barracks for 60 men and a smithy. [...] In the drydock keel blocks [...] tall were then placed and the bottom of the caisson was built upon them [...] a bed consisting of [...] deal, [...] beams, and 1inches of boards. The caisson was completed in August, water was let in and the building berth and the barrage were removed. [...] The floating was done in two hours 2-4 a.m., and its dimensions produced enthusiastic comparisons: [...] "larger than the Stockholm Cathedral!", [...] "...could house the entire Swedish Army and its paraphernalia." ...|$|E
