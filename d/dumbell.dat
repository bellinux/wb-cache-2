50|$|One {{incident}} {{at the time}} which indicated there was a degree of mistrust in <b>Dumbell's</b> Bank centered around a transaction involving Douglas Town Commissioners. The Town Commissioners had bought a water supply from a local businessman, Henry Noble, the consideration being £147,247; however Noble refused to accept a cheque drawn on the bank and insisted on payment in cash. There may however be another dimension to this as Henry Noble was {{a founder of the}} rival Isle of Man Bank.However suspicions of <b>Dumbell's</b> Bank existed in other financial circles. <b>Dumbell's</b> Bank had been instrumental in financing the Douglas & Laxey Electric Tramway Company Ltd and it became a constant drain on the bank.|$|R

5000|$|In 1862 Dumbell's Bank {{secured the}} account of the Great Laxey Mining Company.

50|$|In 1884 <b>Dumbell</b> was {{included}} in the first New Zealand team, which toured New South Wales and played five matches. His first match came before they left for Australia, when they played a Wellington XV. <b>Dumbell</b> played at halfback in this match that they won 9-0. On 28 May they played against Cumberland County in Sydney. <b>Dumbell</b> played on the wing as they eased to a convincing 33-0 victory. The next match again in Sydney saw them up against Combined Suburbs XV, with <b>Dumbell</b> again on the wing. He landed a conversion to give him his first points for the All Blacks and help them to a 23-5 win. The next venue was the Newcastle Sports Ground where they played the Northern Districts. With poor weather conditions the New Zealand team battled on securing the game 29-0. The last game of the tour was against Western Districts in Bathurst. This was one of the tougher matches of the tour and at halftime it was only 4-0. They eventually won the match 11-0. <b>Dumbell</b> had ended up with nine points for the tour, scoring a try and a drop goal in the last match.|$|E

5000|$|In 1853 George <b>Dumbell,</b> a local {{advocate}} and Member of the House of Keys, established a private bank; the Douglas and Isle of Man Bank a trading name of <b>Dumbell,</b> Son & Howard, with its branch situated in St. George's Street, Douglas. Following this branches were opened in Ramsey and Castletown. However in August 1857, {{only four years}} after the commencement of business a notice was posted by Dumbell's advising: [...] "The Bank is compelled to suspend business for the present.

50|$|Another {{consequence}} of the bank's failure {{was the fact that}} those in business who had incurred liabilities with <b>Dumbell's</b> were unable to arrange with other financial institutions to take over their liability to <b>Dumbell's,</b> and this led to a series of failures with a further knock-on effect and the closing of the bank resulted in a long list of bankruptcies. There were similar scenes outside the branch offices. In Ramsey a further bank run resulted in a big rush of people coming in from the surrounding countryside. Over 200 shareholders attended an extraordinary general meeting of <b>Dumbell's</b> on February 12. One director sharply criticised the general manager and manager, with other shareholders in turn criticising the directors, accusing them of profligacy and a reckless lending policy which had contributed immensely to the bank's demise. Accusations and counter-accusations were in turn levelled at the bank's directors. Alexander Bruce, the principal manager, wrote from his sick bed to deny a statement from the Chairman that the balance sheet had been drawn up irregularly. Another manager, John Shimmon, wrote to refute an allegation that there was an undisclosed liability to the Tramway Company in the sum of £65,000 (this liability would later be proven during the liquidation). In April 1900 there was a creditor's petition to the Chancery Court for the winding up of the company.Dumbell's premises and goodwill were acquired by Parr's Bank for £40,300.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his legal activities, <b>Dumbell</b> {{was instrumental in the}} development of the mining industry on the Isle of Man.
