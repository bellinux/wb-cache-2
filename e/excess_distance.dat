40|$|A {{prototype}} Vessel Performance Monitoring and Analysis System (VPMAS) was deployed on a ferry {{to acquire}} needed performance data, {{to help improve}} vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption. A paper published in 2014 described preliminary data trends observed, key performance indicators computed, data products explored and exploratory tools developed for crews to gain insight into their vessel operation. The current paper describes further analysis of the operational data for speed optimization in calm sea states and the preliminary development of trim optimization software. It was found that trip durations around 7 hours (13. 3 knots) use {{the least amount of}} fuel. The least amount of fuel is used when the <b>excess</b> <b>distance</b> travelled is minimized and the voyage time is optimized. There is a lot of leeway in terms of voyage time and <b>excess</b> <b>distance</b> travel by the ship before there is a heavy penalty on fuel consumption. Considering only a mean draft of 6 m and an average speed of 14 knots in the current paper, the optimal trim condition for the ferry is around - 0. 6 m (bow down), which reduces the resistance by 15 % compared to the even keel condition. Positive trim causes the considerable increase of the total resistance consistently. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

Based on a larger set of variables, this study re-estimates the distance threshold, and tests alternative specifications and distribution assumptions over the period 2000 - 05. Complementing the analysis, ordered probit regressions help examine the cross-commune allocation of hospitals with varying complexity of medical services. Thirdly, <b>excess</b> <b>distance</b> estimates are used with other covariates in tobit models of health sector infrastructure investments.

40|$|Although family {{migration}} {{is a well}} examined topic, the migration that {{takes place at the}} start of co-residence of couples is so far hardly studied. This study examines gender differences in who moves to whom and who moves the longer distance when couples start a co-residential union. Analyses are performed based on Swedish register data, 1991 - 2008, including detailed longitudinal information on the residence of all couples in Sweden who married or had a child as cohabitants in 2008. The study reveals that even after adjusting for gender differences in age, local-, family-, and labor market ties, education, occupation, and economic bargaining power, it is more common for the woman to move to the man than vice versa, and the woman is on average moving longer distances than the man. Gender differences are especially pronounced when partners live far apart prior to union formation. Among these couples the woman on average moves 40 kilometers longer than the man. The proposed intervening factors explain half of this <b>excess</b> <b>distance.</b> Men’s likelihood to move and their distance moved is more affected by labor market ties than women’s, indicating that traditional gender ideologies matter for understanding migration patterns at the start of co-residence...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} old open {{clusters}} such as IC 4651 has brought into {{evidence that the}} age assigned to these clusters heavily depends {{on the type of}} stellar models in use, that is, standard models or models {{with a certain amount of}} convective overshoot from the core. While standard models lead to age estimates that reasonably agree among the various sources provided that the same physical assumptions (chemical composition, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, etc.) are adopted, models with convective overshoot give ages that are largely discrepant even if the same input physics is used (the efficiency of core overshoot in particular). This topic has been addressed by Nordstrom & Andersen analyzing the color-magnitude diagram of IC 4651 by Anthony-Twarog et al. They pointed out that the age given by Mazzei & Pigatto based on the overshoot models by Bertelli et al. is about a factor of 3 lower than the value estimated by Maeder and by Maeder & Meynet. Current stellar models indicate that the age of this cluster lies in the range 1. 3 x 10 (9) to 4 x 10 (9) yr, and that the turnoff mass falls in the range 1. 5 - 1. 7 M., depending on the adopted color <b>excess,</b> <b>distance</b> modulus, and type of models (classical versus overshoot). In this paper first we show that a fundamental inconsistency affects the models with core overshoot and corresponding isochrones calculated by Maeder & Meynet, and second we re-derive the color <b>excess,</b> <b>distance</b> modulus, and age of IC 4651 with the aid of new models for both the classical and the overshoot mixing scheme. Specifically, we find that the core H-burning lifetime of the stars in this mass range published by Maeder & Meynet exceeds the maximum nuclear lifetime allowed by the structure of their own models. The maximumm lifetime is simply given by the ratio of the energy liberated by the available fuel to the minimum luminosity of the stars in this phase. This inconsistency does not occur during the central H-burning phase of stars of higher mass, whereas it is likely present during the core He-burning phase of stars of any mass. The reason of this is not understood. The study of the color-magnitude diagram of IC 4651 with the aid of the new model calculations for both standard and overshoot models by Fagotto and Alongi et al., respectively, leads to the following results. With the standard models, we get a color excess E(B-V) = 0. 16, a distance modulus (m - M) 0 = 9. 6, and an age of 1. 4 x 10 (9) yr. With the overshoot models, we obtain a color excess E(B-V) = 0. 14, a distance modulus (m - M) 0 = 9. 5, and an age of 2. 0 x 10 (9) yr.

The mean photometric uncertainties are better than 0. 02 mag in the V magnitude and B-V, V-R, and V-I colour indices to about 0. 03 mag for U-B among stars brighter than magnitude V= 18. Cluster member stars were separated from the field stars using the Galaxia model of Sharma et al. (2011) together with other techniques.

The linear structure of road networks is especially sensitive to natural hazards. In southern Norway, steep topography and extreme weather events promote frequent traffic disruption caused by debris flows. Topographic susceptibility and trigger frequency maps serve as input into a hazard appraisal at the scale of first-order catchments to quantify the impact of debris flows on the road network in terms of a failure likelihood of each link connecting two network vertices, e. g. road junctions. We compute total additional traffic loads as a function of traffic volume and <b>excess</b> <b>distance,</b> i. e. the extra length of an alternative path connecting two previously disrupted network vertices using a shortest-path algorithm.

The scenarios indicate that major routes crossing the central and north-western part of the study area are associated with high link-failure risk.

5000|$|In 1976, Yost set 13 {{aviation}} world’s {{records for}} distance traveled {{and amount of}} time aloft {{in his attempt to}} cross the Atlantic Ocean —solo— by balloon. He designed and built his balloon, the “Silver Fox," [...] himself, partly in his home garage. It featured a gondola that was shaped like a boat in the event that he would be forced down at sea — which is precisely what occurred. Although he had traveled far in <b>excess</b> of the <b>distance</b> needed to reach Europe from his launch point off the coast of Maine, his flight path began to point South rather than the hoped-for East direction due to inaccurate weather forecasting. The dream was achieved two years later with Yost’s assistance in a Yost-built balloon, Double Eagle II.|$|R

Based on proper motions and BV and JHKs 2 MASS photometric data, we select additional 36 stars as probable cluster members. Some stars in vdB 130 are classified as B stars. Our estimates of minimum colour <b>excess,</b> apparent <b>distance</b> modulus and the distance are consistent with young age (from 5 to 10 Myrs) of the cluster vdB 130. We suppose the large deviations from the conventional extinction law in the cluster direction, with $R_V$ ~ 4 - 5. The cluster vdB 130 appears to be physically related to the supershell around Cyg OB 1, a cometary CO cloud, ionized gas, and regions of infrared emission. There are a few regions of bright mid-infrared emission in the vicinity of vdB 130. The largest of them is also visible on H-alpha and [SII] emission maps. We suggest that the infrared blobs that coincide in projection with the head of the molecular cloud are HII regions, excited by the cluster B-stars. Some signatures of a shock front are identified between these IR-bright regions. Comment: 17 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables. Accepted by MNRA...|$|R
40|$|A tax on fuel {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{mechanisms}} for reducing truck transport externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions, road damage, congestion, and accidents. The economic efficiency properties of a fuel tax are examined for the farm-to-elevator grain trucking sector [...] a sector for which the road damage externality is often severe. Because trucking volumes cumulate more rapidly near the delivery points, marginal external cost is generally not proportional to distance. Further, noncompetitive FOB pricing by grain buyers implies that road tax discounts to offset price markups should be independent of location. In both cases, a fuel tax is not capable of efficiently addressing the externality. With discriminatory pricing by buyers, "cross-hauling" emerges and the optimal fuel tax is unexpectedly high because the buyer passes on only a portion of the tax to the farmer. In a simple example with discriminatory pricing, the optimal fuel tax reduces <b>excess</b> average trucking <b>distance</b> by less that 50 %. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
