25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the <b>flyer</b> <b>frame</b> where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the <b>flyer</b> <b>frame</b> showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|E

25|$|Twisting is {{the process}} in which two or more single-spun yarns are united to produce a yarn of greater {{strength}} for use as warp threads in the weaving process and for normal knitting purposes. This is done by rollers delivering the yarns to a revolving spindle which twists or folds the single yarns around one another. The machines used are similar to spinning frames in their method of applying twist, but differ in that they have only one set of delivery rollers {{instead of the usual}} complement of drafting rollers. This machine is an early example of a <b>flyer</b> twisting <b>frame.</b> On the <b>flyer</b> twister, twist imparted to the yarn in a similar manner as on the flyer spinner. A weighted band, running in a groove {{at the base of the}} bobbin, retards the revolving bobbin creating enough tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly onto the bobbin. The machine is hand doffed.|$|R

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring spinning, the roving is first attenuated by using drawing rollers, then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring <b>flyer.</b> Traditionally ring <b>frames</b> could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R
30|$|The {{postprocessor}} {{covers the}} pattern recognition {{part of the}} system and searches for biologically relevant events. As a first step tracking data is normalized such that all attributes are comparable across different videos. From normalized primary attributes we compute secondary attributes that allow definition of behavioural patterns like following, wing extension or copulation. Figure 2 shows some of these attributes. They capture specific fly constellations (Figure 2 a,e,f,g,h) or shapes (Figure 2 b,c,d). Transformation of these attributes into behaviour patterns requires identification of individual flies in each video frame and detection of each fly’s head and tail. Fly identification is rather simple as long as the tracker distinguishes separate regions for each fly in so-called unoccluded frames. For sequences of unoccluded <b>frames,</b> <b>fly</b> identities are carried through successive frames by solving an assignment problem for position characteristics with the Hungarian algorithm [14].|$|R

40|$|The use of {{statistical}} pattern recognition models to segment the left ventricle {{of the heart}} in ultrasound images has gained substantial attention {{over the last few}} years. The main obstacle for the wider exploration of this methodology lies in the need for large annotated training sets, which are used for the estimation of the statistical model parameters. In this paper, we present a new on-line co-training methodology that reduces the need for large training sets for such parameter estimation. Our approach learns the initial parameters of two different models using a small manually annotated training set. Then, given each frame of a test sequence, the methodology not only produces the segmentation of the current frame, but it also uses the results of both classifiers to re-train each other incrementally. This on-line aspect of our approach has the advantages of producing segmentation results and re-training the classifiers on the <b>fly</b> as <b>frames</b> of a test sequence are presented, but it introduces a harder learning setting compared to the usual off-line co-training, where the algorithm has access to the whole set of un-annotated training samples from the beginning. Moreover, we introduce the use of the following new types of classifiers in the co-training framework: deep belief network and multiple model probabilistic data association. We show that our method leads to a fully automatic left ventricle segmentation system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a public database with training sets containing at least twenty annotated images.

40|$|The second {{generation}} of the Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral/Stereo Scanner (MOMS- 02) was <b>flown</b> within the <b>frame</b> of the German D 2 mission aboard Space Shuttle flight STS- 55. During the 9 days experiment (April to May 1993) approximately 8 mio. km" 2 of data have been recorded in different modes. The newly designed sensor provides multispectral coverage in 4 bands within the VIS/NIR range. The objective of this investigations was to analyze MOMS- 02 data for qualitative and quantitative parameters to assess {{the performance of the}} system. Results are discussed in relation to complimentary data from the operational sensors LANDSAT TM and SPOT HRV. Visual inspection and frequency analysis of the raw data indicated a number of distortions. Due to the different read-out of odd and even CCD's elements, a two line striping occurs parallel to the flight direction. A three line striping effect parallel to the scan direction is caused by a malfunction of the multiplexer. Most image distortions could be corrected by separating the striping pattern and applying a histogram matching algorithm. Since ideal Fourier filters using sharply defined cut-off frequencies produce interferences and spatial filters (low-pass) results in a loss of information, the remaining striping was accepted for further investigations. Corrected data were used for assessing the radiometric dynamic, entropy, spatial resolving power (line-spread-functions) and signal to noise ratios. Atmospheric correction was applied for quantification purposes of the spectral and spatial image information content. Transfer coefficients were calculated to estimate the radiometric dynamic using complimentary LANDSAT TM data. The radimetric dynamic indicates that the gain setting for band 3 and 4 have not been optimized.

Hawthorn won the 1955 les 24 Heures du Mans following what {{has been described as}} an inspired drive in which he set a lap record of 122.388 mph during a three-hour duel with Fangio in the early stages. The race was marred by the worst disaster in motor racing history - a crash which killed 84 spectators and driver Pierre Levegh, after Hawthorn had suddenly braked in front of Lance Macklin's Healey after overtaking him to enter the pits, causing Macklin to swerve into the path of Levegh's Mercedes. After colliding with the Healey, the Mercedes skipped the earthen embankment separating the spectator area from the track, bounced through spectator enclosures, then hit a concrete stairwell structure head-on. The impact shattered {{the front end of the}} car, which then somersaulted high, pitching debris into the spectator area, before landing atop the earthen embankment. The debris, including bonnet, engine, and front axle, which separated from the <b>frame,</b> <b>flew</b> through the crowd. Eight hours later, while leading the race 1.5 laps ahead of the Jaguar team, the Mercedes team withdrew from the race, ostensibly as a mark of respect for those who had perished in the accident; the Jaguar team was invited to join them but declined. The French press carried photographs of Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb celebrating their win with the customary champagne but treated them with scorn. The official inquiry into the accident ruled that Hawthorn was not responsible for the crash, and that it was merely a racing incident. The death of the spectators was blamed on inadequate safety standards for track design. The Grandstand and pit areas were demolished and rebuilt soon after. The death toll led to a ban on motorsports in France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and other nations, until the tracks could be brought to a higher safety standard.|$|R
