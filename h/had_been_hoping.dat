5|$|The German {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> {{that the}} Ottomans {{would enter the}} war to support them but the government in Istanbul was undecided. The Germanophile Ottoman War Minister, Enver Pasha, began conspiring with the German ambassador to bring the empire into the war. Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet to go out to sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian vessels into opening fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a flagrant display of hostility, causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{allies were}} aware of Rupert's {{approach}} and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two could come to its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege {{on the night of}} 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby.|$|E
25|$|Jewell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> {{to mount}} a {{promotion}} challenge in 2000–01 with Wednesday but after enduring a torrid eight months in charge was sacked in February 2001 with the debt-ridden Hillsborough club struggling near the foot of Division One. His highlight was the 2–1 League Cup victory over local rivals Sheffield United and victory over Premier League West Ham United.|$|E

25|$|In the end, most {{airlines}} favored lower {{operating costs}} over a marginal increase in speed, {{and the project}} did not attract the interest for which Boeing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping.</b> The Sonic Cruiser project was finally abandoned by December 2002 {{in favor of the}} slower but more fuel-efficient 7E7 (later renamed Boeing 787 Dreamliner). Much of the research from the Sonic Cruiser was applied to the 787, including carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the fuselage and wings, bleedless engines, cockpit and avionics design.|$|E
25|$|By 12 October Third Army {{was held}} on the Selle River. On 14 October Plumer resumed his advance in the north, taking Roulers and {{reaching}} Courtrai. On the same day President Wilson rejected German peace overtures, causing the Germans to abandon the Belgian Coast {{and the city of}} Lille (17 October) which they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to hold as bargaining chips. On the same day Fourth Army crossed the River Sambre and plans were made to advance on the River Selle, amidst worrying signs of a stiffening of German resistance.|$|E
25|$|Davis and Potter {{split up}} in 2001, {{just before a}} trip to Patagonia. Davis <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to summit Fitz Roy and ended up finding a partner after she flew down alone and summitted. However, a month later in Moab, Potter {{proposed}} and in June 2002 the two were married in a meadow in La Sals. Despite being married, the couple {{did not have a}} traditional relationship. They were rarely in the same {{place at the same time}} due to their climbing projects. They also fought over whose projects had priority.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} action at Waitara brought the result Kingi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for and within 10 {{days of the}} Te Kohia battle, about 500 warriors from the Taranaki, Ngati Ruanui and Nga Rauru iwi converged on the New Plymouth area to provide support. The warriors built an entrenched and stockaded pā named Kaipopo {{on one of the}} hills at Waireka, about 8km southwest of New Plymouth and 4km from the Omata stockade that lay {{on the road to the}} town. The area was scattered with some houses built by European settlers, and on 27 March, five settlers, including two boys, were either shot or tomahawked in the Omata district.|$|E
25|$|After his {{purchase}} in Bulgaria, Kamo {{traveled to}} Berlin and delivered {{a letter from}} Lenin to a prominent Bolshevik, Dr. Yakov Zhitomirsky, asking the doctor for medical assistance to treat Kamo's still injured eye. Lenin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to help {{the man who had}} successfully executed the robbery, but unintentionally turned Kamo over to a double agent. Zhitomirsky had been secretly working as an agent of the Russian government and quickly informed the Okhrana about his encounter with Kamo. The Okhrana then asked the Berlin police to arrest Kamo. When they did so, they found a forged Austrian passport and a suitcase with 200 detonators, which he was planning to use in another large bank robbery.|$|E
25|$|When Von Teese was a teenager, {{her mother}} {{took her to}} buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, {{and gave her a}} plastic egg {{containing}} a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.|$|E

25|$|In December 2010, {{organizers}} {{announced that}} they had reached a deal with BYU {{to play in the}} 2013 edition of the Fight Hunger Bowl. The Cougars, who became conference independent during the 2011 season, were scheduled to fill a slot originally allotted to a team from the Western Athletic Conference, which discontinued football prior to the 2013 season. After defeating the Boise State Broncos for their sixth win of the season on October 25, bowl director Gary Cavalli extended an invitation to play in the game. Cavalli stated in 2010 that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to secure the Cougars' participation in the game since 2002. If the Cougars did not earn enough wins to become bowl eligible, an alternate team from the Atlantic Coast Conference would have replaced them; though they finished bowl eligible, one ESPN writer opined they were even better than their record indicated.|$|E
25|$|After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus {{is taken}} to Pilate's court in the praetorium. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had {{previously}} ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, because he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.|$|E
25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned Forest Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see what they could do to save it, a development Profous <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E

25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E
25|$|Inquests {{into the}} deaths, commencing later in 1989, proved controversial. South Yorkshire coroner Stefan Popper limited the main inquest to events up to 3:15pm {{on the day}} of the {{disaster}} – nine minutes after the match was halted and the crowd spilled onto the pitch. Popper said this was because the victims were either dead, or brain dead, by 3:15pm. The decision angered the families, many of whom felt the inquest was unable to consider the response of the police and other emergency services after that time. The inquest returned a verdict of accidental death on 26 March 1991, much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for a verdict of unlawful killing or an open verdict, and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the officers who had been present at the disaster. Popper's decision was subsequently endorsed by the Divisional Court who considered it to have been justified in the light of the medical evidence available to him. Relatives later failed to have the inquest reopened to allow more scrutiny of police actions and closer examination of the circumstances of individual cases.|$|E
500|$|Henneberger gave Weird Tales the {{subtitle}} [...] "The Unique Magazine" [...] {{from the first}} issue. [...] Henneberger <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for submissions of [...] "off-trail", or unusual, material. [...] He later recalled talking to three well-known Chicago writers, Hamlin Garland, Emerson Hough, and Ben Hecht, each of whom had said they avoided writing stories of [...] "fantasy, the bizarre, and the outré" [...] because of the likelihood of rejection by existing markets. He added [...] "I must confess that the main motive in establishing Weird Tales was to give the writer free rein to express his innermost feelings in a manner befitting great literature".|$|E

500|$|In April 1920, Chile only bought Canada {{and four}} destroyers, {{all of which}} had been ordered by Chile prior to the war's {{outbreak}} and requisitioned by the British for the war. Planned replacements for Almirante Cochrane included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar. The most visible dissension came from a block of officers in the navy who publicly opposed any possible purchase and instead promoted a [...] "New Navy" [...] which would acquire submarines and airplanes. They argued that these weapons would cost less and give the country, and its lengthy coastline, better protection from external threats. The ships were not bought for reasons of cost, but neither were the airplanes its supporters <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> for.|$|E
500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't Blow Your Top before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> and waiting for. [...] This short project took my mind off the problems with the KMFDM album and gave me a welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E
500|$|Edwin Baird, {{the first}} editor of Weird Tales, {{was not an}} ideal choice for the job as he disliked horror stories; his {{expertise}} was in crime fiction, {{and most of the}} material he acquired was bland and unoriginal. [...] The writers Henneberger <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hoping</b> to publish, such as Garland and Hough, failed to submit anything to Baird, and the magazine published mostly traditional ghost fiction, with many of the stories narrated by characters in lunatic asylums, or told in diary format. [...] The cover story for the first issue was [...] "Ooze", by Anthony M. Rud; there was also the first installment of a serial, [...] "The Thing of A Thousand Shapes", by Otis Adelbert Kline, and 22 other stories. [...] Ashley suggests that the better pulp writers from whom Baird did manage to acquire material, such as Francis Stevens and Austin Hall, were sending Baird stories which had already been rejected elsewhere.|$|E
