50|$|A dry bag {{is a type}} of <b>flexible</b> <b>container</b> which {{seals in}} a {{watertight}} manner. Dry bags are often used in kayaking, canoeing, rafting, and other outdoor activities where sensitive items would otherwise get wet as well as extreme sports such as skiing and snowboarding. Dry bags are used to protect electronics from water. As well, they are used to prevent sleeping bags and spare clothing from getting wet, as in a camping context, wet sleeping bags or spare clothing could post a risk to a camper's safety, due to the poor insulative qualities of wet clothing or sleeping bags.|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} may {{be employed}} for vibration control of resonant structures, {{similar to that}} of a classical tuned vibration absorber. For such a case, the sloshing frequency is tuned at a critical frequency of the structure in order to gain the benefits of the pressure forces as control forces. Such an absorber is practically free of maintenance. The work presented in this paper utilizes a <b>flexible</b> <b>container</b> partially filled with water, as the sloshing absorber. Numerical predictions are presented where a “tuned” <b>flexible</b> <b>container</b> can be advantageous over a rigid container for effective control. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{free-field}} response by adopting a flexible membrane container as soil boundary for experimental shaking table tests. The {{influence of the}} soil container boundary on the soil behaviour and the dynamic soil properties under seismic effect were examined. A <b>flexible</b> <b>container</b> with 1 / 50 scale factor was adopted in the experimental tests, including construction, instrumentation, and determination {{of the results of}} dynamic tests on a shaking table. Horizontal face displacements and accelerations were analysed to determine the influence of the container boundary on the performance of the soil. The outputs results show that the flexible boundary container allows more displacement and larger accelerations. The soil in a rigid wall container cannot deform as similar as the soil in the real field does. Therefore, the response of <b>flexible</b> <b>container</b> tested is believed to be more reliable for soil boundary than that in the rigid container...|$|E

50|$|In the US, Ernst Eger of United States Rubber Company (later Uniroyal) {{patented}} a self-sealing {{fuel tank}} design in 1941; {{one of many}} companies involved in developing this technology during the war. Goodyear chemist James Merrill filed a patent in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing self-sealing tanks using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft. In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced Corsair fighters, {{as well as other}} aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first flexible fuel bladders as range extender tanks for the MkIX Spitfire. These tanks were <b>flexible</b> <b>containers,</b> made of a laminated self-sealing material like vulcanized rubber and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths.|$|R

25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, <b>flexible</b> <b>containers</b> such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of hydroelastic analysis of large and <b>flexible</b> <b>container</b> ships of today is pointed out. A methodology for investigation of this challenging phenomenon is drawn {{up and a}} mathematical model is worked out. It includes defi nition of ship geometry, mass distribution, structure stiffness, and combines ship hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, ship motion and vibrations. Based on the presented theory, a computer program is developed and applied for hydroelastic analysis of a fl exible segmented barge for which model test results of motion and distortion in waves have been available. A correlation analysis of numerical simulation and measured response shows quite good agreement of the transfer functions for heave, pitch, roll, vertical and horizontal bending and torsion. Such checked tool can be further used for reliable ydroelastic analysis of ship-like structures...|$|E
