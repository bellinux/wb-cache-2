5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> adult bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E

5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
5|$|The gluttonous King Dedede {{has stolen}} {{all of the}} <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{inhabitants}} of Dream Land {{as well as the}} Sparkling Stars needed to obtain more food, so Kirby, a young resident of Dream Land, volunteers to retrieve the food and stars, and stop Dedede.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> male's talons.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E
5|$|Helen Whittier had {{returned}} to intercoastal service by early 1934 when The New York Times reported that she had sailed from San Francisco on 23 March and arrived at New York on 25 April. In June that same year, Helen Whittier {{was one of the}} Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii. Shipments of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles. Helen Whittier sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2,500 tons of food from Los Angeles to Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the National Convention was the United States. Importing <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1944, Đujić's {{force of}} between 6,000–7,000 withdrew to Bihać {{with help from}} the Wehrmacht 373rd Infantry Division. The Chetniks {{received}} ammunition and <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Germans and began a joint German-Chetnik offensive against the Partisans. General Fehn organized the transportation of Đujić's wounded Chetniks through Zagreb to the Third Reich. Đujić requested a written guarantee from Ante Pavelić, leader of the NDH, to afford him and his forces refuge in German-occupied Slovenia. In addition, Ljotić and Milan Nedić petitioned to Nazi party official Hermann Neubacher in Vienna that Đujić's forces should be allowed passage, as did Slovene collaborationist General Leon Rupnik.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, cigarette ends, and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from friends or relatives in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> canteen or the black market.|$|E
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E

5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
5|$|Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 {{soldiers}} and posted 20 more at nearby Pole. Xelha was renamed Salamanca de Xelha {{and became the}} first Spanish settlement in the peninsula. The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was requisitioned from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucatán. Montejo was able to get more <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat of Cozumel. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and instructed them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab, where the Spanish party halted for two months.|$|E
5|$|Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 {{soldiers}} {{under his}} second-in-command, Alonso d'Avila, and posted 20 more at nearby Pole.

Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. His expedition passed through the towns of Xamanha, Mochis and Belma, none of which survives today. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and ordered them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown.

5|$|On 15 April 1525 the {{expedition}} {{arrived at the}} Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them out to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the course of the next week. By this time the remnants of {{the expedition}} had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés constructed an improvised brigantine and, accompanied by canoes, he ascended the Dulce River to Lake Izabal, with about 40 Spaniards, and a number of Indians. He at first believed he had reached the Pacific, but soon realised his error. At the western end of the lake, he marched inland and engaged in battle with the Maya natives at the city of Chacujal, on the Polochic River. He seized plentiful supplies of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city and sent supplies back to Nito in the brigantine. He had rafts built to ferry supplies back downriver, and returned to Nito with them, while most of his men marched back overland. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E
