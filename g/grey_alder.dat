5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of deciduous and coniferous trees. Host species include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, <b>grey</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included <b>grey</b> <b>alder,</b> Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and <b>grey</b> <b>alder.</b> The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
50|$|Cut-out raised bogs are colonised by a wet {{woodland}} {{of birch}} and alder trees. Characteristic species are downy birch, black <b>alder,</b> <b>grey</b> willow, crack willow, broad buckler fern, narrow buckler fern and remote sedge.|$|R
50|$|The species {{forms an}} ectomycorrhizal {{association}} with <b>grey</b> and black <b>alder,</b> {{both in the}} alder subgenus Alnus. A phylogenetic study has shown that L. lilacinus {{is one of several}} species that have specialised on the subgenus Alnus as host plants, whereas the closely related L. lepidotus is restricted to green alder in the subgenus Alnobetula.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} {{sections of}} Tentsmuir NNR support a rich variety of plant species. For example, SNH's Story of Tentsmuir National Nature Reserve states that 320 vascular plant {{species have been}} recorded at Tentsmuir Point, with over 200 recorded at Morton Lochs. At Morton Lochs, water plantain, yellow flag iris, broad-leaved pondweed and greater pond sedge {{are just some of}} the plants that thrive in the mosaic of habitats in this area. The wet woodland surrounding Morton Lochs consists mainly of <b>grey</b> willow, <b>alder,</b> hawthorn and birch. Land to the north and east of Morton Lochs displays some of the natural vegetation characteristic of open heath, despite being planted with forest in 1954.|$|R
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the <b>grey</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
25|$|There are 35 {{tree species}} in the park, which is 32% of the 109 tree species found in Bulgaria. Coniferous woods form 68.3% of the forests and {{deciduous}} woods make up the other 31.7%. The distribution by species is as follows: European beach – 21.6%, dwarf mountain pine – 17.4%, Norway spruce – 16.7%, Scots pine – 14.6%, silver fir and Bulgarian fir – 12.7%, Macedonian pine – 6.9%, sessile oak and Rila oak – 4.6%, silver birch – 1.5%, common aspen – 1.3%, <b>grey</b> <b>alder</b> – 1.1%, other – 1.6%.

25|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} cover 70% of the park's territory. The lowest zones (800–1500m) are {{occupied with}} beech forests consisting primarily of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), riparian deciduous forests dominated by <b>grey</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus incana) and mixed forests of beech, common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia). Above these ecosystems are located xerothermic oak forests, {{dominated by the}} local endemic Rila oak (Quercus protoroburoides) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea), whose upper zones are covered by European beech, European silver fir (Abies alba) and Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis). Coniferous ecosystems occupy altitudes between 1300 and 2200m and consist of Norway spruce (Picea abies), Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and firs. Secondary ecosystems that replace primeval forests cover 5% of the park consist mainly of common aspen (Populus tremula), silver birch (Betula pendula) and common hazel (Corylus avellana) replacing spruce and pine forests.|$|E
50|$|On the {{periphery}} is {{a strip of}} carr which is dominated by <b>Grey</b> Willow and <b>Alder</b> Buckthorn bushes as well as Downy Birch. In places Bog-bean and Bog Arum may {{also be found in}} the undergrowth. The western part of this waterlogged terrain is more fen-like (Niedermoor), with reed beds and tall herbaceous vegetation as well as birch and alder trees. Information about the fauna of the region may be found in the book by Timm (1983).|$|R

30|$|The {{number and}} canopy cover of hazel shrubs were {{evaluated}} separately for hazels lower than 4  m and taller than 4  m. The cover of selected {{plants in the}} ground vegetation layer was visually estimated at randomly located 10 [*]×[*] 10 -m squares in each transect. During the evaluation process, the following canopy-forming tree species were recorded: Norway spruce, silver and downy birches B. pendula and B. pubescens, <b>grey</b> and black <b>alders,</b> pedunculate oak, ash, aspen, willow Salix spp. (mostly Salix caprea, but also Salix cinerea and Salix myrsinifolia), small-leaved lime, Scotch pine Pinus sylvestris, Wych and field elms Ulmus glabra and Ulmus minor, Norway maple Acer platanoides, wild apple Malus sylvestris, common buckthorn Rhamnus cathartica, and common hornbeam Carpinus betulus. Understory species recorded were hazel, glossy buckthorn, bird cherry, rowan, dwarf honeysuckle, European spindle Euonymus europaeus, blackcurrant Ribes nigrum, red elderberry Sambucus racemosa, and mezereon Daphne mezereum.|$|R
40|$|The barks of {{deciduous}} trees {{spread over}} a wide area of Northern Europe, were sequentially extracted using solvents of increasing polarity. The highest yields of hydrophilic extractives were found for ash tree and goat willow (23. 6 % and 23. 8 %, respectively). The highe st total contents of polyphenols were found for black alder and goat willow bark (0. 18 GAE  g - 1 and 0. 12 GAE  g - 1, respectively). Hydrophilic extract from the both <b>grey</b> and black <b>alder</b> barks contained high amount (up to 7 % on bark dry mass) of condensed tannins (CT) or oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC). In tests with free radicals (ABTS ●+, DPPH ●), the high radical scavenging capacities of the hydrophilic extracts enriched with OPC were demonstrated. The antioxidant efficiency of the hydrophilic extracts and purified OPC from alder barks was tested by their influence on thermo-oxidative destruction of model polyurethane (PU) films. The hydrophilic extracts enriched with tannins have good potential as a technical antioxidant for polyurethanes, with the most prominent activity for the hydrophilic extract from black alder and goat willow bark...|$|R

50|$|A {{small area}} along the {{southern}} coast, from Soknedal in southern Rogaland and east to Fevik in Aust-Agder (including Kristiansand) belongs to the Nemoral vegetation zone. This zone is located below 150 m above sea level and at most 30 km inland along the valleys. This is the vegetation zone dominating Europe north of southern France, the Alps, the Carpathians and the Caucasus. The hallmark of this zone in Norway is the domination of oak and the virtual complete lack of typical boreal species such as Norway spruce and <b>grey</b> <b>alder,</b> although a lowland variant of pine occurs. Nemoral covers a total of 0.5% of the land area (excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen).|$|E

50|$|In {{culture and}} in some root nodules, multilocular sporangia {{containing}} many spores are produced. The sporangia are non-motile but the spores can migrate to infect new host plants. A Swedish study found that root nodules developed on transplanted seedlings of the <b>grey</b> <b>alder,</b> Alnus incana, planted in meadow soil that had not grown actinorhizal plants for nearly sixty years. A similar experiment planting seedlings in deep layers of peat where the surface layer had been removed, did not produce nodulation. This {{seems to have been}} because there were no infective propagules of Frankia alna deep in the peat. No air-borne dispersal of Frankia alni was detected and it was thought that movement of water might account for the dispersal of the bacteria in peat soils.|$|E
