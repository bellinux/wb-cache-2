5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the <b>hard</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|The album's {{title was}} {{intended}} to have a double meaning: that the music business is a <b>hard</b> <b>one,</b> and that the band was serious about its music ("The Firm mean business"). However, perhaps due to the lukewarm-at-best critical and financial success which the band met, Page and Rodgers decided to disband The Firm within months of this album's release.|$|E
25|$|The seven-year WMAP {{data were}} {{released}} on January 26, 2010. As {{part of this}} release, claims for inconsistencies with the standard model were investigated. Most were shown not to be statistically significant, and likely due to a posteriori selection (where one sees a weird deviation, but fails to consider properly how <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> has been looking; a deviation with 1:1000 likelihood will typically be found if one tries one thousand times). For the deviations that do remain, there are no alternative cosmological ideas (for instance, {{there seem to be}} correlations with the ecliptic pole). It seems most likely these are due to other effects, with the report mentioning uncertainties in the precise beam shape and other possible small remaining instrumental and analysis issues.|$|E

25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally <b>hard,</b> <b>one</b> might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E
25|$|Central to {{the myth}} {{and the reality}} of the West is the American cowboy. His real life was a <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> and {{revolved}} around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. For young cowboys and buckaroos, working cattle was not just a job but also a lifestyle, one that was lived in the freedom of the outdoors and, most of the time, on horseback. On a long drive, there was usually one cowboy for each 250 head of cattle. Alcohol was everywhere in the West (outside Mormondom), but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink it. Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle. To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Indians and rustlers, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife, lasso, bullwhip, pistols, rifles and shotguns.|$|E

25|$|To {{deal with}} the Bulgarian threat for good, the Byzantines took {{measures}} to end the conflict with the Abbasid Caliphate {{in the east and}} attempted to create a wide anti-Bulgarian coalition. Two envoys were sent to Baghdad, where they secured peace with caliph al-Muqtadir in June 917. The strategos of Dyrrhachium, Leo Rhabdouchos, was instructed to negotiate with the Serbian prince Petar Gojniković, who was a Bulgarian vassal but was willing to renounce Bulgarian suzerainty. However, the court in Preslav was warned about the negotiations by prince Michael of Zahumlje, a loyal ally of Bulgaria, and SimeonI was able to prevent an immediate Serb attack. The Byzantine attempts to approach the Magyars were also successfully countered by the Bulgarian diplomacy. The general John Bogas was sent with rich gifts to the Pechenegs, who inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. The Bulgarians had already established strong connections with the Pechenegs, including through marriages, and Bogas' mission proved to be a <b>hard</b> <b>one.</b> He did manage to convince some tribes to send aid, but eventually the Byzantine navy refused to transport them to the south of the Danube river, probably {{as a result of the}} jealousy that existed between Bogas and the ambitious admiral Romanos Lekapenos.|$|E

2500|$|Driven by {{an innate}} desire to procreate, Tritt, the [...] "Parental" [...] of the triad, at first asks Odeen to persuade Dua to {{facilitate}} the production of their third child. When this fails, Tritt steals an energy-battery from the Pump and rigs it to feed Dua, which stimulates the triad into a total melt, resulting in conception. Dua discovers this betrayal and escapes to the caves of the hard ones, where she transmits the warning messages received by Lamont. This effort nearly exhausts her mortally before she is found by her triad. Here it is revealed that hard ones are not a separate species, but the fully mature form that triads eventually coalesce into permanently. Each melt briefly allows the triad to shift into its hard form during the period they can't later remember. Odeen convinces Dua that the <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> they will become will have influence with the others to stop the Pump; but as their final metamorphosis begins, Dua realizes (too late to prevent irreversible union) that her own triad's 'hard' form is the scientist Estwald.|$|E
