5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's <b>flight</b> <b>operations,</b> no human being had yet flown in space.

5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Denver {{has been}} home to several other {{airports}} that are no longer operational. Stapleton International Airport was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. Lowry Air Force Base was a military flight training facility that ceased <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> in 1966, with the base finally being closed in 1994. It is being used for residential purposes. Buckley Air Force Base, a former Air National Guard base, is the only military facility in the Denver area.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{was paid}} off from RAN service in 1982. A {{proposal}} to convert her {{for use as}} a floating casino failed, and a 1984 sale was cancelled, before she was sold for scrap in 1985 and towed to China for breaking. The scrapping was delayed so Melbourne could be studied by the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as part of a secret project to develop a Chinese aircraft carrier and used to train PLAN aviators in carrier <b>flight</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most EVA Air flights {{originate}} out of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, {{its main}} hub near Taipei, Taiwan. At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air's <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> {{are concentrated in}} Terminal 2. Additionally, EVA Air and its domestic subsidiary UNI Air operate numerous flights out of Kaohsiung International Airport. A focus city for EVA Air outside Taiwan is Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, with westerly connections to all its European destinations except for Paris, which is flown non-stop.|$|E
5|$|Navenby was an {{agricultural}} village {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, but the outbreak of the First World War brought changes for the community. A small airfield, Wellingore Heath, was opened on land bordering Navenby in 1917, to provide a base for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The flat landscape, with its cliff-top situation, proved an ideal situation for <b>flight</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 23 July, Vikrant sailed off to Cochin {{in company}} with the Western Fleet. En route, before {{reaching}} Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After {{the completion of the}} radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for Madras, escorted by Brahmaputra and Beas. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about <b>flight</b> <b>operations.</b> He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an Alizé without compromising the speed restrictions. The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Alizé aircraft would have to land at close to stalling speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A Time Interval Petri net (TIPN) is {{proposed}} {{and used to}} model <b>flight</b> <b>operation.</b> Based on the TIPN model, the flight delay propagation analysis algorithm is provided, which reduces the complexity of flight delay propagation analysis algorithm. Time interval constraints are attached to places and transitions in TIPN model, which could model the flight turnaround time and flight flying period. Meanwhile, firing rules for transition and transition sequence are defined based on the simplified model which is derived depending on the reasoning ability of linear logic. And also, the real time flight delay propagation analysis algorithm {{is proposed}}. TIPN model for <b>flight</b> <b>operation</b> considering different initial delay lev-els in source airport is established and the delay propagation analysis demonstrated that, the model and algorithm could rapidly predict <b>flight</b> <b>operation</b> state and delay level in downstream airports effectively...|$|R
5|$|Also on August15, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the Dominican Republic, from Samaná to Cabo Engaño along the northern coast and westward to Isla Beata off the southwestern coast. Thousands of residents stocked up on bottled water, canned goods, and gas, though stores {{in and around the}} capital remained closed for the day. The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> on the morning of August16. The tropical storm warning for the island was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a weak tropical depression. In Cuba, a storm alert was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of possibly heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|CFB Winnipeg is a Canadian Forces Base at the Winnipeg International Airport. The base {{is home to}} <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> support {{divisions}} and several training schools, {{as well as the}} 1 Canadian Air Division and Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters. 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces is based at CFB Winnipeg; the Wing has three squadrons and six schools. It supports 113 units from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel north to the high Arctic. 17 Wing acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter–bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E

50|$|Air traffic {{controllers}} watching Flight 778's progress {{noticed that the}} plane was proceeding down the runway at high speed and was not slowing down. An alarm signal was issued at 22:45. The <b>flight</b> <b>operation</b> director then ordered the controller in the airport control tower to send out the initial report of the accident, and ordered the weather observer at the main observation point to compile an observation of the weather. At 22:46, the airport was closed by the Aerodome <b>Flight</b> <b>Operation</b> Director {{and not a single}} aircraft could take off or land in the airport.|$|R
5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, NASA held a {{symposium}} on project costs which presented {{an estimate of}} the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion.

50|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), {{headquartered}} in Montreal, is the civil aviation {{branch of the}} UN (United Nations).

Chapter 4 of Annex 6 describes the duties of <b>flight</b> dispatchers/flight <b>operations</b> officers while Chapter 10 of Annex 6 describes the training and qualification requirements for <b>flight</b> dispatchers/flight <b>operations</b> officers.

The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the suitability of V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop normal flight operating procedures, perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night <b>flight</b> <b>operations,</b> and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's flight envelope.|$|E
