Autumn grew up in Malibu, California, and {{according}} to her, [...] "being surrounded by nature and sea <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with [...] development as a 'free spirit.'" [...] Her mother worked as a seamstress, and she has said that {{her father was a}} German immigrant with whom she did not share a close relationship.

500|$|Jamie Edwards, who {{had helped}} record and tour for Happiness... was heavily {{utilized}} during the recording process and was becoming {{a big part of}} the band, considered by some to be the unofficial fifth member of the band at that time. Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that stuff. He was very influential. We had him in all our writing sessions. It was a very creative time that was cool because we were all in a room, kind of working together.” ...|$|E
500|$|The band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four {{times by}} the end of the year. After garnering {{considerable}} attention for their performances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by Seymour Stein of Sire Records. After they were seen by Sire A man Craig Leon he brought the band to the attention of the label. Stein's wife, Linda Stein, saw the band play at Mothers; she would later co-manage them along with Danny Fields. By this time, the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as [...] "punk". The group's unusual frontman <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with their impact. As Dee Dee explained, [...] "All the other singers [...] were copying David Johansen , who was copying Mick Jagger... But Joey was unique, totally unique." ...|$|E

"When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Veeck hired Lemon {{to succeed}} Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon {{took over a}} Chicago team that {{finished}} in last place in the AL West in 1976. [...] "Bob {{is the type of}} manager we need {{at this stage of the}} game", Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, [...] "I think we'll surprise a few people." [...] White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, [...] "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we'd find out who was playing and where. Lemon's made it a serious operation." [...] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. [...] "The fans got behind us after about three weeks. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with our success", Lemon said after being winning the award.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E

500|$|On 24 August 1992, Mexican {{newspaper}} El Siglo de Torreón {{reported that}} Miguel had begun collaborating with David Foster and Juan Carlos Calderón on some compositions, along with English-speaking composers, and selecting cover versions for the album. He also received assistance from Cuban composer Rudy Pérez and Dominican singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra with the songwriting. Recording began on 4 July 1992. Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer Bruce Swedien, {{but decided to}} re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction. Unable to find a producer, he decided to co-produce the album with his long-time associate Kiko Cibrian. Recording the album took almost a year and was affected by several complications, including its high budget of over US$1.5 million, his father's death, and an appendectomy. Miguel announced that {{the name of the}} album would be Aries during a presentation at the 1993 Festival Acapulco. About the naming of the album he said, [...] "This album expresses my personal self. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I produced everything and wanted {{to have a lot of}} fun, take what I like, and what better than the zodiacal sign representing what one is." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

500|$|New York Dolls {{features}} 10 original {{songs and}} 1 cover—the 1963 Bo Diddley song [...] "Pills". Johansen described the album as [...] "a little jewel of urban folk art". Rundgren, {{on the other}} hand, said the band's sensibilities were different from [...] "the urban New York thing" [...] {{because they had been}} raised outside Manhattan and drew on carefree rock and roll and Brill Building pop influences such as the Shangri-Las: [...] "Their songs, as punky as they were, usually <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the same old boy-girl thing but in a much more inebriated way." [...] Johansen quoted the lyric [...] "you'd best believe I'm in love L-U-V" [...] from the Shangri-Las' [...] "Give Him a Great Big Kiss" [...] (1964) when he opened [...] "Looking for a Kiss", which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs. On [...] "Subway Train", he used lyrics from the American folk standard [...] "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah". In the opinion of critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album's rowdy hard rock songs also revamped riffs from Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, resulting in music that sounded edgy and threatening in spite of the New York Dolls' wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities. [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] featured raunchy dual guitars, boogie-woogie piano, and a histrionic pause, while [...] "Trash" [...] was a punky pop rock song with brassy singing.|$|E
