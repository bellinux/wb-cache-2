25|$|On {{the day of}} the quake, the Metro stopped {{service and}} {{completely}} shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people {{to get out of the}} tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to <b>get</b> <b>where</b> they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Taxqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.|$|E

The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan {{in a way that}} Kamin says makes it a belvedere. Kamin also recommends anyone having a bad day to stroll across the bridge, adding, [...] "You won't <b>get</b> <b>where</b> you're going quickly, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you're done." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{enjoyed the}} film, noting its homages {{to the film}} serials of the 1930s–1950s. Although Ebert cited the visual effects as being state of the art, he {{described}} them [...] "as charmingly direct as those rockets in the Flash Gordon serials—the ones with sparklers hidden inside of them, which were pulled on wires in front of papier-mâché mountains." [...] Leonard Maltin wrote that the [...] "film captures {{the look of the}} '30s, as well as the gee-whiz innocence of Saturday matinée serials, but it's talky and takes too much time to <b>get</b> <b>where</b> it's going. Dalton has fun as a villain patterned after Errol Flynn." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine also gave a positive review.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its variety {{of weapons and}} enemies. Game Revolution said that each enemy is [...] "unique both in ability, structure, and behavior so that each requires a specific combat approach". Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions [...] "vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults". Computer Games Magazine praised {{the fact that the}} developers replaced the wire-frame automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they [...] "provide more detail and make it easier to recognize where you are and how to <b>get</b> <b>where</b> you want to go". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its [...] "rock-solid performance on standard dialup modems and easy connectivity", while GameSpot praised it for being [...] "fun and stable". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpot's PC Action Game of the Year. Despite the positive reviews, the game did not perform well in sales. As a result, Daily Radar awarded the game a [...] "System Shock Award", named after the Looking Glass Studios 1994 game of the same name, implying that Descent 3 is a [...] "game that the critics loved but is over-shadowed by lesser or greater games".|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to <b>get</b> <b>where</b> she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E

The arrangement gets off on being withholding, and, at least for one glorious single, so does Madonna: When she sings, [...] "You knew all along/What I never wanted to say," [...] she sounds positively rapturous. Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 30 on his list of [...] "Best Madonna Songs", stating [...] "its slinky R groove made 'Secret' something special, even if it's not remembered for an accompanying scandal or bawdy 'moment'. We {{like to talk about}} her ability to produce controversy and headlines, {{but at the end of}} the day, here's what Madonna makes best: pop music". Louis Virtel of The Backlot listed the song at number 14 on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", calling it [...] "meditative, moving" [...] and [...] "sexy as hell". Rooksby concurred that [...] "its a good track" [...] but felt that the time could have been reduced from five minutes, which made it a little long. He also felt that the drums looping around the track made it a [...] "bit monotonous".|$|E

Chapter headings include: [...] "How to Get All the Cheese in Life" [...] and [...] "How to <b>Get</b> <b>Where</b> You Really Want to Go in Life".

He attempts to convince the reader that life should be considered a game, and that it is more desirable to win at a goal than it is to be right about it. Frederick's thesis is that individuals cause all events which occur in their lives, and that they should work to consciously control their circumstances.|$|E

You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others.
