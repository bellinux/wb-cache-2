40|$|Abstract. High {{levels of}} {{reliability}} and high security {{are the basic}} characteristics and requirements of railway signal systems. So, reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) are necessarily analyzed before the computer <b>interlocking</b> <b>system</b> will be adopted. The All-electronic Computer <b>Interlocking</b> <b>System,</b> which is {{a new kind of}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>system,</b> still needs to analyze its RAM before being put to use. In this paper, the reliability methods and Markov model are adopted to analyze the RAM indexes of the All-electronic Computer <b>Interlocking</b> <b>System</b> when its execution layer equipped with the single configuration or the dual-redundant configuration, the paper also compares the indexes with that of the traditional computer-based <b>interlocking</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, the paper will briefly include suggestions on how the All-electronic Computer <b>Interlocking</b> <b>System’s</b> RAM indexes may be increased and also, how the system may be used practically...|$|R
25|$|Also new for 1974 was {{a federally}} {{mandated}} <b>interlock</b> <b>system</b> {{that required the}} driver and front-seat passenger to fasten their seat belts in order to start the car.

25|$|The {{basic rules}} system of Cyberpunk 2020 (called the <b>Interlock</b> <b>System)</b> is skill-based instead of level-based, with players being awarded points {{to be spent}} on their skill sets.

A large part of the system is the player characters' ability to augment themselves with cyber-technology and the ensuing loss of humanity as they become more machine than man.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 2009, {{a filter}} pump on Bahari River malfunctioned, sending twenty-four guests and {{employees}} to the hospital. At 6:25 pm, the pump, which was turned off at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of liquid bleach and hydrochloric acid into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and nausea. They were given oxygen at the park before being transported to Jasper Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening. It was later determined that an <b>interlock</b> <b>system</b> designed to prevent chemical feeders from pumping chemicals into the water when the pump was turned off had malfunctioned.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a VDM {{model of a}} railway <b>interlocking</b> <b>system,</b> and describes how this model is validated by simulation. The model development illustrates how concepts may be captured for a non-trivial system. The importance of validation by simulation is highlighted by giving two equally plausible safety requirements for the system and the end users reaction to the simulation. Keywords: Application of formal methods, VDM, model validation, railway interlocking. 1 Introduction The task of an <b>interlocking</b> <b>system</b> is to prevent trains from colliding, and derailing, {{while at the same}} time allowing train movements. The Danish National Rail Agency (Bane) has built and used <b>interlocking</b> <b>systems</b> for the past 150 years. The first <b>interlocking</b> <b>systems</b> were pure mechanical systems, but as electricity became common, the systems has developed through electro mechanical to relay based systems, and more recently to computer based <b>systems.</b> <b>Interlocking</b> <b>systems</b> are safety critical systems, so there [...] ...|$|R

Cyberpunk 2013 (1988) was R. Talsorian's second Interlock design. Cyberpunk expanded the original <b>Interlock</b> <b>system</b> by introducing a new combat system called [...] "Friday Night Firefight". The second edition of the game, Cyberpunk 2020 (1990), polished up the <b>Interlock</b> <b>system</b> once more, producing what is now known as [...] "Standard Interlock".|$|E

5000|$|Interlock {{is one of}} {{the direct}} parents of the Fuzion system (the other is the Hero System). The <b>Interlock</b> <b>System</b> is [...] "skill-based" [...] - {{characters}} are created by choosing skills for them, and by advancing those skills individually, rather than by choosing character class packages. The <b>Interlock</b> <b>System</b> is used primarily in the Cyberpunk 2020 and Mekton role-playing games; a variant of the <b>Interlock</b> <b>System</b> is used in Teenagers from Outer Space and the Japanese Gundam Senki RPG. Stats and skills are both rated on a scale of 0-10 with 0 representing no ability/no training and 10 representing the maximum ability possible for a human being. A typical skill roll will range from 12-20 for most tasks, so a skill 10 + stat 10 will succeed at virtually any task barring a critical mishap, while a skill 0 + stat 2 (minimum statistic level for a human character) will fail at any but the very simplest task, and even then will succeed only on a critical success. Interlock builds on the typical skill-based paradigm by offering [...] "template" [...] (Mekton) or [...] "profession" [...] (Cyberpunk) packages that give specialized abilities to characters that take these packages.|$|E

30|$|<b>Interlocking</b> <b>system</b> is {{the core}} {{subsystem}} of railway signalling systems such that it defines the exact conditions of the field equipment in order to manage the vehicle movements safely. For detailed information about railway signalization systems refer to [20]. In this work, the considered system is an urban <b>interlocking</b> <b>system</b> that is operated under double-track operation such that each track is operated exclusively in one direction. In this context, the safety rules that cover the predetermined conditions of the blocks, points and signals within the system are examined. The examined set of conditions are directly linked with the elements contained by the desired route, system topology and states of the routes previously opened. It is obvious that <b>interlocking</b> <b>system</b> structures may vary depending on countries, operating companies, topology and different purposes of use but the basic safety rules remain the same everywhere. This study concentrates on these basic safety rules such that it aims to introduce a new model checking strategy by introducing a core model using the most existing elements in any urban <b>interlocking</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} on {{the market}} of computerized Railway <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Systems</b> has pushed an increasing interest {{in the use of}} Formal Methods, due to their ability to precisely specify the logical rules that guarantee the safe establish-ment of routes and equipments for trains through a railway yard. Recently, a trend has emerged about the use of the graphical language statecharts as a standard formalism to produce precise specifications of these systems. This paper resumes our experiences in modeling railway <b>interlocking</b> <b>systems</b> using this formal language. Our stud-ies have addressed the design problem from different points of view: we have modeled the specifications using two dif-ferent approaches that we call functional description and geographical description. The names indicate that the first approach is focused on the modeling of the logical function of the <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Systems,</b> while the latter focuses on the geographical distributions of the element of the controlled station or yard. The geographical approach has also inspired a proposal for a distributed <b>interlocking</b> <b>system,</b> where the logical rules are embedded into distributed equipments communicating by means of safe buses. ...|$|R
