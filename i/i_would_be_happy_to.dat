2500|$|On 11 August 2010, at {{a public}} forum Tony Abbott was asked a {{question}} about his views on {{the absence of an}} R18+ rating for video games and whether he has any policies relating to the subject. His reply was if the Coalition won the upcoming election he would be happy to examine the issue of an R18+ classification rating for video games. Although he admitted he did not know there had been a debate on the issue [...] "If what happens with video games is not roughly analogous to what happens in other areas, that seems silly," [...] he said. He added [...] "Instinctively I'm with you, and it's something I'd be happy to look at, if we are in Government," [...] finishing off with [...] "If you think there is a problem, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> look at it." [...] However the Liberal/National coalition led by Abbott did not win government, the Australian Labor Party retaining power through a coalition with Green and Independent members.|$|E

60|$|I did not {{accomplish}} {{the purpose of}} going to Trinity Church that morning. Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going. I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Bartleby. Finally, I resolved upon this--I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if he declined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then {{to give him a}} twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses.

It’s clear that if the bridges are run by a state body, motorists and businesses would not have to pay VAT at 20% to drive across. The crossings are vital for the Welsh economy, and it’s important to get them down as much as possible." ...|$|R
