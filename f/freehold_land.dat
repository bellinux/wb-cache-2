5|$|In 1991, {{the cattle}} station {{was taken over}} by the Muckaty Aboriginal Corporation. The Corporation focused on rehabilitating the land, which had been {{degraded}} by excessive numbers of cattle, and by late 1993 Muckaty had been destocked of cattle for several seasons. On 20December 1991, the Northern Land Council lodged a claim over Muckaty on behalf of traditional owners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. The claim was made by members of the seven groups that each has responsibility for different sites and dreamings in the area. In 1997, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner recommended that Muckaty Station be handed back to the traditional owners, and in February 1999, title to the land was returned. At the time there were about 400formal traditional owners, among 1,000people with traditional attachments to the land; some lived on the station, but others were elsewhere in the region, including in the nearby towns of Tennant Creek and Elliott. As Aboriginal <b>Freehold</b> <b>land</b> it is inalienable communal title, and cannot be bought or sold. The pastoral lease holder and manager of the station since 1997 has been Ray Aylett. The Adelaide–Darwin railway, which passes through the western part of Muckaty Station, was completed in early 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Lancashire was {{represented}} by two members of parliament (MPs). Voting was restricted to the adult male owners of <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> with an annual rental value of 40shillings or more– {{the equivalent of about}} £80 in 2008– and votes could only be cast at the county town of Lancaster, by a public spoken declaration at the hustings. Constituency boundaries were out of date, and the so-called rotten boroughs had a hugely disproportionate influence on the membership of the Parliament of the United Kingdom compared to the size of their populations: Old Sarum in Wiltshire, with one voter, elected two MPs, as did Dunwich in Suffolk, which by the early 19th century had almost completely disappeared into the sea. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport, with a combined population of almost one million, were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire, or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport. By comparison, {{more than half of all}} MPs were returned by a total of just 154owners of rotten or closed boroughs. In 1816, Thomas Oldfield's The Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland; being a History of the House of Commons, and of the Counties, Cities, and Boroughs of the United Kingdom from the earliest Period claimed that of the 515 MPs for England and Wales 351 were returned by the patronage of 177 individuals and a further 16 by the direct patronage of the government: all 45 Scottish MPs owed their seats to patronage. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform.|$|E

25|$|The {{land was}} too wet and cold {{to be used}} for wheat but was ideal for the hardy Pennine sheep, so {{agriculture}} was predominantly pastoral. Most of the land was owned by the Howards and was leasehold and it was only in Whitfield that there was any <b>freehold</b> <b>land.</b> The few houses were solid, built of the local stone, and allowed for the development of home industries such as wool spinning and weaving.|$|E
25|$|The first Europeans were {{presented}} with well watered alluvial flats along Enoggera Creek, partly covered with scrub and presumably seen to include land suitable for cultivation. The land beyond the creek flats and {{in the foothills of}} the Taylor Range had better soil derived from the granite and was suitable for grazing. These were the factors that set the pattern for the sale of firstly leasehold and then <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> by the crown in the pre-separation period.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known formal occupancy {{and use of}} {{the area}} by Europeans dates from 1849 when the first crown leases along Enoggera Creek were offered at public auction. The annual rent was 10 shillings per square mile. The area grossing 7020 acres which contained St Johns Wood was taken up by Darby McGrath in 1851 and was known as 'The Gap Station' on which he ran sheep. It is presumed that the lease of 'The Gap Station' was later extinguished by the crown as the granting of <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> tenure spread along Enoggera Creek from 1856.|$|E
50|$|These attainders had a {{much greater}} impact {{on the people of}} Ulster. The 1603 peace {{arrangement}} with the three lords was ended, as they had broken its conditions by leaving the kingdom without permission, and their remaining <b>freehold</b> <b>lands</b> were confiscated. Chichester proposed a new plantation of settlers from England, Wales and Scotland, sponsored in part by the City of London merchants, which became known as the Plantation of Ulster. This had an enormous negative impact on the lower class Gaelic-culture inhabitants of Ulster.|$|R

25|$|The {{dominant}} land tenure in the Great Western Woodlands is Unallocated Crown Land (UCL), which makes up 60% of the area. UCL {{is the lowest}} category of land classification under Western Australian state law – sometimes called ‘orphan country’. Pastoral leases cover 20% of the area. Conservation reserves of various types represent about 15% of the region, with Class A conservation protection over 3.6% of the land, Class B on 4.5% and Class C on 4.5%. Class B and C reserves have relatively little security of tenure, while Class A reserves require parliamentary approval for any tenure changes. The remaining land in the Great Western Woodlands is divided between shire reserves, Crown reserves and <b>freehold</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
25|$|The founders' {{financial}} and legal structure, {{adapted from the}} model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, {{but this was not}} evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model {{and the way in which}} plots were seemingly sold as <b>freehold</b> <b>land,</b> the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the {{government}} {{set up a}} Land Planning Committee, whose first report recommended that government should re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of {{about two-thirds of the}} British Central Africa Company’s <b>freehold</b> <b>land.</b> The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to {{the government}}. However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area {{in the western part of}} Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954. Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby made it clear he would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring voluntary agreement. By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company’s plans to retain its estates. In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands. However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets. At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates. The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.|$|E
50|$|At {{first it}} is {{probable}} that all free inhabitant householders could vote.. In 1430, legislation limited the franchise to only those who owned the <b>freehold</b> of <b>land</b> that brought in an annual rent of at least 40 shillings (forty-shilling freeholders).|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a rising cost of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of <b>freehold</b> <b>lands</b> that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms that were once owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|R
50|$|Queenstown Hill is {{also home}} to a farm {{consisting}} of 1800 sheep which is owned and operated by the Middletons who purchased the lease in 1963 and <b>freeholded</b> the <b>land</b> in 1978. The Queenstown Hill Time Walk is part of the land owned by the Middletons.|$|R
25|$|Tensions between estate {{owners and}} tenants {{remained}} high {{up to the}} early 1950s. In the overcrowded Cholo district, the British Central Africa Company treated tenants on its tea estates harshly. There were riots in 1945, and between 1950 and 1953 the company tried to evict about 1,250 tenants and increase the rents of the rest. Many refused to pay rent or taxes and occupied land on undeveloped parts of company estates. Serious riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, leading to eleven dead and seventy-two injured. The Abrahams Commission (also known the 1946 Land Commission) was appointed by the Nyasaland government in 1946 to inquire into land issues in Nyasaland following riots and disturbances by tenants on European-owned estates in Blantyre districts in 1943 and 1945. Abrahams proposed that the Nyasaland government should purchase all unused or under-used <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> on the estates, which would become Crown land allocated to African smallholders as Native Trust Land. Africans on the estates were to be offered the choice of remaining there as workers or tenants, or of moving to Crown land. The programme of land acquisition accelerated after 1951, and by 1957 the government had negotiated the purchase {{of most of the}} land it had targeted. By June 1954, 350,000 acres had been re-acquired, leaving only 3.7% of Nyasaland's land in estates. At independence in 1964, this had been reduced to less than 2% per cent.|$|E
25|$|The Abrahams Commission (also {{known the}} Land Commission) was a {{commission}} {{appointed by the}} Nyasaland government in 1946 to enquire into land issues in Nyasaland following riots and disturbances by tenants on European-owned estates in Blantyre and Cholo districts in 1943 and 1945. It had only one member, Sir Sidney Abrahams, a Privy Counsellor and lawyer, the former Attorney General of the Gold Coast, Zanzibar and Uganda, and former Chief Justice of Uganda and then Ceylon. There had been previous reviews considering the uneven distribution of land between Africans and European, the shortage of land for subsistence farming and the position of tenants on private estates. These included the Jackson Land Commission in 1920, the Ormsby-Gore East Africa Commission on 1924 and most recently the Bell Commission on the Financial Position and Development of Nyasaland in 1938, but none provided a permanent solution. Abrahams proposed that the Nyasaland government should purchase all unused or under-utilised <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> on European-owned estates which would become Crown land, available to African farmers. The Africans on estates were to be offered the choice of remaining on the estate as workers or tenants or of moving to Crown land. These proposals were not implemented in full until 1952. The report of the Abrahams Commission divided opinion. Africans were generally in favour of its proposals, as was the governor from 1942 to 1947, Edmund Richards (who had proposed {{the establishment of a}} Land Commission), and the incoming governor, Geoffrey Colby. Estate owners and managers were strongly against it, and many European settlers bitterly attacked it.|$|E
