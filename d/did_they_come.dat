Barlett commented to the Gleaner, [...] "We {{just have to say}} that care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in portraying images of our destination and people, Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [...] ". Mavado's manager defended the video, stating, [...] "The concept that they came up with, where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> up with that?

It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So you know what they said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor." [...] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, [...] "I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner." ...|$|E
2500|$|The news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi {{scholar at}} the London School of Economics, as saying: [...] "The {{reception}} [...] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people {{have been talking about}} here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners." ...|$|E
