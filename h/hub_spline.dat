5000|$|Freehub-- The {{mechanism}} {{that allows the}} rider to coast {{is built into the}} <b>hub.</b> <b>Splines</b> on the freehub body allow a single sprocket or, more commonly, a cassette containing several sprockets to be slid on. A lock ring then holds the cog(s) in place. This is the case for most modern bicycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with ball bearings, a <b>splined</b> <b>hub,</b> and clutch plates. In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R
50|$|Most applications, however, do {{not need}} true zero {{backlash}} and can use a spline type connection. Some of these connections between the armature and the <b>hub</b> are standard <b>splines</b> others are hex or square <b>hub</b> designs. The <b>spline</b> will have the best initial backlash tolerance. Typically around 2° but the spline and the other connection types can wear over time and the tolerances will increase.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{initially}} named Rudge-Whitworth Milano, as the <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> locking mechanism was licensed from the Coventry-based Rudge-Whitworth, which had developed the patents since 1908. It {{was run by}} Carlo Borrani at Via Ugo Bassi 9, and quickly became supplier for Alfa Romeo, Bianchi, Lancia and other racing cars, used by such drivers as Enzo Ferrari when winning the first Coppa Acerbo in Pescara (1924). Leadership transferred to Cesare Borrani in 1937.|$|R
50|$|In {{each case}} the shaft or <b>hub</b> had three <b>splines.</b> In {{machines}} {{designed to allow}} for vertical mounting, {{the upper part of}} the shaft or hub could commonly be rotated by 60° so the upper splines locked the reel in place. Some tape decks could accommodate either format by using removable hubs for the larger reel size. When in use these hubs were locked onto the cine spindles by the same mechanism used to secure the smaller reels.|$|R

Other features included 17 mm <b>splined</b> <b>hubs,</b> a wheelie bar, Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system, dual waterproof digital high-torque steering servos, heavy duty slipper clutch, 6.3 inch [...] "Giant Maxx" [...] tires, white progressive rate springs, black-chrome wheels and bumpers, and new paint and graphics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{a method}} of data fusion based on contour of parts is {{proposed}} for multi-factors measurement. Contour of the parts {{is used as a}} reference to fusing data because it is more sensitive to the angular changes than other parts and the relative positions between the contour and other individual part are fixed. This method not only is a reference to fuse data from multi-sensors, but also could apply feedback control for the measurement system. A key part of automotive transmission named <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> has been used in the verification experiment in which the principle and structure of the measurement system is introduced...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|R
50|$|The Alfine 500 group, first {{introduced}} at Eurobike in 2006, included the epicyclic hub gear SG-S500. The internal mechanical {{design of the}} gear hub was based on that of the Shimano Nexus Inter 8, with two stepped planetary series, 5th gear being 1:1 direct drive, thus offering 8 speeds with percent intervals of 22,16,14,18,22,16,14, and an overall gear range of 307%, yet in a more attractive design than the Nexus, with better seals allowing slightly greater ruggedness, more attractive auxiliary components such as e.g. a ratcheting trigger shifter similar to the high-end Shimano derailleur shifters, and a <b>hub</b> shell with <b>splines</b> for mounting a disc brake rotor of the center lock standard. These mechanisms are grease-lubricated.|$|R
50|$|Rear trials hubs tend to {{be divided}} into two main types based on the dropout spacing they are {{designed}} for, 135 mm and 116 mm, sometimes referred to as 110 mm, with the remaining 6 mm occupied by snail cams, which are a popular means of tensioning the chain in horizontal dropout frames. Of the shorter hubs, almost all of them are 'screw-on' hubs, where the sprocket or freewheel that is fitted to the hub screws onto the side of the hub. There are some hubs of this length that have a freewheel mechanism built into them, most of which are used mainly in BMX. There are also a small number of <b>hubs</b> with a <b>splined</b> section machined onto the side of the hub where a sprocket can be attached with no freewheel mechanism.|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 121 - 138 In {{rotating}} equipment, torque {{is usually}} transmitted from shafts to coupling <b>hubs</b> through keys, <b>splines,</b> friction, {{or a combination}} of these. Not covered in this tutorial are applications where the rotating equipment has integral flanges that bolt to the coupling. The type of interface, the fit, and materials used are dependent on the criticality of the equipment. Equipment can be classified into general purpose and special purpose. General purpose equipment includes machines such as pumps that are spared. If they fail or require maintenance the operation does not shut down or slow down. In contrast special purpose equipment (compressor, generator) is critical to the process and if it is unavailable the entire plant might slow down, shut down, or might incur a safety incident or environmental incidence. Generally special purpose equipment and more sophistication is justified {{in the design of the}} interface. The type of interface has also a lot to do with several other issues, including: ?	Ease of assembly/disassembly ?	Reliability of connection ?	How much torque can be transmitted ?	Field conditions Most commonly for general purpose equipment keys with setscrews are used on a small horsepower applications. For larger horsepower applications keys with interference bores are common. For critical equipment the most common interface is keys with interference. As the application gets more critical and power dense, keyless shrink drives and integral flanges become common. Tight fitted splines are common in aircraft derivative gas turbines. The various types are covered in some detail for general purpose and special purpose applications. Covered also is how to assemble some of the most common types. Other issues such as who should bore the couplings, how does one fit bores and keys, and what needs to be considered when specifying interfaces is discussed. They types of couplings that are used on general purpose applications versus special purpose applications are discussed first...|$|R
5000|$|The wheel {{diameter}} on a trials unicycle is usually 19" [...] or 20", as this allows greater maneuverability {{due to the}} short circumference of the wheel. Most Trials unicycles come with 19" [...] rear rims as used on 20" [...] (or mod) trials bicycles. This allows for larger tyres to be fitted which can help provide bounce and preload for jumping, and aid stability being generally quite wide (some up to 2.5 inches).A smaller wheel also means the unicycle is lighter, although some riders prefer larger wheels. The tire is generally wide and thick, giving a large air volume. This is to cushion drops and allow large hops and jumps. The tire will often have a deep tread to allow greater grip to obstacles. Strong high tension spokes and a strong rim wheel rim is used to prevent the wheel from deforming under the great stresses exerted on it by jumping. Unicycle wheels have to withstand large lateral stresses because, unlike in conventional riding, the rider may jump sideways. Many trials unicycles have a <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> and cranks, as this design {{tends to be more}} resistant to bending and breaking than the more common cotterless, or square taper, equivalent. Long cranks give the rider extra torque and pedals with a large amount of grip (often with pins or teeth) are used to prevent the rider's feet from slipping. Unicycles with shorter cranks are generally referred to as street unicycles, as they let the rider keep up their momentum easier and do smooth tricks. Whereas Trials unicycles usually have longer cranks that are better for hopping, as the rider has better control of the rotation of the wheel, and can therefore keep the unicycle from slipping out from under him.|$|R
