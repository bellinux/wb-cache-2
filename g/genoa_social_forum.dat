25|$|The {{police raid}} on the school, which housed protesters linked to the <b>Genoa</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum,</b> took place {{a few minutes before}} midnight when most guests were already asleep. The raid was {{initiated}} by mobile police units from Rome, followed by more units from Genoa and Milan. Battalions of the Carabinieri did not actively participate in the raid, but limited themselves to surround the perimeter and areas adjacent to the school. Mark Covell, a British journalist, was the first person who met the police outside the building and was assaulted, leaving him in a coma. During the raid the police violently attacked those who were in the school, injuring 82 people {{out of a total of}} 93 arrested. Among the arrested, 63 were taken to hospital and 19 were taken to the police station of Bolzaneto. According to the reconstruction of events given in subsequent investigations, evidence was planted after the raid to justify the brutality of the raid. Senior police officers planted two Molotov cocktails recovered elsewhere in the school, delivered to them by General Valerio Donnini that afternoon. Police also planted construction tools, hammers and knives from a nearby construction site and claimed they belonged to anarchist groups housed in the building. A police officer, Massimo Nucera, showed a slash in his bulletproof vest, claiming he was knifed by a violent demonstrator. However, the knife was never identified. He was later convicted of forgery and defamation, and it was later revealed that he cut his own vest to claim resistors were violent, and thus justify the brutality of the raid.|$|E

50|$|The Southeast <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> {{grew out}} of the World <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> process that began in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2001. Between 2001 and 2006, the <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> process had spread to {{numerous}} countries around the world. However, some organizers in the World <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> process had felt that the United States was not ready for a Social Forum—although this belief was contested, and ultimately disproven by the success of the Boston <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> in July 2004. It was eventually decided that there was a definite need to begin a national <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> process in the US, since many social justice activists believe that the world's most serious social problems are being continually worsened by the policies of the US government and US companies. The US <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> in Atlanta was originally slated for 2006, but following Hurricane Katrina, it was moved to 2007 and organizers decided that a 2006 gathering would take place somewhere in the Southeast to help build momentum toward the 2007 event.|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} {{analyzes the}} <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> process through two intrinsically related dimensions. First, it places {{the emergence of}} the <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> phenomenon in the broader transformations towards neoliberal capitalism. It thus puts renewed emphasis on the often side-stepped structuring power of capitalism and class as analytic lenses for {{a deeper understanding of the}} alter-globalization movement in general and <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> process in particular. From this vantage point, movements and groups of the alter-globalization movement are not merely unconnected struggles over the particular but they are potential instantiations of struggles over class formation. <b>Social</b> <b>forums</b> are then arenas for convergences that could lead to a new 21 st century class formation; a class formation keyed to neoliberal capitalism that would take on a very different form than during Fordism. Second, the study analyzes the <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> process—or what I am calling the 2 ̆ 2 Global <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> Rhizome 2 ̆ 2 —as a strategic instrument of the alter-globalization movement by examining them as 2 ̆ 2 resistance relays. 2 ̆ 2 I suggest that <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> 2 ̆ 7 unique organizational matrix has allowed for an ongoing process of 2 ̆ 7 becoming-other-together. 2 ̆ 7 <b>Social</b> <b>forums</b> as relays provide the context and act as catalyst for generating linkages, mobilizations and convergences of this multi-centered 2 ̆ 2 movement of movements. 2 ̆ 2 As such, <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> can be understood as instantiations of an emerging new stage in social movement based organizing, which the study labels the 2 ̆ 2 Rhizomatic Left. 2 ̆ 2 However, the anarchist-inspired politics of <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> generate their own limits and shortcomings that this dissertation also addresses. The study stretches across various physical and virtual sites. The research relied on two main strategies: following online <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> related discussion and conducting on-site field work at <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> in addition to critically reviewing various academic literatures on social movements in general and <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> in particular. ...|$|R

40|$|The World <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> {{quickly became}} the largest {{political}} gathering in human history and continues to offer a direct challenge to the extreme inequities of corporate-led globalization. It has expanded beyond a single event to spin-offs {{in a variety of}} countries including the United States. The forums are an experiment in global and participatory democracy, bringing together networks, organizations, and activists {{from around the world to}} create visions of a just and liberated global society. All of the authors involved in this book have participated in World <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> around the globe. Recounting dozens of dramatic firsthand experiences from their attendance, these authors draw on their knowledge of global politics to introduce the World <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> process, explain its foundations, and discuss its relevance to ongoing transnational efforts toward freedom, peace, and democracy. In the new edition, Global Democracy shows how the World <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> have grown and developed since their inception in 2001 and how they are now connected with other global movements including Occupy, the Arab Spring, and beyond.

I use a multi-approach methodology, combining direct observation, focus groups, interviews, and documentary analysis. I show that despite strong national differences, a highly decentralized process, and the strong autonomy of local actors, local <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> share structural characteristics, and the expression “social forum” is associated with ways of doing things that limit the variety of local <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> initiatives: organizers share a common intentionality; the mode of operation of local <b>social</b> <b>forum</b> process and event belong to the same political culture and translate into the same practices; and the outputs of these gatherings are similar in terms of the building of ties.
