5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.|$|E

5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, we can <b>imagine</b> <b>that,</b> for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as}} an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

25|$|Ancient authors {{seemed to}} believe, incorrectly, that sling-bullets could {{penetrate}} armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their {{passage through the}} air, would melt in flight.
