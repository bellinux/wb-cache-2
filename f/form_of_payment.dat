500|$|In John, Jesus' miracles are {{described}} as [...] "signs", performed to prove his mission and divinity. However, in the Synoptics, when asked by some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority, Jesus refuses, saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except {{the sign of the}} prophet Jonah. Also, in the Synoptic Gospels, the crowds regularly respond to Jesus' miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick. In John's Gospel, Jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds, who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith. One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of Jesus also often include teachings, and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching. Many of the miracles teach the importance of faith. In the cleansing of ten lepers and the raising of Jairus' daughter, for instance, the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their faith.|$|E

Aigler opposed the move, saying: [...] "You can't give athletic scholarships without aspiring to the sigma of professionalism[...] [...] [...] Other schools have tried it, and if the practice enjoys widespread continuance, it will prove the doom of collegiate sport." [...] Aigler argued that scholarships were a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> that undermined the concept of the unpaid student athlete. He said: [...] "Those college teams made up of scholarship holders and the like should be grouped with the Giants, Redskins, Bears, etc., instead of with those teams made up of bona fide college students to whom athletic participation must be secondary." [...] On another occasion, he urged schools granting athletic scholarships, though [...] "ostensibly amateur", to [...] "turn square and associate themselves with the Washington Redskins and Green Bay Packers." ...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{developments}} in technology have brought about {{new methods of}} retail payment-such as remote banking, electronic cash, and debit, stored-value, and smart cards-that were unavailable a decade ago. Some observers believe that these alternative payment methods will differ from traditional methods not only in a technological but also in an economic sense and will alter how consumers and businesses interact.; This article examines the question of whether, {{from the standpoint of}} economic theory, there is or will likely be anything new about these new <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> The author describes some of the conflicts of interest that confront all types <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> systems in market economies.
