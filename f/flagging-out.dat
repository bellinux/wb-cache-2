40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the flagging-in and -out behaviour of Greek shipowners {{during the past}} fifty years. It is argued that this behaviour has not {{been affected by the}} growth of the relevant fleet. Instead, practices followed by other competing maritime nations, may have affected Greek <b>flagging-out,</b> e. g. the phenomenon of parallel and other registries that emerged in Europe and elsewhere at the end, and as a result, of the 1981 – 1987 shipping crisis. The concept of ‘efficient flag’ is used in the paper as a working definition. An efficient flag is defined as one that provides an economical, political, legal and general framework in which companies are able to make efficient use of resources (money, people, ships). An attempt has also been made to determine the size of Greek shipping companies that flagged-out between 1979 and 1998. Moreover, two related topics have been analysed: a) the Greek shipping policy in the period 1953 – 1998 and its effectiveness in preventing and counteracting flagging-out; and b) the important issue of the competitiveness of the Greek flagged vessel. Finally, a new maritime policy is proposed, based on a vessel ‘point system’, that balances the benefits offered to ships with the targets of the Administration so that flagging-in is attained and <b>flagging-out</b> reversed.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the annual CO 2 emissions by international shipping over the 2007 - 2009 period. Once {{controlling for the}} recent changes in activity levels in international trade, we evidence a slow-down of the total volume emitted in 2009. Using an exhaustive dataset of the world fleet, we provide international rankings in CO 2 emissions both by country of ownership and by flag of registry of vessels. We finally study how, through <b>flagging-out,</b> most ship-owners from developed countries are implicitly exporting a share of their CO 2 emissions under foreign flags. This suggests that a system based on taxes or quotas to be applied by vessel type {{rather than by the}} country of ownership or flag of registry may be more efficient to reduce CO 2 emissions in shipping. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} of the markets in the late 1980 s proved to be insufficient in restoring the traditional western registries to anywhere near their levels before the long period of crisis triggered off in 1973. The recent downturn in the dry bulk sector has triggered again the discussion {{on the role of}} manning costs and the terms of registration of ships. Yet, as demonstrated by the different impact of the crisis of the 1970 s and the 1980 s on the various major fleets, the resilience of shipping companies is a much more complex issue. This article attempts to assess to what extent the prerequisites for being competitive in shipping exceed the simple [...] and simplistic [...] notion of low manning costs; reviewing the last developments in fleet registration, with a special focus on the Greek flag, It highlights further the different context in which business and policy decisions have to be taken nowadays by traditional maritime nations.

40|$|We {{stress the}} basic pillars of EU's Maritime Policy: 'competition, quality ships, and short sea shipping'. EU {{expressed}} its dissatisfaction with IMO, destined, by shipping community, to safeguard safety. This emerged after 1985, when national flags created parallel registries. The common maritime policy was absent from 1957 till 1986, {{due to the}} unanimity principle, as argued. The qualified majority adopted, but unfortunately, for decisions in maritime matters, it remained {{as it was when}} the Union was established. This paper found it fair to propose a new allocation of votes among MS, when maritime matters are decided, based on fleet owned under national flag. Great achievement for the Union in 1986 was the four regulations, 4055 - 4058, reinforcing competition and recognised as the foundation of EU Maritime Policy. <b>Flagging-out</b> during the crisis of 1981 - 1987 remained. In 1989, EU proposed the so called 'positive measures', one of which was to establish an EU Register of ships, which failed twice. EU Maritime Policy was driven by marine accidents and quality shipping thereafter to this day. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E
40|$|This study {{takes its}} {{departure}} in the difficulties {{to recruit and}} retain qualified senior seafarers in the Swedish shipping sector. The study focus is on seafarers' motivation at work for the specific shipping company (organizational commitment), and seafarers' motivation towards their occupation (occupational commitment), in times of flagging out. It was hypothesized that the youngest seafarers and the oldest may be most sensitive to foreign registration of ships. Statistical analyses were employed, using a survey material of 1, 309 Swedish seafarers randomly collected in 2010 from a national register of seafarers. The results of the analyses show that <b>flagging-out</b> imposes a significant decline in organizational commitment for all seafarers. This decline {{is related to the}} perception of the social composition of crew. In addition, the oldest seafarers (age 55 +) demonstrate diminished occupational commitment under a foreign flag. This decline is related to the degree of satisfaction with the social security structure. Occupational commitment among the youngest seafarers (age 19 - 30) is not affected by the nationality of flag. However, this type of commitment is decreasing by the time served on the same ship. This effect is partly related to a decline in satisfaction with the work content. In the concluding discussion, the findings are discussed in more details and recommendations are put forward...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} of Swedish {{seafarers}} was to investigate attitudes, perceptions and work experiences in the seafaring occupation. The study was undertaken partly in response {{to the needs of the}} shipping industry to recruit and retain qualified Seafarers, and partly because of political ambitions to extend people’s working lives in general. The two main areas of enquiry were seafarers’ motivations to work for the specific shipping company (organizational commitment) and seafarers’ motivations for working in their particular occupation (occupational commitment). The study is based on survey responses from a sample of 1, 309 seafarers taken from the Swedish Register of Seafarers. The study has shown that the seafaring occupation has strong influence on identity construction and that job satisfaction is generally high. Seafarers enjoy and are motivated by their job content. The study also, however, observed a number of challenges for Swedish shipping. It emerged that flagging out – registration of ships abroad – impairs commitment to the particular shipping company and that perceptions of the social composition on board are one underlying cause. Specifically for older seafarers (55 +), <b>flagging-out</b> also resulted in a distinct decline in commitment to the occupation in general. The cause in this case is the perceived inadequacy of the social security structure. Occupational commitment otherwise increases with age and seafarers in the oldest category appear to find the seafaring life unproblematic. In this respect, there is a clear difference compared to the youngest seafarers (aged 19 - 30), a large proportion of whom believe it is likely they will leave the occupation within the next few years. The first two chapters of the report present the general aims of the study along with those aspects of shipping and the situations of seafarers in 2009 - 2010 relevant to the aims. The third chapter presents a selection of earlier Swedish maritime research. Work and commitment are discussed, based on theory and international studies, in the fourth chapter, where the study aims are also defined in greater detail. Chapter five presents the approach to data collection and processing. Results are reported and analyzed thereafter in three separate results chapters. In the final chapter, the most important results are brought to the fore and discussed along with associated recommendations and suggestions for future research.

40|$|Thesis (D. Tech. -Teacher Education) [...] Cape TechnikonThe {{maritime}} industry in South Africa (RSA) {{is relatively small}} in comparison with its agricultural and mining industries. In its broadest sense it includes, but is not limited to. • cargo handling and stevedoring; • cargo logistics and administration; • vessel owning and operating with its related industries, such as ships' agents and surveyors and • an array of fishing industries. Maritime education and training in the RSA is fragmented and is offered by technikons (Higher Education and Training Band), technical colleges and training centres (Further Higher Education and Training Bands). Courses offered serve as preparation for Department of Education (National and Provincial) and Department of Transport, Chief Directorate: Shipping (SADoT) examinations. Aspiring officers find {{it increasingly difficult to}} complete their experiential training owing to vessel owners <b>flagging-out</b> (registering South African vessels under flags of convenience, e. g. Panama, in a bid to save on operating costs). This implies that cheaper foreign crews may be recruited resulting in an increased deficiency of skilled manpower. The fishing quota system is being revised by the all-inclusive Fisheries Policy Development Committee (FPDC) appointed by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. This implies that learners from the previously disadvantaged maritime communities (mainly unskilled) will imminently be allowed access to marine resources. The heterogeneous composition of the class groups, with particular reference to • academic qualification, • age distribution, • categories of fishing industries served, • employer, • mother tongue and • sea-service, exacerbated by the inadequate fixed time constraints of course durations, grossly violates the didactic principle of individualisation. For this reason, a didactically accountable instruction-learning programme for aspirant navigating officers in the fishing industry was formulated in an attempt to remedy current shortcomings in the Maritime Education and Training Development (METD) process. The outcomes based instructional design encompassed the models utilized by Fraser et al (1994 : 102) and Tanner & Tanner (1995 : 239) because it is vocationally directed and can accommodate the diversity of the adult target group of adult learners. The history and development of, as well as courses offered by, Maritime Education and Training Providers (METP's) in the Western Cape Province, i. e. • Cape Technikon's Department of Maritime Studies, • industry in-house training establishments, • Training Centre for Seamen and • Wingfield Technical College was outlined. An analysis of similar courses offered by METP's abroad, such as • Australian Maritime College, • Canadian Fisheries and Marine Institute of the Memorial University of Newfoundland, • Danish Maritime Authority, • Manukau Polytechnic, New Zealand Maritime School, • National Taiwan Ocean University of the Republic of China on Taiwan and • the Republic of Namibia was made. An empirical investigation by means of questionnaires to vessel-owners and employee representatives in the South African fishing industry were executed in order to establish their training needs and expectations. From the data collated, an outcomes-based Navigating Officer Limited: Fishing (Vessels less than 24 metres) instruction-learning programme was formulated in National Qualifications Framework (NQF) format...|$|E
