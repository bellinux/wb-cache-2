Sediments from Hess Rise provide a discontinuous record of eolian MARs. During Albian to Cenomanian time, the influx of volcanic material was fairly high (0. 35 - 0. 6 g/cm** 2 / 10 ** 3 yr), recording the latest stages of the Albian volcanism that formed Hess Rise. From the Campanian through the Paleocene, influx of <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment</b> was low, averaging 0. 03 g/cm** 2 / 10 ** 3 yr. None of the four Hess Rise drill sites show evidence of the Late Cretaceous volcanic episode recorded at many sites now in the equatorial to subtropical Pacific.

40|$|Sheets of <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment</b> cover {{many areas}} of the earth's urface, sand seas, dune fields, and loess sheets being the best known {{examples}} of such features. Less well known are deposits of sandy, <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment</b> forming extensive plains. An excellent example of such a region is the semi-arid Southern High Plains (northwest Texas and eastern New Mexico). The level landscape of the area was created by depositon of multiple, extensive (, ~ 80, 000 km 2) sheets of <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment</b> (Biackwater Draw Formation) over the past 1. 4 + Ma. This deposit grades from sandy (southwest) o silty and clayey (northeast) and is up to 27 m thick. Surface soils (at least 30, 000 and possibly 120, 000 years old) are well developed (5 YR hues, agrillic horizons, 1 - 2 m thick with prismatic structure, Stage II-III calcic horizons) and are generally Paleus-tolls and Paleustalfs, with some Paleargids and Haplargids. Morphologic variation isdue mainly to textural variation of the eolian parent material, although locally thickness of the parent material nd wind erosion and cumulization are impor-tant factors, and locally slight variation in effective precipitation may be significant. The Blackwater Draw Formation contains as many as six well-developed buried soils, each formed in individual layers of <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment,</b> similar to or more strongly expressed (2. SYR hues, higher illuvial clay content) than the regional surface soils. The presence of the buried soils indicates that sedimentation was episodic and separated by long periods of relative landscape stability.

The Peró {{coastal plain}} {{is one of}} the three {{morphological}} compartments located between Búzios and Arraial do Cabo, on the east coast of Rio de Janeiro State, characterized by the occurrence of dune fields, driven by northeasterly winds, obliquely oriented in relation to the coastline.

The results indicate that during the period of investigation sediment transport from the beach-foredune to the main dune field was largely inhibited by the presence of vegetation, and that sediment transport was limited to the reworking of its own sediment stock. Climatic oscillation toward drier periods, whether the result of global climate change or local variation in the duration of the dry period, will probably trigger the <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment</b> transport due to the reduction of the vegetation cover resulting in the migration of the main dune field towards urban areas.

40|$|Soils with andic {{features}} {{are known to}} be very important as regards both ecosystem fertility and susceptibility to land degradation. In recent years there has been an increasing number of finds of these soils in non-volcanic mountain ecosystems (NVME) {{in different parts of the}} world under different environmental settings. In Italian NVME there has been extensive investigation proving that these soils have a much wider distribution than previously thought. But despite these important findings, very little is known about their genesis or properties. Against this background, our investigation aims to question the nature of parent material in andic soils in Italian NVME; we consider this question fundamental for proper understanding of such soils. We address the question of the parent material by highlighting similarities/dissimilarities between soils and their underlying bedrocks and ascertaining whether soils developed as a result of in situ weathering or because of eolian inputs. The study was conducted on 41 soil profiles distributed throughout Italian NVME, performing an integrated analysis of (i) grain-size distribution (GSD) by laser granulometry, (ii) end-member modelling of obtained GSD, (iii) soil???bedrock differences in magnetic susceptibility, and (iv) soil???bedrock differences based on the geochemistry of 38 elements. The final results from these investigations show that the investigated soils are mainly derived from <b>eolian</b> <b>sediments</b> and that weathering of the underlying bedrock plays a minor role. Two main types of eolian parent materials seem to coexist in different proportions according to the soil type: <b>eolian</b> <b>sediments</b> with a similar composition of the underlying bedrock (termed autochthonous loess) and <b>eolian</b> <b>sediments</b> of volcanic type (pyroclasts).

40|$|Recent stratigraphic {{studies in}} central Alaska have yielded the {{unexpected}} finding {{that there is}} little evidence for full-glacial (late Wisconsin) loess deposition. Because the loess record of western Alaska is poorly exposed and not well known, we analyzed a core from Zagoskin Lake, a maar lake on St. Michael Island, to determine if a full-glacial eolian record could be found in that region. Particle size and geochemical data indicate that the mineral fraction of the lake sediments is not derived from the local basalt and is probably eolian. Silt deposition took place from at least {{the latter part of the}} mid-Wisconsin interstadial period through the Holocene, based on radiocarbon dating. Based on the locations of likely loess sources, eolian silt in western Alaska was probably deflated by northeasterly winds from glaciofluvial sediments. If last-glacial winds that deposited loess were indeed from the northeast, this reconstruction is in conflict with a model-derived reconstruction of paleowinds in Alaska. Mass accumulation rates in Zagoskin Lake were higher during the Pleistocene than during the Holocene. In addition, more <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment</b> is recorded in the lake sediments than as loess on the adjacent landscape. The thinner loess record on land may be due to the sparse, herb tundra vegetation that dominated the landscape in full-glacial time. Herb tundra would have been an inefficient loess trap compared to forest or even shrub tundra due to its low roughness height. The lack of abundant, full-glacial, eolian silt deposition in the loess stratigraphic record of central Alaska may be due, therefore, to a mimimal ability of the landscape to trap loess, rather than a lack of available <b>eolian</b> <b>sediment...</b>|$|E

Three zones characterized by different intensities of salt-dust storms and located at different distances from the lake were distinguished. The relationship between the intensity of salt-dust storms, the composition of <b>eolian</b> <b>sediments,</b> and the amount of soil salts was established. In the first zone (zone I) with the most intensive storms, the redistribution of eolian material-blowing out, transportation, and accumulation-is observed. Strongly saline chloride solonchaks predominate in this zone. In the second zone (zone II), soils with chloride-sulfate and sulfate-chloride salinization predominate. The third zone (zone III), at a distance of more than 100 km from the lake, is characterized by the least intensity and frequency of storms and the least salinity of soils. In recent decades, the landscape degradation in western Dzungaria has increased under the impact of salt storms...|$|R

This paper reconstructs the list of most probable late Pleistocene Beringian lowland grass species from biogeographical evidence. Late Pleistocene <b>eolian</b> <b>sediments</b> and buried soils indicate that {{large areas of the}} Beringian lowlands had nutrient-rich, silty soils that occurred over ice-rich permafrost but were generally not waterlogged. A list of likely grasses was compiled from all species that have been recorded on similar fine-grained, mesic-to-dry lowland soils (i. e., presumed refugia) and are distributed at least sporadically across the whole region today. Grasses from 13 genera met these criteria, including most of the taxa that have been identified as late Pleistocene fossils from the study area. Most of these grasses are high-latitude species of genera that are also common in temperate latitudes (e. g., Elymus, Festuca, and Poa). This diverse group of plants has a wide range of adaptations today, suggesting that grasses would have been available to occupy a variety of habitats through Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Among these grasses are a number of highly productive forage species...|$|R
