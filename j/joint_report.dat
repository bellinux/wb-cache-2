5|$|In 1960, Democrat Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first {{introduced}} legislation for a feasibility study {{to survey the}} area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted {{that it was not}} designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 <b>joint</b> <b>report</b> by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan, another Senator from Idaho, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's members of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 <b>joint</b> <b>report</b> of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether patient characteristics can predict change in health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) scores or change {{in the number of}} painful <b>joints</b> <b>reported</b> by children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome at eighteen months following the initial assessment. Methods: Children with JHS and one of their parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4. 0 Generic Core Scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and the Pediatric Pain Questionnaire. Demographic and anthropometric measures, joint hypermobility, foot posture, strength, balance, walking capacity, physical activity and reported symptoms were recorded at baseline and again 18 months later. Stepwise multiple regression was undertaken to {{determine whether}} any combination of measures could predict the change in HRQOL and number of painful <b>joints</b> <b>reported</b> 18 months following initial assessment. Results: Eighty nine children (50 girls) aged 6 – 16 years were assessed at baseline. Sixty-three children (35 girls, mean age 11. 2 years) were assessed 18 months later. HRQOL remained stable in 49 children, improved in 6, and declined in 8 children. Thirty-four {{percent of the variance in}} the change in child-reported HRQOL scores 18 months following baseline could be accounted for by four baseline variables – HRQOL score, body mass index centile for age, foot posture and the total number of <b>reported</b> painful <b>joints</b> (p < 0. 001). For the number of painful <b>joints</b> <b>reported</b> 18 months later, child-reported fatigue and the number of painful <b>joints</b> <b>reported</b> at baseline accounted for 37 % (p < 0. 001) of the variance in the change scores. Conclusions: Factors amenable to change, such as BMI for age and child-reported fatigue, contribute to the decline in both the HRQOL and increase in number of painful joints experienced by children with JHS over an 18 month period. Management strategies aimed at improving these factors may assist in minimising the impact of JHS in some children’s daily lives. 1 page(s...|$|R

25|$|A <b>joint</b> <b>report</b> by the Underground and its {{maintenance}} contractor Tube Lines {{concluded that}} poor track geometry {{was the main}} cause, and that, because of this, extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail.

500|$|In January 1951, Ulam {{had another}} idea: to channel the {{mechanical}} shock {{of a nuclear}} explosion so as to compress the fusion fuel. [...] On the recommendation of his wife, Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it.
