Materials and Methods: Case control study done on two groups of 20 each, age matched type 2 diabetics with/without cardiac autonomic neuropathy and matched with 20 controls of either sex (n= 60). Rate Pressure Product was measured in response to cold pressor and hand grip test. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software by paired and unpaired t test. Results: There was a significant increase in rate pressure product in controls and in patients without autonomic neuropathy after the tests (p 0. 001). The change in RPP (∆RPP) was least in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy and significant in controls and non-neuropathy diabetics using unpaired t-test (p< 0. 05). Resting RPP was recorded highest in diabetic autonomic neuropathy patients. Conclusion: Heightened resting RPP and failure of Rate Pressure Product increment during cardiac sympathetic stimulation promotes aggravated ischemic episodes.

The solar flux variation is modeled as a time series characterized by the subsolar Vertical Total Electron Content double difference in time, computed with dual-frequency GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) measurements in the daylight hemisphere (GNSS solar flare <b>indicator</b> <b>rate</b> parameter).

The sudden overionization pattern {{is assumed to be}} of solar origin, and the data used in this study was collected during the last solar cycle. The two defining characteristics of this time series are an extreme variability (i. e., in a solar cycle one can find events at 400 sigma from the mean value) and a temporal correlation that is independent of the timescale. We give a characterization of a model that explains the empirical results and properties such as (a) the persistence and presence of bursts of solar flares and (b) their long tail peak values of the solar flux variation.

We performed the analysis to identify the association of after surgery complication rates with full time equivalent employees (FTEs) per admission and per patient day, expenses per admission and per patient day and, the percent of total operating expense accounted for by payroll expenses. Design: A cross sectional analysis using inpatient hospital discharge data and financial data from seventy short-term general hospitals, both for-profit and not-for-profit. Methods: Discharge data from year 2000 was obtained from Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). This data was used to calculate Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) related to after surgery complications in 840, 945 hospital discharge records from 70 short-term general hospitals across the state of Florida. The predictor variables include: payroll expenditures per admission, payroll expenditures per patient day, personnel (FTE) per admission, personnel (FTE) per patient day and payroll expense {{as a percent of}} total operating expenses. Main outcome measures: Nine patient safety indicators defined by AHQR and specific to after surgery complications: complications of anesthesia, foreign body left during procedure, postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma, postoperative physiologic and metabolic derangement, postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, postoperative respiratory failure, postoperative sepsis, postoperative wound dehiscence. Results: Patient safety <b>indicator</b> <b>rate</b> showed an inverse relationship with the percent of total operating expense represented by payroll, Personnel per patient day and personnel per admission.

This characteristic, associated with the absence of a strong economic activity, forms a favorable context for the exploration of experiences related to the development of creative economies. There exists as much hand labor there as the necessity to amplify the work potential and income of this population, and while a craft-art activity is practiced, they don't have the necessary knowledge and information to make developed products that have any added value, and as a result, access to a more ample consumer market. 	The project is being developed in the county of Santa Luzia do Itanhy, Sergipe, Brazil; with funding from IDB, Inter-american Development Bank, through the FUMIN program. This county is one of poorest of Brazil and it has the second lowest Human Development <b>Indicator</b> <b>rate</b> (0, 545) of the state of Sergipe (HDI = 0, 731).

This assessment has been mandated for use in these two regions and the indicators are generated directly from items within the assessment. The indicators are expressed as rates of negative outcomes (e. g., falls, dehydration). Client-level risk adjustment of the <b>indicator</b> <b>rates</b> was used to enable fair comparisons between the regions. Results. Clients had a mean age of 83. 2 years, the majority were female (68. 6 %) and the regions were very similar on these demographic characteristics.

The highest quality <b>indicator</b> <b>rates</b> were related to clients who had ADL/rehabilitation potential but were not receiving therapy (range: 66. 8 %- 91. 6 %) and the rate of cognitive decline (65. 4 %- 76. 3 %).

For 13 of the 19 indicators that have risk adjustment, after applying the risk adjustment methodology, the difference between the adjusted rates in the two regions was reduced. Conclusions. Home care clients in these two regions are experiencing a significant level of functional and cognitive impairment, health instability and daily pain. The quality indicators provide some important insight into variations between the two regions and can serve as an important decision-support tool for flagging potential quality issues and isolating areas for improvement.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis project {{evaluated}} if {{by focusing}} on process changes and tool use rather than key <b>indicator</b> <b>rates,</b> the use of evidence-based therapies in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) would increase. BackgroundThe use of tools designed to improve quality of care in the American College of Cardiology AMI Guidelines Applied in Practice Pilot Project resulted in improved adherence to evidence-based therapies for patients, but overall, tool use was modest. MethodsThe current project, implemented in five hospitals, was modeled after the previous project, but with greater emphasis on tool use. This allowed early identification of barriers to tool use and strategies to overcome barriers. Main outcome measures were AMI quality indicators in pre-measurement (January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2001) and post-measurement (December 15, 2001 to March 31, 2002) samples. ResultsOne or more tools were used in 93 % of patients (standard orders = 82 %, and discharge document = 47 %). Tool use was associated with significantly higher adherence to most discharge quality <b>indicator</b> <b>rates</b> with increases in aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and smoking cessation and dietary counseling. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had low <b>rates</b> of discharge <b>indicators.</b> Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization {{were more likely to}} receive evidence-based therapies. ConclusionsThese data validate the results of the pilot project that quality of AMI care can be improved through the use of guideline-based tools. Identifying and overcoming barriers to tool use led to substantially higher rates of tool use. The low rates of adherence to quality indicators in patients undergoing CABG suggest that these patients should be particularly targeted for quality improvement efforts...|$|R
