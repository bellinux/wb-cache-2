50|$|Most level term {{programs}} include a renewal option, {{and allow the}} insured person to renew the policy for a maximum guaranteed rate if the insured period needs to be extended. The renewal {{may or may not}} be guaranteed, and the insured person should review the contract to determine whether evidence of <b>insurability</b> is required to renew the policy. Typically, this clause is invoked only if the health of the insured deteriorates significantly during the term, and poor health would prevent the individual from being able to provide proof of <b>insurability.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the USA, life {{insurance}} companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, {{with the exception of}} Civil Rights Act compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine <b>insurability,</b> and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} to renewal experienced {{with some of these}} policies is requiring proof of <b>insurability.</b> For instance the insured could acquire a terminal illness within the term, but not actually die until after the term expires. Because of the terminal illness, the purchaser would likely be uninsurable after the expiration of the initial term, and would be unable to renew the policy or purchase a new one.|$|E
50|$|An {{individual}} with very low <b>insurability</b> {{may be said}} to be uninsurable, and an insurance company will refuse to issue a policy to such an applicant. For example, an {{individual with}} a terminal illness and a life expectancy of 6 months would be uninsurable for term life insurance. This is because the probability is so high for the individual to die within the term of the insurance, that he/she would present much too high a liability for the insurance company. A similar, and stereotypical, example would be earthquake insurance in California.|$|E

50|$|Group life {{insurance}} (also known as wholesale {{life insurance}} or institutional life insurance) is term insurance covering {{a group of}} people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or superannuation fund. Individual proof of <b>insurability</b> is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of adverse selection. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage.The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.|$|E

50|$|Limited risk of catastrophically large losses. Insurable {{losses are}} ideally {{independent}} and non-catastrophic, {{meaning that the}} one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, {{on the order of}} 5 percent. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., flood risk is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether <b>insurability</b> exists is contested is the case of nanotechnology. In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer’s capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market.|$|E
5000|$|Privacy {{researcher}} Pam Dixon, {{founder of}} the World Privacy Forum, coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime {{for the first time}} and made the plight of victims public. The report's definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself. [...] In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief's medical history may be added to the victim's medical records. Inaccurate information in the victim's records is difficult to correct and may affect future <b>insurability</b> or cause doctors relying on the misinformation to deliver inappropriate medical care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people. Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organisations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.|$|E

This paper correlates non-life insurance penetration in 70 countries with income level, financial sector depth, country risk, a measure of cost of insurance, and the World Bank governance indexes. We find that institutional quality-transparency-uncertainty nexus is the dominant determinant of <b>insurability</b> across countries, surpassing the explanatory power of income level. Institutional quality, as it reflects on the level of uncertainty, is the deeper determinant of <b>insurability.</b> <b>Insurability</b> is lower when governance is weaker.

40|$|Genetic {{stratification}} {{approaches in}} personalized medicine may considerably improve {{our ability to}} predict breast cancer risk for women at higher risk of developing breast cancer. Notwithstanding these advantages, concerns have been raised {{about the use of}} the genetic information derived in these processes, outside of the research and medical health care settings, by third parties such as insurers. Indeed, insurance applicants are asked to consent to insurers accessing their medical information (implicitly including genetic) to verify or determine their <b>insurability</b> level, or eligibility to certain insurance products. This use of genetic information may result in the differential treatment of individuals based on their genetic information, which could lead to higher premium, exclusionary clauses or even the denial of coverage. This phenomenon has been commonly referred to as “Genetic Discrimination” (GD). In the Canadian context, where federal Bill S- 201, An Act to prohibit and prevent genetic discrimination, has recently been enacted but may be subject to constitutional challenges, information about potential risks to <b>insurability</b> may raise issues in the clinical context. We conducted a survey with women in Quebec who have never been diagnosed with breast cancer to document their perspectives. We complemented the research with data from 14 semi-structured interviews with decision-makers in Quebec to discuss institutional issues raised by the use of genetic information by insurers. Our results provide findings on five main issues: (1) the reluctance to undergo genetic screening test due to <b>insurability</b> concerns, (2) insurers' interest in genetic information, (3) the duty to disclose genetic information to insurers, (4) the disclosure of potential impacts on <b>insurability</b> before genetic testing, and (5) the status of genetic information compared to other health data. Overall, both groups of participants (the women surveyed and the decision-makers interviewed) acknowledged having concerns about GD and reported a need for better communication tools discussing <b>insurability</b> risk. Our conclusions regarding concerns about GD and the need for better communication tools in the clinical setting may be transferable to the broader Canadian context...|$|E
40|$|New {{kinds of}} risks {{increasingly}} threaten electronic commerce. The traditional instrument for risk transfer is insurance. Research {{is needed to}} determine whether new Internet risks are insurable. In this article, starting with damage scenarios and damage dimensions, Internet risks are classified and their properties are evaluated by means of decision-oriented <b>insurability</b> criteria. The definition of basic goal-oriented risk sees risk as a violation of the technical protection goals of the multilateral security concept (confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability). These technical security risks, which form the foundation for further economic and social risks, are being further examined. On the basis of the protection goals of multilateral security, existing insurance offers are analysed and statements regarding the <b>insurability</b> of potential violation of individual protection goals are made. The article works out problems resulting from <b>insurability</b> and shows solution approaches regarding the <b>insurability.</b> 1. Scenarios and dimensions of damage High turnover rates and great future perspectives are forecast for e-commerce which characterizes business practice via the open world wide web. On the one hand the Internet offers great opportunities, on the other hand it harbors a high potential of damages. Individuals as well as enterprises are affected by loss of data due to attacks by hackers or viruses, industrial espionage or profile formation. The distributed-denial-of-service-attack on Yahoo, E-Bay and E-Trade on February 8, 2000, for instance, generated a turnover loss of $ 250 million [42]. Furthermore, it entailed a loss of their stock exchange value of $ 2, 5 billion [14].

40|$|In {{many cases}} {{liability}} is attributed {{in a different}} way than through the clear cut situation where one tortfeasor causes harm to one single victim. Those cases of complicated attributions in tort law are analyzed in this article from an economic perspective. After briefly sketching the economic starting points in section II, the way in which multiple tortfeasors are dealt with in the law is analyzed in section III. Section IV analyzes the perspective of multiple tortfeasors in law and economics, distinguishing between the situations of full solvency, insolvency and <b>insurability</b> of more particularly joint and several liability. The article then shifts attention to one particular phenomenon, channeling of liability, whereby the legislature exclusively attributes liability to one (of many possible) tortfeasor(s). Section V analyzes this phenomenon from an economic as well as an <b>insurability</b> perspective. Finally, section VI examines the situation where someone other than the original tortfeasor may be held liable—the case of vicarious liability. In all cases the question is addressed whether these deviations from the original attribution make sense from an economic and <b>insurability</b> perspective. The crucial question is obviously to what extent the legal rules found in various legal systems correspond with the idea of providing all parties who could prevent an accident appropriate incentives to effectively do so...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{issues relating}} to the <b>insurability</b> of punitive damages awards. There is no clear consensus today whether the law should allow insurance coverage of punitive damages. Our courts conflict sharply: some deny coverage on grounds of public policy; the majority allow coverage. Courts on both sides have regarded the <b>insurability</b> issue as implicating the most central goals of modern tort law, but they have failed to generate a consensus regarding whether coverage or the refusal of coverage best achieves these goals. Indeed, there is substantial confusion {{in each of the}} alternative judicial approaches to the <b>insurability</b> of punitive damages. Many courts, for example, deny insurance coverage on grounds that it violates public policy to allow insurance to diminish the deterrent effect of punitive awards, which is the awards 2 ̆ 7 chief function. Yet, even courts adopting this approach have crafted exceptions to the rule, allowing insurance coverage where the award serves some compensatory purpose or where other legal principles, such as strict vicarious liability, are implicated. The rationale for these exceptions, however, is not well worked out. Courts have not explained why there should be less concern over diminishing the deterrent effect of vicarious liability or why and to what extent the compensation goal should trump the deterrence goal...|$|E

40|$|Our rapidly {{changing}} {{world has been}} challenging insurers to keep the pace. Given the qualitative changes in risk trends, the insurance industry has encountered a problem of <b>insurability</b> limits and shifting boundaries of the private insurance sector. The possibilities of covering enormous uncertainties, particular risks and new or modified risks are discussed in this paper. The basic problem of how the nature of risks has evolved over time and obstacles to insuring against certain risks are explained in this paper, and some innovative ways to overcome the mentioned obstacles are listed. One of the most recently discussed issues {{is the impact of}} catastrophic losses and man-made disasters since their frequency and extent have been continuously growing recently. In order to handle the rapid changes in our world and to maintain its stable position, the insurance industry has found some ways to heighten the limits of <b>insurability,</b> i. e., adjustments of terms and conditions, careful risk selection and pricing, reinsurance, innovations, public private partnerships, or multi-source financing of incurred losses have been used recently. However, given the more stringent regulatory requirements which are going to be implemented by 2013, capital requirements may increase and thus the capacity of the insurance industry might be reduced and the industry might have to find other solutions for heightening its capacity. shifting boundaries in <b>insurability,</b> qualitative changes in risk trends, man-made disasters, catastrophic losses...|$|E
