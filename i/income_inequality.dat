5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as <b>income</b> <b>inequality</b> and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, <b>income</b> <b>inequality</b> in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

However, from 2011–2015 Census data of New York County, the per capita income was recorded in 2015 dollars as $64,993, with the median household income at $72,871, and poverty at 17.6%.|$|E

Our goal was to shed light on the different effects of financial development through these two channels. Our results, based on data from 130 countries from 1960 to 1999, confirm their importance in determining the level of <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> but with effects varying with the level of income per capita. We find that, even if financial development globally contributes to the widening of <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> (increasingly with the level of income per capita), there is a narrowing effect through the diminution of educational inequalities. educational <b>inequalities,</b> Financial Development, <b>income</b> <b>inequalities...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in <b>income</b> <b>inequality.</b> While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E

Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of <b>income</b> <b>inequality</b> in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. <b>Income</b> <b>inequality</b> and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E

40|$|According to some scholars, {{immigration}} {{can have}} a relevant role in the reduction of inequality. It {{has happened in the}} past and it may also happen in the future, as it is possible and desirable. However, migration in itself does not resolve definitely the issue of the inequalities and, moreover, in light of the recent studies on the effect of immigration, the exigency of additional in depth research on the impact of this phenomenon on regional disparities and <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> has become evident. The present paper faces these relevant issues, focusing on the regional impact of internal migration and attempting to demonstrate, with reference to the Italian case, how out-migration can increase <b>income</b> <b>inequalities,</b> thus hindering economic growth and exacerbating regional disparities, while immigration can reduce <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> and mitigate economic imbalances, according to the hypothesis of skilled immigration equalising, formulated in 2008 by Kahanec and Zimmermann...|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} on which risk factors attenuate <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> in child overweight and obesity; whether and why these inequalities widen as children age. Method: Eleven thousand nine {{hundred and sixty}} five singletons had complete data at age 5 and 9384 at age 11 from the Millennium Cohort Study (UK). Overweight (age 5 : 15 %; age 11 : 20 %) and obesity (age 5 : 5 %; age 11 : 6 %) were defined using the International Obesity Taskforce body mass index cut-points. To measure socioeconomic inequalities, we used quintiles of family income and as risk factors, we considered markers of maternal health behaviours and of children’s physical activity, sedentary behaviours and diet. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models were used. Results: The unadjusted analyses revealed stark <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> {{in the risk of}} obesity at age 5 and 11. At age 5, children in the bottom income quintile had 2. 0 (95 % CI: 1. 4 – 2. 8) increased relative risk of being obese whilst at age 11 they had 3. 0 (95 % CI: 2. 0 – 4. 5) increased risk compared to children in the top income quintile. Similar <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> in the risk of overweight emerged by age 11. Physical activity and diet were particularly important in explaining <b>inequalities.</b> <b>Income</b> <b>inequalities</b> in obesity and overweight widened significantly between age 5 and 11 and a similar set of risk factors protected against upward and promoted downward movements across weight categories. Conclusions: To reduce <b>income</b> <b>inequalities</b> in overweight and obesity and their widening across childhood the results support the need of early interventions which take account of multiple risk factors...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two independent essays on public economics. The first essay studies the consequences of fiscal decentralization on poverty and <b>income</b> <b>inequalities.</b> This essay describes the possible channels through which fiscal decentralization might affect poverty and <b>income</b> <b>inequalities,</b> and carries out an empirical analysis with data {{of a large number}} of countries at different stages of development, for the period 1971 - 2000. Fiscal decentralization is found to have significant effects on poverty and <b>income</b> <b>inequalities.</b> These findings are important because they suggest, contrary to the traditional public finance theory, that sub-national governments can play an important role in the reduction of poverty and <b>income</b> <b>inequalities.</b> The second essay studies the second best solution to the public expenditures’ problem in the presence of a proportional labor income tax. By allowing the tax base to vary with the taxpayers’ behavioral responses to taxation, we derive the “effective” budget constraint faced by the government, which describes the set of affordable combinations of public and private goods. We show that the optimal solution to the government problem corresponds to the point of tangency between the effective budget constraint and the highest attainable social indifference curve. The traditional normative prescription for public expenditures under a second-best scenario does not satisfy this condition, and therefore it provides a suboptimal solution. Finally, we use the same analytical framework in order to explain the flypaper effect, an empirical regularity that has for long challenged the conventional theory...|$|R
