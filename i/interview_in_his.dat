5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement <b>Interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100m {{freestyle}} at the Australian Championships, clocking {{a time of}} 51.12s. He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television <b>interview.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In the 2009–10 season, Biedriņš {{appeared}} in only 33 games, starting 29, and {{was limited to}} 23.1 minutes per game, his lowest since his second season in the league (2005–2006). Injuries played a big role, as he was derailed with back and groin ailments that made him miss {{weeks at a time}} before he finally had groin surgery on March 10, ending his season. Biedriņš' free-throw percentage had dropped from 62% in 2007–2008 to 55.1% in 2008–2009; in 2009–2010, he shot an appalling four-for-25 (16%). His other numbers dropped precipitously as well – five points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game after career-highs in all these stats in 2008–2009. Additionally, Warriors' coach Don Nelson repeatedly criticized Biedriņš for his lack of intensity and aggressiveness in his time on the floor. Biedriņš capped of the off season by criticizing the team during an <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> native Latvia.|$|E

During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E

Blunt trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. While still in the army, he worked on demos during his time off. A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact Elton John's manager Todd Interland, with whom she used to share a house. Interland told HitQuarters that he listened to Blunt's demo while driving home and after hearing the track [...] "Goodbye My Lover", pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting.|$|E

[...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] I {{may not be able to}} talk to you again after this."

2500|$|Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige {{appeared}} in his first ever interview with the media on the program Nightline on February 14, 1992, and was interviewed by Ted Koppel. Miscavige stated that he believed Scientology did not [...] "lend itself well to the press", and he criticized a piece on Scientology that aired on Nightline shortly before his <b>interview.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> criticism of the piece, Miscavige asserted that Nightline correspondents had only interviewed members of CAN, stating, [...] "For instance, something that isn't mentioned in there is that every single detractor on there {{is part of a}} religious hate group called Cult Awareness Network and their sister group called American Family Foundation. Now, I don't know if you've heard of these people, but it's the same as the KKK would be with the blacks. I think if you interviewed a neo-Nazi and asked them to talk about the Jews, you would get a similar result to what you have here." [...] Koppel then posited the notion that others critical of Scientology were less apt to come forward and speak publicly due to fears of potential recrimination from the Church. In 1994, the Cult Awareness Network opened a counter-suit against the Church of Scientology, eleven individual Scientologists and the Los Angeles law firm of Bowles and Moxon.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to press}} accounts, Cheney told {{investigators}} that he had learned of Mrs. Wilson's employment by the CIA and her potential role in her husband being sent to Niger by then-CIA director George Tenet, though it's unclear whether Cheney was made aware of her classified status. Tenet has {{told investigators that}} he had no specific recollection of discussing Plame or her role in her husband's trip with Cheney. Tenet did recall, however, that he made inquiries regarding the veracity of the Niger intelligence information as a result of inquires from both Cheney and Libby. According to press accounts, Libby told investigators that on July 12, 2003, while aboard Air Force Two, he and Cheney may have discussed leaking information about Plame to reporters. Libby told investigators he believed {{at the time that the}} information about Plame had come from Russert. After arriving back in Washington, according to Cooper's and Miller's testimony at Libby's trial, Libby spoke to both of them by telephone and confirmed to them that Plame worked for the CIA and may have played a role in sending her husband to Niger. FBI agent Deborah Bond testified at Libby's trial that during Libby's second FBI <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> office on November 23, 2003, Libby was asked about the July 12 flight. Bond testified Libby told the FBI [...] "there was a discussion whether to report to the press that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA." [...] She added that Mr. Libby expressed some doubt, however, adding [...] "Mr. Libby told us he believed they may have talked about it, but he wasn't sure." [...] She testified that Libby did say he had discussed Wilson's wife with Cheney sometime after allegedly discussing her with Russert. Libby reportedly told investigators that neither the president nor the vice president specifically directed him or other administration officials to disclose Plame's CIA employment to the press.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1996, {{production}} {{began on}} a biographical comedy film adaptation of Private Parts for Paramount Pictures. Development had lasted {{over two years}} as Stern, who had final script approval, [...] "rejected every script there was ... they were over the top comedies that I think were dumb, boring and dull". After producer Ivan Reitman got involved with the project, Stern agreed to a script developed by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko. Filming began in May 1996 with director Betty Thomas, and lasted four months with Stern, Quivers and Norris acting as their younger and current self. The crew travelled to the film set after each radio show and stayed there to shoot on weekends. Stern embarked on an extensive publicity tour to promote the film which included numerous television appearances and magazine <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> attempt to appeal {{to people who were}} not listeners of his radio show. Private Parts premiered on February 27, 1997 at The Theater at Madison Square Garden; outside the theatre Stern and Rob Zombie performed [...] "The Great American Nightmare", a track they recorded for its soundtrack. The film's wide release followed on March 7, 1997. It topped the US box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million, and earned a domestic total of $41.2 million. In 1998, Stern received a Blockbuster Entertainment award for Favorite Male Newcomer and nominations for a Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Comedy) and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star.

60|$|THE TRAP SET. On Saturday morning John B. Winters sent verbal {{word to the}} Gold Hill Assay Office that he {{desired to}} see me at the Yellow Jacket office. Though such a request struck me as decidedly cool in view of his own recent discourtesies to me there alike as a {{publisher}} and as a stockholder in the Yellow Jacket mine, and though {{it seemed to me}} more like a summons than the courteous request by one gentleman to another for a favor, hoping that some conference with Sharon looking to the betterment of mining matters in Nevada might arise from it, I felt strongly inclined to overlook what possibly was simply an oversight in courtesy. But as then it had only been two days since I had been bruised and beaten under a hasty and false apprehension of facts, my caution was somewhat aroused. Moreover I remembered sensitively his contemptuousness of manner to me at my last <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> office.
