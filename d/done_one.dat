25|$|The method then {{consists}} in placing oneself within the Duration, which always contains {{a sense of}} all the other Durations within the absolute Duration. From here, one should expand their Duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Once this is <b>done,</b> <b>one</b> differentiates two extremities within the Duration to create a dualism, just as one differentiates between red and yellow within the colour spectrum, before showing they are in fact one.|$|E
25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was <b>done</b> <b>one</b> side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E

5000|$|Flashcards {{exercise}} the mental process of active recall: given a prompt (the question), one produces the answer.

Various systems have been developed, with the main principle being spaced repetition - increasing the review interval whenever a card is recalled correctly and recalling the important information of the subject of study.|$|R

This time the objective was Balikpapan, Borneo, where the First Australian Corps was to be landed. Smith began shore bombardment at 0700, 1 July, and received return fire from enemy guns ashore that splashed close aboard. The Japanese gunners finally got her range and sent three shells through her number one stack. The shells failed to explode, and only superficial damage was <b>done.</b> <b>One</b> visible gun emplacement was taken under counterbattery fire and silenced. Smith left the next day for Morotai, picked up a resupply convoy, and was back in Balikpapan on 16 July. She departed on the 24th for San Pedro and tender availability.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Gruenwald {{succumbed to}} a heart attack, {{the result of}} an unsuspected {{congenital}} heart defect. Gruenwald was a well-known practical joker, and due to his young age, many of his friends and co-workers initially believed the reports of his death to be just another joke. Just days prior, he had <b>done</b> <b>one</b> of his trademark cartwheels down the halls of the Bullpen. A longtime lover of comics, Gruenwald made it known amongst his friends and families that his one desire was to have his ashes used in part of a comic. In accordance with his request, he was cremated, and his ashes were mixed with the ink used to print the first printing of the trade paperback compilation of Squadron Supreme.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, Charles Wisner Barrell, {{a former}} {{director}} of Motion Pictures for the Western Electric Company, an American follower of Looney's and Allen's views, examined the portrait using X-ray and infra-red photography, and proved what Allen had suspected, namely that the painting had indeed been tampered with. He supported Allen's conclusion that it was a retouched portrait of Edward de Vere. On the basis of what was taken to be the artist's monogram, C.K., beneath a coat of arms, he concluded that the portrait was the work of Cornelius Ketel, who had been active in England and had reportedly <b>done</b> <b>one</b> of Oxford's portraits. He also suggested that the coat of arms belonged to Oxford's wife, Elizabeth Trentham. Ketel had in fact been commissioned in 1577 to paint a series of 19 portraits for the Cathay Company, in which Oxford had invested and lost a large sum of money.|$|E

[...] Although this was Taft's professional goal, he refused as he felt his work as governor was not yet <b>done.</b> <b>One</b> reason for Roosevelt's action was his desire to neutralize a potential rival for the presidency: Taft's success in the Philippines had not gone unnoticed in the American press. The following year, Roosevelt asked Taft to become Secretary of War. As the War Department was responsible for the Philippines, Taft would remain responsible for the islands, and Root was willing to postpone his departure until 1904, allowing Taft time to wrap up his work in Manila. After consulting with his family, Taft agreed, and sailed for the United States in December 1903.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s MacMillan choreographed two musicals: {{one for the}} stage (The World of Paul Slickey, 1958) {{and one for the}} cinema (Expresso Bongo, 1959). The Invitation, first shown at the Royal Opera House on 30 December 1960, is {{probably}} MacMillan’s most controversial ballet. This one-act work about rape was interpreted by Lynn Seymour and Desmond Doyle and provoked, at the time, mixed reactions in the press and the audience. Among MacMillan’s works for the Royal Ballet in the early 1960s was The Rite of Spring (1962); he selected an unknown junior dancer, Monica Mason, to dance the lead role of the chosen maiden who dances herself to death in a primitive ritual. Dance and Dancers described it as [...] "a singular and signal triumph"; Mason’s performance was judged [...] "brilliantly <b>done</b> ... <b>one</b> of British ballet's most memorable performances". In The Times John Percival commented that ever since Nijinsky's original attempt in 1913 The Rite had been waiting for a choreographer who could make it work on stage, and MacMillan's was the most successful version to date.|$|E

Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just <b>done</b> <b>one</b> of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do.

500|$|On May 6, 2009, Capcom listed two [...] "mystery games" [...] as part {{of their}} Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 (E3 2009) lineup. Nintendo Power {{magazine}} revealed [...] "Capcom Mystery Game #1" [...] to be the North American localization of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes, with the new subtitle [...] "Ultimate All-Stars". It was playable at the company's E3 booth. European and Australian releases were announced on later dates. The game was originally unintended for release outside Japan, but was localized by Capcom due to positive fan reception. Tatsunoko Production assisted Capcom with its character licensing issues; while Tatsunoko Production holds such rights in Japan, they are licensed to companies such as Time Warner in other countries. Niitsuma said that acquiring character licenses was difficult, as it was largely <b>done</b> <b>one</b> at a time, and characters cleared in North America had to be checked separately in Europe. Another issue was the possibility that Eighting would be occupied with other projects. Time constraints led Niitsuma to replace the character-specific minigames of Cross Generation of Heroes with [...] "Ultimate All-Shooters", an expansion of PTX-40A's minigame. Artwork by UDON replaced the animated character-specific endings.|$|E
