5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone. It's not only <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would {{be followed by a}} movie that was arguably worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often {{talked with}} Sasuke's Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their {{characters}}. When the two characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre of the Uchiha clan <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{and started to}} read the Naruto manga {{in order to see}} if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors noted that in the end Itachi served as a good old brother to Sasuke. English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how many times he revisited the series.|$|E

5|$|Idaho {{police officer}} Hal Jackson (William Boyett) {{arrives at the}} funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has {{died in a car}} accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that, only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E
5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported {{that in the first}} week of operations Luftflotte 2 had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> and ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E
60|$|As he had {{explained}} it to Billy Byrne the idea was <b>to</b> permit Mr. <b>Harding</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Theriere and his companions had been duped by Skipper Simms--that they had {{had no idea of}} the work that they were to be called upon to perform until the last moment and that then they had done the only thing they could to protect the passengers and crew of the Lotus.|$|R
500|$|However, Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{rated the}} episode 40 out of 100, {{describing}} it as [...] "classic bad Big Bang Theory". Pierson said [...] "a story like {{this makes it}} a bit <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in Sheldon" [...] and suggested that Sheldon should [...] "take something from this experience". Pierson also disliked the girls' subplot as it did not [...] "go anywhere" [...] and described the guys as [...] "cowards".|$|R

25|$|Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; – February 20, 1895) was an African-American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After {{escaping}} from slavery in Maryland, {{he became a}} national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writings. In his time, he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Northerners at the time found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that such a great orator {{had once been a}} slave.|$|E
25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought it odd {{that a man who}} appeared to be a penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to carry a gun. MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E

He certainly was puzzled, was Jimmy Skunk. If Old Mr. Toad {{had told him that}} he could fly, Jimmy would not have been more surprised, or found it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> than that Old Mr. Toad had a beautiful voice. The truth is, Jimmy didn't believe it. He thought that Old Mr. Toad was trying to fool him.|$|R

5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song have {{attracted}} particular criticism, with Gil Kaufman of MTV describing them as [...] "a titanic mound of turgid clichés", citing the chorus [...] "every step you climb another mountain / every breath is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> / you’ll {{make it through the}} pain / weather the hurricane / to get to that one thing / when you think the road is going nowhere / just when you’ve almost gave [...] up on your dreams / then take it by the hand and show you that you can".|$|R

500|$|The episode guest starred Helen Hunt as Renee, Moe's girlfriend. Hunt {{has said}} she liked the design of her character, who was named after Hauge's wife. During {{the making of the}} episode, Hunt and Hank Azaria, who voices Moe, were dating. In an {{interview}} with People Magazine in 1998, Scully stated: [...] "Hank and Helen got along so well it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they are a real couple."

500|$|Enola Gay stayed {{over the}} target area {{for two minutes}} and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated.

[...] "It was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> what we saw", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said [...] "the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'". He and Tibbets compared the shockwave to [...] "a close burst of ack-ack fire".|$|E

The men in the turret often stopped their ears, and perhaps their eyes, {{at the moment of}} firing, and then instantly worked the run-in levers, and did not notice how much the guns had recoiled. This no doubt occurred. Both guns were at once reloaded, and the rammer's indicator, working by machinery, set fast and failed to show how far the new charge had gone." ...|$|E

In the book America's Best, Britain's Finest: A Survey of Mixed Movies, critic John Howard Reid says of Cartier's 1958 film Passionate Summer: [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that... anyone could make such a dull movie.

40|$|Held in {{the palm}} of a human hand, a single {{specimen}} of Azolla filiculoides looks downright inconsequential. Even with the scaly leaves of this miniature aquatic fern spread flat, it barely spans the distance between the creases that cleave the flesh. Its fibrous root tendrils dangle like a lock of matted hair, adding to its overall impression of impotence and making it even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Azolla might help address humanity’s greatest challenges. That it could is the hope of a team of scientists investigating Azolla’s potential as a sustainable source of biofuel and protein.

500|$|Many {{critics and}} audiences have likened {{the film to}} a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that {{revolves}} around mistaken identity plot devices. Peter Howell, in his review for the Toronto Star, wrote: [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that this is the}} work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of Fargo. There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps."
