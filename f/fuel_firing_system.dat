40|$|Customarily, {{electricity}} is generated in a utility power plant while thermal energy is generated in a heating/cooling plant; the electricity produced {{at the power}} plant is transmitted to the heating/cooling plant to power equipments. These two separate systems waste vast amounts of heat and result in individual efficiencies of about 35 %. Cogeneration is the sequential production of power (electrical or mechanical) and thermal energy (process steam, hot/chilled water) from a single power source; the reject heat of one process issued as input into the subsequent process. Cogeneration increases the efficiency of these stand-alone systems by producing these two products sequentially at one location using a small additional amount of fuel, rendering the system efficiency greater than 70 %.

40|$|Issue: Hogged fuel is {{typically}} purchased by volume, unless the user has installed scales for weighing. Due to the hog fuel combustion process {{used by the}} end user, the size and BTU value of the wood waste will be the determining factor of the purchase price. Depending upon the type of boiler being utilized, wood waste high in fines may not be acceptable. Also, material high in moisture {{may lead to a}} reduction in the price paid for the feedstock. Most hog <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> <b>systems</b> include their own screening and shredding system to assure a quality control step in sizing the material before it is introduced into the interim storage/surge bin feed system. Best Practice: This best practice recommends that processors and end users come to a clear, written understanding of quality requirements. Written specifications for acceptable wood waste feedstocks should be developed and mutually agreed upon. A means to test for compliance with these specifications should also be agreed upon. Feedstock specifications will vary from end user to end user. These differences are due to differences in processing equipment and handling techniques. Wood waste processors should develop specifications for each individual customer they will supply, and these specifications should be made part of a written contract or letter of agreement that stipulates other important conditions (price, volume, etc.). Provided below are general specifications which are intended to provide a starting point for negotiations between processors and end users. The limits shown can also be used by a processing facility to examine the feasibility of achieving the specifications for this type of market, although the final determination of marketability should rest on a more detailed local analysis of end users and their specifications...|$|R

40|$|During the summer, {{power output}} and the {{efficiency}} of gas turbines deteriorate significantly. Gas turbine inlet air fog cooling is considered a simple and cost-effective method to increase power output as well as, sometimes, thermal efficiency. During fog cooling, water is atomized to micro-scaled droplets and introduced into the inlet airflow. In addition to cooling the inlet air, overspray can further enhance output power by intercooling the compressor. With continued increase of volatility of natural gas prices and concerns regarding national energy security, alternative fuels such as low calorific value (LCV) synthetic gases (syngas) derived from gasification of coal, petroleum coke, or biomass are considered as important common fuels in the future. The effect of fogging/overspray on LCV <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> gas turbine <b>systems</b> is not clear. This paper specifically investigates this issue by developing a we...|$|R
40|$|Issue: There are {{a number}} of {{environmental}} issues that need to be analyzed when considering the installation or modification of a hog <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> combustion <b>system.</b> These could include: • environmental regulations that exist in the location of the proposed facility. • types of existing pollutants already at serious levels in the region. • environmental impact of the system equipment components as proposed. • capability of the latest environmental technology. Depending upon the sourcing strategy and quality control steps employed by a boiler fuel purchasing agent, several different types of waste streams may be used in the boiler. Processed wood waste is one such stream. It could be introduced as a blended component with conventional fuels. It would be introduced to cut fuel costs and help keep the boiler operation competitive. There will be nominal amounts of contaminants in the processed wood, but they are controllable. The fuel purchasing agent and the supplier must work together to insure that between the quality control of the wood waste feedstock and the emissions control system of the boiler, that the actual emissions of the boiler do not exceed the allowable parameters. Such a protocol has been developed and it is specific to each system and each grade of wood waste feedstock that is used...|$|R
40|$|Under certain circumstances, {{the water}} on which a burning pool of liquid fuel is {{supported}} may begin to boil. The bubble of water vapor that is released and escapes through the fuel surface tends to chenge the temperature distribution in the fuel layer and sometimes to atomize the fuel which results in a boilover of the burning liquid <b>fuel.</b> A pool <b>fire</b> <b>system,</b> in which the burning surface of the fuel was fed into the flame so that a boiling water sublayer could be oberved, was designed to invstigate the effect of water sublayer on the burning phenomena of the liquid fuel layer. Data obtained incrude temperature and mass loss history of the liquid fuel and water, flame hight, and irradiance from the flame. Results show that when boiling occurs, the temperature gradient across the fuel layer vanishes, the temperature level of the fuel decreases, and the burning rate of the fuel decreases. Because water-vapor bubbles released from the fuel-water interface stir the fuel layer as they pass upward through it...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{potential}} {{for the use of}} micro-cogeneration systems in the residential sector because they have the ability to produce both useful thermal energy and electricity from a single source of fuel such as oil or natural gas. In cogeneration systems, the efficiency of energy conversion increases to over 80 % as compared to an average of 30 - 35 % for conventional fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> electricity generation <b>systems.</b> This increase in energy efficiency can result in lower costs and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the conventional methods of generating heat and electricity separately. Cogeneration systems and equipment suitable for residential and small-scale commercial applications like hospitals, hotels or institutional buildings are available, and many new systems are under development. These products are used or aimed for meeting the electrical and thermal demands of a building for space and domestic hot water heating, and potentially, absorption cooling.

40|$|The {{source term}} {{literature}} was reviewed to estimate aerosolized and respirable release fractions for accidents involving plutonium in high-explosive (HE) detonation and in <b>fuel</b> <b>fires.</b> For HE detonation, all estimates {{are based on}} the total amount of Pu.

Expected values for aerosolization were obtained from the Vixen A field tests, which represent a realistic case for modest turbulence and updraft, and for respirable fractions from some laboratory experiments involving large samples of Pu. Upper bound estimates for credible accidents are based on experiments involving combustion of molten plutonium droplets.

40|$|One of the IM tests {{described}} in STANAG 4439 is the Fast Cook-off (FCO) test. The Liquid <b>Fuel</b> or External <b>Fire,</b> Munition Test Procedures is {{described in}} STANAG 4240 : “The objective of the selected <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test is {{the determination of the}} reaction and time to reaction of the munition(s) when subjected to a liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> environment”. However, {{there is a lot of}} discussion about this typical test. The drawback of the <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test is the pollution of the environment during burning, as a result of the soot and many other substances in the fuel. Therefor a group of international experts is evaluating the use of propane as an alternate fuel for the Fast Heating Test Procedure identified in STANAG 4240 during a series of <b>Fuel</b> <b>Fire</b> Expert meetings (FFE). In the Netherlands the number of polluting large <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test per year is limited but also the performance of the Dutch small <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test leads to pollution and gives an undesirable situation. This is the reason that, in cooperation with the Knowledge Center of Weapons & Munitions of the Dutch MoD, also TNO has developed and tested a clean FCO test setup, based on propane. In the last IMEMTS conference the set-up was described and the results of several tests series, including a calibrating test series in co-operations with the US laboratories NSWC and NAWC, was presented. Since then, the set-up has been improved with respect to safety and several tests series have been performed to increase the hearth of the fire and improve the temperature distribution over the hearth. Also the heating of none cylindrical items such as munition boxes has been improved. The gas flow of the set-up is now remote controlled for safety reasons during live munition testing. The number of burners has been increased, up to 24 burners can now be used. Four relative expensive piezo-burners are used for ignition while the other have replace by cheaper burners without piezo-igniters. Also, the set-up of the burners has been changed; two lines of burners per side have been made, one pointing on the bottom of the tested item and one somewhere around the middle. This increases the hearth of the fire and the improves temperature distribution around the item. Now up to 10 cm below and above the test item, the temperatures are well above the 800 °C. One of the main advantages of this set-up is that burning is so clean that the fire is totally transparent and all items can be filmed during testing. With the new set-up and with the small <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test a series of tests with live munitions has been performed. The results of the pre-test with the mock-ups, the results and comparison of the two tests series with live munition as well as the lessons learned from these tests series will be presented in this paper...|$|R
