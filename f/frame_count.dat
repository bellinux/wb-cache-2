5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

Methods: The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was measured in 2, 049 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography from March 2003 to February 2005. Results: Among 308 patients with normal coronary angiograms, 44 undergoing the procedure for electrophysiologic studies or valvular heart disease surveys other than angina were designated normal controls. Another 155 patients with positive stress test results were diagnosed as syndrome X. Comparisons of the two groups showed that the syndrome X patients had higher frame counts in the left anterior descending artery (40. 9 ± 15. 7 vs. 47. 8 ± 25. 4; p < 0. 05) and left circumflex artery (35. 2 ± 11. 7 vs. 42. 0 ± 18. 7; p < 0. 05). A similar trend was found in the right coronary artery (29. 3 ± 13. 5 vs. 31. 9 ± 15. 9; p = 0. 2). The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in each artery of the syndrome X group was related to the patients' variables (sex, age, and body mass index), clinical variables (medication use, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and family history), and hemodynamic variables (aortic systolic blood pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure). By multivariate analysis, the TIMI frame counts in all arteries were significantly higher in women and lower with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use (both p < 0. 05). The <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in the left anterior descending was associated with diuretics use (p < 0. 05).

Methods: Two hundred sixty-one patients aged 61. 8 ± 1. 4 years were included in the study. All subjects were divided into three large groups: group 1 - patients with significant coronary artery stenosis and with MS (n= 148), group 2 - patients with significant coronary artery stenosis and without MS (n= 75), and group 3 - patients without significant coronary artery stenosis and without MS (n= 38). At the same time, the patients in group 1 were again divided into 3 subgroups based on the number of MS criteria. Arterial blood pressure (BP), waist circumference (WC), and levels of fasting glucose (FG), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) were measured in all patients. All subjects underwent coronary angiography and TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was calculated. Results: According to the results in patients with stable angina with 5 criteria of MS, the TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was significantly greater than in patients with stable angina with 3 and 4 criteria of MS. While in the group of patients with stable angina with 3 criteria of MS, the most frequent combination found was BP +WC + FG (28. 3 ± 6. 2 %), in patients with stable angina with 4 MS criteria, it was BP + WC + FG + HDL combination (48. 0 ± 7. 1 %). Conclusions: The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> method is simple, inexpensive and broadly applicable and plays role in the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of coronary artery blood flow in patients with stable angina and MS.

In this research we propose a method to quantify coronary stenosis using planar x-ray angiography image processing. The method we present here has a clinical equivalent called Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction <b>frame</b> <b>counting</b> (TFC), which is widely used as a qualitative measure for flow velocity. The TFC is measured by counting the number of frames between injection of the contrast agent in the artery until it reaches the most distal bifurcation. The approach used in this research is to reconstruct a 3 -d model which is used to track the coronary arteries and measure the contrast density in 2 -d image sequences containing hyperemic or basal acquisitions. Then we focus on the generation of a flow map, this is in fact a 2 -d representation of a set of time density curves, which is used to analyze contrast agent propagation. With flow maps we are able to analyze the contrast density along the vessel centerline with a higher spatial resolution compared to using {{only a limited number of}} regions of interest.

There was a significant association of serum neopterin levels (β= 0. 60, 95 % CI: 4. 93 - 9. 06, p< 0. 001) and serum hs-CRP levels (β= 0. 29, 95 %CI: 0. 84 - 4. 33, p= 0. 004) with mean TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> independent of potential confounders such as age, gender, body mass index, smoking, glucose and cholesterol levels. Conclusion: We have shown that serum neopterin and hs-CRP levels were significantly elevated in patients with SCF when compared with control subjects. Serum neopterin and hs-CRP levels were correlated with mean TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in patients with SCF...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Stable {{microvascular}} angina (SMVA) describes {{patients with}} angina, findings compatible with myocardial ischemia and normal coronary angiograms. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the impact of diabetes on the coronary microcirculation troughs angiography indexes (TIMI <b>Frame</b> <b>Count,</b> Myocardial Blush Grade, Total Myocardial Blush Score) and a new index:TotalTIMI <b>Frame</b> <b>Count</b> (TTFC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included 310 patients with SMVA that we split into two populations: diabetic-non hypertensive (164 patients) and non-diabetichypertensive (146 patients). We calculated, on angiographic images of each patient, TIMI <b>Frame</b> <b>Count</b> (TFC), Myocardial Blush Grade (MBG) and Total Myocardial Blush Score (TMBS) using the protocol described by Gibson and Yusuf. On the basis of Yusuf's experience we imagined a new index:TTFC like sum of the three coronary TFC. RESULTS:We found a worse coronary microcirculation in diabetic-non hypertensive patients with lower values of TFC, MBG and TMBS (p = 0. 02), compared with non-diabetic hypertensive. New index TTFC is usually higher in diabetic-non hypertensive than non-diabetic hypertensive patients. Patients with positive scintigraphy had a worse TMBS than patients with a negative one, with a high statistical significance (p = 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of diabetic non hypertensive and non-diabetic and hypertensive patients with cardiac syndrome X has led to asses that the diabetic population has a greater involvement of microcirculation. Also the new index, TTFC, proved to be a good marker, in agreement with results of other indexes...|$|E
5000|$|The act of {{recording}} a beneficial pseudo-randomly generated result. All gaming systems are fundamentally computers, {{which can only}} perform predetermined calculations; thus all [...] "random" [...] numbers must inherently be generated from predictable but hard-to-replicate sources such as <b>frame</b> <b>counts,</b> timers, and input sequences. Such sources are difficult for a real-time player to control, but when {{the aim is to}} simply generate an input sequence that yields a desired result, the creator of said input sequence can attempt different methods of input to see how a game will react, and then keep the input sequence that performs best. Frame advance and savestates are the most common way to quickly examine multiple attempts. Common results that rely on pseudo-randomly generated numbers in the context of video games include instances of artificial intelligence or the obtaining of random power-ups.|$|R
