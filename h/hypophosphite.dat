The two exceptions (NaH 2 PO 2 (H 2 O) and K 2 HPO 4) showed first-order kinetics. Based on experimental results, the escape of hydrogen involves three steps: the diffusion of hydrogen atoms from the bulk to the surface, association of these atoms on the surface (rate controlling step for second-order hydrogen evolution), and the desorption of molecular hydrogen from the surface.

40|$|Wastewater {{containing}} {{a mixture of}} <b>hypophosphites</b> and phosphites was treated {{in order to assess}} the possibility of attaining high levels of phosphorus oxidation to phosphate.

60|$|At {{the risk}} of {{offending}} the young beginner's illusions, he must be reminded {{of one or two}} homely but important facts bearing upon literary production. Homely as they are, they explain much that is at first puzzling. This perplexing question of distinction; the quality of being somehow fresh--individual. Really it is a perfectly simple matter. It is common knowledge that, after a prolonged fast, the brain works in a feeble manner, the current of one's thoughts is pallid and shallow, it is difficult to fix the attention and impossible to mobilise the full forces of the mind. On the other hand, immediately after a sound meal, the brain feels massive, but static. Tea is conducive to a gentle flow of pleasing thoughts, and anyone who has taken Easton's syrup of the <b>hypophosphites</b> will recall at once the state of cerebral erethrism, of general mental alacrity, that followed on a dose. Again, champagne (followed perhaps by a soupçon of whisky) leads to a mood essentially humorous and playful, while about three dozen oysters, taken fasting, will in most cases produce a profound and even ominous melancholy. One might enlarge further upon this topic, on the brutalising influence of beer, the sedative quality of lettuce, the stimulating consequences of curried chicken; but enough has been said to point our argument. It is, that such facts as this can surely indicate only one conclusion, and that is the entire dependence of literary qualities upon the diet of the writer.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} flame retardancy of {{polyurethane}} foams (PUR) and, in general of polymers, have been deeply influenced by regulation requirements {{and also by}} the concept of “sustainable development” which implies that the fire retardants should present a low impact on human health and environment during the whole life cycle of the polymer; this concerns then also the toxicity and the density of smoke developed during burning of the materials. Therefore, {{the reduction of the}} amounts of brominated compounds used in flame retardancy formulations is actually one of the main aims of the research in this field, although this reduction is not very easy because of their very high effectiveness. In this chapter, novel halogen-free flame retardant systems for polyurethane foams are reviewed and discussed. The chapter deals in particular with charring compounds which may lead to the development of different char morphologies: compact, intumescent and “glassy-like” char layers. The advantages and disadvantages of each system on fire behaviour and thermal stability of polyurethane foams will be analysed. Particular attention will be put on possible synergistic effects arising from suitable mixing of them. The flame retardants analysed are phosphorus-based compounds (phosphates, elementary phosphorous and novel <b>hypophosphites),</b> intumescent systems (for example expandable graphite) as well as glass precursors like borates, alumino-silicates and glass modifiers. Since the recent interest in nanocomposites, potential application and benefits of layered silicates on fire behaviour and thermal stability of PUR foams will be also reported. In order to assess the effectiveness of the systems considered in enhancing the fire behaviour and thermal stability, PUR and PIR-PUR (polyisocyanurate-polyurethane) foams containing different amounts of them were prepared and tested in several ways. In particular the thermal stability, both in inert and oxidizing atmosphere, and fire behaviour through the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and use of cone calorimeter (CC) were analysed. Some results of SBI (Single Burning Item) test were also reported. Also the char morphology and composition were studied through use of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and elementary analysis (EDX, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) ...|$|R
