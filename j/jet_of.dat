5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible {{in the night sky}} for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E
5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} Virgo A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Virgo. One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{geometry}} <b>of</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> submanifolds with {{special interest in}} {{the relationship with the}} calculus of variations. We give a new proof of the fact that higher order <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> submanifolds are affine bundles; as a by-product we obtain a new expression for the associated vector bundles. We use Green-Vinogradov formula to provide coordinate expressions for all variational forms, i. e., objects in the finite-order variational sequence on <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> submanifolds. Finally, we formulate the variational problem in the framework <b>of</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> submanifolds by an intrinsic geometric language, and connect it with the variational sequence. Detailed comparison with literature is provided throughout the paper. Comment: 28 page...|$|R
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> {{smoke from}} a {{recently}} active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|Lobates {{have eight}} comb-rows, {{originating}} at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond {{the body to}} the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia {{in four of the}} comb rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids. This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} finite order variational {{sequences}} has been recently developed trough Krupka’s finite order variational bicomplex and Vinogradov’s C-spectral sequence. Such theories are formulated on finite order <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> fibred manifolds. In this paper we shall provide a formulation on finite order <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> submanifolds using Vinogradov’s C-spectral sequence approach.

5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> {{water from}} the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind {{this is that the}} force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the {{tawny nurse shark}} is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E

For <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> order 5, the algebraic structure explodes in complexity. Bracketing gives 36 invariants. Removing redundancies leaves 24 fundamental invariants...|$|R
