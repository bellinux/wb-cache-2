2500|$|In {{comparison}} with the vigorous optimism of the communist myth, the mythology propagated by the national socialists seems particularly inept; {{and this is not}} only because of the limitations of the racial myth (<b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>one</b> imagine that the rest of Europe would voluntarily accept submission to the master-race?), but above all because of the fundamental pessimism of the Germanic mythology. [...] For the eschaton prophesied and expected by the ancient Germans was the ragnarok--that is, a catastrophic end of the world.|$|E
2500|$|I Have Been to Hiroshima Mon Amour (2009) was {{produced}} at the Voice & Vision Theater at {{part of the}} Hiroshima Project at Ohio Theatre. Written {{as a response to}} the famous 1959 film Hiroshima mon amour, the play follows three stories taking place at different points in time. The first follows a French actor who falls in love with a man in Hiroshima, the second is about a man’s fiancée who becomes a victim of the bomb, and the third revolves around three students in New york City who watch the 1959 film and argue about it. Miyagawa said she wrote this film because, “I was annoyed by the appropriation of the city’s tragedy by the French female protagonist. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>one</b> person’s loss possibly be thought of as a metaphor for the deaths of one hundred thousand people?”. Martin Harries, a NYU English professor, praises the play, “There are many plays that look like they want to be movies. There are too few that take them on in meaningful, craft, theatrical ways. Here is one.” ...|$|E

After a stay in South America and the Falklands, Bougainville reached Tahiti in April 1768, where his boat was {{surrounded}} by hundreds of canoes filled with beautiful women. [...] "I ask you", he wrote, [...] "given such a spectacle, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>one</b> keep at work 400 Frenchmen?" [...] He claimed Tahiti for the French and sailed westward, past southern Samoa and the New Hebrides, then on sighting Espiritu Santo turned west still looking for the Southern Continent. On June 4 he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the Great Barrier Reef. He sailed through what is now known as the Solomon Islands that, due to the hostility of the people there, he avoided, until his passage was blocked by a mighty reef. With his men weak from scurvy and disease and no way through he sailed for Batavia in the Dutch East Indies where he received news of Wallis and Carteret who had preceded Bougainville. When he returned to France in 1769, he was the first Frenchman to circumnavigate the globe and the first European known to have seen the Great Barrier Reef. Though he did not reach the mainland of Australia, he did eliminate a considerable area where the Southern land was not.|$|E

The short stories of Gloria Naylor and Alice Walker enrich the tradition of African-American writers and women writers by providing a yet unknown and different perspective on the lives of black women in the United States. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|R
