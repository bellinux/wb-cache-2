5|$|Kathak, a {{classical}} dance form, owes its origin {{to the state}} of Uttar Pradesh. The dance form is connected to classical Hindustani music where the rhythmic nimbleness of the feet is accompanied by either Tabla or Pakhawaj. <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> schools of this dance form, Lucknow gharana, Ajrara gharana, Farukhabad gharana and Benares gharana, are situated in Uttar Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 1885, {{one week}} after the massacre, six {{companies}} of soldiers arrived in Wyoming. <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> companies then escorted the Chinese back to Rock Springs. Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land where their homes once stood. The mining company had buried only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{first serious}} {{violation}} to {{the no-fly zone}} came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> Serb jets over Banja Luka. This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the Banja Luka incident {{was also the first}} combat engagement in the history of NATO. The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The singles {{competition}}, {{similar to}} a skills competition in ice hockey, involved team members {{from each of the}} twelve teams attempting six types of shots.

5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the city is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Tiruchirappalli is {{the headquarters of the}} Trichy region of TNEB. The city and its suburbs form the Trichy Metro Electricity Distribution Circle, which is subdivided into six divisions. A chief distribution engineer is stationed at the regional headquarters at Tennur. Water supply is provided by the Tiruchirappalli City Corporation. The city gets its drinking water supply from the Kaveri River and 1,470 bore wells linked to 60 service reservoirs in and around the city. <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> head works from which the city gets its water supply are maintained by the municipal corporation and the rest by other agencies.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} preseason poll, however, {{speculation}} began {{as to whether}} regular-season parity would render the prediction irrelevant. Before the 2010 season, the poll had predicted the ACC winner correctly only once {{in the championship game}} era. In the Coastal Division, this speculation was groundless, as Virginia Tech's undefeated season rendered any other winner impossible. In the Atlantic Division, the situation was much different. As late as the second week of November, <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> division teams were in contention for the division title. These candidates were whittled to three with two weeks remaining in the regular season, then to two in the final week. During that week, NC State traveled to Maryland. If NC State had won, {{it would have been the}} Atlantic Division winner by virtue of a tie-breaking win against Florida State. Instead, NC State lost 38–31, and Florida State earned a bid to the championship game.|$|E

5|$|The 1904 Tour de France was {{the second}} Tour de France, held from 2 to 24 July. With a route similar to its {{previous}} edition, 1903 Tour de France winner Maurice Garin seemed to have repeated his win by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, while Hippolyte Aucouturier won <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> stages. But the race became a victim of its own success, plagued by scandals; cyclists were accused of having taken trains during the race. Twelve cyclists, including the first four of the final classification and all stage winners, were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF). Henri Cornet, originally the fifth-place finisher, was awarded the victory {{four months after the}} race. The problems caused the Tour de France to be provisionally cancelled, and subsequently the 1905 Tour de France was run with different rules from the 1903 and 1904 edition.|$|E
5|$|One bank {{employee}} {{testified that}} Shakur {{was one of}} the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain. The prosecution showed surveillance photos of <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use photo manipulation; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible. In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record. Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage. The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{assembly}} of Mir began on February 19, 1986 with {{the launch of}} the Proton-K rocket. <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> modules which were later added (Kvant-2 in 1989, Kristall in 1990, Spektr in 1995 and Priroda in 1996) followed the same sequence {{to be added to the}} main Mir complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module's docking node, then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate, before lowering it to dock. The node was equipped with only two Konus drogues, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.|$|E
