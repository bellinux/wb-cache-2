40|$|Load {{shedding}} is {{the last}} and most expensive control action against system collapse and blackout. Achievement of an efficient emergency control to stabilize the power system following severe disturbances, requires two <b>key</b> <b>objectives.</b> First, preventing <b>of</b> <b>further</b> cascading outages, i. e. saving the available and determinant power system elements and second, issuing proper control actions to stabilize the power system inside the permissible time frame. In this paper online contingency analysis is performed to monitor secure and reliable operation of transmission lines. Load shedding locations are continuously updated based on loading rate/thermal limit of lines to prevent their outage. Simulation of severe contingencies carried out on 39 bus IEEE standard test system in DIgSILENT power-factory validates the efficiency of proposed method. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) {{is a large}} (6. 6 m), cold (< 50 K), infrared-optimized space {{observatory}} {{that will}} be launched early {{in the next decade}} into orbit around the second Earth-Sun Lagrange point. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-infrared camera, a near-infrared multi-object spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0. 6 < λ < 5. 0 µm, while the mid-infrared instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5. 0 < λ < 29 µm. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme is to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems.
