40|$|AbstractConducting {{polymers}} {{have been}} found to be promising as electrode material in energy storage devices such as electrochemical capacitors due to they have good capacitance and relatively high charge/discharge rates, giving rise to higher energy and power density than carbon-based electrochemical capacitors. Furthermore, they have good chemical stability, high conductivity and are easy to manufacture. The excellent performance of conducting polymers is due to their pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism. Polyaniline (PANI) is one of candidate of conducting polymer has been used as material in this field; however, there are some drawbacks to using conducting polymers as the electroactive material. Therefore, conducting polymers require presence of another material which has good mechanical and <b>electrochemical</b> behavior to <b>address</b> those problems. Manganese oxides have good electrochemical performance by themselves, and are therefore an excellent candidate for forming a composite with conducting polymers. Desirable characteristics of manganese oxides include that they are abundant, low cost, and have high specific capacitance. An initial study of the electrodeposition behavior of polyaniline-manganese oxides thin film was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronoamperometry (CA), and cyclic voltammetry (CV).

40|$|Tremendous {{attention}} is paid to renewable sources of energy. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are intensively studied for their promising catalytic activities in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this fundamental work, we explore the catalytic properties of TMDs family members: 2 H TaS 2 and 1 T TaS 2. Our findings reveal that both polytypes exhibit poor HER performance which is even more pronounced when subjected to electrochemical treatment with reduction/oxidation. Our experimental data show that 1 T TaS 2 has a lower overpotential at a current density of - 10 mA. cm- 1, despite our theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicating that more favorable free energy of hydrogen adsorption should make perfect 2 H TaS 2 a better HER catalyst.

40|$|Department of Energy Engineering(Battery Science and Technology) A {{vigorous}} {{expansion of}} newly emerging application fields, including smart mobile electronics, power tools, (hybrid) electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage systems inspires the relentless pursuit of advanced rechargeable power sources with reliable/sustainable electrochemical performance and safety tolerance. Among the numerous power sources, undoubtedly, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) {{are listed in}} the top tier and still garner considerable attention as an appealing <b>electrochemical</b> system to <b>address</b> the challenging issues. A battery separator membrane is supposed to be electrically inert for preventing electrical contact (resulting in safety failures) between electrodes, in addition to its another key role as an ion-conducting route. Here, as a multifunctional membrane strategy to break up the stereotypical belief about battery separators, we demonstrate a new class of Janus-faced, dual (ion/electron) -conductive/chemically-active (i. e., heavy metal ion-chelating) battery separators based on elaborately-designed heterolayered nanomat architecture. The Janus-faced, heterolayered nanomat separators (referred to as “Janus separators”) are fabricated through the in-series, concurrent electrospraying/electrospinning process. The Janus separator is composed of an ion-conductive/metal ion-chelating support layer (= a mat of densely-packed, thiol-functionalized silica particles spatially besieged by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) /polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers) and a dual-conductive top layer (= a thin mat of polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibers wrapped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)). The support layer acts as a chemical trap that can capture heavy metal ions dissolved in liquid electrolytes and the thin top layer serves as an upper current collector of cathodes to facilitate redox reaction kinetics. Notably, the unusual porous structure (specifically, preferential deposition of the MWNTs along the PEI nanofibers) of the top layer is theoretically elucidated using molecular dynamics simulation. As a consequence, the Janus separator enables significant improvements in the fast-rate charge/discharge reaction of lithium-ion batteries and also high-temperature cycling performance, which lie far beyond those achievable with conventional polyethylene separators. The Janus separator featuring such exceptional multifunctionality is envisioned to open a new membrane solution for high-energy/high-performance lithium-ion batteries that will power forthcoming smart ubiquitous era. ope...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{membranes}} surround {{all living}} cells and are comprised {{of a complex}} matrix of phospholipids and proteins. The proteins embedded in or bound to {{the exterior of the}} membrane are responsible {{for a wide range of}} processes, for example cell signalling, and transport of material in and out of the cell. Understanding how transmembrane proteins behave within the lipid membrane system will allow for a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of diseases as well as the development more targeted therapeutics. However, due to the complex nature of the cell membrane environment, it is difficult to selectively study single protein species within the whole cell system. This has driven the development of model membrane systems, which allow for the sub-division of these complex systems into simpler forms and allow for the study of individual membrane proteins. Solid supported lipid bilayers have been widely used as model systems, however they have multiple limitations, the most important being the influence of the underlying substrate on the bilayer. This can impede lipid fluidity and is particularly detrimental to mobility of reconstituted proteins as substrate-protein interactions can impede motion and even cause protein to denature. This thesis attempts to address this by developing substrates for studying membrane proteins in a biomimetic environment where such interactions are minimized. The initial substrates, designed for optical measurements, comprise of a microcavity array substrate formed in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A method for spanning bilayers over these PDMS microcavity arrays was developed and lipid diffusion dynamics over the cavities was assessed using Fluorescence Lifetime Correlation Spectroscopy (FLCS). Importantly, diffusion coefficients for lipids over these cavities are 2 to 3 times faster than on flat PDMS, and are more akin to diffusion rates normally observed in liposomes, indicating that the bilayer is minimally influenced by the underlying substrate. In the second part of this thesis an analogous substrate and bilayer deposition method was developed using gold substrates with the objective of using <b>electrochemical</b> methods to <b>address</b> the bilayer or trigger events within the cavity. Firstly lipid bilayers are spanned in a similar manner as developed for PDMS and the bilayer modified gold was characterised by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Incorporation of ion transporting molecules into the supported bilayers is also investigated by EIS. Finally a novel means of inducing electrically controlled release of reagent from inside the gold cavities to a lipid bilayer suspended across the cavity was developed using a ferrocene/cyclodextrin complex. To demonstrate this Streptavidin was released to a biotinylated lipid bilayer and its interaction with the bilayer was monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{are capable}} of self-assembling into structures on the 10 - 100 nm length scale. Structures of this size are attractive for applications such as nanopatterning and electrochemical membrane materials. However, block copolymer self-assembly in these examples {{is complicated by the}} presence of surfaces in the case of thin films and the presence of an additive, such as an ionic liquid, in the case of electrochemical membrane materials. Improved understanding of the structure and thermodynamics of such systems is necessary for the development of structure-property relationships in applications for block copolymers, such as nanopatterning and <b>electrochemical</b> devices. To <b>address</b> the challenge of block copolymer thin film characterization over large areas, resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) has been applied to characterize order formation in copolymer thin films. Using theory and experiment, the dramatic chemical sensitivity of RSoXS to subtle differences in the bonding energies of different blocks of a copolymer is demonstrated. The unambiguous identification of structure and domain size in block copolymer thin films using RSoXS enables a quantitative comparison of the bulk block copolymer structure and domain size, leading to improved understanding of the impact of surfaces on block copolymer self-assembly. The self-assembly of block copolymer/ionic liquid mixtures has been characterized as a function of block copolymer composition and molecular weight, mixture composition, and temperature using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), optical transmission characterization, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The resulting phase behavior is reminiscent to that of block copolymer mixtures with a selective molecular solvent and lamellar, cylindrical, ordered spherical micelles, and disordered phases are observed. Analysis of order-disorder transitions and molecular weight scaling analysis qualitatively indicates that the segregation strength between block copolymer phases increases with ionic liquid loading. DSC characterization of the thermal properties of the block copolymer/ionic liquid mixtures reveals two composition dependent regimes. At high block copolymer concentrations, a "salt-like" regime corresponding to an increase in the block copolymer glass transition temperature is observed, while at intermediate block copolymer concentrations, a "solvent-like" regime corresponding to a decrease in the block copolymer glass transition temperature is observed. The distribution of ionic liquid within microphase-separated domains of a block copolymer has been characterized using contrast matched small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and DSC. The ionic liquid is shown to partition selectively into domains formed by one block of a block copolymer in agreement with studies of the phase behavior of ionic liquid/block copolymer mixtures. Unexpected differences in ionic liquid partitioning are observed in mixtures containing a deuterated versus hydrogenated ionic liquid...|$|R
40|$|The {{nervous system}} {{consists}} {{of a network of}} specialized cells that coordinate the actions of the body by transmitting information to and from the brain. The communication between the nerve cells is dependent on the interplay of both electrical and chemical signals. As our understanding of nerve cell signalling increases there is a growing need to develop techniques capable of interfacing with the nervous system. One of the major challenges is to translate between the signal carriers of the nervous system (ions and neurotransmitters) and those of conventional electronics (electrons). Organic conjugated polymers represent a unique class of materials that can utilize both electrons and ions as charge carriers. Taking advantage of this combined feature, we have established a novel communication interface between electronic components and biological systems. The organic bioelectronic devices presented in this thesis are based on the organic electronic ion pump (OEIP) made of the conducting organic polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). When electronically <b>addressed,</b> <b>electrochemical</b> redox reactions in the polymer translate electronic signals into electrophoretic migration of ions. We show that the device can transport a range of substances involved in nerve cell signaling. These include positively charged ions, neurotransmitters and cholinergic substances. Since the devices are designed to be easily incorporated in conventional microscopy set-ups, we use Ca 2 + imaging as readout to monitor cell responses. We demonstrate how electrophoretic delivery of ions and neurotransmitters with precise, spatiotemporal control can be used to modulate intracellular Ca 2 + signaling in neuronal cells in the absence of convective disturbances. The electronic control of delivery enables strict control of dynamic parameters, such as amplitude and frequency of Ca 2 + responses, and can be used to generate temporal patterns mimicking naturally occurring Ca 2 + oscillations. To enable further control and fine-tuning of the ionic signals we developed the electrophoretic chemical transistor, an analogue of the traditional transistor used to amplify and/or switch electronic signals. We thereby take the first step towards integrated chemical circuits. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the OEIP in a new “machine-to-brain” interface. By encapsulating the OEIP we were able to use it in vivo to modulate brainstem responses in guinea pigs. This was the first successful realization of an organic bioelectronic device capable of modulating mammalian sensory function by precise delivery of neurotransmitters. Our findings highlight the potential of communication interfaces based on conjugated polymers in generating complex, high-resolution, signal patterns to control cell physiology. Such devices will have widespread applications across basic research as well as future applicability in medical devices in multiple therapeutic areas...|$|R
