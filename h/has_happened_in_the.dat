5|$|Later, in Boston, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of}} Dr. Craig Horning, an archaeologist from a local history museum, after a security guard discovers {{a large amount of}} blood in Horning's lab. They interview both the curator, Dr. Lewton, and graduate student Mona Wustner. They also visit a reclusive Bilac. After closing, Lewton is killed by the jaguar spirit after his car doesn't start. During an investigation of the crime scene, Scully comes across rat corpses in the engine compartment of Lewton's vehicle. Mona denies that anything unusual <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gate {{is set in}} {{the summer}} of 2010, {{approximately}} one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E

In the Saudara Cup match against Singapore, he took a hat-trick, the only time this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 37-year history of the fixture.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} playoff series between these teams. Boston won {{three of the four}} games that were played in the regular season. Bruins rookie Tyler Seguin scored a goal and an assist in his first career playoff game in game one. In game two, he tied the NHL record for points by a {{teenager}} in a single playoff period with four points, two goals and two assists (held by Trevor Linden). Game seven featured remarkable discipline from both teams, as no penalties were called during the game, the first time this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs in over twenty years. Boston's Nathan Horton recorded his second game-seven-winning goal in this year's playoffs, as his first was scored against Montreal in round one.|$|E
25|$|Atkinson played mostly second eleven cricket in 1987, but in 1988 he {{returned}} to first-class cricket at Cambridge University, {{where he was a}} student at Downing College. Played as a middle-order batsman, his only score of note in his first season for Cambridge was 73 against Surrey, and this was his highest score in his three years at the university. He was awarded his Blue, though in fact the match against Oxford University was abandoned without a ball being bowled, the only time this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the fixture going back to 1829. He went on to win Blues in both 1989 and 1990, when he was captain of the Cambridge team: both of these matches were also badly affected by rain. In all three seasons, he played List A cricket in the Benson and Hedges Cup for the Combined Universities cricket team: an amalgam of the Oxford and Cambridge sides. In both 1988 and 1989 {{he returned}} after the university term was over to play occasional games for Somerset, but the 1990 University match was his last first-class game, and there was only one further List A match for Somerset in August 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E

In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [...] after what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me." ...|$|E

500|$|Hugo Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen by {{supporting}} or attending {{members of the}} annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with five nominees, except {{in the case of}} a tie. These five works on the ballot are those most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1953 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up nominees, but since 1959 all five candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote [...] "no award", if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that [...] "no award" [...] takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. The only time this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discontinued awards was in the 1959 Best New Author category.|$|E

The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.

Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations, and no more than two works per series allowed on the final ballot. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.

500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness.|$|E
