5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E

5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> cholesterol.|$|E

5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E

In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated {{to each other as}} mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away.|$|E

5|$|Low-powered motorboats {{are allowed}} in the park; the {{majority}} of salt water areas are no-wake zones to protect manatees and other marine animals from harm. Jet skis, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing. Fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, but a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), alligators and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, and sharp dangerous coral are plentiful in salt water. Visibility <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> both kinds.|$|E

5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> fat and digestible carbohydrates, {{and high in}} protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E

The {{diversity}} of termite species <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> North America and Europe (10 species known in Europe and 50 in North America), but {{is high in}} South America, where over 400 species are known. Of the 3,000 termite species currently classified, 1,000 are found in Africa, where mounds are extremely abundant in certain regions. Approximately 1.1million active termite mounds {{can be found in}} the northern Kruger National Park alone. In Asia, there are 435 species of termites, which are mainly distributed in China. Within China, termite species are restricted to mild tropical and subtropical habitats south of the Yangtze River. In Australia, all ecological groups of termites (dampwood, drywood, subterranean) are endemic to the country, with over 360 classified species.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E

5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E
