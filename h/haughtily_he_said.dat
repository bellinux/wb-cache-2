6000|$|... "I {{can protect}} myself," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>haughtily.</b> Nevertheless <b>he</b> had a {{depressing}} consciousness that his lithe and graceful burden was somewhat {{in the way}} of any heroic expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "`She's my slave,' <b>said</b> the owner, <b>haughtily.</b> <b>He</b> would not, perhaps, have condescended {{even with}} that much {{explanation}} {{if he had not}} seen that the landlord sympathised with the doctor.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{an awkward}} test, as Juan found, [...] But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride: [...] With gentle force her white arms he unwound, [...] And seated her all {{drooping}} by his side, [...] Then rising <b>haughtily</b> <b>he</b> glanced around, [...] And looking coldly in her face, he cried, [...] 'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor [...] Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am!" [...] <b>said</b> Pony, <b>haughtily,</b> and <b>he</b> twitched {{away from}} where {{she was sitting on}} the side of his bed, leaning over him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> <b>haughtily</b> enough, as resenting Hereward's {{familiar}} [...] "thou," [...] "am Arnulf, grandson and heir of Baldwin, Marquis of Flanders, and lord of this land. And to {{his grace}} I call {{on you to}} surrender yourselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|David Hyde Pierce as Drixenol [...] "Drix" [...] Koldreliff, a stoic cold pill {{who becomes}} Ozzy's best friend. His right arm is a cannon used to shoot an {{assorted}} variety of medication, {{including one that}} freezes any target. He is a follower of written rules and compensates for his doubts of himself by acting <b>haughtily.</b> <b>He</b> is intelligent, clever, and dedicated to work. Straight-laced and by-the-book, he is in disagreement with the crude humor and unorthodox methods of Ozzy, but respects Ozzy as a partner due to his dedication to fighting diseases.|$|R
60|$|Lord Julian, {{sick with}} {{horror of the}} {{spectacle}} he had just witnessed, commanded himself with difficulty to supply them. Then <b>haughtily</b> <b>he</b> demanded to know in his turn {{the name of their}} aggressor. He was in an exceedingly ill temper. He realized that if he had done nothing positively discreditable in the unusual and difficult position into which Fate had thrust him, at least he had done nothing creditable. This might have mattered less but that the spectator of his indifferent performance was a lady. He was determined if possible to do better now.|$|R
60|$|Very {{shortly after}} Herbert's return to Castle Richmond, it was {{notified}} {{to him that}} he need have no fear as to his inheritance; and it was so notified with the great additional comfort of an assuring opinion from Mr. Die. He then openly called himself Sir Herbert, took upon himself the property which became his by right of the entail, and issued orders for the preparation of his marriage settlement. During this period he saw Owen Fitzgerald; but he did so in the presence of Mr. Somers, and not a word was then said about Lady Clara Desmond. Both the gentlemen, Herbert and Mr. Somers, cordially thanked the master of Hap House for the way in which he had behaved to the Castle Richmond family, and in reference to the Castle Richmond property during the terrible events of the last two months; but Owen took their thanks somewhat <b>haughtily.</b> <b>He</b> shook hands warmly enough with his cousin, wishing him joy on the arrangement of his affairs, and was at first less distant than usual with Mr. Somers; but when they alluded to his own conduct, and expressed their gratitude, he declared that he had done nothing for which thanks were due, and that he begged it to be understood that he laid claim to no gratitude. Had he acted otherwise, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> would have deserved to be kicked out of the presence of all honest men; and to be thanked for the ordinary conduct of a gentleman was almost an insult. This <b>he</b> <b>said</b> looking chiefly at Mr. Somers, and then turning to his cousin, he asked him if he intended to remain in the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "What means this?" [...] Count Walter de Vesoul slid <b>haughtily,</b> as <b>he</b> reined up {{his horse}} {{a few paces}} from the line. [...] "By what {{authority}} do you dare close the gates and thus stand armed before them?" ...|$|R
60|$|This was rank mutiny. Mrs. Porter stared <b>haughtily</b> at Kirk. <b>He</b> met {{her gaze}} with determination.|$|R
60|$|Denver Dan tried {{him next}} and sat him, <b>haughtily</b> contemptuous, till <b>he</b> stopped, quivering with fatigue and reeking with sweat.|$|R
50|$|Well, {{the other}} day when I was out walking, I met my cousin Josef from Muck Meadow. I couldn't {{understand}} what was wrong, why he wasn't working, 'cause he'd been working for several years for that big farmer over at Sweet Ridge, so I asked him if he wasn't working there anymore. No, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> I quit, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Really? You quit? I <b>said.</b> Yes, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> I quit, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Oh, I said, but why did you quit? I <b>said.</b> Well, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the food got so bad, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Really, I said, the food got so bad? I <b>said.</b> Yes, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the food got so bad, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> so I had to quit, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> You see, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> first the big cow died, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and then we had to eat her up, he said; {{and then all of a}} sudden the big sow died, and then we had to eat her up, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> But, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> finally the farmer's wife died, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and — that's when I quit! <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
60|$|And folding {{his arms}} and {{throwing}} back his lean, hawklike face, <b>he</b> <b>haughtily</b> confronted {{the man with the}} formal frock-coat and the eccentric elbow.|$|R
60|$|He forgot her, {{and turned}} to look at Gerald. With head oddly lifted, like a man who draws his head back from an insult, half <b>haughtily,</b> <b>he</b> watched the cold, mute, {{material}} face. It had a bluish cast. It sent a shaft like ice through the heart of the living man. Cold, mute, material! Birkin remembered how once Gerald had clutched his hand, with a warm, momentaneous grip of final love. For one second--then let go again, let go for ever. If he had kept true to that clasp, death would not have mattered. Those who die, and dying still can love, still believe, do not die. They live still in the beloved. Gerald might still have been living in the spirit with Birkin, even after death. He might have lived with his friend, a further life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grizel, I {{have come}} back." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{it to the}} night, and bowed his head. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> it with head accompaniment to Grizel's lighted window. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> it {{to himself as he}} reached the door. <b>He</b> never <b>said</b> it again.|$|R
5000|$|Inscription: Genesis 32:26-29 - [...] "And <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> Let me {{go for the}} day breaketh. And <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> I {{will not}} let thee go, except thou bless me. And <b>he</b> <b>said</b> unto him, Why is thy name? And <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> Jacob. And <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with me, and hast prevailed. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there." ...|$|R

6000|$|What Mrs. Harris thought <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, [...] "Jump off." [...] Why {{she should}} have thought <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Jump off," [...] when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Sit tight," [...] neither of them can explain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'what most beastly and nauseous {{thing is}} this? Oh,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'what detestable drug is this? Oh, oh,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I shall never, never, get this horrible taste {{out of my}} mouth.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would wait}} there {{until we got}} back. In fact, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his leg hurt him so he couldn't go a step further, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> knew the old folks who lived there very well. We didn't know anything more than what he told us." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to William of Tyre, Manasses [...] "is {{said to have}} {{conducted}} himself very <b>haughtily.</b> <b>He</b> assumed an insolent attitude of superiority towards the elders of the realm and refused to show them proper respect." [...] With his newfound power, he made many enemies among the more established older nobles, and Melisende's son Baldwin III especially hated him for keeping him out of government and alienating him from his mother. Manasses supported Melisende against Baldwin III when Baldwin attempted to claim full power in 1152. Baldwin had himself crowned separately and the kingdom was divided between him and Melisende, with Melisende keeping Jerusalem and Nablus {{in the south and}} Baldwin ruling from Acre and Tyre in the north. Baldwin appointed a constable of his own, Humphrey II of Toron, and soon invaded the south. He forced Manasses to surrender his castle of Mirabel, and captured Jerusalem from Melisende. Manasses was exiled and permanently replaced as constable by Humphrey.|$|R

5000|$|... 19 Now <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this, {{signifying}} by {{what kind}} of death he would glorify God. When <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> this, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to him, [...] "Follow me." ...|$|R
60|$|He helps {{himself to}} butter, and she {{holds out the}} jam pot to him, but <b>he</b> <b>haughtily</b> rejects it. Do you think she gives in now? Not a bit of it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{that when}} the Americans evicted the Taliban he wanted to work to help bring former king Zahir Shah back to power. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> made contact with General Rahim Wardak. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> Defense Minister Fahim Khan and Besmil Khan, the {{commander}} of the Northern Alliance sent him a message: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might ha’ {{known what}} he meant when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> I brightened the cabin up," [...] said Mrs. Jansell; [...] "and when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> thought me and my {{daughter}} were sisters. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> he’d like me to sit there always, the wretch!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> didn't {{know the}} hosses was gone until his father told him. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{got lost in}} the woods, and stayed in a certain spot till the blow was over." ...|$|R
50|$|Initially <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{had told}} the Americans the story his Afghan captors had coached him to tell. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had stopped talking to his American interrogators when they started torturing him too.|$|R
