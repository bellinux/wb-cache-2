25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> possible {{to speak of a}} gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E

500|$|By 1987, Paul {{was ready}} to sever all ties to the Republican Party, as he {{explained}} in a blistering resignation letter: [...] "Since [...] Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together? … There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force {{to reduce the size}} of government. That is the message of the Reagan years." [...] A month later he announced he would seek the 1988 Libertarian Party nomination for president.|$|E
500|$|During the {{remainder}} of the 1980s and early 1990s the historical accuracy of Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was little disputed, and the film became representative of canonical history; its version of the 1965 events was the only one allowed in open discourse. By the mid-1990s, however, anonymous internet communities and small publications had begun questioning the movie's contents; one online message, sent anonymously through a mailing list, asked [...] "If only a small section of the PKI leadership and military agents knew about , <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that over a million people were killed and thousands of people who knew nothing had to be imprisoned, exiled, and lost their civil rights?" [...] Heryanto suggests that this resulted from an unintended polyphony in the film, while Sen and Hill opine that Noer may have been aware of the government's intent for propaganda and thus made the film's political message [...] "obviously contradictory".|$|E

500|$|Milner wanted full {{voting rights}} after five years' residence, a revised {{naturalisation}} oath and increased legislative representation {{for the new}} burghers. Kruger offered naturalisation after two years' residence and full franchise after five more (seven years, effectively) along with increased representation and a new oath {{similar to that of}} the Free State. The High Commissioner declared his original request an [...] "irreducible minimum" [...] and said he would discuss nothing else until the franchise question was resolved. On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: [...] "How can strangers rule my state? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> possible!" [...] When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying [...] "It is our country you want". Milner ended the conference that evening, saying the further meetings Steyn and Kruger wanted were unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> possible that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true {{if it would be}} accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend {{is included in the}} memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

500|$|My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, {{presented}} at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012. The song [...] "All of the Lights" [...] was nominated for Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, winning in the latter two categories. However, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was not nominated for Album of the Year, which {{was viewed as a}} [...] "snub" [...] by several outlets, along with the rejection of Watch the Throne, West's collaborative album with Jay-Z, for that category. In an article for Time, music journalist Touré elaborated on the album's acclaim, called West's nominations in minor categories [...] "booby prizes", and stated, [...] "MBDTF is by far the best reviewed album in many years: the critical community flipped out over it like nothing since Radiohead’s zenith. And it sold well, over 1.2 million so far. So what happened? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> Grammy overlooked Kanye’s magnum opus and gave noms to four sonic widgets and Adele's 21?"

500|$|Along with musicians D'Angelo and Erykah Badu, Maxwell was {{credited}} with helping to shape the [...] "neo soul" [...] movement that rose to prominence during the late 1990s. Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Badu's Baduizm (1997), Urban Hang Suite has been recognized by writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility. However, in contrast to D'Angelo, Maxwell was more conventional in his approach on his debut album. The term [...] "neo soul" [...] was penned in the late 1990s by record executive Kedar Massenburg, who managed both D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. According to Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from more classical styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R counterparts. In commenting on the [...] "new soul revival" [...] in music, Maxwell told Entertainment Weekly in 1997 that [...] "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh new thing. If it doesn't lend itself to your history, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> going to extend to your future?" [...] According to Kerika Fields, Maxwell received an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his debut album from music listeners due to their weariness of contemporary black music's predictability.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is “given” to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.

2500|$|Writing later of the incident, Paul recounts, [...] "I opposed [...] to his face, {{because he}} was clearly in the wrong", and says he told Peter, [...] "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?"

[...] That is, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> possible that people cry for [...] "More taxes! Less bread!"?

2500|$|The New Testament has {{a biblical}} account of Arab {{conversion}} to Christianity {{recorded in the}} book of Acts.

[...] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God." [...] (Acts 2:8, 11, English Standard Version).

2500|$|He is a poet of {{remarkable}} totality of approach toward {{the world and}} his very self.
