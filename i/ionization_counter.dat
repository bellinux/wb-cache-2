40|$|Fast {{secondary}} {{particles from}} interactions of K+ at 70 GeV/c and K- at 110 GeV/c in the BEBC hydrogen bubble chamber are identified {{by use of}} the relativistic rise of ionization in argon. The ionization is measured in a large multicell <b>ionization</b> <b>counter</b> system, the External Particle Identifier (EPI). The operation of this hybrid system, the calibration and the procedures of off-line analysis leading to particle identification are described. For a sample of 9283 secondary particles collected in the K+ p experiment, we present the measurements of ionization, and the determination of acceptance and identification efficiencies. The momentum-dependent populations of pions, kaons and protons have been obtained. Track by track identification procedures yielding samples of pions and kaons with a contamination {less-than or approximate} 12 % are discussed. A study of {{the resolution of the}} EPI in these experimental conditions shows average values in a range of 7. 6 % to 11 % depending on the number of ionization samples remaining after removal of background. These values extrapolate to a value consistent with the 6. 6 % fwhm measured over the whole device for single particles during calibration with a 50 GeV/c π- beam. © 1983.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an independent {{analysis of the}} data from 3 He-filled proportional counters from the third phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) data. These counters were deployed in SNO’s heavy water to independently detect neutrons produced by the neutral current interaction of 8 B solar neutrinos with deuterium. Previously published results from this phase were based on a spectral analysis of the energy deposited in the proportional counters. The work in this thesis introduces a new observable based on the time-profile of the <b>ionization</b> in the <b>counters.</b> The inclusion of this observable in a maximum-likelihood fit increases the potential to distinguish neutrons from backgrounds which are primarily due to alpha-decays. The combination of this new observable with the energy deposited in the counters results in a more accurate determination of the number of neutrons. The analysis presented in this thesis was limited to one third of the data from the proportional counters, uniformly distributed in time. This limitation was imposed to reconcile different time-lines between the submission of this thesis, a thorough review of this work by the SNO Collaboration and results from an independent analysis that is still underway.

40|$|Radioisotopes are {{radioactive}} {{versions of}} the natural chemical elements, differing from these only in their nuclear mass and {{in their ability to}} emit radiations. They are produced mainly by neutron bombardment of ordinary materials in a nuclear reactor. The most important radiations are beta particles (fast electrons of nuclear origin) and gamma rays (penetrating electromagnetic radiations). These are detected with <b>ionization</b> chambers, Geiger <b>counters</b> or scintillation counters. In production control, the absorption or scattering of radiations is used as a measure of material thickness, and in some cases, of its atomic number. Radioactive tracers aid in production research in rapid determination of mixing efficiencies and hold-up times. Tracers are also used in the non-destructive testing of materials and components and in more basic research into alloy structure. In this latter research, photographic films are used to produce autoradiographs which show the micro-scopic distribution of radioactively labelled constituents. Radioactivation by neutron irradiation enables certain impurities to be assayed at sub-microgram levels without chemical separation. The wear of engine parts can be measured, in a fraction of the time taken for orthodox methods, by making the parts in question radioactive and measuring the worn radioactive debris in circulating lubricant. Cutting tools can be measured similarly by assaying radio-active debris attached to the swarf. For many purposes gamma radiography supplements X-radiography or replaces it as a cheaper alternative. The greater manoeuvrability of gamma-ray sources is of especial advantage in the radiography of assembled engines...|$|R
40|$|Effects of beta (tritium) and gamma {{irradiation}} on {{the surface}} electrical conductivity of two types of conducting polymer films are documented to determine their potential use as a sensing and surveillance device for the tritium facility. It was shown that surface conductivity was significantly reduced by irradiation with both gamma and tritium gas. In order to compare {{the results from the}} two radiation sources, an approximate dose equivalence was calculated. The materials were also sensitive to small radiation doses (< 10 {sup 5 } rad), showing that there is a measurable response to relatively small total doses of tritium gas. Spectroscopy was also used to confirm the mechanism by which this sensing device would operate in order to calibrate this sensor for potential use. It was determined that one material (polyaniline) was very sensitive to oxidation while the other material (PEDOT-PSS) was not. However, polyaniline provided the best response as a sensing material, and it is suggested that an oxygen-impermeable, radiation-transparent coating be applied to this material for future device prototype fabrication. A great deal of interest has developed in recent years in the area of conducting polymers due to the high levels of conductivity that can be achieved, some comparable to that of metals [Gerard 2002]. Additionally, the desirable physical and chemical properties of a polymer are retained and can be exploited for various applications, including light emitting diodes (LED), anti-static packaging, electronic coatings, and sensors. The electron transfer mechanism is generally accepted as one of electron 'hopping' through delocalized electrons in the conjugated backbone, although other mechanisms have been proposed based on the type of polymer and dopant [Inzelt 2000, Gerard 2002]. The conducting polymer polyaniline (PANi) is of particular interest because there are extensive studies on the modulation of the conductivity by changing either the oxidation state of the main backbone chain, or by protonation of the imine groups [de Acevedo, 1999]. There are several types of radiation sensors commercially available, including <b>ionization</b> chambers, geiger <b>counters,</b> proportional counters, scintillators and solid state detectors. Each type has advantages, although many of these sensors require expensive electronics for signal amplification, are large and bulky, have limited battery life or require expensive materials for fabrication. A radiation sensor constructed of a polymeric material could be flexible, light, and the geometry designed to suit the application. Very simple and inexpensive electronics would be necessary to measure the change in conductivity with exposure to radiation and provide an alarm system when a set change of conductivity occurs in the sensor that corresponds to a predetermined radiation dose having been absorbed by the polymer. The advantages of using a polymeric sensor of this type rather than those currently in use are the flexibility of sensor geometry and relatively low cost. It is anticipated that these sensors can be made small enough for glovebox applications or have the ability to monitor the air tritium levels in places where a traditional monitor cannot be placed. There have been a few studies on the changes in conductivity of polyaniline specifically for radiation detection [de Acevedo, 1999; Lima Pacheco, 2003], but there have been no reports on the effects of tritium (beta radiation) on conducting polymers, such as polyaniline or polythiophene. The direct implementation of conducting polymers as radiation sensor materials has not yet been commercialized due to differing responses with total dose, dose rate, etc. Some have reported a large increase in the surface conductivity with radiation dose while others report a marked decrease in conductive properties; these differing observations may reflect the competing mechanisms of chain scission and cross-linking. However, {{it is clear that the}} radiation dose effects on conducting polymers must be fully understood before these materials can be used as sensing devices. This report presents the results of irradiations of two conductive polymers: polyaniline and polythiophene. Samples of doped polyaniline and polythiophene were coated onto polyester (polyethyleneterephalate, PET) substrates and were exposed to both tritium gas (beta irradiation) and {sup 60 }Co gamma irradiation. The samples were subsequently characterized after various total doses. Infrared spectroscopy was utilized to characterize the gamma-exposed samples post-irradiation. Although the sources of radiation are different in kind (charged particle versus photon) and their energies differ, there will be great value in using noncontaminating gamma irradiation to model the effects of tritium beta radiation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is divided}} into three parts. Part A, {{discusses}} some of the focusing properties of magnetic fields used for the deflection and analysia of ion beams; part B describes the design and construction of magnets employing these theoretical principles; and Part C is an account of some experimental work done using focussed beams of deuterons. The work was all alone at the Clarendon Laboratory, between Michaelmas Term 1948 and Michaelmas Term 1953, and the three parts form a roughly chronological sequence. Part A: The Focusing Properties of Magnetic Analysers. The 1 M. V. and 500 KV. acaelerators of the Clarendon Laboratory provide relatively high current beams of positive ions which are very homogeneous in energy. For separating the ions of different masses a magnetic analyser is clearly necessary, since it can be shown that the alternative, an electrostatic analyser, gives energy dispersion only. The simple magnetic analyser which was customarily used until recently, being a sector shaped uniform field, has strong focussing properties in the plane containing the beam and perpendicular to the field lines (the "perpendicular" plane), but none in a plane containing the emergent beam and parallel to the field lines (the "parallel" plane). This focussing becomes stronger as the sector angle Φ is increased, until at 90 Â°, which is frequently a convenient angle, an incident collimated beam of circular cross-section converges to a line focus at the exit boundary. This is a great inconvenience in mnny cases where care has been taken with the accelerator to provide an intense ion beam for nuclear bombardment studies. The properties of such uniform sector fields are discussed briefly, since they serve to demonstrate the formal analogy between ion trajectories in magnetic fields (ion optics) and light optics. The power of the lens in the two planes can be changed by using a field which in non-uniform, varying with radial distance as H α r -n. Such a field focusses in both planess but it is shown that coincident foci can only be obtained at image distances too close to the magnet for practical convenience in many cases. The inherent non-uniformity of the "fringe" field at the pole boundaries can be used to change the power of the lens in both planes if the boundaries make an angle with the beam at entrance or exits. Expressions are derived for the image distances in both planes and the conditions for equality are then discussed. The equation has a variety of possible solutions which are to some extent limited by practical considerations. In particular, the magnification of the systme will in general increase with the increase of image distance and this proves to be the principal limiting factor, since the object for the ion-optical system has a finite size (initially the ion source canal). The theoretical results for a 90 ° analyser are compared with experiment and reasonable agreement is found. However it is found that there is a great loss of intensity in the analysed beam. the whole question of abberations is discussed and it is found that the loss of intensity is likely to be due to spherical abberation in the electron lens system, a circumstance that can probably not be improved in the existing type of accelerator column, and which makes 90 ° analyser of the type discussed of no great advantage over the uniform-sectpr field for many purposes. For an accelerator with large spherical aberration the only way out of this difficulty is to sacrifice the large dispersion and mechanical convenience of 90 ° deflection and use deflection through small angles. this is seperately considered as a special case of a field with oblique non-uniform boundaries, and the optical properties of such a magnet as is used in Part C are discussed. Part B: The Design of Magnets for Ion Analysers. The general considerations which guide the design of an analysing electromagnetic are presented, and details are given of the construction of a magnet and pole-pieces designed to give 90 ° deflection of l M. V. deutrons in either of the two opposite directions. The pole-pieces have faces which give the beam a 19 cm. radius path in the field, and freedom to choose the boundary angle (in accordance with the principles of Part A) is provided by the adjustable segments at the pole tips. The limitations on operation imposed by heating of the windings, non-uniformity of the field due to magnetic saturation and the proximity of the coils, and the effect of the hysteresis on field stabilisation are mentioned The vacuum box the carries the beam between the magnet poles is made of brass wave guide with a rigid supporting structure of Yorkshire tubing which also serves as a high speed pumping by-pass. The field is stabalised by referring the voltage developed by the magnet current across a resistance to that of a standard cell. The unbalance current is amplified by means of a galvanometer, modulated light beam, photocell and AC amplifier, and corrects the magnet current by a moter driven variac in the power supply before rectification. It is shown that a satisfactory magnet design can be based on triangular cores and windings. The dimensions of a magnet to deflect 1. 4 M. V. tritons through 90 ° in either of the two opposite directions are given, and also details of the tests, on a &frac 14; scale model, to find the temperature rise in the windings and the expected uniformity of the field in the full-size magnet. The field at various points in space near a triangular winding has been worked out. Part C: A Further Study of the D- D Reactors The angular distribution of the products of the two reactions: (a) D + D → He 3 + n (b) D + D → H 3 + p has been investigated in the energy range 150 KV. to 450 KV. (deuteron bombarding energy). Although other workers have made measurements of (a) in this region, the technique used was different, and the present work partly bridges the gap between the work of Eliot (0 to 50 KV.) and that of Blair (1 to 315 MV.), both of whom used similar methods. The apparatus consisted of a cylindrical target chamber filled with deuterium at a pressure of about 0. 1 mm. Hg., and attached {{to the end of the}} accelerator column of a 500 KV Phillips generator. the beam was carefully collimated by a canal system, and the charged reaction products from a small volume at the centre of the target box were counted by ion counters operated in the proportional region. Two counters were arranged to swivel about an axis through the centre of the reaction volume, and a third, which was used to monitor conditions, was fixed to the lid of the box. The counter windows were of very thin (about 0. 5 μ) quartz. The counter gas was heptane vapour at a pressure (about 1 cm.) determined by a fixed temperature bath. Counts were made of the number of He 3 and H,sup> 3 particles penetrating the counter window at various angles. These particles were distinguished by a careful choice of bias applied to a phase height disoriminato, and by the use of absorbing mica screens in front of the window. The principle is that the three charged particles from the reaction, as well as scattered deuterons, give in general different amounts of <b>ionization</b> in the <b>counter</b> materials and absorbers, because of their difference of energy and charge. the results to be expected are discussed in detail. The results are conveniently expressed in terms of the 'asymmetry' coefficients A and B in the expression for the angular distribution of the yields: Y α 1 + Acos 4 Ρ + Bcos 4 Ρ There is a significant difference in the values of A and B for reactions (a) and (b), which is in agreement with the results of other workers.
