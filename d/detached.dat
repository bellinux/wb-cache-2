This reflects the dynamical gradation that can exist between the orbital parameters of the scattered disk and the <b>detached</b> population.|$|E

5|$|In this way, <b>detached</b> objects differ {{substantially}} {{from most}} other known TNOs, which form a loosely defined set of populations {{that have been}} perturbed to varying degrees onto their current orbit by gravitational encounters with the giant planets, predominantly Neptune. <b>Detached</b> objects have larger perihelia than these other TNO populations, including the objects in orbital resonance with Neptune, such as Pluto, the classical Kuiper belt objects in non-resonant orbits such as Makemake, and the scattered disk objects like Eris.|$|E

Forces, which appear during removing of solid photopolymer layerformed in stereolithography 3 D DLP printer, can destroy the built model. In this article the detachment force is measured, obtained results arestatistically analyzed and relation between <b>detach</b> force, area of produced layer and thickness of the layer are verified. Linear dependence between <b>detach</b> force and built area is determined. On the other hand, relation between <b>detach</b> force and thickness of the layer is not confirmed...|$|R

5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} an extensive orchestral sinfonia marked Concerto in the autograph score. Lasting 22 bars, this ritornello establishes the prevailing anguished {{mood of the}} first section. It is heard twice again, but only as the accompanying backdrop for the separate musical material of the chorus, a setting of the first phrase of the Old Testament text. The open motifs are also heard again in the fragmentary accompaniment of the central choral fugato episode between the two reprises of the ritornello. The different motifs in the ritornello thus also serve the purpose of accompanying specific parts of the text. The first predominant motif consist of <b>detached</b> repeated quaver chords, passed antiphonally between the three instrumental groups of recorders, oboes and strings. These are accompanied by similarly <b>detached</b> crotchets, scored as quavers with rests, in the walking bass of the continuo. After thirteen bars there follows a four bar passage of melifluous semiquaver passages in thirds for the recorders with imitative responses from the oboes; the upper strings take up the <b>detached</b> crotchets and the continuo the groups of <b>detached</b> repeated quavers. In the four succeeding bars the quaver figure in the continuo line {{is replaced by a}} new motif of rising semiquaver scales, with the <b>detached</b> quavers and crotchets passing into the upper strings and the woodwind playing sustained chords. In the concluding two bars of the sinfonia the semiquaver scale motif passes into the recorders in thirds and is taken up by the other instruments for the sustained final cadence.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the American strikes on Formosa beginning 12 October, newly formed carrier units like the Japanese 634th Naval Air Group (NAG) were <b>detached</b> from their ships in the IJN's Fourth Carrier Division. Posted to the land-based 2nd Air Fleet, the 634th NAG experienced rapid attrition throughout {{the remainder of the}} month. By January 1945 this group had no personnel capable of maintaining flight operations. At the same time, older carrier units like the 653rd Naval Air Group, which had just finished rebuilding after losses suffered during the First Battle of the Philippine Sea, were <b>detached</b> and similarly integrated into the 2nd Air Fleet. Over the course of the Formosa Air Battle alone the 653rd NAG lost almost half of its available aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Iron Age and Roman remains {{have been}} found in the area. Steep {{formerly}} included a <b>detached</b> parish enclave called Ambersham, which lies deeply in West Sussex. It was the only <b>detached</b> part of Hampshire and was returned to West Sussex when a new law came into effect in 1844. The church of All Saints was built around 1125. From medieval times, Steep was included in the parish of East Meon until it became an independent parish in 1867. Since 1899 the village has been the location of Bedales School, a progressive public school.|$|E
