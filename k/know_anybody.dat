The final negotiation details between Atlantic and the band remain unknown. Weiland later clarified, [...] "I didn't want to record for Atlantic because I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> there anymore, except for Craig Kallman. Since then I've gotten to know Craig much better, and I've gotten to know the Atlantic staff pretty extensively." ...|$|E

Within a week, sales had risen tenfold; it reached number 1 on amazon.com's best-seller list, and number 6 in the best-seller lists of the bookstore chains Borders Group and Barnes & Noble. A prominent critic of Chomsky's political views, Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, told The New York Times that he believed most of those buying Hegemony or Survival would not read it, remarking that [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> who's ever read a Chomsky book". Furthermore, he related that the MIT professor [...] "does not write page turners, he writes page stoppers. There {{are a lot of}} bent pages in Noam Chomsky's books, and they are usually at about Page 16." ...|$|E

500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let me tell you something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he {{sit down with the}} mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E
500|$|Hartman {{was widely}} mourned in Hollywood. NBC {{executive}} Don Ohlmeyer stated that Hartman [...] "was {{blessed with a}} tremendous gift for creating characters that made people laugh. Everyone who {{had the pleasure of}} working with Phil knows that {{he was a man of}} tremendous warmth, a true professional and a loyal friend." [...] Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman's death, and Steve Martin said he was [...] "a deeply funny and very happy person." [...] Matt Groening called him [...] "a master", and director Joe Dante said, [...] "He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> who didn't like him." [...] Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly concluded that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper" [...] and [...] "a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with." [...] In 2007, Entertainment Weekly ranked Hartman the 87th greatest television icon of all time, and Maxim named Hartman the top Saturday Night Live performer of all time.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of The X-Files reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Gillian Anderson cited the episode as being among her highlights of the third season. She said the episode was like dessert, adding [...] "That's what kept it fun and that's what kept it worth doing all the time." [...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> in the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reilly's presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew. Executive Producer Robert Goodwin said that the casting of Reilly was the most fun of the episode.|$|E

2500|$|On July 28, 2009, Mike Stark {{approached}} Missouri Congressman Roy Blunt {{asking him}} about the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen. Blunt responded: [...] "What I don’t know is why the President can’t produce a birth certificate. I don’t <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> else that can’t produce one. And I think that’s a legitimate question. No health records, no birth certificate." [...] Blunt's spokesperson later claimed that the quote {{was taken out of}} context.|$|E

2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> who plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, I just put a little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of Defense Gates {{summarized}} fundamental {{concerns with}} the practicality {{of the program}} concept: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> at the Department of Defense, Mr. Tiahrt, who thinks that this program should, or would, ever be operationally deployed. The reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times {{more powerful than the}} chemical laser in the plane right now {{to be able to get}} any distance from the launch site to fire....So, right now the ABL would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase. And if you were to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since then many {{world famous}} authors have praised War and Peace as a {{masterpiece}} of the world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: [...] "This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed." [...] Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace [...] "the best novel that had ever been written". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: [...] "this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement." [...] Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be [...] "the greatest ever war novel {{in the history of}} literature." [...] Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he'd been taking lessons on how to [...] "write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way." [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> who could write about war better than Tolstoy did", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.|$|E
2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anybody.</b> I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 New Jersey Senator Harrison A. Williams [...] "reminded {{his colleagues}} of James Madison's strong {{objection}} when the post {{was created in}} 1793", and [...] "noted the modern fulfillment of another of Madison's warnings, that there would inevitably be discrimination in the appointment of such a chaplain against the (then) smaller denominations such as Catholics and Jews." [...] Williams pointed out [...] "that although Catholics have for some time comprised the largest religious affiliation in both the Senate and {{the population as a}} whole, there has been only one Catholic Senate Chaplain since 1793, and not a single rabbi." [...] He noted [...] "Only eight denominations have been represented in the office." [...] In light of this Williams put forward Senate Resolution 90 which [...] "resulted in the Senate's decision to appoint a new chaplain annually, rather than let the incumbent serve for life." [...] The appointment would also [...] "rotate among the nation's three major religious groups." [...] When asked by reporters about the question of Constitutionality raised by his citing Madison he replied [...] "If this were tested, I would say that it could go either way. It could be declared unconstitutional. Any taxpayer could question this, but no one ever has." [...] He held that in places where people were isolated by acts of government, such as people in the armed services, hospitals or prisons that chaplains serving them would be Constitutional, [...] "But, I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> less isolated than members of Congress." [...] In following eras the courts would rule on the constitutionality of the chaplaincy.|$|E
