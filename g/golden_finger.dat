6000|$|I love to {{play the}} child with little children, and have learned {{something}} by so doing; I have met with a child that has had a sore finger; yea, so sore as to be altogether at present useless; and not only so, but by reason of its infirmity, has been a let or hindrance {{to the use of}} all the fingers that have been upon that hand, then have I began to bemoan the child, and said, Alas! my poor boy, or girl, hast got a sore finger! Ah! quoth the child, with water in its eyes, and hath come to me to be bemoaned. Then I have begun to offer to touch the sore finger. O! saith the child, pray do not hurt me: I then have replied, Canst thou do nothing with this finger? No, saith the child, nor with this hand either; then have I said, Shall we cut off this finger, and buy my child a better, a brave <b>golden</b> <b>finger?</b> At this the child has started, stared in my face, gone back from me, and entertained a kind of indignation against me, and has no more cared to be intimate with me.

If membership be so dear, if this child has such tenderness to the most infirm, the most useless of its members; if it counts me its friend no longer than when I have a mouth to bemoan and carriages that show tenderness to this useless finger; what an interest doth membership give on in the body, and what compassions hath the soul for such an useless thing, because it is a member! and turning all this over to Jesus Christ, then instead of matter and corruption, there presently comes honey to me out of this child's sore finger; I take leave to tell you now how I use to play. And though I have told this tale upon so grave a truth, as is the membership of Christians with their head, yet bear with me; no child can be so tender of its sore finger as is the Son of God of his afflicted members; he cannot but be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.[31] ...|$|E

40|$|Colour {{adjectives}} or colour nouns?This paper presents partial {{results of}} corpus research into colour terms. Our focus here is on lexical-class membership. Colour terms {{are known to}} be either adjectives or nouns. But there may be cases where they have too easily been classified as adjectives. When a phrase headed by a colour term (or a colour compound) occurs in predicative position, this colour term is sometimes unequivocally a noun, witness the indefinite article: 1) BNC B 7 G The motorcycle was a bright red. It belonged to the Post Office. These alternate with articleless occurrences: 2) BNC BP 1 […] touching the reeds with <b>golden</b> <b>fingers</b> so that they were bright yellow. In 2), nothing in principle rules out the (uncountable) noun analysis. However, we have found few occurrences of articleless bright/dark/light/pale colour in predicative position in the BNC, a finding which supports the adjectival reading. But it is striking that when bright/dark/light/pale appear in the comparative form in predicative colour phrases, as in 3) BNC B 0 K The coat is red-and-white pied and the Brandrood variety is a darker red,the colour phrase is almost systematically preceded by the indefinite article. This reveals some association between comparative modifier and nominal colour term. We believe this association extends to the attributive position as well. It is usually assumed that strings like are compound adjectives (Bauer & Huddleston 2002 : 1658; Conti 2007 : 134). But there are four possible readings of a phrase like a very dark green room: 1. A room that is both very dark and green: a [very dark] [green] room 2. A green room that is very dark: a [very dark] [green room] 3. A room that is dark green to a high degree: a [very [dark green]] room 4. A room that is a very dark green: a [[very dark] green] roomIn 1 and 2, both dark and green are adjectives. More interesting are 3 and 4, where very dark green forms a constituent. In 3, dark green is a compound. In 4, the nominal paraphrase and the fact that very dark can hardly be an adverb phrase suggest that green is most likely a noun. It is this last claim in particular that needs further substantiation. We will therefore explore two patterns that potentially favour a nominal reading of the colour term: multiple premodification (e. g. rich dark green), and attributive colour phrases modified by comparative brighter/darker/lighter/paler (e. g. a darker green blouse) – which preclude adjectival compounds (as those are always internally uninflected).

"In his hand, {{the golden}} Papa has a letter; {{and after he}} has made his excuse for {{disturbing}} us in our Infernal Region with the common mortal Business of the house, he addresses himself to the three young Misses, and begins, as you English begin everything in this blessed world {{that you have to}} say, with a great O. 'O, my dears,' says the mighty merchant, 'I have got here a letter from my friend, Mr.----'(the name has slipped out of my mind; but no matter; we shall come back to that; yes, yes--right-all-right). So the Papa says, 'I have got a letter from my friend, the Mister; and he wants a recommend from me, of a drawing-master, to go down to his house in the country.' My-soul-bless-my-soul! when I heard the golden Papa say those words, if I had been big enough to reach up to him, I should have put my arms round his neck, and pressed him to my bosom in a long and grateful hug! As it was, I only bounced upon my chair. My seat was on thorns, and my soul was on fire to speak but I held my tongue, and let Papa go on. 'Perhaps you know,' says this good man of money, twiddling his friend's letter this way and that, in his <b>golden</b> <b>fingers</b> and thumbs, 'perhaps you know, my dears, of a drawing-master that I can recommend?' The three young Misses all look at each other, and then say (with the indispensable great O to begin) [...] "O, dear no, Papa! But here is Mr. Pesca' At the mention of myself I can hold no longer--the thought of you, my good dears, mounts like blood to my head--I start from my seat, as if a spike had grown up from the ground through the bottom of my chair--I address myself to the mighty merchant, and I say (English phrase) 'Dear sir, I have the man! The first and foremost drawing-master of the world! Recommend him by the post to-night, and send him off, bag and baggage (English phrase again--ha!), send him off, bag and baggage, by the train to-morrow!' 'Stop, stop,' says Papa; 'is he a foreigner, or an Englishman?' 'English to the bone of his back,' I answer. 'Respectable?' says Papa. 'Sir,' I say (for this last question of his outrages me, and I have done being familiar with him--) 'Sir! the immortal fire of genius burns in this Englishman's bosom, and, what is more, his father had it before him!' 'Never mind,' says the golden barbarian of a Papa, 'never mind about his genius, Mr. Pesca. We don't want genius in this country, unless it is accompanied by respectability--and then we are very glad to have it, very glad indeed. Can your friend produce testimonials--letters that speak to his character?' I wave my hand negligently. 'Letters?' I say. 'Ha! my-soul-bless-my-soul! I should think so, indeed! Volumes of letters and portfolios of testimonials, if you like!' 'One or two will do,' says this man of phlegm and money. 'Let him send them to me, with his name and address. And--stop, stop, Mr. Pesca--before you go to your friend, you had better take a note.' 'Bank-note!' I say, indignantly. 'No bank-note, if you please, till my brave Englishman has earned it first.' 'Bank-note!' says Papa, in a great surprise, 'who talked of bank-note? I mean a note of the terms--a memorandum of what he is expected to do. Go on with your lesson, Mr. Pesca, and I will give you the necessary extract from my friend's letter.' Down sits the man of merchandise and money to his pen, ink, and paper; and down I go once again into the Hell of Dante, with my three young Misses after me. In ten minutes' time the note is written, and the boots of Papa are creaking themselves away in the passage outside. From that moment, on my faith, and soul, and honour, I know nothing more! The glorious thought that I have caught my opportunity at last, and that my grateful service for my dearest friend in the world is as good as done already, flies up into my head and makes me drunk. How I pull my young Misses and myself out of our Infernal Region again, how my other business is done afterwards, how my little bit of dinner slides itself down my throat, I know no more than a man in the moon. Enough for me, that here I am, with the mighty merchant's note in my hand, as large as life, as hot as fire, and as happy as a king! Ha! ha! ha! right-right-right-all-right!"

40|$|There {{is a high}} {{motivation}} to develop smart sensor systems based on surface-engineered sensor elements for environmental and biomedical monitoring purposes. Key characteristics are that the sensors perform reliable, accurate, sensitive, and ideally selective measurements while being low-cost, portable, robust for online and on-field applications, and allowing wireless communication. Polymer-coated interdigitated electrodes (IDEs), which are able to convert {{a change in the}} properties of a dielectric material into an electrical signal, have shown promising detection performances in the gaseous phase. Within this concept, the collection of the target compounds, mostly by absorption, results in dielectric changes that can be measured capacitively. In this thesis, we pursue to study this type of sensors when brought in direct contact with an aqueous phase for the capacitive detection of organic pollutants. For this goal, planar IDE structures centred on 1 cm 2 large borosilicate glass chips were fabricated with the following electrode dimensions: 221 <b>golden</b> interdigitated <b>fingers</b> of 2 mm in length, 6 ?m in width, with a 3 ?m gap between them, and diagonally arranged leads of 6 ?m in width to the contact pads. IDE chips with and without in-plane guarding electrodes were designed. The IDE chips were wire-bonded to a printed circuit board, from where further connections to the electronic readout device were made. Measurements were performed using the LabVIEW supported universal transducer interface (UTI) by the Smartec Company in the Netherlands. The polymeric sensing layers were prepared using Sylgard® 184, a commercially available polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) product by the Dow Corning Company. The polymer layers were deposited with controlled thicknesses via a spin-coating technique. For polymer layer thicknesses larger than the spatial electrode wavelength, i. e., 18 ?m, the capacitances for IDE chips with and without in-plane guarding electrodes were in the order of ~ 19 pF and ~ 20 pF, respectively. The measurement resolution —and hence detection limit— was measured to be ~ 500 aF. PDMS has beneficial properties for both sensing and water-contact applications as the visco-elastic and hydrophobic silicone network allows quick and reversible diffusion of small molecules, and simultaneously it serves as a water sealant, protecting the electrode structure. The polymer-coated IDE chip also forms the bottom part of a flow cell chamber, which is completed by mounting a Teflon flow cell with a sealing Viton O-ring centred on top of the IDE chip. The flow cell system allows measurements under continuous flow conditions, using a syringe pump with two individual syringe drives. The polymer layer thickness with respect to the spatial electrode wavelength is an important design parameter. The electric sensing field established between the planar IDEs lies primarily out-of-plane. If the polymer layer is sufficiently thick and the electric field is restrained within the layer, only the absorption of pollutants into the layer will be detected. For thin polymer layers, for which the electric field extends beyond the polymer surface, also adsorption and swelling as induced by pollutant uptake will contribute to changes in the capacitive response. We show that the polymer layer thickness also plays a significant insulation role. The out-of-plane electric field of the planar IDEs is geometrically difficult to guard, especially when the chip is being exposed to an electrically challenging environment, such as water. This is —because in contrast to air— water is relatively conductive, especially when it contains dissolved solids, and it has a relatively high dielectric constant. For this reason, the electrical complexity for aqueous systems is enhanced and the chance for parasitic electrical coupling effects to other system parts and the surrounding increases. If the electric sensing field is parasitically coupled through the water phase, then device sensitivity to electrical changes of the aqueous solution is induced. By means of the two-port technique, the UTI is not affected by parasitic capacitances of parallel capacitors to ground, such as introduced, e. g., by the coax cables. Yet, electrical coupling events that lead to a reduction in the IDE capacitance cannot be distinguished. It was found that for the designed system and for an unguarded IDE chip with ~ 50 ?m thick PDMS coating an increase in the aqueous salt (NaCl) molarity from 0 up to 20 mM results in a capacitance decrease down to ~ 175 fF. This is attributed to enhanced parasitic coupling to the system environment for increasing solution salinity. The parasitic coupling effect further increased for lower layer thicknesses, showing its role of insulation. We demonstrated how water-enhanced electrical coupling to in-plane guarding electrodes or ideally a third electrode, which connects the water phase with the ground terminal, is a key mechanism in achieving response immunity to further parasitic coupling. This way the device sensitivity to solution conditions can be significantly decreased for reasonable layer thicknesses and without impairing the detection performance. Eventually, we investigated the capacitive response of interdigitated electrodes covered with ~ 50 ?m thick PDMS films from the moment of deposition until full evaporation of drops of pure volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including chloroform, methyl tert-butyl ether, 1 -hexanol, toluene, m-xylene, and n-hexane. Then the direct exposure to aqueous solutions of these VOCs (up to 1 mM) under continuous flow conditions was studied. It is shown that the capacitive response changes upon absorption of the VOCs into the PDMS are in line with their relative dielectric constants as compared to the one of the thin PDMS layer and that the response changes were fully reversible. The response changes were in the low fF range with a detection limit of ~ 0. 1 mM for the more water-soluble VOCs, which include chloroform, methyl tert-butyl ether, and 1 -hexanol. However, the response reproducibility decreased for the more hydrophobic organics toluene, m-xylene, and n-hexane, pointing at distribution processes such as evaporation, wetting, and phase separation within the system. Research challenges are the design of innovative polymeric sensing layers that provide both tuned chemical selectivity within an IDE multi-array and sufficient sealing properties when being directly exposed to water. This may require also the design of new surface modification techniques to achieve good adhesion with the transducer substrate. Further research on the detection and partitioning processes will demand the design of fully conditioned and calibrated measuring systems. Finally, the development of more sensitive transducer interfaces and fully integrated smart sensor systems are further requirements to achieve the goal of target detection at governmental water standards.

You don't understand Nor care to understand about my art, But you can hear at least when people speak: And that cartoon, the second from the door --It is the thing. Love! so such things should be-- Behold Madonna!--I am bold to say. I can do with my pencil what I know, [...] 60 What I see, what at bottom of my heart I wish for, if I ever wish so deep-- Do easily, too--when I say, perfectly, I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, And just as much they used to say in France. At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: I do what many dream of, all their lives, --Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, [...] 70 And fail in doing. I could count twenty such On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, Who strive--you don't know how the others strive To paint a little thing like that you smeared Carelessly passing with your robes afloat-- Yet do much less, so much less. Someone says, (I know his name, no matter)--so much less! Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. There burns a truer light of God in them, In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, [...] 80 Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, Enter and take their place there sure enough, Though they come back and cannot tell the world. My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. The sudden blood of these men! at a word-- Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. I, painting from myself and to myself, [...] 90 Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame Or their praise either. Somebody remarks Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, Sightly traced and well ordered; what of that? Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-gray Placid, and perfect with my art: the worse! I know both what I want and what might gain, [...] 100 And yet how profitless to know, to sigh [...] "Had I been two, another and myself, Our head would have o'erlooked the world!" [...] No doubt. Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth The Urbinate who died five years ago. ('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) Well, I can fancy how he did it all, Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, Above and through his art--for it gives way; [...] 110 That arm is wrongly put--and there again-- A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, He means right--that, a child may understand. Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: But all the play, the insight and the stretch-- Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think-- [...] 120 More than I merit, yes, by many times. But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow, And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare-- Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged [...] "God and the glory! never care for gain. The present by the future, what is that? Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! [...] 130 Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!" [...] I might have done it for you. So it seems: Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; The rest avail not. Why do I need you? What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? In this world, who can do a thing, will not; And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power-- And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, [...] 140 God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. 'T is safer for me, if the award be strict, That I am something underrated here, Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. The best is when they pass and look aside; But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! [...] 150 I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, In that humane great monarch's <b>golden</b> look-- One <b>finger</b> in his beard or twisted curl Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, I painting proudly with his breath on me, All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls [...] 160 Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts-- And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, This in the background, waiting on my work, To crown the issue with a last reward! A good time, was it not, my kingly days? And had you not grown restless [...] . but I know-- 'T is done and past; 't was right, my instinct said, Too live the life grew, golden and not gray, And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. [...] 170 How could it end in any other way? You called me, and I came home to your heart. The triumph was--to reach and stay there; since I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! [...] "Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; The Roman's is the better when you pray, But still the other's Virgin was his wife--" [...] Men will excuse me, I am glad to judge [...] 180 Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows My better fortune, I resolve to think. For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, Said one day Agnolo, his very self, To Rafael's [...] . I have known it all these years [...] . (When the young man was flaming out his thoughts Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, Too lifted up in heart because of it) [...] "Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, [...] 190 Who, were he set to plan and execute As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!" [...] To Rafael's!--And indeed the arm is wrong. I hardly dare [...] . yet, only you to see, Give the chalk here--quick, thus the line should go! Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, (What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? Do you forget already words like those?) [...] 200 If really there was such a chance, so lost-- Is, whether you're--not grateful--but more pleased. Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! This hour has been an hour! Another smile? If you would sit thus by me every night I should work better, do you comprehend? I mean that I should earn more, give you more. See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. [...] 210 Come from the window, love--come in, at last, Inside the melancholy little house We built to be so gay with. God is just. King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, The walls become illumined, brick from brick Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, That gold of his I did cement them with! Let us but love each other. Must you go? That Cousin here again? he waits outside? [...] 220 Must see you--you, and not with me? Those loans? More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? While hand and eye and something of a heart Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit The gray remainder of the evening out, Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly How I could paint, were I but back in France, One picture, just one more--the Virgin's face, [...] 230 Not yours this time! I want you at my side To hear them--that is, Michel Agnolo-- Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend. I take the subjects for his corridor, Finish the portrait out of hand--there, there, And throw him in another thing or two If he demurs; the whole should prove enough To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, What's better and what's all I care about, [...] 240 Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he, The Cousin! what does he to please you more? ...|$|R
