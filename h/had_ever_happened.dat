500|$|Achebe {{has been}} called [...] "the father of modern African writing" [...] and Africa's {{greatest}} storyteller, and many books and essays {{have been written about}} his work over the past fifty years. In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman's Library collection published by Alfred A. Knopf. His 60th birthday was celebrated at the University of Nigeria by [...] "an international Who's Who in African Literature". One observer noted: [...] "Nothing like it <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> before in African literature anywhere on the continent." ...|$|E
500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|After the incident, Brodevik {{described}} his {{and the other}} band member's situation as [...] "trapped like rats." [...] While {{he said that the}} band is used to hatred from the extreme metal community toward the Bible and Christianity, nothing like this <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the band before. Aanonsen, the bassist and a father of three, explained that while he understood that the tour could have ended in death for him and the other band members, when violence finally broke out a Belo Horizonte he remained completely, unexpectedly calm. In retrospect he remarked that while it scared him, the concert in Belo Horizonte was the best he has ever experienced, as all attendees [...] "defied so much" [...] to get to it. He also noted that because of the attack, the band is now [...] "twice as big" [...] in Brazil as it had been before the incident. In a summary of the concert posted on Facebook, Antestor stated that ...|$|E

25|$|In the 1st {{innings of}} the 5th Test, England's 6th, 7th and 8th wicket {{partnerships}} all made 100, {{the first time}} this <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in Test cricket.|$|R
500|$|From 2006, {{according}} to Rinder, executives undergoing [...] "group confessions" [...] {{were made to}} stand in big trash cans {{in the middle of}} the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. Rinder described how it became [...] "relatively routine" [...] for people to be [...] "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" [...] in order to make them confess. He told the Tampa Bay Times that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment. There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became [...] "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable." [...] He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour or so, he was [...] "shaking so uncontrollably and his lips were so completely blue that he was incapable of talking". (The executive in question denied to the Tampa Bay Times that this incident <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dublin were victorious by {{a single}} point, {{achieving}} their first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title since 1995. This was the first Kerry–Dublin final since 1985. History was made as the winning point was scored by a goalkeeper, Stephen Cluxton of Dublin, {{the first time this}} <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in the final. Cluxton's point gave the title to Dublin as, with the teams level, the match would have had to be replayed at a later date had it ended with both teams on the same score. RTÉ called it [...] "one of the most gripping Sam Maguire Cup deciders of the modern era" [...] and the BBC said it was a [...] "dramatic comeback victory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aviva Dove-Viebahn {{wrote that}} [...] "Mad Men {{straddles}} {{the line between}} a nuanced portrayal of how sexism and patriarchal entitlement shape lives, careers and social interactions in the 1960s and a glorified rendering of the 'fast-paced, chauvinistic world of 1960s advertising and all that comes with it.'" [...] Melissa Witkowski, writing for The Guardian, argued that Peggy's ascendancy was marred because the show [...] "strongly implies that no woman had ever been a copywriter at Sterling Cooper prior to Peggy, but the circumstances of her promotion imply that this was merely because no woman <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to have shown talent {{in front of a}} man before," [...] pointing out that Peggy's career path bore little resemblance to the stories of successful ad women of the time such as Mary Wells Lawrence and Jean Wade Rindlaub.|$|E

2500|$|Roberts was at {{the time}} a {{resident}} of nearby Georgetown, another unincorporated area of Bart Township. His wife last saw him at 8:45a.m. when they walked their children to the bus stop before she left. When Mrs. Roberts returned home a little before 11:00a.m., she discovered four suicide notes; one addressed to herself and one to each of their three children. Roberts called his wife from the schoolhouse on his cell phone and told her that he had molested two young female relatives (between the ages of 3 and 5) 20 years previously (when he was 12) and had been daydreaming about molesting again. One note Roberts left behind indicated his despondency over a daughter who died approximately 20 minutes after birth nine years earlier. He stated that he had [...] "been having dreams {{for the past couple of}} years about doing what he did 20 years ago and he has dreams of doing them again", according to State Police Commissioner Colonel Jeffrey Miller. On October 4, 2006, the two relatives whom Roberts said he molested 20 years ago told police that no such abuse <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened,</b> throwing a new layer of mystery over the gunman's motive and mental state during the shooting. KY Jelly was also found in the schoolhouse among Roberts's belongings, possibly suggesting multiple motives for the incident.|$|E

50|$|The RCMP and Crimestoppers {{received}} many thanks for their work. Only a few shootings in public venues <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in Nova Scotia's history, {{such as the}} 1992 Sydney River McDonald's murders in Cape Breton.|$|R
60|$|So Fillmore and Gladys Winch are married! From what I {{have seen}} of her, it's {{the best thing}} that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to Brother F. She is a splendid girl. I must write to him...|$|R

60|$|No such {{introduction}} to the evening readings as this <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> before in all Mrs. Armadale's experience as a listener. She {{looked up from the}} sofa in a flutter of curiosity, and besought her reverend friend to favor her with an explanation.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Sibiu was the European Capital of Culture (together with Luxembourg). This was {{the most}} {{important}} cultural event that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.|$|R

50|$|A {{traditional}} legend is of wreckers deliberately decoying ships on to coasts using tricks (in particular false lights), so {{that they}} run ashore and can be plundered. While this has been depicted in many stories and legends, it is uncertain that this <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA. I {{have only}} this to say. You dragged {{me down to}} your level for a moment this afternoon.

60|$|I {{went into}} Old Munich one {{afternoon}} {{when there were}} few customers, and sat at my usual table near the stairway. I was shocked and almost displeased to perceive that the glass cigar-case by the orchestra stand had been smashed to smithereens. I did not like things to happen in Old Munich. Nothing <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> there before.|$|E
60|$|Uncle John laughed. He doubled up in {{his chair}} and rocked back and forth, shaking his little round body as if he had met with the most amusing thing that <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in his life. Aunt Jane stared at him, while Louise and Beth looked their astonishment, but Patsy's clear {{laughter}} rang above Uncle John's gasping chuckles.|$|E
50|$|How {{long the}} {{condition}} {{has been going}} on and how it has changed since onset (better, worse, different symptoms), whether it <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> before, whether and how it may have changed since onset, and when the pain stopped if it is no longer currently being felt.|$|R

50|$|The lust song. Amos, {{thinking}} {{that he is in}} love, recounts the excitement he feels for his new relationship. And for Amos, every night with Shelby truly is Heaven sent.

60|$|How strange--stranger than {{anything}} that <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to her before--was it to hear that name on the lips of this cowboy! It was a name by which she was familiarly known, though only those nearest and dearest to her {{had the privilege of}} using it. And now it revived her dulled faculties, and by an effort she regained control of herself.|$|E
6000|$|No note of doubt, hesitation, concealment, or shame was {{in their}} {{greetings}} and the boy knew it. They all sat around the kitchen, and chatted and laughed as if no ill thing <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to him. Burns uttered the only doubtful word when he said: [...] "I don't know about this running away from things here. I'd be inclined {{to stay here and}} fight it out." ...|$|E
60|$|If the Parks be ‘the lungs of London,’ {{we wonder}} what Greenwich Fair is—a {{periodical}} breaking out, we suppose, {{a sort of}} spring-rash: a three days’ fever, which cools the blood for six months afterwards, and at the expiration of which London is restored to its old habits of plodding industry, as suddenly and completely as if nothing <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to disturb them.|$|E
6000|$|Clayton {{ignored the}} comment. [...] "It is {{the strangest thing}} that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in my life.

50|$|The {{events at}} Burrangong were well-recorded at the time, {{and have been}} {{analysed}} {{by a number of}} historians in recent decades. The Burrangong affair was arguably the most serious civil disorder that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in Australia, involving more people and lasting much longer than the Eureka rebellion at Ballarat six years earlier.|$|R
