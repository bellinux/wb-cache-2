5|$|After graduation, {{she moved}} to Amsterdam to {{interview}} Dutch anarchists in the Provo countercultural movement. While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin. Soon after they were married, she said, de Bruin began to abuse her severely, punching and kicking her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on her legs with a wooden beam, and banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> floor until he knocked her unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
25|$|In May 1970, Norris—on bail for {{his latest}} offense—attacked a female student {{whom he had}} been {{stalking}} {{on the grounds of}} the San Diego State University campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees, before he repeatedly beat <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the Atascadero State Hospital, where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.|$|E

50|$|We {{also learn}} how May sleeps, “in snatches” with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bowed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall which is {{reminiscent}} of Mary in Watt.|$|R
60|$|Just then <b>her</b> <b>head</b> struck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{roof of the}} hall: in {{fact she}} was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.|$|R
25|$|Chrissie persuades Zoe {{to abort}} {{the baby and}} tells her they should team up for revenge on Den. They get {{together}} with Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) to do this, meeting up in The Queen Victoria. Chrissie sends for Sharon claiming Den is on his deathbed. She finds out that it isn't true and leaves again. Chrissie planned this {{to get rid of}} Sharon so Den would pay attention to her and love her instead. Right after Sharon leaves, Den realizes Chrissie did this and attacks her smashing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> jukebox. Zoe stops him by attacking him with a metal doorstop, supposedly killing him. She runs off and Sam goes after her to calm her down. However, he is not dead, and he grabs Chrissie. She hits him again with the doorstop, killing him. Zoe is led to believe that she killed Den, though Sam sees Chrissie kill Den and eventually tells Zoe, who punches Chrissie.

500|$|When told by Dr. Lynn of her husband's death, Ono started sobbing and said, [...] "Oh no, no, no, no... tell me it's not true!" [...] Dr. Lynn {{remembers that}} Ono {{lay down and}} began hitting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> floor, but calmed down when a nurse gave Lennon's wedding ring to her. In a state of shock, she was led away from Roosevelt Hospital by Geffen Records' president, David Geffen.|$|E
2500|$|After Torque defeats the creature, {{he remembers}} the murders. During an {{argument}} with his wife, he pushed her, and she accidentally knocked <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bedside table. Seeing his mother dead, Torque's eldest son, Cory, drowns his younger brother and then jumps from the upstairs window, telling Torque, [...] "You took her away, I'm taking us away." [...] When the coastguard arrives, Torque knocks him out and commandeers the boat, sailing away from Carnate.|$|E
60|$|And {{then her}} eyes closed. The {{voice of the}} Man from Nome had a monotony in its very earnestness. Besides, what dull talk was this of brooms and {{sweeping}} and dust? She leaned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|R
60|$|Just at this moment, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> struck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{roof of the}} hall: in fact, she was now {{rather more}} than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried off to the garden door.|$|R
60|$|When {{twilight}} came {{she went}} out to the front steps and leaned <b>her</b> aching <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> honeysuckle trellis. The sun had just set and the whole world swam in dusky golden light. The wonderful beauty frightened her. She felt like a blot on it.|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{pretended to}} bang <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sofa in mock frustration. [...] "SO {{much has been}} made of that," [...] she groans, noting that it was only done where words had been used that really meant {{something}} very different to Americans. Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper – British for pullover sweater – means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. [...] "He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?" [...] That was fine with Rowling.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was {{transferred}} from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as 'Prisoner n° 280'. Leaving the tower she bumped <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> lintel of a door, which prompted one of her guards to {{ask her if she}} was hurt, to which she answered, [...] "No! Nothing now can hurt me." [...] This was the most difficult period of her captivity. She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy. The [...] "Carnation Plot" [...] (Le complot de l'œillet), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards. She was attended by Rosalie Lamorlière, who took care of her as much as she could. At least once she received a visit by a Catholic priest.|$|E
2500|$|Although King David and {{his successors}} sought {{to impose their}} {{authority}} on Moray, resistance continued. King Malcolm IV, David's grandson and successor, uprooted and expelled the local populace. The Chronicle of Holyrood records that in 1163: [...] "King Malcolm transferred men of Moray". It was not until 1229, when William Comyn of Buchan, led a royal army into Moray and finally, brutally, pacified the province for King Alexander II; he was rewarded by a grateful king with the lordship of Badenoch. The final, and most unmerciful, action in the mac Malcolm kings' long campaign against the rival royal dynasty was perpetrated against the infant in whom its claim resided: the three-year-old girl was publicly murdered by King Alexander's men, who, having read a proclamation, smashed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> market-cross in the burgh of Forfar. Moray now finally accepted {{the rule of the}} mac Malcolm kings of Scots.|$|E
60|$|The mare {{had raised}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and cocked <b>her</b> ears at the {{rustling}} of a quail in the thicket. Chris {{leaned over and}} rubbed around her ears.

60|$|He struck savagely at {{her face}} in the darkness. She threw herself down, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cushions. With the {{strength}} and fury of a maniac he showered his blows above her, thudding upon the leather or crashing upon the woodwork, heedless of his own splintered hands.|$|R
60|$|She {{had turned}} and fallen into step beside him, <b>her</b> hooded <b>head</b> bowed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{thinning}} rain. As usual she was humming to herself.|$|R
2500|$|On September 5, 1989, {{after her}} Sizzling Spectacular concert in Nevada, Gordon {{forcibly}} married Jackson, claiming {{it was for}} her own protection against kidnapping by her family. La Toya Jackson states that this was both unplanned and against her wishes. According to Jackson; [...] "I told him, 'No way, Jack! I can't marry you. You know what marriage means to me. I've never been in love; I don't even date.... It's not right. I don't love you. I don't have feelings for you.'" [...] Jackson tried {{to run out of}} the chapel three times but bodyguard Antonio Rossi grabbed her saying, [...] "There's some things you have to do. Even if you don't want to." [...] Jackson told Ebony magazine the marriage was [...] "strictly in name only. It has never been consummated." [...] Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> corner of the hotel room table saying that he would never let her go. Paparazzi subsequently photographed Jackson with black eyes, which Gordon claimed were caused by an intruder. From this point forward, Jackson lost all contact with her family and wrote an autobiography, , which accused her father of physical abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
2500|$|The video {{starts with}} King {{swinging}} {{around on a}} chair, then goes {{through all of the}} band's members with a close up shot. As Healy starts singing, she is at a window, and it is images outside of the window, with raindrops on the window, goes inside of the house, where she is seen sitting playing with the blinds at the window. The band are pictures at the Cinema trying to cheer Healy up after she's had her heart broke, eventually the band start having a laugh by throwing popcorn at her. Sandford and Wiseman are seen putting the phone down on their boyfriends after singing the lyrics, [...] "there's nothing left to say". As the chorus kicks in, White is seen walking out of the house, slamming the door, singing the lyrics, [...] "forever is over", which means she's left her boyfriend, she has had enough. The band start smashing and throwing things as they are angry with their ex-boyfriends. Wiseman is later seen having lunch with her boyfriend, which she is not very happy about and starts pulling faces, and later throws her glass of wine over him, and throws her engagement ring away. Sandford is also seen trying to phone her boyfriend, but he does not pick up the phone, and she puts <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, and King comes comfort her by putting her arm around her. There are scenes where Healy and Wiseman begin to cook cakes in the kitchen, and where all the band are dancing in the car. Healy is seen typing 'Lover' into her laptop, but then deletes the L so it spells 'Over'. As the video comes to an end, the band are seen in a night club dancing, then leaving the club.|$|E

Her parents divorced a few years after the rescue.|$|R
6000|$|The {{figure of}} the little Madonna in the [...] "Presentation" [...] should be [...] {{compared}} with Titian's in his picture of the same subject in the [...] Academy. I prefer Tintoret's infinitely: and note how much finer is [...] the feeling with which Tintoret has relieved the glory round <b>her</b> <b>head</b> [...] <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pure sky, than that which influenced Titian in encumbering [...] his distance with architecture.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Cyrilla {{glanced at}} the little mother. She had fallen asleep with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> seat-back.|$|E

60|$|With <b>her</b> <b>head</b> lowered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> keen wind {{she walked}} rapidly {{down the street}} and stopped for an instant {{at the door of the}} fourth house.

6000|$|At length [...] "Wilbur" [...] said: [...] "Good-night." [...] I rose, and Miller, eagerly, expectantly, {{turned the}} light slowly on.
