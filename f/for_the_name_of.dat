5|$|Some of Fleming's {{friends had}} their names {{used in the}} story, with Ivar Bryce giving his name to the alias used by Bond, while another friend, Tommy Leiter, found his surname being used for Felix Leiter; Ivar Bryce's middle name of Felix was used for Leiter's first name, while John Fox-Strangways saw part of his surname being used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the MI6 station chief in Jamaica. Fleming also used {{the name of the}} local Jamaican Rufous-throated {{solitaire}} bird as the name of the book's main female character.|$|E
5|$|Still another, Walter Kwiatkowski, {{testified that}} he paid Horton $600 (in {{addition}} to the $200 bond) to have the case against him dropped where Glasser was acting as prosecutor. And another, Victor Raubunas, {{testified that he}} twice paid bribes to Kretske in cases that Glasser was handling (Raubunas was convicted a third time, after refusing to pay Kretske, in a case prosecuted by Ward himself). Mae and Anthony Jurkas, two small-time bootleggers, testified that Glasser declined to prosecute them in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> their bootlegging boss.|$|E
5|$|While {{the story}} was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title GoldenEye traces its origins to the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels. Fleming gave a number of origins <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> his estate, {{including}} Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye and Operation Goldeneye, a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during World War II {{in case of a}} Nazi invasion through Spain.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British {{army officer}} and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{who served as}} Vice-Chamberlain {{during the reign of}} King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led to the demise of the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the Hawaiian ukulele.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Irataba's family relations, except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> his son Tekse thume, and his nephews Qolho qorau (Irataba's sister's son who succeeded him as leader) and Aspamekelyeho. Olive Oatman, who lived with the Mohave for five years, later stated that Irataba was {{the brother of the}} former chief, presumably Cairook, with whom Irataba clearly had a close relation. One anecdotal {{description}} states that Irataba had several wives, among them a Hualapai woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son. He also had at least one daughter, the mother of his granddaughter Tcatc who was interviewed in the 1950s. She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother's sons, but that they were eventually lost.|$|E
5|$|Peribsen's royal name is {{a subject}} of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is {{connected}} to the deity Seth rather than Horus, as was traditional <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a pharaoh. Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see Hieroglyphics). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the Set animal, representing Seth, on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh, he is not the only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 13th dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre, the 19th dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 20th dynasty king Setnakhte.|$|E
