In 1966, 12 JA class members (and four J class) received a full overhaul, six in 1967 and two in 1968. Use of steam on freight on the East Coast of the South Island finished in March 1969, and 15 JAs and the three Js rebuilt with North Island JA tenders and trailing engine bogies were maintained for service. JA 1267 was the last steam engine given an A grade overhaul by NZR in November 1968, and with the last three Js provided {{one of the last}} high speed steam services in the world, between Christchurch and Oamaru. The JA class lasted in front-line duty until the end of steam in New Zealand; the South Island Limited was then worked by steam locomotives until replaced by the diesel Southerner in November 1970.

40|$|Nowadays the {{challenges}} on SOFC are {{to find a}} way to produce good quality electrolyte, which does not need sintering at high temperature.

Cerium ammonium nitrate and gadolinium acetylacetonate were used as precursors' salts. Parameters such as gas flow, liquid flow and temperature were studied.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dependence}} of the heat transfer and the van der Waals friction between two semi-infinite solids on the dielectric properties of the bodies. We show that the <b>heat</b> transfer and <b>van</b> der Waals friction at short separation between the solids may increase by many orders of magnitude when the surfaces are covered by adsorbates, or can support low-frequency surface plasmons. In this case the <b>heat</b> transfer and <b>van</b> der Waals friction are determined by resonant photon tunneling between adsorbate vibrational modes, or surface plasmon modes. The enhancement of the van der Waals friction is especially large when in the adsorbed layer there is an acoustic branch for the vibrations parallel to the surface like {{in the case of}} Cs adsorption on Cu(100) surface. In this case we show that even for separation d= 10 nm, the van der Waals friction induced by adsorbates can be so large that it can be measured with the present state-of-art equipment. The van an der Waals friction is characterized by a strong distance dependence (∼ 1 /d^ 6), and at the small distances it can be much larger than the electrostatic friction observed in Stipe. 0. 3 cm Keywords: non-contact friction, van der Waals friction, radiative heat transfer, atomic force microscope, adsorbate vibrational modeComment: published in Surface Scienc...|$|R

40|$|We generalize {{normal mode}} {{expansion}} of Green's tensor G̅̅̅(r,r') to lossy resonators in open systems, resolving a longstanding open challenge. We obtain a simple yet robust formulation, whereby radiation {{of energy to}} infinity is captured by a complete, discrete set of modes, rather than a continuum. This enables rapid simulations by providing the spatial variation of G̅̅̅(r,r') over both r and r' in one simulation. Few eigenmodes are often necessary for nanostructures, facilitating both analytic calculations and unified insight into computationally intensive phenomena such as Purcell enhancement, radiative <b>heat</b> transfer, <b>van</b> der Waals forces, and Förster resonance energy transfer. We bypass all implementation and completeness issues associated with the alternative quasinormal eigenmode methods, by defining modes with permittivity rather than frequency as the eigenvalue. We obtain true stationary modes that decay rather than diverge at infinity, and are trivially normalized. Completeness is achieved both for sources located within the inclusion and the background through use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Modes are defined by a linear eigenvalue problem, readily implemented using any numerical method. We demonstrate its simple implementation on COMSOL Multiphysics, using the default inbuilt tools. Results were validated against direct scattering simulations, including analytical Mie theory, attaining arbitrarily accurate agreement regardless of source location or detuning from resonance.

30|$|The two {{variables}} of secondary {{importance in the}} two statistical models can both be interpreted as affecting fuel availability and fuel quantity (Figure 4 B and 4 C). The noticeably higher probabilities of scarring from WFU fires on south-facing aspects are most likely due to generally warmer and drier conditions that exist on south-facing slopes (Taylor and Skinner 1998). These conditions are caused by higher solar insolation on south-facing slopes, {{and can lead to}} greater fuel consumption and heat output in fires, relative to north- and east-facing aspects (Beaty and Taylor 2001, Stephens 2001, Skinner et al. 2006). The higher probability of scarring in stands with greater basal area may also be related to greater fuel availability, and consequently greater fuel consumption. Greater basal area is generally associated with larger trees, which generally have larger crowns, thus contributing to greater quantity and continuity of fine fuels to the forest floor (Skinner et al. 2005). Greater continuity of fine fuel promotes fire spread into areas of higher tree basal area, and the greater quantity leads to greater consumption and <b>heat</b> output (<b>van</b> Wagtendonk et al. 1998, Skinner et al. 2005, Ritchie et al. 2007). Increased heat output from fires, especially near the base of trees where fine fuels tend to accumulate, increases the probability of partial cambium mortality, and thus fire-scar formation (Gill 1974, McBride and Laven 1976).|$|R

Here, using time-resolved photocurrent measurements we identify an efficient out-of-plane energy transfer channel, where charge carriers in graphene couple to hyperbolic phonon polaritons in the encapsulating layered material. This hyperbolic cooling is particularly efficient, giving picosecond cooling times, for hexagonal BN, where the high-momentum hyperbolic phonon polaritons enable efficient near-field energy transfer. We study this heat transfer mechanism through distinct control knobs to vary carrier density and lattice temperature, and find excellent agreement with theory without any adjustable parameters.
