Microbiota has been observed to differ in subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis compared to controls, and this finding has commanded this study as a possible autoimmune process.

40|$|Intestinal {{bacteria}} influence mammalian physiology, {{but many}} types of bacteria are still uncharacterized. Moreover, reference strains of mouse gut bacteria are not easily available, although mouse models are extensively used in medical research. These are major limitations for the investigation of <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes</b> and their interactions with diet and host. It is thus important to study in detail the diversity and functions of gut microbiota members, including those colonizing the mouse intestine. To address these issues, we aimed at establishing the Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC), a public repository of bacterial strains and associated genomes from the mouse gut, and studied host-specificity of colonization and sequence-based relevance of the resource. The collection includes several strains representing novel species, genera and even one family. Genomic analyses showed that certain species are specific to the mouse intestine and that a minimal consortium of 18 strains covered 50 - 75 % of the known functional potential of metagenomes. The present work will sustain future research on microbiota-host interactions in health and disease, as it will facilitate targeted colonization and molecular studies.

Here we explore the microbiome composition of different feeding specialists: insectivore Macrotus waterhousii, sanguivore Desmodus rotundus, nectarivores Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Glossophaga soricina, and frugivores Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus jamaicensis. The V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene from three intestinal regions of three individuals per species was amplified and community composition and structure was analyzed with α and β diversity metrics. Bats with plant-based diets had low diversity microbiomes, whereas the sanguivore D. rotundus and insectivore M. waterhousii had the most diverse microbiomes. There {{were no significant differences}} in microbiome composition between different intestine regions within each individual. Plant-based feeders showed less specificity in their microbiome compositions, whereas animal-based specialists, although more diverse overall, showed a more clustered arrangement of their intestinal bacterial components. The main characteristics defining microbiome composition in phyllostomids were species and feeding strategy. This study shows how differences in feeding strategies contributed to the development of different <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes</b> in Phyllostomidae...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{microbes}} {{inhabit the}} human intestine, {{many of which}} are uncharacterized or uncultivable. They form a complex microbial community that deeply affects human physiology. To identify the genomic features common to all human gut microbiomes as well as those variable among them, we performed a large-scale comparative metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from 13 healthy individuals of various ages, including unweaned infants. We found that, while the gut microbiota from unweaned infants were simple and showed a high inter-individual variation in taxonomic and gene composition, those from adults and weaned children were more complex but showed a high functional uniformity regardless of age or sex. In searching for the genes over-represented in gut microbiomes, we identified 237 gene families commonly enriched in adult-type and 136 families in infant-type microbiomes, with a small overlap. An analysis of their predicted functions revealed various strategies employed by each type of microbiota to adapt to its intestinal environment, suggesting that these gene sets encode the core functions of adult and infant-type gut microbiota. By analysing the orphan genes, 647 new gene families were identified to be exclusively present in human <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes.</b> In addition, we discovered a conjugative transposon family explosively amplified in human gut microbiomes, which strongly suggests that the intestine is a ‘hot spot’ for horizontal gene transfer between microbes...|$|R

However, the concomitant effects of GTS {{on the large}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes</b> and associated metabolomes are largely unclear. Herein, we performed an integrated microbiome-metabolome analysis to uncover the esoteric links between gut microbiome and exo/endogenous metabolome maneuvered in the large intestine of UVB-exposed mice subjected to dietary GTS. In UVB-exposed mice groups (UVB), class Bacilli and order Bifidobacteriales were observed as discriminant taxa with decreased lysophospholipid levels compared to the unexposed mice groups subjected to normal diet (NOR). Conversely, in GTS fed UVB-exposed mice (U+GTS), the gut-microbiome diversity was greatly enhanced with enrichment in the classes, Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia, as well as genera, Allobaculum and Lachnoclostridium. Additionally, the gut endogenous metabolomes changed {{with an increase in}} amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, and bile acids contents coupled with a decrease in nucleobases and carbohydrate levels. The altered metabolomes exhibited high correlations with GTS enriched intestinal microflora. Intriguingly, the various conjugates of green tea catechins viz., sulfated, glucuronided, and methylated ones including their exogenous derivatives were detected from large intestinal contents and liver samples. Hence, we conjecture that the metabolic conversions for the molecular components in GTS strongly influenced the gut micro-environment in UVB-exposed mice groups, ergo modulate their gut-microbiome as well as exo/endogenous metabolomes...|$|R

Pure culture of each living ASF bacteria can be grown in anaerobic conditions in laboratory setting. Lactobacilli and Bacteroides are given by gavage to germfree mice first to establish a microbial environment in the GI tract, which then supports the colonization of the spirochete and fusiform bacteria that are given later. An alternative way is to inoculate the drinking water of germfree mice with fresh feces from cecum and colon of gnotobiotic mice (ASF mice), {{over a period of}} four days. The establishment and concentration of each bacteria species vary slightly depending on the age, gender, and environmental conditions of the mice.|$|E
50|$|Observational {{studies show}} a strong {{association}} between delayed intestinal transit {{and the production}} of methane. Experimental data suggest a direct inhibitory activity of methane on the colonic and ileal smooth muscle and a possible role for methane as a gasotransmitter. Statins can inhibit archaeal cell membrane biosynthesis apparently without affecting bacterial numbers as demonstrated in livestock and humans. This opens the possibility of a therapeutic intervention that targets a specific etiological factor of constipation while protecting the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome.</b> While it is generally believed that statins inhibit methane production via their effect on cell membrane biosynthesis, mediated by inhibition of the HMGCoA reductase, there is accumulating evidence for an alternative or additional mechanism of action where statins inhibit methanogenesis directly. It appears that this other mechanism may predominate when the lactone form of statins, particularly lovastatin lactone, is administered.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, a {{research}} {{team from the}} cell and microbiology department of Anoka-Ramsey Community College revealed that an F2 litter of two pups had been produced from two of the original hybrids. At the same time, despite the six F1's successful delivery from the same coyote, they were not all full siblings because multiple sperm from eight different northwestern gray wolves were used in their production. The successful production of the F2 litter, nonetheless, confirmed that hybrids of coyotes and northwestern gray wolves are just as fertile as hybrids of coyotes to eastern and red wolves. Both the F1 and F2 hybrids {{were found to be}} phenotypically intermediate between the western gray wolves and coyotes. Unlike the F1 hybrids, which were produced via artificial insemination, the F2 litter was produced from a natural breeding. The study also discovered through sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA encoding genes that the F1 hybrids all have an <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> distinct from both parent species, but were once reported to be present in some gray wolves. Moreover, analysis of their complementary DNA and ribosomal RNA revealed that the hybrids have very differential gene expressions compared to those in gray wolf controls.|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of gut microbiomes in clinical studies of human diseases typically rely on identification and quantification of species or genes. In addition to exploring specific functional {{characteristics of the}} microbiome and potential significance of species diversity or expansion, microbiome similarity is also calculated to study change in response to therapies directed at altering the microbiome. Established ecological measures of similarity can be constructed from species abundances, however methods for calculating these commonly used ecological measures of similarity directly from whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequence are lacking. We present an alignment-free method for calculating similarity of WGS metagenomic sequences that {{is analogous to the}} Bray-Curtis index for species, implemented by the General Utility for Testing Sequence Similarity (GUTSS) software application. This method was applied to <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes</b> of healthy young children to measure developmental changes toward an adult microbiome during the first 3 years of life. We also calculate similarity of donor and recipient microbiomes to measure establishment, or engraftment, of donor microbiota in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) studies focused on mild to moderate Crohn's disease. We show how a relative index of similarity to donor can be calculated as a measure of change in a patient's microbiome toward that of the donor in response to FMT. Because clinical efficacy of the transplant procedure cannot be fully evaluated without analysis methods to quantify actual FMT engraftment, we developed a method for detecting change in the gut microbiome that is independent of species identification and database bias, sensitive to changes in relative abundance of the microbial constituents, and can be formulated as an index for correlating engraftment success with clinical measures of disease. More generally, this method may be applied to clinical evaluation of human microbiomes and provide potential diagnostic determination of individuals who may be candidates for specific therapies directed at alteration of the microbiome...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to generate a phylogenetic diversity census of bacteria identified in the intestinal tract of chickens and turkeys using a nave analysis of all the curated 16 S rRNA gene sequences archived in public databases. High-quality sequences of chicken and turkey gastrointestinal origin (3, 184 and 1, 345, respectively) were collected from the GenBank, Ribosomal Database Project, and Silva comprehensive ribosomal RNA database. Through phylogenetic and statistical analysis, 915 and 464 species-equivalent operational taxonomic units (defined at 0. 03 phylogenetic distance) were found in the chicken and the turkey sequence collections, respectively. Of the 13 bacterial phyla identified in both bird species, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the largest phyla, accounting for > 90 % of all the sequences. The chicken sequences represent 117 established bacterial genera, and the turkey sequences represent 69 genera. The most predominant genera found in both the chicken and the turkey sequence data sets were Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides, but with different distribution between the 2 bird species. The estimated coverage of bacterial diversity of chicken and turkey reached 89 and 68 % at species-equivalent and 93 and 73 % at genus-equivalent levels, respectively. Less than 7, 000 bacterial sequences from each bird species from various locations would be needed to reach 99 % coverage for either bird species. Based on annotation of the sequence records, cecum was the most sampled gut segment. Chickens and turkeys were shown to have distinct <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes,</b> sharing only 16 % similarity at the species-equivalent level. Besides identifying gaps in knowledge on bacterial diversity in poultry gastrointestinal tract, the bacterial census generated in this study may serve as a framework for future studies and development of analytic tools...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} intestinal fungal microbiota {{in the development of}} human disease. Infants, in particular, are an important population in which to study <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes</b> because microbial community structure and dynamics during this formative window of life have the potential to influence host immunity and metabolism. When compared to bacteria, much less is known about the early development of human fungal communities, owing partly to their lower abundance and the relative lack of established molecular and taxonomic tools for their study. Herein, we describe the development, validation, and use of complementary amplicon-based genomic strategies to characterize infant fungal communities and provide quantitative information about Candida, an important fungal genus with respect to intestinal colonization and human disease. Fungal communities were characterized from 11 infant fecal samples using primers that target the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 locus, a region that provides taxonomic discrimination of medically relevant fungi. Each sample yielded an average of 27, 553 fungal sequences and Candida albicans was the most abundant species identified by sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Low numbers of Candida krusei and Candida parapsilosis sequences were observed in several samples, but their presence was detected by species-specific qPCR in only one sample, highlighting a challenge inherent in the study of low-abundance organisms. Overall, the sequencing results revealed that infant fecal samples had fungal diversity comparable to that of bacterial communities in similar-aged infants, which correlated with the relative abundance of C. albicans. We conclude that targeted sequencing of fungal ITS 2 amplicons in conjunction with qPCR analyses of specific fungi provides an informative picture of fungal community structure in the human intestinal tract. Our data suggests that the infant intestine harbors diverse fungal species and is consistent with prior culture-based analyses showing that the predominant fungus in the infant intestine is C. albicans...|$|R
40|$|Aims  This {{study focused}} on {{comparing}} the phylogenetic composition and functional potential of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> of rainbow trout sourced from both farm and aquarium settings.   Methods and Results  Samples of distal intestinal contents were collected from fish and subjected to high throughput 16 S rRNA sequencing, to accurately determine {{the composition of the}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome.</b> The predominant phyla identified from both groups were Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetae and Bacteroidetes. A novel metagenomic tool, PICRUSt, was used to determine the functional potential of the bacterial communities present in the rainbow trout intestine. Pathways concerning membrane transport activity were dominant in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> of all fish samples. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that gene pathways relating to metabolism, and in particular amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, were upregulated in the rainbow trout <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome.</b>   Conclusions  The results suggest that the structure of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> in farmed rainbow trout may be similar regardless of where the fish are located and hence could be shaped by host factors. Differences were, however, noted in the microbial community membership within the intestine of both fish populations, suggesting that more sporadic taxa could be unique to each environment and may have the ability to colonize the rainbow trout gastrointestinal tract. Finally, the functional analysis provides evidence that the microbiome of rainbow trout contains genes that could contribute to the metabolism of dietary ingredients and therefore may actively influence the digestive process in these fish.   Significance and Impact of the Study  To better understand and exploit the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> and its impact on fish health, it is vital to determine its structure, diversity and potential functional capacity. This study improves our knowledge of these areas and suggests that the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> of rainbow trout may {{play an important role in}} the digestive physiology of these fish...|$|E

To investigate whether compositional and functional alterations of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> are associated with AMD, we sequenced the gut metagenomes of patients with AMD and controls. The genera Anaerotruncus and Oscillibacter as well as Ruminococcus torques and Eubacterium ventriosum were relatively enriched in patients with AMD, whereas Bacteroides eggerthii was enriched in controls. Patient's intestinal microbiomes were enriched in genes of the L-alanine fermentation, glutamate degradation and arginine biosynthesis pathways and decreased in genes of the fatty acid elongation pathway. These findings suggest that modifications in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> are associated with AMD, inferring that this common sight threatening disease may be targeted by microbiome-altering interventions...|$|E
40|$|Human <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiomes</b> {{exhibit a}} large degree of interindividual {{compositional}} variation. Animal models, such as the zebrafish, facilitate the design of controlled and highly replicated studies {{that allow us to}} understand the normal variation in vertebrate intestinal composition and to study the rules guiding normal assembly of these complex communities. The smaller intestinal size and high fecundity of the zebrafish allow us to fully sample the intestinal contents of many animals, while the optical transparency allows direct in vivo observation of fluorescently labeled bacterial species within the intestine. The studies in this dissertation utilize these advantages to investigate the composition, colonization dynamics and functional requirements for colonization in the vertebrate intestine. We first describe the taxonomic composition and diversity of the zebrafish intestinal microbiota from wild-caught and domesticated zebrafish. In the process, we identify a set of core bacterial genera that are consistently present in zebrafish intestines. We then use species from two of these genera in subsequent studies to gain a detailed understanding of the colonization dynamics and genetic requirements of the two species. We initially describe the application of light sheet microscopy to imaging the zebrafish intestine and associated colonizing bacteria. We find that a single species, Aeromonas veronii, does not occupy the entire intestinal space and that competition within the same species appears to prevent further colonization. These results are extended to a zebrafish isolated Vibrio species as well as A. veronii by tagging bacteria with transposon insertions and tracking the changes in colonizing population sizes. These insertion libraries also identify genes in each bacterial species that are important in the process of colonization, highlighting the key role for motility and chemotaxis in this process.

40|$|Numerous {{quantitative}} PCR assays for microbial fecal source tracking (MST) {{have been}} developed and evaluated in recent years. Widespread application has been hindered {{by a lack of}} knowledge regarding the geographical stability and hence applicability of such methods beyond the regional level. This study assessed the performance of five previously reported quantitative PCR assays targeting human-, cattle-, or ruminant-associated Bacteroidetes populations on 280 human and animal fecal samples from 16 countries across six continents. The tested cattle-associated markers were shown to be ruminant-associated. The quantitative distributions of marker concentrations in target and nontarget samples proved to be essential for the assessment of assay performance and were used to establish a new metric for quantitative source-specificity. In general, this study demonstrates that stable target populations required for marker-based MST occur around the globe. Ruminant-associated marker concentrations were strongly correlated with total intestinal Bacteroidetes populations and with each other, indicating that the detected ruminant-associated populations seem {{to be part of the}} <b>intestinal</b> core <b>microbiome</b> of ruminants worldwide. Consequently tested ruminant-targeted assays appear to be suitable quantitative MST tools beyond the regional level while the targeted human-associated populations seem to be less prevalent and stable, suggesting potential for improvements in human-targeted methods...|$|R
40|$|The term sociotype {{has been}} {{introduced}} to describe the dynamic relationship of an individual with his/her social environment throughout life. The sociotype is a conceptual framework to highlight, in addition to bio-medical pathways, the psycho-social and environmental factors necessary to understand responses to life stresses and patient self-management for chronic illness. The sociotype interacts with genotype expression through mate selection and metabolic programming, and with the phenotype to determine adaptation throughout life from birth to old age. Following {{on the work of}} Antonovsky, Engel, and McEwen, and others in the life and social sciences, the sociotype details and expands the many factors generally included in the environmental influences on a person’s life identified here as the domains of health, relationships, and environment. Physiological mediators for sociotypic influences include: adrenal steroids and the sympathetic nervous system (allostatic load), and oxytocin (social neuroscience). The biological pathways are multiple through nutrition (essential dietary-derived amino- and fatty acids for neurotransmitter synthesis, caloric restriction, and diet–gene interactions), epigenesis, and metabolic programming. Nutrition influences growth and development, fertility and longevity, and also determines susceptibility to non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and particularly diabetes and obesity, through in-utero effects, the development of <b>intestinal</b> flora (<b>microbiome),</b> and chronic stress. Thus the sociotype and nutrition are reciprocally related in both health and disease...|$|R

40|$|Next {{generation}} sequencing {{techniques are}} currently revealing novel {{insight into the}} microbiome of the human gut. This new area of research seems especially relevant for neonatal diseases, because {{the development of the}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> already starts in the perinatal period and preterm infants with a still immature gut associated immune system may be harmed by a dysproportional microbial colonization. For most gastrointestinal diseases requiring paediatric surgery there is very limited information {{about the role of the}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome.</b> This reviews aims to summarize the current knowledge and outline future perspectives for important pathologies like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) of the newborn, short bowel syndrome (SBS) and Hirschsprung´s disease associated enterocolitis (HAEC). Only studies applying next generation sequencing techniques to analyse the diversity of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> were included. In NEC patients intestinal dysbiosis could already be detected prior to any clinical evidence of the disease resulting in a reduction of the bacterial diversity. In SBS patients the diversity seems to be reduced compared to controls. In children with Hirschsprung´s disease the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> differs between those with and without episodes of enterocolitis. One common finding for all three diseases seems to be an overabundance of Proteobacteria. However, most human studies are based on fecal samples and experimental data question whether fecal samples actually represent the microbiome at the site of the diseased bowel and whether the luminal (transient) microbiome compares to the mucosal (resident) microbiome. In conclusion current studies already allow a preliminary understanding of the potential role of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> in pediatric surgical diseases.

30|$|For example, a human gut-on-a-chip device [66, 68, 78] {{employing}} intestinal villi colonized by gut microbiome demonstrates complex host-microbiome {{interactions that}} can modulate epithelial differentiation and immune modulation (e.g. balance of helper vs. regulatory T lymphocytes) (Fig.  4 a) [78]. During the complex host-microbe interactions, gut <b>microbiome,</b> <b>intestinal</b> epithelium, and resident immune components produce various molecular secretomes such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) [79], cytokines and chemokines [80], and antimicrobial peptides [81] under homeostatic condition. When this microenvironment is {{challenged by the}} factors that can induce inflammatory responses such as dysbiosis [82], susceptible genetic background of the host [83], pathogenic infection [84], or ingestion of toxic compounds [85], intestinal homeostasis is immediately compromised resulting in the switch-on of inflammatory signaling cascades and subsequent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that can exacerbate the disease symptoms. Hence understanding the fate of those intermediate compounds and their steady-state homeostatic level is of great importance to interrogate cellular and microbial signatures in situ.

40|$|AbstractThe early {{postnatal}} {{period is}} a critical window for intestinal and immune maturation. <b>Intestinal</b> development and <b>microbiome</b> diversity and composition differ between breast- (BF) and formula-fed (FF) infants. Mechanistic examination into host–microbe relationships in healthy infants has been hindered by ethical constraints surrounding tissue biopsies. Thus, a statistically rigorous analytical framework to simultaneously examine both host and microbial responses to dietary/environmental factors using exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells was developed. Differential expression of ∼ 1200 genes, including genes regulating intestinal proliferation, differentiation and barrier function, was observed between BF and FF term infants. Canonical correlation analysis uncovered a relationship between microbiome virulence genes and host immunity and defense genes. Lastly, exfoliated cells from preterm and term infants were compared. Pathways associated with immune cell function and inflammation were up-regulated in preterm, whereas cell growth-related genes were up-regulated in the term infants. Thus, coordinate measurement of the transcriptomes of exfoliated epithelial cells and microbiome allows inquiry into mutualistic host–microbe interactions in the infant, {{which can be used}} to prospectively study gut development or, retrospectively, to identify potential triggers of disease in banked samples...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the role of {{intestinal}} alkaline phosphatase (IAP) as a crucial mucosal defence factor essential for maintaining gut homeostasis has been established. IAP is an important apical brush border enzyme expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and secreted both into the intestinal lumen and into the bloodstream. IAP exerts its effects through dephosphorylation of proinflammatory molecules including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from cells during stressful events. Diminished activity of IAP could {{increase the risk of}} disease through changes in the <b>microbiome,</b> <b>intestinal</b> inflammation, and intestinal permeability. Exogenous IAP exerts a protective effect against intestinal and systemic inflammation in a variety of diseases and represents a potential therapeutic agent in diseases driven by gut barrier dysfunction such as IBD. The intestinal protective mechanisms are impaired in IBD patients due to lower synthesis and activity of endogenous IAP, but the pathomechanism of this enzyme deficiency remains unclear. IAP has been safely administered to humans and the human recombinant form of IAP has been developed. This review was designed to provide an update in recent research on the involvement of IAP in intestinal inflammatory processes with focus on IBD in experimental animal models and human patients...|$|R

Recent clinical studies have posited that extracts from green-lipped mussels may lead to prebiotic activity in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> that in turn {{has been reported to}} improve symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. Prebiotics have been reported to favorably interact with the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> through the proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the gut, suppressing exogenous and endogenous intestinal infections and promoting homeostasis by balancing local pro- and anti-inflammatory actions. Bioactive compounds from Perna canaliculus are functional foods and, in this regard, may positively interact with the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> and provide novel therapeutic solutions for intra-intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammatory conditions...|$|E
40|$|Sepsis {{remains one}} of the leading causes of death in burn {{patients}} who survive the initial insult of injury. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier has been shown after burn injury; this can lead to the translocation of bacteria or their products (e. g., endotoxin) from the intestinal lumen to the circulation, thereby increasing the risk for sepsis in immunocompromised individuals. Since the maintenance of the epithelial barrier is largely dependent on the intestinal microbiota, we examined the diversity of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> of severely burned patients and a controlled mouse model of burn injury. We show that burn injury induces a dramatic dysbiosis of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> of both humans and mice and allows for similar overgrowths of Gram-negative aerobic bacteria. Furthermore, we show that the bacteria increasing in abundance have the potential to translocate to extra-intestinal sites. This study provides an insight into how the diversity of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>microbiome</b> changes after burn injury and some of the consequences these gut bacteria can have in the host...|$|E
40|$|In mammals, {{two factors}} {{likely to affect}} the {{diversity}} and composition of <b>intestinal</b> bacteria (bacterial <b>microbiome)</b> and eukaryotes (eukaryome) are social status and age. In species in which social status determines access to resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16 S, 44 for eukaryote 18 S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring {{the value of an}} amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals. We propose that free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the combined effect of exogenous enzymes and probiotic supplementation on tilapia growth, <b>intestinal</b> morphology and <b>microbiome</b> composition. Tilapia (34. 56 ± 0. 05 g) were fed one of four diets (35 % protein, 5 % lipid); {{one of which was}} a control and the remaining three diets were supplemented with either enzymes (containing phytase, protease and xylanase), probiotic (containing Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus pumilus) or enz-pro (the combination of the enzymes and probiotic). Tilapia fed diet supplemented with enz-pro performed better (P < 0. 05) than tilapia fed the control and probiotic supplemented diets in terms of final body weight (FBW), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER). The dietary treatments did not affect somatic indices. The serum lysozyme activity was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in tilapia fed the probiotic supplemented diet than of those fed the remaining experimental diets. The intestinal perimeter ratio was higher (P < 0. 05) in tilapia fed enz-pro supplemented diet when compared to those fed with the control and probiotic supplemented diets. Goblet cells abundance, microvilli diameter and total enterocyte absorptive surface was higher (P < 0. 05) in tilapia fed diet supplemented with enz-pro than those fed the control diet. High-throughput sequencing revealed that majority of reads derived from the tilapia digesta belonged to members of Fusobacteria (predominantly Cetobacterium) distantly followed by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The alpha and beta diversities did not differ among dietary treatments indicating that the overall microbial community was not modified to a large extent by dietary treatment. In conclusion, supplementation of the diet with a combination of enzymes and probiotic is capable of improving tilapia growth and intestinal morphology without deleterious effect on the intestinal microbial composition...|$|R
40|$|Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram {{negative}} anaerobe {{and member}} of the human <b>intestinal</b> tract <b>microbiome.</b> B. fragilis serves many beneficial roles within the intestinal tract; however, its translocation to the peritoneal cavity and the blood stream can result in peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess formation, bacteremia and sepsis. We have shown that B. fragilis mediates both acute and Prolonged Oxidative Stress (POST) responses both in vitro and in vivo. This report characterizes the role and the genetic regulation of the iron storage proteins Dps and DpsL during the POST response. To test sensitivity to oxidative stress during the POST response a disk diffusion assay was developed using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH). When the assay plates received aerobic exposure for three hours there was no zone of growth inhibition, whereas those kept under anaerobic conditions were highly sensitive to tBOOH. These results demonstrated an oxygen induced resistance to tBOOH that was mediated by prolonged aerobic exposure. To determine a mechanism for this POST induced resistance to tBOOH, a series of oxidative stress mutants were assayed. Only the Δdps mutant was sensitive to tBOOH after aerobic exposure indicating that Dps mediated the POST phenotype. Because of the similarities to Dps, the recently characterized DpsL (bfr) was tested for a role in the POST response. The Δbfr mutant demonstrated resistance to tBOOH after aerobic exposure similar to wildtype (WT); however, when a double Δdps Δbfr mutant was generated it demonstrated sensitivity to tBOOH that was greater than the Δdps mutant indicating that both Dps and DpsL {{play a role in the}} resistance phenotype. To explore the role that Dps and DpsL play in the survival of B. fragilis during infection, animal experiments were performed in the rat abscess model. Interestingly only the double Δdps Δbfr mutant was attenuated in this model whereas neither of the single mutants showed a defect in competition experiments with WT. This indicated that both Dps and DpsL play a role in survival during infection. To investigate genetic regulation during the POST response, it was essential to identify the second regulator of dps expression. It was previously shown that OxyR is a strong inducer of dps expression during acute oxidative stress; however, the ΔoxyR mutant was resistant to tBOOH after prolonged aerobic exposure similar to WT. This indicated that there was a second regulator of dps expression during the POST response. A known POST regulator, SigOF was investigated to determine if it played a role in this response. Similar to ΔoxyR the ΔsigOF mutant was resistant to tBOOH. Interestingly though a double ΔsigOF ΔoxyR mutant was sensitive to tBOOH in the POST assay and dps expression was reduced as shown by qRTPCR. These results strongly suggest that SigOF is the regulator responsible for dps expression during the POST response...|$|R
