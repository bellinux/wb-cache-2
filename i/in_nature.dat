5|$|Patterns <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> {{are visible}} regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order <b>in</b> <b>nature.</b> The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
