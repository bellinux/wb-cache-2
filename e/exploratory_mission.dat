25|$|Dawn is NASA's first purely <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission</b> to use ion {{propulsion}} engines. The spacecraft {{also has}} twelve 0.9 N hydrazine thrusters for attitude control, which {{are designed to}} assist in orbital insertion.|$|E
25|$|The Dawn {{mission is}} managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with {{spacecraft}} components contributed by European partners from the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. It {{is the first}} NASA <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission</b> to use ion propulsion, which enabled it to enter and leave the orbit of multiple celestial bodies. Previous multi-target missions using conventional drives, such as the Voyager program, were restricted to flybys.|$|E
25|$|On September 29, Herman Van Rompuy {{presented}} his final {{report to the}} King. Afterwards, the Royal Palace announced that King Albert II relieved him of his <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission.</b> Later that day, King Albert II again appointed Yves Leterme as formateur. On Friday, 5 October, Leterme provided the King his first interim report, after which negotiations with all orange-blue parties began.|$|E

In October 1904, he was {{transferred}} to the 52nd Nezhin Dragoon Regiment in Manchuria, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.

25|$|In 1688, the {{governor}} Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville {{gave him the}} concession of the seigniory (estate) of Les Douacques (which later became the town of Bar Harbor, Maine, well known today as a tourist town, but then for fishing and lobsters). His concession brought him no income, even from agriculture. Lamothe entered into a trading partnership with officers of Port Royal, an activity facilitated by using a ship owned by his brothers-in-law Guyon. In 1689, he was sent on an expedition {{in the vicinity of}} Boston. Upon his return, he asked {{the governor}} of Acadia, Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Méneval, for a job as notary, to bring in a minimum income; his request was turned down. Then, Cadillac was introduced to the governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac in Quebec, who sent him on an <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission</b> along the coasts of New England, aboard the frigate L'Embuscade (The Ambush). Strong head winds forced the ship to return to France.|$|E
25|$|Following {{consultations}} {{with a number}} of ministers of State, King Albert received Herman Van Rompuy (CD), the outgoing President of the Chamber of Representatives, and charged him with an <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission</b> in order to find a solution to the political crisis. Van Rompuy was considered by Flemish and French-speaking parties and newspapers as a good choice. He met on August 30 with the presidents of several parties of the orange-blue coalition, in particular Jo Vandeurzen (CD), Bart De Wever (N-VA), Bart Somers (Open VLD) and Jöelle Milquet (CDH). On August 31, he met with presidents Didier Reynders (MR), Olivier Maingain, (FDF) and Jean-Michel Javaux (Ecolo). The content of the discussions is unknown as Van Rompuy wanted to communicate and negotiate discreetly. De Standaard noted that Van Rompuy did not talk with a member of the PS, which could mean he wanted to reach the required two-thirds majority for constitutional reform with the ecologists (Ecolo on the French-speaking side) and rather that the PS.|$|E

500|$|In early 1964, before American forces became {{actively}} engaged in South Vietnam, Captain Bucklew, {{at the behest of}} CINCPAC Admiral Harry D. Felt, took part in an <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission</b> to determine what could be done to counter waterborne infiltration of South Vietnam. Bucklew and his staff traveled the Mekong Delta, interviewing dozens of Vietnamese military personnel and their American advisors. At the Cambodian border, Bucklew witnessed the Vietcong openly moving supplies by sampan inside Cambodia, despite its neutrality. [...] In his report to CINCPAC, Bucklew described the totality of the Communist infiltration effort, criticized the South Vietnamese response as inefficient and inadequate, and suggested that halting the Vietcong would require a coastal blockade augmented by extensive patrolling of the internal rivers along the Cambodian frontier, in addition to the Mekong and Bassac. [...] The [...] "Bucklew Report" [...] further recommended that the Navy establish [...] "a viable means of controlling the rivers by implementing barricades, curfews, checkpoints, and patrols." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{remained}} {{on board the}} ship through the next day, a Sunday, for prayer and worship. The immigrants finally set foot on land at what became Provincetown on November 13. The first task was to rebuild a shallop, a shallow draft boat that had been built in England and disassembled for transport aboard the Mayflower. It would remain with the Pilgrims while the Mayflower returned to England. On November 15, Captain Myles Standish led a party of sixteen men on an <b>exploratory</b> <b>mission,</b> during which they disturbed a Native American grave and located a buried cache of Indian corn. The following week, Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine White on the Mayflower. He was the first English child born to the Pilgrims in the New World. The shallop was finished on November 27, and a second expedition was undertaken using it, {{under the direction of}} Mayflower master Christopher Jones. Thirty-four men went, but the expedition was beset by bad weather; the only positive result was that they found a Native burial ground and corn that had been intended for the dead, taking the corn for future planting. A third expedition along Cape Cod left on December 6; it resulted in a skirmish with local Native Americans known as the [...] "First Encounter" [...] near modern-day Eastham, Massachusetts. The colonists decided to look elsewhere, having failed to secure a proper site for their settlement, and fearing that they had angered the local Native Americans by robbing their corn stores and firing upon them. The Mayflower left Provincetown Harbor and set sail for Plymouth Harbor.|$|E

Several attempts to invade Taiwan were unsuccessful, mainly due to disease and armed resistance by aborigines on the island.

He obtained an escort of soldiers commanded by Lt. James A. White from Fort Yuma's acting commander, Lt. A. A. Winder.

2500|$|Two new {{categories}} of content were introduced during the patch cycle of Heavensward, post-launch: <b>Exploratory</b> <b>Missions</b> and Deep Dungeon. <b>Exploratory</b> <b>Missions</b> {{are designed to}} emulate the feel of [...] "first generation" [...] MMORPGs in which players hunted notorious monsters in the field with hidden spawn conditions. It also fills {{a gap in the}} game's content repertoire for huge-scale battles with extremely large numbers of players. However, it was not well-received at launch because of the simplicity of its battle mechanics, the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop, and the randomness of the loot drops which were not tied to skill or effort spent. Deep Dungeon is a roguelike randomly generated instance, inspired by Chocobo Mystery Dungeon. Yoshida wanted to allow veteran players to party with their friends who are just starting out more quickly; as such, characters are temporarily reset to level one upon entering and level quickly back to the maximum {{over the course of the}} first 50 floors.

40|$|For {{several years}} {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} at the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory on four passively-cooled submillimeter-wavelength, space observatories. Two <b>exploratory</b> <b>missions</b> were studied: a 2. 5 -m Submillimeter Explorer (SMME) and a more ambitious 3. 7 -m Submillimeter Imager and Line Survey (SMILS). Only one of these missions would actually be flown, and its goal would be to perform a high-spectral-resolution survey of several hundreds of sources at wavelengths between 100 and about 750 microns with modest angular resolution. Following either SMME or SMILS, the Large Deployable Reflector (LDR) and/or the Synthesis Array for Lunar Submillimeter Astronomy (SALSA) would be flown. LDR is a 10 - to 20 -m diameter telescope with greatly increased sensitivity and imaging capabilities compared to the <b>exploratory</b> <b>missions.</b> SALSA is a lunar-based array consisting of twelve 3. 5 -m diameter telescopes with a maximum baseline of nearly 1 -km. With operating wavelengths between 30 and 500 microns, SALSA would achieve 10 milliarcsecond angular resolution, and thus could explore source structure in much greater detail than the other missions.
