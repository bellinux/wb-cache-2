In a separate statement, he commented, “Everything I set out to accomplish in 2005, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> accomplished. The World Series of Poker is bigger than ever before. The brand is in a strong position and the player experience is better than it's ever been.” Pollock did not elaborate on any subsequent career opportunities, but said, [...] "I'm {{going to take a}} moment to pause and reflect, then will think things through and make some decisions," ...|$|E
500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrasting {{with his}} successes {{as a solo}} artist since 1970, Dark Horse earned Harrison the worst {{critical}} notices of his career. [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)" [...] drew a favourable response during the 1974 tour, however, as reviewers commented on the energy with which the band performed the piece. In his feature article on the West Coast concerts, for Rolling Stone, Ben Fong-Torres described the song as a [...] "well-arranged, tension-and-release number", while the Pacific Sun called it [...] "a zingy and classically melodic instrumental... a touchstone of the Harrison style". Reviewing the second show of the tour, D.P. Bond of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: [...] "Harrison's opening instrumental piece was beautiful: the fullest, finest explosion of rock 'n' roll that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever heard." ...|$|E

500|$|Stewart felt betrayed: [...] "It {{has been}} my fight ever since I became a {{minister}} {{to see that the}} farmers of the province were having a square deal," [...] he remarked, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done this with some success." [...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{illustrations}} did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, [...] "I {{have altered the}} oven as it will save a good many corrections. I did a good deal to the cat but she is still looking at the top one. I don't think it signifies as she talks about both ovens ... I don't think I have ever seriously considered {{the state of the}} pie but the book runs some risk of being over cooked if it goes on much longer! I am sorry about the little dog's nose.

500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E

500|$|Debussy {{was widely}} {{held to be}} an impressionist {{composer}} – a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and {{the works of the}} two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre. Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not. Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship. Ravel wrote that Debussy's [...] "genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [...] symbolism". During {{the first years of the}} new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet [...] "at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence".|$|E
500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> three good religious works. May they spare me {{a few days in}} Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is [...] "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his magnum opus sacrum, the opera, Dialogues des Carmélites." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{as the top}} scorer at Euro 2008, Villa {{continued his}} form into the 2008–09 season, where he scored the first goal in a 3–0 win against Mallorca in what was the opening game of the season. After failing to sign the player, Real Madrid's manager at the time, Bernd Schuster, accused Villa of having [...] "no ambition", whereupon Villa responded by saying, [...] "Footballing ambition is not about your mouth, it is about your feet. You can accuse me of lots of things – of having a bad day, of missing chances, of many things – but I have always had ambition and always will have. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> proved that on the pitch with Zaragoza, Sporting, UD Langreo, and the national team." [...] In October 2008, Kaká praised Villa: speaking to Canal+, he claimed that Villa is [...] "the best Spanish footballer" [...] adding that, [...] "The player with whom I would most like to play is David Villa of Valencia." [...] On 2 December 2008, Villa came seventh in the Ballon d'Or 2008 rankings and on 12 January 2009, he was announced as the joint ninth-best player of 2008 alongside international teammate Andrés Iniesta of Barcelona, according to the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E

500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like waiting around. But you know what? It's the easiest thing to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. I think that was a pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E
