The following three modes of failure {{were identified in}} this study for untreated and lime treated cohesive soil walls: overturning, rotational sliding, and planar sliding. The addition of 2 % lime to the back-fill significantly improved the prototype equivalent <b>failure</b> <b>height,</b> and it influenced {{the position of the}} failure surface by moving the slip surface {{toward the front of the}} wall. The lime treated backfill models collapsed suddenly along a bilinear slip surface in a brittle type of failurewith little prefailure deformation,while the untreated clay backfill models collapsed gradually along a curvilinear slip surface and withstood large de-formations prior to failure.

40|$|Instability {{predictions}} {{are important}} in sheet-metal forming processes, one such instability being splitting failures due to localized necking. The majority of such sheet-metal industrial splitting failures occur near to the plane-strain state. Therefore, sheet-metal industries have always been looking for an ''ideal'' formability test which allows them to evaluate sheets {{for their ability to}} resist splitting failures under near plane-strain conditions. Several formability tests have been developed in the past but none have been very successful. Presently, a new test has been designed, constructed and used to evaluate the formability of different sheet materials. The results from this new test are compared with standard limiting-dome-height (LDH) tests and finite-element simulations. The results show that the new test is more reproducible, more closely follows the desirable plane strain path and takes roughly 1 / 6 of the time to perform relative to the LDH test. Strain measurements and finite-element simulations have revealed that the improvements are a result of the new test geometry, which produces a more stable and repeatable plane-strain state near to the splitting failure locations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behaviour}} of reinforced embankments over conventional soft cohesive soil, rate-sensitive {{soil and}} peat deposits is reviewed, and recent design and analysis methods are summarized. The findings from both field observations and finite element analyses are presented. Both undrained and partially drained behaviour of reinforced embankments are considered. The use of reinforcement {{in combination with}} prefabricated vertical drains is addressed. The effects of both the viscous and inviscous characteristics of reinforcement and foundation soils on embankment behaviour are discussed. It is concluded that the partial consolidation provided by PVDs and the tension mobilized in reinforcement can substantially increase embankment stability. However, creep of geosynthetics can decrease the embankment <b>failure</b> <b>height.</b> The mobilization of reinforcement during and after embankment construction can vary significantly depending on the soil and reinforcement characteristics.

A full-scale case history trial embankment constructed on Muar flat in {{the valley of the}} Muar River in Malaysia was modeled and analyzed. The Muar trial embankment was simulated in two- and three-dimension (2 -D and 3 -D) utilizing finite element programs PLAXIS 2 -D AND PLAXIS 3 -D FOUNDATION, using staged-construction procedure. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the thickness of weathered crust layer beneath the embankment fill, i. e., three models of embankment with no surface crust, 1 m surface crust and 2 m surface crust layer. Predictions were made for the vertical and the horizontal displacements of the embankment. Factor of safety for each meter increase in the embankment height was defined until the failure is reached. It is concluded that the bearing capacity of the ground and the deformation behavior of the embankment were sensitive to the thickness of the weathered crust layer. The surface crust layer has a positive effect on the stability of the embankment and consequently reduces the settlement and increases the <b>failure</b> <b>height</b> of the embankment fill up to 37 %...|$|E
40|$|Many {{embankments}} {{constructed on}} soft ground {{are susceptible to}} failure and large settlements due to its low strength soil condition. Geosynthetics are used effectively as a reinforced material to increase the shear strength, and stiffness of the reinforced embankment and consequently, to reduce the total and differential settlements. In {{the first part of}} the study, four different cases of embankments with and without reinforcement, constructed on soft and stiff grounds were studied through small-scale physical modeling using centrifuge test and numerical modeling using finite element simulation. Comparison between the results using both finite element models and centrifuge tests was carried out to validate and identifies the reliability of the finite element method. In centrifuge test, a model scale with various sizes was simulated to a constant full-scale dimension using different acceleration fields. The results show the different deformation behavior for these different embankment cases and indicate the significant effect of the geosynthetics reinforcement on increasing the stability of embankment. The comparison analysis presents a good agreement between results of these two methods. It validated the finite element technique in analysis of different embankment cases. The second part of the study focus on the geometrical effects on the behavior and failure mechanism of embankments. Two full-scale case history embankments in Malaysia and Canada, the Muar trial embankment and Vernon highway embankment were verified. Three dimensional effects on Muar trial embankment were evaluated by comparing the results of two and three-dimensional analysis, in terms of predicted displacements, lateral movements, excess pore pressure, factor of safety, and <b>failure</b> <b>height</b> of the embankment fill. Moreover, this study attempt to evaluate the boundary limits for the applicability of two and three-dimensional analyses by determining the suitable geometry configuration of embankment in utilizing the geotechnical analysis. The ratio of the calculated <b>failure</b> <b>height</b> of three to two dimensional Finite Element analyses (Hf, 3 D/Hf, 2 D) has been determine for embankment cases with different base aspect ratio of the length to width (L/B). Two shape-factor equations related to the bearing capacity of spread footings and safety factor of embankments also utilized to account for the geometrical behavior of the embankment regards to its geometrical configuration. Results of three-dimensional analyses have better agreement with the actual field measurements. It is concluded that neglecting the three dimensional effects could mislead the design of the embankment in some condition. In conclusion, it is recommended that for “long embankment” with the length to width ratio more than two (L/B > 2), it may appropriate to use two-dimensional analysis as the three-dimensional safety factor converges to two dimensional safety factor. For “short embankment” with the length to width ratio less than two (L/B < 2), three dimensional effects on the embankment behavior becomes considerably great and should be considered as important factor in design and analysis of embankments...|$|E

The data is plotted as {{strength to weight}} ratio versus height, strength to volume ratio versus <b>height,</b> <b>failure</b> stress versus <b>height,</b> load versus time of failure and load to height ratio versus time of failure. Result shows that increase in height of the fresh reinforced bamboo increases the strength and vice versa. The moisture content also has significant influence {{on the strength of}} the fresh reinforced bamboo. The moisture content reduced the strength of the fresh reinforced bamboo by 21. 8 %. This percentage is really significant in structural analysis since it can cause catastrophic failure to structures. Concrete is significant in reinforcing bamboo structures for a better strength. The crushing stresses for fresh reinforced bamboo of heights 250, 210, 170, 130 and 90 mm were found to be 26. 09, 25. 52, 24. 85, 21. 97, 21. 86 MPa respectively.

It binds to receptors {{on the surface}} of target cells, stimulates production of Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) leading to growth of almost all tissues of the body capable of growing. Growth <b>failure</b> (<b>height</b> below 3 rd centile) occurs in children who do not secrete sufficient amount of GH.

On arrival in the lab a blood sample was collected for basal GH level in each patient. Screening was performed by subjecting the patients to exercise stimulation test and/or L-dopa stimulation test. Patients with GH deficiency underwent insulin tolerance test (ITT) after one week for confirmation. All the basal and post-stimulation samples were analyzed for GH levels.

Numerical simulation and theoretical analysis were performed to investigate the influence of the mining thicknesses of initial mining seam on the destruction and pressure relief effect of the upper coal seam in a high-gas coal seam group. The mechanical model of the roof failure based on the mining thickness was established by assuming that the gob formed after adjacent panels have fully been caved is the infinite plane.

Considering the geological conditions of No. 9 and No. 12 coal seams of Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine, economic effectiveness, and proposed techniques, we concluded that the top layer (4 m) of the No. 12 coal seam should be mined first. The top layer of the No. 9 coal seam should be subsequently mined. The topcaving technique was applied to the exploitation of the lower layer of the No. 12 coal seam. Practically monitored data revealed that the deformation and failure of the No. 2699 panel roadway was small and controllable, the amount of gas emission was reduced significantly, and the effect of upward mining was active.

40|$|The {{application}} of finite element (FE) techniques {{for the analysis}} of re-inforced embankment behaviour is reviewed. Details such as the choice of finite element and constitutive models as well as the validation of finite element results against benchmark solutions are discussed. Results from the authors ' finite element analyses are examined, and it is shown that FE analysis can be particularly useful for identifying the mechanisms offailure and also for indicating why a geosynthetic reinforcing material may substantially improve stability for a certain foundation strength profile whereas for different foundation strength profiles the same reinforcement may give rise to negligible improvement in embankment stability. The use of plasticity solutions for estimating the maximum effect of reinforcement is illustrated. The results of finite element analyses are then used to demonstrate that although the collapse load calculated from plasticity theory can be attained for very highly reinforced embankments, in many situations failure will occur at embankment heights well below the collapse height. It is then demonstrated that he <b>failure</b> <b>height</b> for a reinforced embankment is related to the modulus of the reinforcement but is not very sensitive to the modulus of the soil. The development ofstrain in the geotextile is examined and it is demon-strated both from field evidence and theoretical analysis that the reinforce-ment plays a relatively small role at low load levels ince the soil is essentially elastic.

To facilitate the application of these technologies in improving mine safety, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed the Support Technology Optimization Program (STOP). STOP is a Windows-based software program that provides mine operators with a simple and practical tool to make engineering decisions about the selection and placement of these various roof support technologies. The program includes a complete database of the support characteristics and loading profiles obtained through safety performance testing of these supports at the NIOSH Safety Structures Testing Laboratory. A support design criterion {{in the form of the}} required support load density at a specified convergence can be established from four options: (1) a database of measured ground reaction obtained from various mines or ground behavior information input by the user,(2) load requirements based on a detached roof block or rock <b>failure</b> <b>height,</b> (3) criteria based on the current roof support system, and/or (4) arbitrary criteria set by the user.

40|$|CONTEXT: It is {{estimated}} that 3 - 30 % of cases with isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) have a genetic etiology, {{with a number of}} mutations being reported in GH 1 and GHRHR. The aim of our study was to genetically characterize a cohort of patients with congenital IGHD and analyze their characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 224 patients (190 pedigrees) with IGHD and a eutopic posterior pituitary were screened for mutations in GH 1 and GHRHR. To explore the possibility of an association of GH 1 abnormalities with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, we have screened 62 patients with either multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (42 pedigrees), or IGHD with an ectopic posterior pituitary (21 pedigrees). RESULTS: Mutations in GH 1 and GHRHR were identified in 41 patients from 21 pedigrees (11. 1 %), with a higher prevalence in familial cases (38. 6 %). These included previously described and novel mutations in GH 1 (C 182 X, G 120 V, R 178 H, IVS 3 + 4 nt, a>t) and GHRHR (W 273 S, R 94 L, R 162 W). Autosomal dominant, type II IGHD was the commonest form (52. 4 %), followed by type IB (42. 8 %) and type IA (4. 8 %). Patients with type II IGHD had highly variable phenotypes. There was no difference in the endocrinology or magnetic resonance imaging appearance between patients with and without mutations, although those with mutations presented with more significant growth <b>failure</b> (<b>height,</b> - 4. 7 +/- 1. 6 SDS vs. - 3. 4 +/- 1. 7 SDS) (P = 0. 001).

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} the numerical modelling of prefabricated vertical drain (PVD) subjected to vacuum loading in a 2 -D plane strain {{finite element model}} employing the modified Cam-clay theory, and the experimental evaluation of effectiveness of combined vacuum and surcharge preloading using a large scale, radial drainage consolidometer. The original axisymmetric analysis and plane strain analysis of vertical drains including the effect of smear and well resistance have been well documented {{in the past for}} surcharge preloading. In this study, the existing axisymmetric and plane strain theories of a unit cell are modified to incorporate the vacuum pressure application. Unsaturation of drain soil boundary owing to the vacuum pressure is also considered in the numerical modeling. Thereafter, a multi-drain, plane strain analysis is conducted to study the performance of the entire embankment stabilised with vertical drains subjected to vacuum preloading, for two case histories taken from Thailand. A laboratory technique of evaluating the effectiveness of combined vacuum and surcharge preloading is elaborated. In this approach, a central vertical drain was installed in soil specimens placed in a large stainless steel cell (450 mm in diameter and 950 mm in height) using a specially designed mandrel, and then the vacuum and surcharge loads were applied using the two different loading systems. The results clearly show the effectiveness of vacuum preloading. Following initial laboratory simulation in the large-scale radial drainage consolidometer, a different approach to conventional analysis is adopted to analyse the vacuum assisted consolidation around vertical drains. It is assumed here that a linear variation of negative pore pressure along the drain length and a constant (maximum) suction head at the ground surface are realistic and sufficient. The observed retardation of pore pressure dissipation is explained through a series of finite element models, which consider the effect of unsaturation at the drain-soil interface. The results indicate that the introduction of an unsaturated soil layer adjacent to a PVD improves the accuracy of numerical predictions. The knowledge gained from the modeling of large-scale consolidometer cell is applied to study the behaviour of two embankments built on soft clay, stabilised with vertical drains subjected to vacuum loading. A multi-drain analysis is conducted and the field measurements are compared with a series of numerical model predictions. The best predictions of settlement, lateral displacements and pore pressures are obtained when the numerical analysis included the time and depth dependent changes in vacuum pressure, in addition to having an unsaturated layer of elements along the external boundary of the PVD. Finally, a comprehensive multi-drain analysis is used to predict the <b>failure</b> <b>height</b> of embankment, considering various parameters such as embankment geometry, construction method, sub soil properties and soil improvement techniques...|$|E

RESULTS: All had growth <b>failure</b> (mean <b>height</b> SDS - 1. 2; range - 2. 5 - 0. 0), weight gain [mean body mass index (BMI) SDS 3. 5; range 2. 5 - 4. 6] and clinical virilization, while five had hypertension [mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 83 mmHg]. One patient had generalized lentigines, one had a tibial chondromyxomatous cyst and two had facial freckling. One patient had {{a family history of}} primary nodular adrenocortical disease. The diagnosis of CS was based on elevation of sleeping midnight serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol excretion, and impaired suppression of cortisol on both low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests (DST).

Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging showed normal or small adrenals, with nodules in two patients. All patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomy, performed by open (n = 2) or laparoscopic surgery (n = 4) at a mean of 0. 4 years (range 0. 2 - 0. 8 years) from diagnosis. Hypercortisolaemia was treated preoperatively by metyrapone alone 0. 50 - 0. 75 g/day (n = 4), metyrapone 0. 75 - 1. 50 g/day + o'p'DDD/mitotane 1 - 2 g/day (n = 1), or ketoconazole (n = 1). Adrenal histology showed nodular cortical hyperplasia with shrinkage of intervening cortical tissue and pigmentation, present in four patients. Molecular analysis of the type 1 -alpha regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PRKAR 1 A) gene revealed a novel germline mutation in one patient. Postadrenalectomy, three patients, had catch-up growth with height velocities increasing from 3. 0, 3. 9 and 2. 5 - 8. 9, 8. 3 and 9. 0 cm/years, respectively. All six are well at a follow-up (mean 4. 0 years; range 0. 5 - 10. 8 years). CONCLUSIONS: PNAH was associated with cushingoid features, virilization and hypertension with a lack of cortisol suppression on high DST, undetectable plasma ACTH and absent cortisol and ACTH responses to CRH. Adrenals were normal or small on imaging. PRKAR 1 A gene analysis may be helpful in the assessment of these patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} application for landslide susceptibility analysis (LSA) based on GEOSTAtistical INterpolation Techniques (Kriging) (GEOSTAINT-K) for a deterministic model {{was used to}} calculate the factor of safety (FOS) and failure probabilities for the area of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. In this paper, the LSA value can be expressed by a FOS value, which is the ratio of forces that make the slope fail and those that prevent the slope from failing. A geotechnical engineering properties data base has been developed {{on the basis of a}} series of parameter maps such as effective cohesion (C’), unit weight of soil (g), depth of <b>failure</b> surface (Z), <b>height</b> of ground water table (Zw), Zw/Z dimensionless (m), unit weight of water (gw), slope surface inclination (?) and effective angle of shearing resistance (f). Taking into consideration the cause of the landslide, identified as groundwater change, two scenarios of landslide activity were studied. Scenario 1 considered the minimum groundwater level recorded corresponding to the actual situation of the most recent landslide while Scenario 2 considered the reverse. A simple method (infinite slope model) for error propagation was {{used to calculate the}} variance of the FOS and the probability that will be less than 1 for each pixel. The highest probability value of the various scenarios was selected for each pixel and final LSA 1 (scenario 1) and LSA 2 (scenario 2) maps were constructed. The validation between the examined LSA 1 and LSA 2 maps and the results of the landslide distribution map (LDM) were evaluated. This deterministic model had higher prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracy was 81 % and 85 %, respectively. In general for both factors, the LSA 2 map showed higher accuracy compared to the LSA 1 map. The resulting LSA map can be used by local administrators or developers to locate areas prone to landslides, determine the land use suitability and organize more detailed analysis of the “hot spot” areas identified. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{inventory}} plots {{are widely}} used to estimate biomass carbon storage and its change over time. While {{there has been much}} debate and exploration of the analytical methods for calculating biomass, the methods used to determine rates of wood production have not been evaluated to the same degree. This affects assessment of ecosystem fluxes and may have wider implications if inventory data are used to parameterise biospheric models, or scaled to large areas in assessments of carbon sequestration. Here we use a dataset of 35 long-term Amazonian forest inventory plots to test different methods of calculating wood production rates. These address potential biases associated with three issues that routinely impact the interpretation of tree measurement data: (1) changes in the point of measurement (POM) of stem diameter as trees grow over time; (2) unequal length of time between censuses; and (3) the treatment of trees that pass the minimum diameter threshold (“recruits”). We derive corrections that control for changing POM height, that account for the unobserved growth of trees that die within census intervals, and that explore different assumptions regarding the growth of recruits during the previous census interval. For our dataset we find that annual aboveground coarse wood production (AGWP; in Mg ha− 1 year− 1 of dry matter) is underestimated on average by 9. 2 % if corrections are not made to control for changes in POM <b>height.</b> <b>Failure</b> to control for the length of sampling intervals results in a mean underestimation of 2. 7 % in annual AGWP in our plots for a mean interval length of 3. 6 years. Different methods for treating recruits result in mean differences of up to 8. 1 % in AGWP. In general, the greater the length of time a plot is sampled for and the greater the time elapsed between censuses, the greater the tendency to underestimate wood production. We recommend that POM changes, census interval length, and the contribution of recruits should all be accounted for when estimating productivity rates, and suggest methods for doing this.

40|$|The {{progressive}} kyphosis {{and pain}} {{in patients with}} acute thoracolumbar burst fractures treated conservatively so as the recurrent kyphosis after posterior reduction and fixation were associated to disc collapse rather than vertebral body compression. It depends on redistribution of the disc tissue in the changed morphology of the space after fractures of the endplate. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate, alone or associated to short posterior instrumentation, in the treatment of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures. Eleven fractures in ten consecutive patients with an average age of 48 years who sustained acute thoracolumbar traumatic burst fractures without neurological deficits were included in this study. The fractures were A 1. 2 (3), A 3. 1 (4) and A 3. 2 (4), according to AO classification. In 7 fractures (A 1. 2 and A 3. 1) the kyphopasty was performed alone in order to make the most of efficacy in fracture reduction, anterior and medium column stabilization and, as much as possible, segmental kyphosis correction. In the A 3. 2 fractures (4), that are unstable, the kyphoplasty was associated to a short posterior instrumentation. To avoid the PMMA long run complications in younger patients, we used a calcium phosphate cement. VAS, SF- 36, Roland-Morris questionnaire (RMQ) and Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire (ODQ) were used to evaluate pain, state of health, functional outcomes and spine disability. To the average follow-up time of 15. 5 months (range 8 – 31) we did not observe statistically significant differences in 7 of 8 SF- 36 domains in comparison to general healthy population of same sex and age. At the same follow-up, the spine disability questionnaire showed a functional restriction of 18 % (ODQ) and 29, 6 % (RMQ) being 100 % the maximum of disability. No bone cement leakage, no implant <b>failure</b> and no <b>height</b> correction loss were observed in any case. Our data confirm the safety and the efficacy of ballon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate in the treatment of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures. In this way we can reduce the possible complications resulted from discal space collapse and obtain an early functional restoration. When performed alone, this mini invasive surgical technique offer the advantage of almost immediate return to daily activities. When associated to posterior instrumentation, it decreases the long run complications and allows to reduce the number of stabilized levels, maintaining, in part, the thoracolumbar junction movement...|$|R
40|$|Lodging, the {{permanent}} displacement of plant {{stems from the}} vertical, occurs on average once every four years in UK wheat crops, when it reduces the yield and bread making quality of grain. Lodging usually occurs {{in the summer and}} control is most commonly sought by applying growth retarding chemicals in the spring. This thesis develops a method of predicting which crops are prone to lodging so that spring lodging controls can be targeted most effectively. A model was developed in association with this study which calculates stem and root lodging risk from summer-time plant, weather and soil factors. The spread of the plant's root plate, the stem diameter and the number of shoots per plant were shown to have very strong influences on lodging. Structural rooting depth, stem <b>failure</b> yield stress, <b>height</b> at centre of gravity and the rate at which stems oscillate in wind (natural frequency) were also important, but less influential. Methods of predicting the most important lodging-associated plant characters from crop observations in spring were developed from the literature. These were then tested through experiments in 1995 and 1996 with factorial combinations of crops sown in late September and late October, at 500 seeds m- 2 and 250 seeds m- 2 and with large and small levels of residual soil nitrogen. Early sowing, dense seed rates and fertile soils all increased stem and root lodging, with sowing date having the greatest influence. Plants sown at high densities had small root plates and were poorly anchored; they also had fewer shoots causing a smaller leverage. Early sown plants had shoots with a high centre of gravity and slow natural frequency, causing a greater leverage. Plants sown early on fertile soils had narrow, weak stems. Final shoot number per plant was predicted with good precision (R 2 = 094) from spring plant number m- 2 and maximum shoot number m- 2 using a model of tiller survival. Stem diameter was predicted with moderate precision (R 2 = 057) from spring canopy size and shoot number m- 2, via a calculation of the amount of dry matter partitioned to each stem base. Root plate spread showed a linear and inverse relationship to spring plant density (R 2 = 0. 48), mainly as a result of variation in the length of the rigid roots and in the width of the plant base. It is concluded that early season crop observations have the potential to predict the values of the most influential lodging-associated plant characters, from which a model of lodging can calculate the proneness of crops to stem or root lodging in time for remedial action. The next steps would be to develop prediction schemes for other plant characters which influence lodging and test all the predictions in a wider range of crops, sites and seasons...|$|R
40|$|Dutch flood protections are {{assessed}} every {{five to six}} years in a nationwide safety assessment round. During the last assessment round large dike stretches in the Dutch Wadden Sea could not meet the safety requirements, and were assessed with failure. Dike strengthening is therefore needed in these areas. However, in front of these dike salt marshes are present, which act as shallow foreshores. These could reduce the load in these dikes, {{which could lead to}} less or no dike strengthening. The dikes is assessed in the last official assessment round with a probabilistic program Hydra-NL. In this program the safety of a dike can determined {{on the basis of a}} dike profile and Hydraulic Boundary Conditions. The derivation of these conditions is done with the wave model SWAN. For the derivation of the hydraulic conditions a bottom profile is needed, in which the shallow foreshore are already included to some extent. Typically, the foreshores have already been included until 50 - 100 m in front of the dike toe. Here the hydraulic conditions have been given in a so called output point. In the program Hydra-NL a foreshore module is present. With this module the final stretch of foreshore can be taken into account. With this module the design conditions in the output point are taken and transformed to the location of the dike toe. This transformation leads to lower wave heights, which leads to lower loads on the dike. The calculation method used in the foreshore module of Hydra-NL is the ENDEC method. This module is first compared on theoretical basis to other available transformation methods as SWAN and DaF. This are all modules used in other official calculation tools. Outcome of the comparison was that the ENDEC module can, in some situations, give a significant deviation from the other modules. To determine the extent to which the effect of the foreshores have been included in the official safety assessment a different database of hydraulic conditions has been derived. Instead of near the dike, these conditions are defined at locations in front of the foreshore. These can therefore be seen as the deep water conditions. The effects of the foreshore {{are assessed}} on to <b>failure</b> mechanisms. A <b>height</b> assessment, using the maximum overtopping as criteria and a cover stability assessment, for which the wave height notably plays a big role. For the height assessment it was found that including the final foreshore stretch does not lead to a significant increase of the minimum required crest height. The assessment on the dike cover however shows that including the last part of the foreshore could lead to a substantial reduction of wave load. Particularly the lower dike parts experience lower wave loading. As most of the dike stretches in the Wadden Sea have failed on the cover slope of the outer dike, including the foreshore in this manner could lead to a reduction of failure probability.
