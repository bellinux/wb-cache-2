5|$|In September, Jennifer Lucking of Walk With Me {{encouraged}} Canadians {{to write}} to their members of parliament {{to make sure that}} the promises outlined in the plan come to fruition. In preparation for 2013 Walk for Freedom, Invidiata said she was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the NAP-CHT had come into existence, but that the related funds should be released in a different way.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration and confusion during the episode. Both she and McNutt were <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Tyrion's exposition scene in the tent with Bronn and Shae did not use sex to keep viewers, as was done in past episodes.|$|E
5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company were <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E

5|$|Over dinner, Leslie tells Dave {{that she}} will not move to San Diego with him, as her life is in Pawnee. Dave, {{although}} sad, understands her choice and the two split up amicably. At Pawnee's tree lighting ceremony, Leslie is congratulated by everyone, including Leslie's mother Marlene, who is proud that her daughter successfully fought off the media. Leslie returns to {{work the next day}} much to Ron's immense relief, as he could barely handle just a portion of her daily duties. Everyone is visibly <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Leslie is back.|$|E
5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E
5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E

5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him {{that that is not}} a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and can not afford to ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare, {{could he}} read it, would be <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> {{he was dead}} â€¦. If Julia A. Moore would kindly deign to shed some of her poetry on our humble grave, we should be but too glad {{to go out and}} shoot {{ourselves}} tomorrow.|$|E

25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you could say I have an engaged stance. The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
25|$|Maregwede's cricket {{heroes are}} Steve Waugh, {{and like many}} Zimbabweans, Andy Flower. His proudest moment came in the U19 World Cup when he scored 64 against Australia. He also played first team rugby and hockey for Churchill and was a sprinter. Alester really enjoys travelling, and is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> his cricket {{commitments}} give him the chance to visit many foreign countries. Alester was a vital member of the Mildura Settlers Cricket Clubs first premiership in 20 years. Alester has since parted ways with the club but is hopeful of remaining in the area.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{disagreeing with}} many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's {{required}} prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly {{as part of his}} philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. He was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed {{to take part in the}} Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.|$|E

25|$|Dexter when {{he arrived}} began at once to turn the green field into a cloth of gold...He took chances - thank {{goodness}} for those who look on batting as a challenge! - but he made superb strokes, with his driving tremendous in power and placement. Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the ball went between his legs and that his hands were not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.|$|E
25|$|Dexter's power amazed {{everyone}} {{who had not}} had the joy of watching him in other innings in England and in Perth. He took chances â€“ thank goodness for those who look on batting as a challenge! â€“ but he made superb strokes, with his driving tremendous in power and placement. Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders.

25|$|Mr and Mrs Boffin {{attempt to}} adopt a young orphan, {{previously}} {{in the care of}} his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, but the boy dies before the adoption can proceed. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. She has a terror of the workhouse. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer. In the meantime Eugene Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie's whereabouts from Jenny's father and has tracked the object of his affections. Bradley Headstone attempts to enlist the help of Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, to find Lizzie. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Lizzie finds him in the river and rescues him. Wrayburn, thinking he will die anyway, marries Lizzie to save her reputation. When he survives, he is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> this has brought him into a loving marriage, albeit with a social inferior. He had not cared about the social gulf between them but Lizzie had and would not otherwise have married him.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E
25|$|Distraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian {{had tried}} to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is {{grateful}} when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven {{does not want to}} share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to St Pancras railway station, and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the Eurostar, but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now Ben Hardy) and fiancÃ©e Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.|$|E

50|$|Morecambe and Wise had {{dominated}} British light entertainment {{throughout the}} 1970s, but their presence {{had begun to}} wane in the early 1980s. When Morecambe died moments after finishing a solo show in 1984 (his last words were 'I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that's</b> over'), the best-loved double act in British comedy came to an end, and several new acts emerged. However, the two distinct groups {{could not have been}} more different.|$|R

I threw on my clothes and ran down at once. My patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers.|$|R
