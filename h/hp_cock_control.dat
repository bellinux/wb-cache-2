50|$|To {{avoid such}} accidents, free turbine engines, {{including}} the Proteus, are now commonly {{fitted with a}} device to shut off the fuel supply at the <b>HP</b> <b>cock</b> if torque in the turbine output shaft suddenly falls to zero.|$|R
50|$|The {{tanks were}} air pressurised, {{the fuel tank}} by engine {{compressor}} bleed air and the oxidiser tank by ram air and additionally by the stored air bottle. Ram air {{was taken from the}} supersonic inlet boundary layer bleeds. A single timer-controlled valve opened the stored air supply which then opened the pneumatic LP cocks. A second valve, after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. <b>HP</b> <b>cocks</b> were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their main valves opened. Correct opening of all four valves was monitored by the timer control, to ensure a safe mixture.|$|R
50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>cock</b> switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the {{throttle lever}}s actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
50|$|One {{turn of the}} <b>cock</b> <b>controlling</b> the {{couplings}} {{divided the}} train into segments of separate cars, each of which had a brake which acted automatically upon detachment from the train. This partially destroyed {{the momentum of the}} whole, and a collision could only take place by a succession of comparatively light blows from the engine and slowing sections of the train, instead of by a single blow with the momentum of the whole train. The brakes were operated upon the balancing wheels of the trucks, but they mayed also be fitted upon the supporting wheels. The action of the brakes could be well illustrated by rails between the rolls of a rolling mill, except that the action was reversed. It was apparent that no slipping of the wheels can take place, no matter what pressure may be brought to bear upon them.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Revolting Cock au Lait" [...] (appeared in the Retail Version of the album) is a mishmash of many songs {{considered}} {{hard rock}} classics. The intro uses the sampled [...] "stomp-clap" [...] from Queen's [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] {{and in the}} middle there is a simultaneous mashup parodying both the chorus from Pink Floyd's [...] "Another Brick in the Wall" [...] and Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song", alluding topics like masturbation ("We don't need some masturbation... aaaaah... You fuck yourself! We don't need no <b>cock</b> <b>control...</b> aaaah... You fuck yourself!") and child sexual abuse by priests ("Preachers... Leave those kids alone!"). At one point a transposed version of the guitar solo from Led Zeppelin's [...] "Stairway To Heaven" [...] can be heard. Also, the melody used for this song (chords and compases) are based on Jimi Hendrix's [...] "Purple Haze". [...] "RevColution Medley" [...] is a shorter version of [...] "Revolting Cock au Lait", before the parody of this Pink Floyd song.|$|R

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) {{produces}} both {{gross and}} histopathologic changes in {{tissues and organs}} of infected birds. These lesions may cause increase or decrease in organ sizes especially lymphoid organs leading to immune suppression. Therefore, {{the effect of a}} velogenic NDV on the body and organ weights of vaccinated Shika brown (SB) cocks was studied. Forty SB cocks consisting of twenty control and twenty infected cocks were slaughtered at the age of thirty-two weeks after infection with a velogenic NDV. They were weighed before being sacrificed and their internal organs (liver, spleen, thymus, heart, bursa of Fabricius, brain and adrenal glands) were removed and weighed. Sections of these organs were taken and stored in Bouin’s solution for 24 h and later sent for histology. The liver, spleen, thymus, heart and adrenal glands of the infected red SB cocks were heavier than those of the control red and white Shika brown cocks and infected white SB cocks. The weight of the spleen and brain of both the control and infected red and white cocks did not vary significantly (P> 0. 05). The infected red cocks had heavier adrenal glands, heart and liver weight than the control red and infected white cocks. The spleen and brain body weight ratio was similar for both control and infected red and white <b>cocks.</b> The <b>control</b> white <b>cocks</b> had the least thymus body weight ratio. The <b>control</b> white <b>cocks</b> had a higher bursa body weight ratio than the infected red and white <b>cocks</b> and the <b>control</b> red <b>cocks.</b> Only one infected white cock showed perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and foci of glial cells.

40|$|The Caribbean {{region is}} {{considered}} to be at risk for avian influenza (AI) because of predominance of the backyard poultry system, important commercial poultry production, migratory birds and disparities in the surveillance systems. The Caribbean animal health network (CaribVET) has developed tools to implement AI surveillance in the region: (i) a regionally harmonized surveillance protocol, (ii) specific web pages for AI surveillance on [URL] caribvet. net, and (iii) a diagnostic network for the Caribbean including AI virus molecular diagnostic capability in Guadeloupe and technology transfer. Altogether 303 samples from four Caribbean countries were tested between June 2006 and March 2009 by real time PCR either for importation purposes or following clinical suspicion. Following AI H 5 N 2 outbreaks in the Dominican Republic in 2007, a questionnaire was developed to collect data for risk analysis of AI spread in the region through fighting cocks. The infection pathway of Martinique commercial poultry sector by AI through introduction of infected cocks was designed and recommendations were provided to the Caribbean veterinary services to improve fighting <b>cock</b> movement <b>controls</b> and biosecurity measures. Altogether, these CaribVET activities contribute to strengthen surveillance of AI in the Caribbean region and may allow the development of research studies on AI risk analysis.

40|$|Distribution of catecholamine-containing {{cells in}} the {{adenohypophysis}} of the White leghorn fowls was studied after administration of L-dopa. Results obtained {{in this study are}} as follows: 1. In <b>control</b> <b>cocks</b> and hens, no catecholamine-containing cells were observed. 2. After administration of L-dopa, green fluorescent cells were observed in the cephalic lobe in cocks and immature pullets. It is considered that these cells are ACTH cells and therefore included into the APUD cells described by Pearse (1968, 1969). 3. In addition to ACTH {{cells in the}} cephalic lobe described above, another type of green fluorescent cells identified with GTH cells were observed in the both cephalic and caudal lobe in the laying hens. This result suggests that the uptake of L-dopa or dopamine into GTH cells can be probably related to LH secretion during the ovulatory cycele. 白色レグホーン種類にL-dopaを投与して腺性下垂体内のcatecholamine含有細胞の分布を追究した. その結果は次の通りである. 1. 対照鶏では雄雌ともにcatecholamine含有細胞は観察されなかった. 2.

40|$|The Caribbean {{region is}} {{considered}} to be at risk for avian influenza (AI) due to a large backyard poultry system, an important commercial poultry production system, the presence of migratory birds, and disparities in the surveillance systems. The Caribbean Animal Health Network (CaribVET) has developed tools to implement AI surveillance in the region with the goals to have 1) a regionally harmonized surveillance protocol and specific web pages for AI surveillance on www. caribvet. net, and 2) an active and passive surveillance for AI in domestic and wild birds. A diagnostic network for the Caribbean, including technology transfer and AI virus molecular diagnostic capability in Guadeloupe (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the AI virus matrix gene), was developed. Between 2006 and 2009, 627 samples from four Caribbean countries were tested for three circumstances: importation purposes, following a clinical suspicion of AI, or through an active survey of wild birds (mainly waders) during the southward and northward migration periods in Guadeloupe. None of the samples tested were positive, suggesting a limited role of these species in the AI virus ecology in the Caribbean. Following low pathogenic H 5 N 2 outbreaks in the Dominican Republic in 2007, a questionnaire was developed to collect data for a risk analysis of AI spread in the region through fighting cocks. The infection pathway of the Martinique commercial poultry sector by AI, through introduction of infected cocks, was designed, and recommendations were provided to the Caribbean Veterinary Services to improve <b>cock</b> movement <b>control</b> and biosecurity measures. The CaribVET and its organization allowed interaction between diagnostic and surveillance tools {{on the one hand and}} epidemiologic studies on the other, both of them developed in congruence with regional strategies. Together, these CaribVET activities contribute to strengthening surveillance of avian influenza virus (AIV) in the Caribbean region and may allow the development of research studies on both AI risk analysis and on AIV ecology.

50|$|With larger engines, the {{linkages}} involved in controlling cutoff and direction grew progressively heavier {{and there was}} a need for power assistance in adjusting them. Steam (or later, compressed air) powered reversing gear was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Typically, the operator worked a valve that admitted steam to {{one side or the other}} of a cylinder connected to the reversing mechanism until the indicator showed the intended position. A second mechanism, usually a piston in an oil-filled cylinder held in position by closing a <b>control</b> <b>cock,</b> was required to keep {{the linkages}} in place. The first locomotive engineer to fit such a device was James Stirling of the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1873. Several engineers then tried them, including William Dean of the GWR and Vincent Raven of the North Eastern Railway, but they found them little to their liking, mainly because of maintenance difficulties: any oil leakage from the locking cylinder, either through the piston gland or the cock, allowed the mechanism to creep, or worse “nose-dive”, into full forward gear while running. Stirling moved to the South Eastern Railway and Harry Smith Wainwright, his successor with that company, incorporated them into most of his designs, which were in production about thirty years after Stirling’s innovation. Later still the forward-looking Southern Railway engineer Oliver Bulleid fitted them to his famous Merchant Navy Class of locomotives, but they were mostly removed at rebuild.|$|R
40|$|Fifty Rhode Island {{chickens}} {{were randomly}} assigned to five treatments with ten cocks in each treatment. Group I <b>cocks</b> (full fed <b>control)</b> received 140 g of a 16 % CP growers ration per cock per day. Cocks in Group II, III, IV and V received 98, 70, 42 and 28 g of the same ration per cock per day, representing 70, 50, 30 and 20 % of Group I intake, respectively. The feeding trials lasted for 8 weeks during which one ejaculate per day was collected from each cock using the massage technique. The ejaculated semen samples were subjected to both physical and biochemical evaluations. Results showed that cocks that were severely underfed (i. e., Groups IV and V) took significantly longer time (p< 0. 01) to ejaculate. In addition, ejaculation failures were encountered more frequently with the severely underfed cocks than in cocks that were moderately underfed (i. e., Groups II and III). There were however, no significant differences in most of the biochemical parameters between cocks I all the treatment groups. Ejaculate volume, progressive sperm motility and sperm concentration were significantly depressed (p< 0. 01) in the severely underfed cocks than in the moderately underfed cocks. Thus, this study revealed that providing Rhode Island red and white cocks with one-half to three-quarter (i. e., 50 - 70 %) of their normal daily ration would neither undermine their semen producing ability nor affect their semen quality adversely...|$|R
