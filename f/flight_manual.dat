5|$|Unfortunately {{his desire}} to be a pilot was postponed. The family {{required}} further income after his father retired. Unable to wait for that opportunity to arise he joined the Royal Engineers on 26 April 1910, as No. 20083. On 24 February 1911 he set sail for Gibraltar on the southern tip of Spain. McCudden spent eighteen months in Gibraltar before returning to England in September 1912. While in Gibraltar he read <b>Flight</b> <b>manual</b> magazine habitually, which explained the theory of flight, aircraft construction and aero engines. He excelled in his service and by 26 April 1913 he had become a qualified Sapper. He also held the grade Air Mechanic 2nd Class, No. 892, which was awarded to him on 28 April 1913. Soon afterwards he {{became a member of the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 9 May he was posted to Farnborough depot as a mechanic.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise <b>Flight</b> <b>Manual</b> as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a system for}} managing inventory at Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc., a major provider of aviation-information products. The system determines order quantities for charts used in <b>flight</b> <b>manuals.</b> These charts contain essential safety in-formation that changes frequently, making standard methods for inventory management ineffective. We formulated the problem as a dynamic programming model and {{developed a}} simple heuristic-solution procedure for determining order quantities. Based on this procedure, we also developed a deci-sion support system (DSS) and implemented it for 600 {{of the most expensive}} Jeppesen charts. The system has been in use since August 1998, generating actual annual cost reductions of over $ 800, 000. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (Jeppesen), inbusiness since 1934, is the largest pro-vider of aviation-information products in the world. Although Jeppesen manufac-tures many products, including flight sim-ulators, aircraft maintenance manuals, and training videos, its most important prod-uct line consists of <b>flight</b> <b>manuals.</b> These manuals, used by the majority of pilots flying today, are composed of charts (or maps), and Jeppesen manufactures, dis-tributes, and maintains inventory of over 100, 000 distinct charts used in over 2, 000 different <b>flight</b> <b>manuals.</b> Jeppesen’s cus-tomers include most major airlines, suc...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{accident}} the Canadian TSB issued several recommendations, {{one of which}} was a recommendation to the FAA regarding the crew training and <b>flight</b> <b>manual,</b> and another being a recommendation to install an overheat warning system inside the wheel-wells of every Metroliner; before {{the accident}} warning systems were not required on such aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In January 2000, {{an order}} using Shehhi's credit card had a Boeing 747-400 flight {{simulator}} program, a Boeing 767 flight deck video, and some flight attendant literature and <b>flight</b> <b>manuals</b> shipped to Baluchi's work address. Baluchi then shipped {{them to his}} uncle to pass onto Shehhi.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{investigation}} of the accident, the CAB urged the FAA to mandate a redesign of the elevator boost control, so that the shift to manual mode could be easily carried out by the pilots, even when applying nose down pressure. The FAA replied that they had asked the manufacturer to incorporate procedural changes in the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>manual,</b> but did not require any design changes.|$|E
25|$|Adding to the plane's {{troubles}} was the pilots' {{decision to}} maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing {{just ahead of}} them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action—which went specifically against <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> recommendations for an icing situation—actually contributed to additional icing on the 737. The exhaust gases from the other aircraft melted the snow on the wings, but during takeoff, instead of falling off the plane, this slush mixture froze on the wings' leading edges and the engine inlet nose cone.|$|E
25|$|During takeoff, {{both the}} ailerons and flaps are lowered, {{which is a}} {{relatively}} uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58 degree position; the <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver {{is relatively easy to}} handle, having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls; however, effective application of the rudder is necessitated in order to counteract adverse yaw. It should be flown with a relatively nose-low pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. Reportedly, the aircraft is very easy to land, even upon less calm water condition.|$|E

25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
