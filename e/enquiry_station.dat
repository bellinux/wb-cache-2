50|$|The {{expanding}} fleet {{meant that}} the company needed a larger depot, and nearby Summercourt was chosen.

5000|$|An {{extraordinary}} event {{occurred at}} Dingle station on 13 June 1940, after the line's closure to passengers. A German spy named Walter Simon {{arrived at the}} station and asked when the next train would depart (not realising that only freight services were still operating). Simon had been landed by a German submarine, U-38, during the previous night. He then made his way by bus to Tralee and thence by train to Dublin. Following his <b>enquiry</b> at Dingle <b>station</b> the Garda Síochána were informed and he was trailed by detectives. He was arrested on arrival in Dublin and interned {{for the duration of}} the War (known in neutral Ireland as [...] "The Emergency").|$|R
25|$|When the Subway first opened, single-carriage four axle (twin truck) trains were operated. Late in {{the evening}} on the opening day, after 11pm, one car laden with 60 {{passengers}} was run into by another under the River Clyde. Four people were injured, one being taken to the infirmary. This entailed {{the closure of the}} Subway until 19 January 1897. The 20 original wooden bodied carriages were built by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, of Oldbury, Worcestershire. Many continued in service until 1977 in an upgraded form. A further 10 were delivered by the same manufacturer in 1897. From 1898, second four axle (trailer) carriages without a cable gripper mechanism were added, though they were considerably shorter than the front (gripper) carriage. These additional carriages, eventually numbering 30, were built by Hurst Nelson & Company, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. These carriages were soon expanded to match the length of the front carriages, although carriage 41T has been restored to its original length and cut longitudinally and number 39T is preserved in the Riverside Museum. Carriage 41T was on display at Buchanan Street subway station but was removed with the latest round of <b>station</b> modernisations. <b>Enquiries</b> with <b>station</b> staff on 27 September 2017 reveal that the removal was conducted {{in the middle of the}} night at the end of 2015 or the start of 2016. The removal sparked protests. Its location is currently unknown. Most of the gripper carriages were subsequently converted to electric traction in 1935. All carriages were originally built with lattice gates (instead of doors) at the ends; many were converted to air-operated sliding doors in the 1960s, but a few retained the gates until 1977.|$|R
50|$|In November 1672 CE, Sarugohain and his {{supporters}} fully armed approached the palace at mid night. They requested the Chief of the guards, guarding the entrance, Pacha-Simalu Hazarika of Dimaruguria unit to open the gate. But Pacha Simalu Hazarika refused to let the conspirators in. Debera asked Gajpuria Hatibarua, the officer-in-charge of elephants and Parikshit Dhekeri Mahout, the elephant rider, to employ elephants to break {{the gates of the}} Palace. The elephants broke open the gates and the conspirators entered inside the Palace compound. The entrance guards and their chief Pacha Simalu Hazarika, after offering some resistance, were killed by the conspirators. Sarugohain, accompanied by other conspirators marched towards the Royal Audience Hall. Charingia Pelan Borbarua, Charingia Barua and Papang Chaodang Barua, along with their men rushed forward to resist the conspirators led by Sarugohain, but they were over-powered, after offering some resistance. Sarugohain hurled his spear at the Borbarua and pierced him at the thigh. The Prince then inflicted the finishing blows on the Borbarua and killed the Chaodang Barua as well. Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha, soundly asleep in his bed, heard faintly the uproar and commotion outside, but the body-guard on duty in the Royal bed-chamber, who had already been tutored by Debera, informed the monarch that the disturbance was due to the elephants coming out of their stalls, and the attempt made by the Borbarua to bring them round. The king was satisfied with the answer, and refrained from making further <b>enquiries.</b> Meanwhile, Sarugohain <b>stationed</b> himself at the king’s audience-chamber, and dispatched men to guard the several gates of the palace compound. Debera and Mohan deka removed the ladder leading to the royal apartments. Those who opposed Sarugohain and Debera were instantly put to death. Having besieged Udayaditya Singha in his bed chamber and making it impossible for him to escape, Sarugohain seated in the audience hall, declared himself to be king. Ghorakonwar Bhitarual Phukan who had assisted Sarugohain in his bid for the throne was immediately re-elevated to the office of Borbarua. Many royal officers, except Hari Borpatrogohain came and offered their allegiance to the new king. Hari Borpatrogohain was dismissed from his office. Sarugohain appointed one of his loyal followers, Chapa as the new Borpatrogohain.|$|R
