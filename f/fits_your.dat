6000|$|Bad {{state of}} the ledger will {{demonstrate}} that your {{way of dealing with}} your Colonies is absurd, and urgently in want of reform; but to demonstrate that the Empire itself must be dismembered to bring the ledger straight? Oh never. Something else than the ledger must intervene to do that. Why does not England repudiate Ireland, and insist on the [...] "Repeal," [...] instead of prohibiting it under death-penalties? Ireland has never been a paying speculation yet, nor is it like soon to be! Why does not Middlesex repudiate Surrey, and Chelsea Kensington, and each county and each parish, and in the end each individual set up for himself and his cash-box, repudiating the other and his, because their mutual interests have got into an irritating course? They must change the course, seek till they discover a soothing one; that is the remedy, when limbs of the same body come to irritate one another. Because the paltry tatter of a garment, reticulated for you out of thrums and listings in Downing Street, ties foot and hand together in an intolerable manner, will you relieve yourself by cutting off the hand or the foot? You will cut off the paltry tatter of a pretended body-coat, I think, and fling that to the nettles; and imperatively require one that <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> size better.|$|E

Do you think I fear a THING such as you--a beast without honor that kicks an unconscious man in the face? I know that you can kill me. I know that you are coward enough to do it because I am a defenseless woman; and though you may kill me, you never can make me show fear for you. That is what you wish to do--that is your idea of manliness. I had never imagined that such a thing as you lived in the guise of man; but I have read you, Mr. Byrne, since I have had occasion to notice you, and I know now that you are what is known in the great cities as a mucker. The term never meant much to me before, but I see now that it <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> kind perfectly, for in it is all the loathing and contempt that a real man--a gentleman--must feel for such as you." ...|$|E

50|$|Damage control surgery can {{be divided}} into the {{following}} three phases: Initial laparotomy, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resuscitation, and definitive reconstruction.

There are clearly different approaches throughout the country, and no one way is necessarily correct. However, the ability to evaluate objectively the differences and then choose the one that <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> team is important.|$|E
50|$|The flex point is, simply, {{where the}} shaft bends. While {{this may seem}} like an easy concept, the flex point of the club has {{a huge impact on}} the flight of the ball. Shafts that have a flex point closer to the head tend to have more of a draw bias than those that have ones near the grip. However, this whip-like flex near the head {{produces}} a faster club head speed. The idea is to find a point that <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> swing in regards to the face being square while maximizing the club head speed.|$|E

5000|$|The Career Within You, in 2009, was co-authored with Ingrid Stabb. It {{has been}} called [...] "the perfect career book".

[...] He described how the book provides for nine personas [...] "thoughtful and clear descriptions, how each style relates to the spectrum of career choices and a powerful method to determine the path that best fits you.

50|$|Stiffness is {{much less}} complex {{than the other two}} topics. This is {{directly}} and solely tied to your swing speed. The faster the swing, the stiffer the shaft. This is because the faster you swing, the more the club will bend; if the club bends too much, it will whip through impact and the face will be square for a very short time. Stiffer shafts don't flex as much and keep the face squarer through contact. The other side is less stiff shafts will produce a higher ball speed off the face. So the goal is to get the most flexible shaft that <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> swing, but stiff enough so it doesn't hurt your control. This is why it is important that you make sure you are swinging the right shafts for you. Possible options are junior, women, senior, regular, stiff, and xstiff.|$|E
5000|$|Don Turnbull {{reviewed}} High Fantasy for White Dwarf #19 (June/July 1980), {{giving it}} an overall score of 4 out of 10. He explained his rationale for rating the game rules at only a 4: [...] "in {{the case of}} any new role-playing game nowadays, any rating on review has to take account, not just of objective judgment of the game but also of its likely impact on a market which is already dominated ... Whether {{you are likely to}} enjoy the game-system is not entirely the point: the question is - will the game-system contain enough material which <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> personal taste {{to the extent that it}} tempts you away from whatever system you are using at present ... I believe that the High Fantasy rules are too lightweight for that. So my ratings are based on the degree to which High Fantasy materials will compete with D&D or be compatible with D&D and (in the case of modules) the degree to which these make a significant contribution to material which would be grafted onto a D&D format." ...|$|E

5000|$|With the {{addition}} of a powerful new V6, the Saab 9-3 has become a real contender among the sports sedans, convertibles and sport wagons in its class. Whichever body style <b>fits</b> <b>your</b> needs and desires, the Saab 9-3 is sporty, it's tight, and it handles well. A new 2.8-liter turbocharged 6-cylinder has been added for 2006 along with an improved 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 35 more horsepower last year's engine. Together, they make the 2006 Saab 9-3 a more compelling choice. The 4-cylinder option had 12.3 psi maximum turbo boost pressure and turned out , while the 6-cylinder had 8.7 psi boost and turned out [...] In certain markets, like Switzerland, a 230 hp variant of the 6-cylinder was also offered in Vector trim.

The United States 2.0T version was similar to the 2005 Arc except for U.S. Linear wheels were used. The Linear and Arc versions continued to be sold in most other countries.
