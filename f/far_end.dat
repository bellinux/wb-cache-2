5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E
5|$|George A. Campbell and Zobel {{worked on}} this problem of extracting a single {{sideband}} from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in multiplexing telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the transmission.|$|E

5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{charges in}} HMS Campbeltown detonated {{at noon on}} 28 March 1942, and the dry dock was destroyed.

5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. Anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} a vertebra, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> of the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|E

5|$|Christchurch's {{town centre}} {{encompasses}} {{a mixture of}} traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used as the town hall until the civic offices {{were built in the}} mid-1970s. It was restored to its former condition circa 1982 when the Saxon Square shopping precinct was built.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the <b>far</b> <b>end.</b> Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E
5|$|The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and {{is blocked}} off on its {{northern}} end by a sod-cast bank, {{adjacent to the}} site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising young fish, being fed with water from the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. At the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.|$|E

5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the active runway that was alternately connected {{to one of two}} slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or <b>far,</b> <b>end</b> of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end.</b> There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, {{and to protect the}} tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once {{there is no longer a}} need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads {{of male and female}} flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> of a Triaenops humerus (upper arm bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, {{but she did not}} identify it as either species because of the small size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. In site NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and another with m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E

40|$|A compact {{model for}} RLC {{interconnect}} lines, {{in the form}} of a twopath hybrid ladder, is proposed for on-chip interconnect timing and noise analysis. The model parameters are synthesized through constrained nonlinear optimization to directly match the circuit response characteristics over a range of transition times and loads, both at the driving point and at the receiver end. The effect of capacitances on the return current distribution is explicitly considered in our work in obtaining the accurate responses for industrial circuits, and is found to have a significant effect. The parameters for this model are embedded in a table that is characterized once for a design and then used for the analysis of various structured interconnects. Compared with a prior compact modeling approach, our model is demonstrated to accurately predict responses such as the interconnect delay, gate delay, transition times at near and <b>far</b> <b>ends</b> of switching lines as well as the overshoot at the <b>far</b> <b>ends</b> of switching lines. 1...|$|R

5|$|In November, the 6th Brigade {{moved to}} its {{starting}} positions in Libya {{to be held}} in reserve while the initial part of the offensive commenced. The brigade entered the fray on 21 November, and moved to Bir el Hariga with the 25th Battalion leading alongside the 24th Battalion, while the 4th Brigade targeted the Bardia–Tobruk highway and the 5th Brigade the area around Bardia and Sollum. However, the following day, the 6th Brigade was ordered to advance to Point 175, set up a perimeter and then make contact with the 5th South African Brigade, which was in some difficulty, at Sidi Rezegh. Leaving early in the morning of 23 November, the 25th and 26th Battalions led the advance. At daybreak, they stopped and bivouacked in a wadi. Units of the Afrika Korps, later discovered to be its headquarters element, moved into the wadi from the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> and this initiated a battle in which the battalion took several prisoners.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade {{are believed to be}} imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
