25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E

On the same date, the label uploaded an audio video for the track to its YouTube channel. [...] "Yodel It!" [...] was also included on the [...] compilation, which was released on 21 April 2017 and featured the 43 participating entries. Alexandru eventually remixed the song and stretched it to three minutes and 41 seconds. An English language track, [...] "Yodel It!" [...] combines rock with pop and hip hop music. Ilinca yodels prominently during the chorus, while Florea provides rap vocals. The song runs at a moderate tempo of 87 beats per minute. Bogdan Honciuc from Wiwibloggs likened its lyrical message to that of Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off" [...] (2014), as [...] "Ilinca teaches us to break free from the daily <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom,</b> but she suggests yodeling our hearts out instead of shaking it off". The song's instrumental was sent to specialists in Sweden to remaster prior to the duo's appearance at the Eurovision Grand Final in Kiev.|$|E

500|$|For {{the change}} from Ghost Rider to LMD, Joseph McCabe at Nerdist said that any doubts he had about the change [...] "are more or less eliminated" [...] by the series take on a robotic antagonist, which he called [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron done right ... where it most {{obviously}} improves on the overstuffed second Avengers film is in the humor department". Schwartz called the transition smooth, and felt the series' ongoing Inhuman subplot complimented the LMD storyline well. Valentine said that the beginning of LMD [...] "doesn’t maintain the heights of [...] days with Ghost Rider in the driver’s seat, but it does manage to remain a solid entry on the airwaves." [...] He was very critical of the Inhuman subplot, calling the Watchdogs [...] "pretty much played out at this point" [...] and feeling the Inhumans had become stale after the previous two seasons. Fitzpatrick also criticized the [...] "flat" [...] Inhuman storyline, but felt the change to LMD [...] "got off to the best possible start" [...] given the [...] "obviously less of an immediate hook" [...] than Ghost Rider. Beginning the Agents of Hydra pod, Schwartz said [...] "this return episode more than delivered" [...] on the previous episode's cliffhanger. She was satisfied that the Framework reality was not undone within a single episode, and was hopeful that the remaining episodes of the season would offer [...] "similar surprises [...] our expectations". Valentine felt [...] "What If..." [...] "made for a very good start" [...] to the pod, feeling it [...] "continues {{to build on the}} goodwill created by season 4 of S.H.I.E.L.D. presenting an interesting concept and world to be explored". McCown-Levy continued the praise, saying [...] "This could’ve been a sodden slog through too-obvious reveals and portentous <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom.</b> Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept its fleet and efficient pacing, but bent it to the service of a dark and compelling narrative arc already paying dividends in terms of rewarding long-time viewers with deep-pull references and stories". Fitzpatrick, however, felt the episode [...] "stumbled" [...] and was [...] "something of a bumpy reentry into season 4, and doubly so for anyone who lost sight of the Life Model Decoy conflict in play, or harbor concern ABC might not order a fifth season." [...] He found it difficult to determine the rules at play in the Framework, and felt the storyline was done more so because the [...] "producers missed working with Brett Dalton".|$|E

40|$|By-elections {{sometimes}} reflect {{important political}} trends, {{and sometimes they}} don’t. So why are we watching Canning so closely? It was Saturday 26 March 1988, and Coalition supporters were cock-a-hoop. Just a week earlier twelve years of NSW Labor government had been swept away, big time, and now the federal electorate of Port Adelaide had swung to the Liberals by a whopping 11. 1 per cent at a by-election caused by the resignation of Labor’s Mick Young. Port Adelaide had stayed Labor – just – but double-digit swings are (or were) rare. Political observers could vividly recall the 14 per cent slide in Bass in 1975 that foretold the Whitlam government’s election demolition later that year. And just a month before Labor’s knock in Port Adelaide, the Liberals had taken Adelaide in a by-election with an 8. 4 per cent swing. For the five-year-old, twice re-elected (most recently, just nine months earlier) Hawke government, all was <b>doom,</b> <b>gloom</b> <b>and</b> introspection.

2500|$|An {{organization}} with similarities to Scientology, called Selfosophy, {{was a central}} part of an episode from the second season of Millennium that aired on the Fox network on November 21, 1997, entitled [...] "Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense." [...] Selfosophy was created by a science fiction writer who had spent time in an insane asylum. Matt Roush of USA Today wrote that the episode was [...] "written with the density of a Simpsons cartoon. You'll scream till you laugh, or laugh till you scream." [...] Michael Patrick Sullivan writing for Underground Online/UGO wrote: [...] "After {{a year and a half}} of <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> stories, one of the most astounding television writers of the nineties, Darin Morgan, is allowed his fractured take on Millennium and Frank and author Jose Chung investigate murders that lead them deeply into the world of a pseudo-religion called Selfosophy (read as Scientology).

2500|$|Reynolds {{has spoken}} {{of a shift}} from early goth to gothic rock proper, {{advanced}} by the Sisters of Mercy. As journalist Jennifer Park put it, [...] "The original blueprint for gothic rock had mutated significantly. <b>Doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> was no longer confined to its characteristic atmospherics, but as the Sisters demonstrated, it could really rock". The Sisters of Mercy, who cited influences such as Leonard Cohen, Gary Glitter, Motörhead, the Stooges, the Velvet Underground, the Birthday Party, Suicide, and the Fall, created a new, harder form of gothic rock. In addition, they incorporated a drum machine. Reynolds identified their 1983 single [...] "Temple of Love" [...] as the quintessential goth anthem of the year, along with Southern Death Cult's [...] "Fatman". The group created their own record label, Merciful Release, which also signed the March Violets, who performed in a similar style. According to Simon Reynolds, the March Violets [...] "imitated Joy Division sonically". Another band, the Danse Society was particularly inspired by the Cure's Pornography period.|$|E

2500|$|Australian {{literature}} was equally developing a distinct voice. The classic Australian writers Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, Miles Franklin, Norman Lindsay, Steele Rudd, Mary Gilmore, C J Dennis and Dorothea Mackellar were all forged by—and indeed helped to forge—this period of growing national identity. Views of Australia at times conflicted—Lawson and Paterson contributed {{a series of}} verses to The Bulletin magazine in which they engaged in a literary debate {{about the nature of}} life in Australia: Lawson (a republican socialist) derided Paterson as a romantic, while Paterson (a country born city lawyer) thought Lawson full of <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom.</b> Paterson wrote the lyrics of the much-loved folksong Waltzing Matilda in 1895. The song has often been suggested as Australia's national anthem and Advance Australia Fair, the Australian national anthem since the late 1970s, itself was written in 1887. Dennis wrote of laconic heroes in the Australian vernacular, while McKellar rejected a love of England's pleasant pastures in favour of what she termed a [...] "Sunburnt Country" [...] in her iconic poem: My Country (1903).|$|E
2500|$|Arthur was {{initially}} scripted {{to be an}} extremely depressed character, which stemmed from his inability to find employment and provide sufficiently for his family. Arthur's fall into depression {{was considered to be}} an extremely risky storyline to portray, as his decline was to take place over a lengthy period of time. His loss of pride (resulting in theft of the residents Christmas club money) and the deterioration of his health as a result, was an important issue that Tony Holland wanted to get right. His character had [...] "to reach the gutter" [...] before he could be put on the [...] "straight and narrow again". The deteriorating situation was to be shown graphically, with [...] "no punches pulled". His eventual harrowing breakdown and destruction of Lou Beale's (Anna Wing) living room was written by Tony Holland and aired on Christmas Day 1986. Holland and Smith initially feared that the audience {{may not be able to}} tolerate so much <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> at Christmas, however that same episode went on to pull in 30.1 million viewers, giving the soap its highest ever episode rating, which has yet to be beaten by any other plotline from any other soap in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} {{as early as}} November 2009 that the band were aiming {{to take a new}} direction with the third album, with Cronise explaining that [...] "coming up with eight or nine or 10 different themes [...] every couple years, well, it's a little daunting some times, especially for me personally" [...] and noting that [...] "Given the types of themes we'd covered already, I didn't really want to revisit the same stuff again on another record and talk about the same things and <b>doom</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> and sorcerers and ravens and things. So, we just kind of wanted to change it up and do something a little different." [...] Further elaboration was also given on the 'science fiction concept album' idea, with Cronise explaining that [...] "It's psychedelic, in a way. It's not like Star Wars science fiction ... laser guns and action all the time. It's more cerebral in that it's still mythological in the way it's told. It's science fiction and there's spaceships and robots, but it doesn't take place in the future. It's just like another planet far away sort of thing. Otherworldly. And of course, it will have universal-type themes in it. I wanted to create a completely original kind of setting to have the songs take place in." ...|$|E
