5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the <b>double</b> <b>bond.</b> The thermodynamical stability in this compound, {{and the role of}} steric protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E
5|$|Using a ligand called Eind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl) {{germanium}} {{is able to}} form a <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> {{with oxygen}} (germanone).|$|E
5|$|Another {{family of}} carbenes {{is based on}} a cyclopropenylidene core, a three-carbon ring with a <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> between the two atoms {{adjacent}} to the carbenic one. This family is exemplified by bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene.|$|E
5000|$|Unsaturated {{fatty acids}} {{have one or}} more <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> between carbon atoms. (Pairs of carbon atoms {{connected}} by <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> can be saturated by adding hydrogen atoms to them, converting the <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> to single <b>bonds.</b> Therefore, the <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are called unsaturated.) ...|$|R
5000|$|After oxidation, the eicosanoids {{are further}} modified, making a series. Members {{of a series}} are {{differentiated}} by an ABC... letter, and are numbered {{by the number of}} <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> which does not change within a series. For example, cyclooxygenase action upon AA (with 4 <b>double</b> <b>bonds)</b> leads to the series-2 thromboxanes (TXA2, TXB2... each with two <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> Cyclooxygenase action on EPA (with 5 <b>double</b> <b>bonds)</b> leads to the series-3 thromboxanes (TXA3, TXB3... each with three <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> There are exceptions to this pattern, some of which indicate stereochemistry (PGF2α).|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{since both}} <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are {{separated}} by a single C-C <b>bond,</b> the <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are conjugated.|$|R
5|$|Like phosphate, {{phosphoryl}} chloride is tetrahedral in shape. It features three P−Cl {{bonds and}} one strong P=O <b>double</b> <b>bond,</b> {{with an estimated}} bond dissociation energy of 533.5kJ/mol. On the basis of bond length and electronegativity, the Schomaker-Stevenson rule suggests that the <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> form is very dominant (in contrast with POF3). The P=O bond does not utilize the d-orbitals on phosphorus as is commonly described in older textbooks as quantum chemical calculations have shown that d-orbitals {{are not involved in}} main group chemical bonding (see Hypervalent molecule). More modern texts favour a description which involves the donation of the lone pair electrons from oxygen p-orbitals to the antibonding phosphorus-chlorine bonds thus constituting π bonding.|$|E
5|$|The first acyclic {{persistent}} carbene {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone was not necessary for their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, {{the extent of their}} <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine group. A negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related Wittig reaction, {{the formation of the}} much stronger phosphorus-oxygen <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> prevents oxirane formation and instead, olefination takes place through a 4-membered cyclic intermediate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{methods are}} well-suited to the {{oxidation}} of electron-rich or electron-poor <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> but few are as effective for both classes of substrate as dioxiranes. Weitz-Scheffer conditions (NaOCl, H2O2/KOH, tBuO2H/KOH) {{work well for}} oxidations of electron-poor <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> and sulfonyl-substituted oxaziridines are effective for electron-rich <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{reactions}} of cumulene {{are those of}} simple isolated <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> because the consecutive <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are not conjugated to each other.|$|R
40|$|Single crystal X-ray {{structures}} of two bridgehead dienes are reported. The bridgehead <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> of diene 7 show only modest deviation from strain-free tetrasubstituted <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> The <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> in bridgehead diene 6, however, exhibit an average deviation of the C-CC-C torsion angle (φ + χ) of 14 °. © 1986...|$|R
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|The tetroxide and {{a related}} {{compound}} potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis, despite being very poisonous. For the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which uses osmate for {{the conversion of}} a <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> into a vicinal diol, Karl Barry Sharpless won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. OsO4 is very expensive for this use, so KMnO4 is often used instead, even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
2500|$|The AA-derived prostanoids {{have two}} <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> (e.g. PGG2 or PGG2) while their AA-derived leukotrienes have four <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> (e.g. LTB4 or LTB4).|$|R
25|$|The EPA-derived prostanoids {{have three}} <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> (e.g. PGG3 or PGG3) while leukotrienes derived from EPA have five <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> (e.g. LTB5 or LTB5).|$|R
50|$|Fatty acids {{that have}} carbon-carbon <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are known as}} unsaturated. Fatty acids without <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are known as saturated. They differ in length as well.|$|R
5|$|Selenium, {{especially}} in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, {{as illustrated by the}} selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a <b>double</b> <b>bond,</b> there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>bonds</b> {{involving}} carbon {{are stronger}} than single bonds and are also shorter. The bond order is two. <b>Double</b> <b>bonds</b> are also electron-rich, which makes them reactive.|$|R
25|$|Fats contain long {{hydrocarbon}} chains, {{which can}} either be unsaturated, i.e., have <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> or saturated, i.e., have no <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations. In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40°C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> into trans <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{omega-3 fatty}} acids are {{important}} in human physiology, α-linolenic acid (18:3, n-3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3; DHA). [...] These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5, or 6 <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> in a carbon chain of 18, 20, or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. As with most naturally-produced fatty acids, all <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are in the cis-configuration, in other words, the two hydrogen atoms {{are on the same}} side of the double bond; and the <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are interrupted by methylene bridges (--), so that there are two single bonds between each pair of adjacent <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|A <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> may exhibit {{one of two}} {{possible}} configurations: trans or cis. In trans configuration, the carbon chain extends from {{opposite sides of the}} <b>double</b> <b>bond,</b> whereas, in cis configuration, the carbon chain extends from {{the same side of the}} <b>double</b> <b>bond.</b> The trans molecule is a straighter molecule. The cis molecule is bent.|$|E

5000|$|Polyterpenes {{consist of}} long chains of many {{isoprene}} units. Natural rubber consists of polyisoprene {{in which the}} <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are cis. Some plants produce a polyisoprene with trans <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> known as gutta-percha.|$|R
50|$|One set of Woodward-Fieser {{rules for}} dienes is {{outlined}} in table 1. A diene is either homoannular with both <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> contained in one ring or heteroannular with two <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> distributed between two rings.|$|R
40|$|Triacylglycerols {{are among}} the most abudant classes of lipid. Their chemical, {{physical}} and biological characteristics depend on degree of unsaturation and positions of <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> in acyls. This thesis was focused on localization of <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> using tandem mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. We studied 14 standards and 44 standard mixtures with different number of <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> and lenght of hydrocarbob chain in acyls.

25|$|The fourth box is Step 3, {{which is}} the {{saturation}} of the alpha-beta unsaturated <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> between carbons 2 and 3. In this step of the reaction, Lysine deprotonates the oxygen off the alpha carbon and the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the oxygen of the alpha carbon comes down reforming the ketone <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> and pushing the lone pair (forming the <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> between the alpha and beta carbon) off, picking up a proton from the nearby Tyrosine amino acid.
