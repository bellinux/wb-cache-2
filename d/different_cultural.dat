5|$|Because of its {{geographic}} position, Croatia {{represents a}} blend of four <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures.|$|E
5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian. However, the <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> and political views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous {{aspects of the}} political spectrum. In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E
5|$|In Byzantine literature, four <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> {{elements}} are recognised: the Greek, the Christian, the Roman, and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, Michael Psellus, and Michael Choniates {{are regarded as}} the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the Digenis Acritas. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.|$|E

5|$|In Singapore, Neila {{was exposed}} to dancers of <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> {{backgrounds}} and traditions, inspiring her to create new Indian dance steps based on classical foundations. In 1977, Neila and her husband founded performing arts company Apsaras Arts {{under the auspices of}} the Kamala Club, an organisation for Indian ladies promoting Indian dance and music. Starting with 20 students, the company expanded in size and significance, and has staged numerous arangetrams (dance débuts) and performances in Singapore and abroad, including Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Neila's {{interactions}} with choreographers and dancers of <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> backgrounds and traditions in Singapore inspired her {{to create new}} Indian dance steps based on classical foundations; for instance, her dance-drama Kannagi, staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998, {{was said to have}} stretched tradition to its limits and offered something to a range of audiences far wider than a traditional dance-drama would have done. Up to 2007, Neila had choreographed dance segments for the last 13 Chingay Parades, street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army {{succeeded in}} conquering many territories {{covering}} the entire Mediterranean region and coastal regions in southwestern Europe and north Africa. These territories were {{home to many}} <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> groups, both urban populations and rural populations. Generally speaking, the eastern Mediterranean provinces were more urbanised than the western, having previously been united under the Macedonian Empire and Hellenised by the influence of Greek culture.|$|E

The mosque's roof goes upwards in five steps, with the dome at the top; {{the first step is}} square, while the rest are octagonal. Each part of the roof has slits in it for lighting.|$|E
5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
5|$|Arnada {{released}} his novel Rumah di Seribu Ombak in early 2012; {{it had been}} written {{while he was in}} prison. Set in Singaraja, Bali, the novel followed the friendship of two young boys from <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> backgrounds. He adapted the novel later that year, serving as director and producer. The film was a critical success and nominated for nine Citra Awards at the 2012 Indonesian Film Festival, including Citra Award for Best Director for Arnada. It won four, including Best Editing and Best Screenplay; Arnada lost the Best Director award to Herwin Novianto of Tanah Surga... Katanya (Land of Heaven... They Say).|$|E

5|$|Carpet weaving {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, Turkic peoples migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle between life and death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and <b>different</b> <b>cultural</b> expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E
