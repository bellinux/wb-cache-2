5|$|Construction of the {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1990, lbut a decade-long hiatus between the mid-1990s and 2004 caused by funding <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> setting up {{of a separate}} company to develop and operate the motorway meant it was not completed until 2007. As of July 2011, the entire motorway route is completed, consisting of a dual-carriageway and four traffic lanes, except for a relatively short segment which is still a single carriageway road. The motorway is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt did {{not wish}} to lead the U.S. into the war; his 1937 Quarantine Speech denouncing {{aggression}} by Italy and Japan had met mixed responses. Welles felt freer in this regard, looking towards postwar border <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a U.S.-led international body that could intervene in such disputes. Roosevelt saw Welles's stronger public statements as experiments that would test the public mood in regard to U.S. foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|The Glen Yards {{project has}} been {{controversial}} due to local opposition to the project, environmental <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cost of the project itself. The project, which has received approval from the provincial government, was, in 2003, expected to be complete by 2010. The new 'campus' has now been completed, and a massive effort of moving units from older hospitals, such Royal Victoria, Montreal Children's, and Montreal General, into the new McGill University Health Center is underway.|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> burgeoning subprime mortgage crisis, while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50percent. A second summit, was held in October 1986, Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500kilometers (300 to 3,400miles) and their infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian {{government}} depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent amidst widespread overpopulation and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country's outlook appears to be improving, with {{a rise in the}} economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews, earning {{praise for}} its story, characters, dialogue, and visual style.

5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} {{the fabric of the}} building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of the}} Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E
5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E
5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E
