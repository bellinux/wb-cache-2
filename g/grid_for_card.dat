The <b>grid</b> <b>for</b> the third race is decided by reversing between 4 and 6 of the top 10 finishers from the second race.|$|R

50|$|Qualifying for Race 20 {{consisted}} of three parts: a 20-minute qualifying session and two 20-lap (60 km) qualifying races. The qualifying session was contested by regular championship drivers and set the <b>grid</b> <b>for</b> {{the first of the}} qualifying races, which was contested by co-drivers. The results of the first qualifying race set the <b>grid</b> <b>for</b> the second, where the main drivers took part.

50|$|At each of {{the first}} four race weekends, two {{qualifying}} sessions were held in order to establish the <b>grids</b> <b>for</b> the first and third races of each meeting. The first fifteen-minute session establishes the <b>grid</b> <b>for</b> the opening race, while the second session of fifteen minutes established the <b>grid</b> <b>for</b> the final race of the meeting, denoted as the feature race. In between, the <b>grid</b> <b>for</b> the second race was established via a partially reversed grid and the conduction of a marble draw by the first race winner. Based upon the finishing positions of the first race, the grid could be inverted by either four, six or eight positions via the marble draw.|$|R
