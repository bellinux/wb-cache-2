40|$|Crowdsourcing is an {{appealing}} and economic solution to software application <b>testing</b> because <b>of</b> {{its ability to}} reach a large international audience. Meanwhile, crowdsourced testing could have {{brought a lot of}} bug reports. Thus, in crowdsourced software <b>testing,</b> the inspection <b>of</b> a large number <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> is an enormous but essential software maintenance task. Therefore, automatic prediction of the severity <b>of</b> crowdsourced <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> is important because of their high numbers and large proportion of noise. Most existing approaches to this problem utilize supervised machine learning techniques, which often require users to manually label a large number of training data. However, Android <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> are not labeled with their severity level, and manual labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the above problems, we propose a Knowledge Transfer Classification (KTC) approach based on text mining and machine learning methods to predict the severity <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>reports.</b> Our approach obtains training data from bug repositories and uses knowledge transfer to predict the severity <b>of</b> Android <b>test</b> <b>reports.</b> In addition, our approach uses an Importance Degree Reduction (IDR) strategy based on rough set to extract characteristic keywords to obtain more accurate reduction results. The results of several experiments indicate that our approach is beneficial for predicting the severity <b>of</b> android <b>test</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R

This management is based on concepts of modern document management systems such as the archiving, accessing and presenting of fine-grained documents.

40|$|By law and {{according}} to conventional practice. individual psychoeducational testing {{is an essential part}} of the identification and placement process of handicapped students. However, evidence reported in the literature suggests that testing results, especially in the form <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>reports,</b> are rarely fully utilized. This study was conducted at Intermountain Intertribal School at Brigham City, Utah and demonstrated a method of collecting objective data about the use <b>of</b> psychoeducational <b>testing</b> <b>reports</b> as well as the opinions and suggestions of staff members who used them. More specifically, this study documented: 1. Who the primary users <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>reports</b> were and for what purposes the reports were used. 2.

In spite of the fact that respondents generally found the reports to be free from jargon and judged the reports to be useful in preparing the student 2 ̆ 7 s educational program, results indicate that the testing results were used almost exclusively in the placement of the student and preparation of the student 2 ̆ 7 s individual education plan.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess changes in the {{anaerobic}} threshold of young soccer players in an annual training cycle. A group of highly trained 15 - 18 year old players of KKS Lech Poznań were tested. The tests included an annual training macrocycle, and its individual stages resulted from the time structure of the sports training. In order to assess the level of exercise capacities of the players, a field exercise <b>test</b> <b>of</b> increasing intensity was carried out on a soccer pitch. The test made it possible to determine the 4 millimolar lactate threshold (T LA 4 mmol[*]·[*]l- 1) on the basis of the lactate concentration in blood [LA], to establish the threshold running speed and the threshold heart rate [HR]. The threshold running speed at the level of the 4 millimolar lactate threshold was established using the two-point form of the equation of a straight line. The obtained indicators of the threshold running speed allowed for precise establishment of effort intensity used in individual training in developing aerobic endurance. In order to <b>test</b> the significance <b>of</b> differences in mean values between four <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> a non-parametric Friedman ANOVA test was used. The significance of differences between consecutive <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> was determined using a post-hoc Friedman ANOVA test. The tests showed significant differences in values of selected indicators determined at the anaerobic threshold in various stages of an annual training cycle of young soccer players. The most beneficial changes in terms of the threshold running speed were noted on the fourth <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> when the participants had the highest values of 4. 01 m[*]·[*]s- 1 for older juniors, and 3. 80 m[*]·[*]s- 1 for younger juniors. This may be indicative of effective application of an individualized programme of training loads and of good preparation of teams for competition in terms of players’ aerobic endurance...|$|R
