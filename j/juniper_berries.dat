5|$|While {{classified}} as generally recognized as {{safe in the}} US, <b>juniper</b> <b>berries</b> may have various side effects that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming <b>juniper</b> <b>berries</b> may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, <b>juniper</b> <b>berries</b> were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, <b>juniper</b> <b>berries,</b> acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} supplemented <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> (Juniperus communis) on fattening performance and some carcass traits of quails. A total of 150 one-day-old Japanese quail chicks were randomly divided into five groups (one control and four treated groups) with three replicates. Four different <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> levels (0. 5, 1, 1. 5, and 2 %) and a control treatment (0 %) were added to the diet. <b>Juniper</b> <b>berry</b> supplementation to the diets initiated at the end of the 1 st week and sustained for seven weeks. Live weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio during the trial and some carcass traits after slaughter were determined. <b>Juniper</b> <b>berry</b> supplementation in the diet during seven weeks of growing period significantly increased body weight, cumulative feed intake, and feed conversion ratio of the treated groups. Carcass weight, carcass yield, and breast yield were also significantly increased by supplemented <b>juniper</b> <b>berry.</b> No significant difference was observed between viability of different groups. Supplementation of 0. 5 - 1 % <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> in quail diets has positive impacts on fattening performance and carcass traits...|$|R

5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and <b>juniper</b> <b>berries,</b> weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in Juniper forests where they feed on <b>juniper</b> <b>berries,</b> differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which dig for food in the soil of the villages' terraced pastures.|$|E

40|$|Plant {{phenolics}} {{have shown}} to activate apoptotic cell death in different tumourigenic cell lines. In this study, we evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> extract (Juniperus communis L.) on p 53 protein, gene expression and DNA fragmentation in human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells. In addition, we analyzed the phenolic composition of the extract. We found that <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> extract activated cellular relocalization of p 53 and DNA fragmentation-dependent cell death. Differentially expressed genes between treated and non-treated cells were evaluated with the cDNA-RDA (representational difference analysis) method at the early time point of apoptotic process when p 53 started to be activated and no caspase activity was detected. Twenty one overexpressed genes related to cellular stress, protein synthesis, cell survival and death were detected. Interestingly, they included endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer and sensor HSPA 5 and other ER stress-related genes CALM 2 and YKT 6 indicating that ER stress response was involved in <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> extract mediated cell death. In composition analysis, we identified and quantified low concentrations of fifteen phenolic compounds. The main groups of them were flavones, flavonols, phenolic acids, flavanol and biflavonoid including glycosides of quercetin, apigenin, isoscutellarein and hypolaetin. It is suggested that <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> extract induced the p 53 -associated apoptosis through the potentiation and synergism by several phenolic compounds...|$|R
