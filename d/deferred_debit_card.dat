5000|$|The {{annual fee}} for a <b>deferred</b> <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> is around €10 more than for one with {{immediate}} debit. Most France debit cards are branded with the Carte Bleue logo, which assures acceptance throughout France. Most card holders choose to pay around €5 more in their annual fee to additionally have a Visa or a MasterCard logo on their Carte Bleue, {{so that the}} card is accepted internationally. A Carte Bleue without a Visa or a MasterCard logo is often known as a [...] "Carte Bleue Nationale" [...] and a Carte Bleue with a Visa or a MasterCard logo {{is known as a}} [...] "Carte Bleue Internationale", or more frequently, simply called a [...] "Visa" [...] or [...] "MasterCard".|$|E
5000|$|Banks in France usually charge annual {{fees for}} debit cards (despite card {{payments}} being very cost efficient for the banks), yet {{they do not}} charge personal customers for checkbooks or processing checks (despite checks being very costly for the banks). This imbalance dates from the unilateral introduction in France of Chip and PIN debit cards in the early 1990s, when {{the cost of this}} technology was much higher than it is now. Credit cards of the type found in the United Kingdom and United States are unusual in France and the closest equivalent is the <b>deferred</b> <b>debit</b> <b>card,</b> which operates like a normal debit card, except that all purchase transactions are postponed {{until the end of the}} month, thereby giving the customer between 1 and 31 days of [...] "interest-free" [...] credit.|$|E
5000|$|The Israel {{bank card}} system is {{somewhat}} confusing to newcomers, comprising {{a blend of}} features taken from different types of cards. What may {{be referred to as}} a credit card, is most likely to be a <b>deferred</b> <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> on an associated bank current account, {{the most common type of}} card in Israel, somewhat like the situation in France, though the term [...] "debit card" [...] is not in common usage. Cards are nearly universally called cartis eshrei (כרטיס אשראי), literally, [...] "credit card", a term which may bely the card's characteristics. Its main feature may be a direct link to a connected bank account (through which they are mostly issued), with the total value of the transactions made on the card being debited from the bank account in full on a regular date once a month, without the option to carry the balance over; indeed certain types of transactions (such as online and/or foreign currency) may be debited directly from the connected bank account at the time of the transaction. Any such limited credit enjoyed is a result of the customer's assets and credibility with the bank, and not granted by the credit card company. The card usually enables immediate ATM cash withdrawals & balance inquiries (as debit cards do), instalment & deferred charge interest free transactions offered by merchants (also applicable in Brazil), interest bearing instalment plans/deferred charge/revolving credit which is transaction specific at the point of sale (though granted by the issuer, hence the interest), and a variety of automated/upon request types of credit schemes including loans, some of which revolve or resemble the extended payment options sometimes offered by charge cards.|$|E
5000|$|Overall, banks {{routinely}} offer <b>deferred</b> <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> {{to their}} new customers, with [...] "true" [...] <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> usually offered {{only to those who}} cannot obtain credit. These latter cards are not attractive to the average customer since they attract both a monthly fee from the credit company and a bank account fee for each day's debits. Isracard Direct is by far more common than the ICC Visa Electron <b>debit</b> <b>card.</b> Banks who issue mainly Visa cards will rather offer electronic use, mandate authorized transaction only, unembossed version of Visa Electron <b>deferred</b> <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> (branded as [...] "Visa Basic" [...] or [...] "Visa Classic") to its customers - sometimes even in the form of revolving credit card.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> {{usage and}} its impact on {{household}} debts, using the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances. By conducting simultaneous equation modeling, we examine how <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> users are different from non-users, and whether <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> usage influences household debt. We find that, after controlling for selection bias, the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> is negatively associated with household debt. We also find that those with revolving debt tendencies (i. e., carrying outstanding balances on credit cards) are more likely to use <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> than those without a revolving debt tendency. We conclude that <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> usage discourages the accumulation of household debt rather than that <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> users tend to be financially conscientious. © 2007 Academy of Financial Services.

This brief analyzes the potential effects of an increase in <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fees or in bank account fees by using the results of the 2008 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC). The main findings are that: 1) consumers with the least amount of education (less than a high school diploma), the lowest annual income (below $ 25, 000), and the youngest age (under 25 years) consider cost {{to be the most important}} payment characteristic. It is probable that these consumers would be most affected by an increase in <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fees, and most likely to change their payment behavior in response; 2) the cost of debit seems to be an important factor affecting consumer payment decisions: consumers who rated the cost of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> as low relative to the cost of other payment methods were significantly more likely to adopt and to use debit cards; 3) credit cards were viewed as the closest substitute for <b>debit</b> <b>cards.</b> If the cost of using <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> rises, consumers are more likely to substitute credit cards for some of their <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> transactions; 4) consumer reaction depends on the type of fee increases: an increase in the cost of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> specifically is expected to have a greater effect on <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> use than a broader increase in the cost of maintaining bank accounts; and 5) an increase in the one-time cost of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> setup could lead to a substantial decrease in the rate of <b>debit</b> adoption. <b>Debit</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{exclusion}} {{restrictions that}} identify Eq. (1)—where the acquirer change in transaction volume per POS terminal with <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> (ACTVPOS) is the dependent variable—are the merchant <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> discount fee and the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> annual fee—which {{are expected to}} be negatively related to merchant transaction volumes- and an interaction term of the merchant acceptance and the total number of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> in that network. This interaction captures the network effects as ACTVPOS is expected to increase when the number of merchants served by the acquirer increases or the number of total <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> increases. The exclusion restriction for ICTVDC corresponds to the annual <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fee and the network effects shown by the interaction term of the merchant acceptance in the network and the number of cards issued by the bank. It {{is important to note that}} only 6  % of banks in the sample charge an annual fee for <b>debit</b> <b>cards.</b> 6 Even so, we exploit such variation to infer the impact of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fees on acquirer (Eq.  1) and issuer (Eq.  2) volumes. As for Eq. (3) the exclusion restrictions also include a price for that side of the market—the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> ATM fees- and the interaction of the number of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> in the network and the number of ATMs by issuer, which is expected to show ATM network effects.|$|R
