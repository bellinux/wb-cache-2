However, a High Court exercises its original civil and criminal <b>jurisdiction</b> only if the subordinate courts are not authorized by law to try such matters for lack of pecuniary, territorial <b>jurisdiction.</b> High courts may also enjoy original <b>jurisdiction</b> in certain matters if so designated specifically in a state or federal law.|$|E

5|$|Exclusive <b>Jurisdiction</b> is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim <b>jurisdiction</b> over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive <b>Jurisdiction</b> can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share <b>jurisdiction</b> (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive <b>Jurisdiction</b> does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E
5|$|Hemi {{argued that}} a line of Illinois appellate {{opinions}} demonstrated that Illinois law required more than federal law with regard to satisfying due process standards for personal <b>jurisdiction.</b> The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, finding {{that none of the}} cases cited by Hemi even suggested a meaningful difference between the federal and Illinois due process standards, and {{that at least one of}} the cases cited by Hemi only discussed the distinction in the theoretical context. Though the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court may only exercise <b>jurisdiction</b> only if both federal and state constitutional elements are satisfied, it also stated that it was unaware of cases where personal <b>jurisdiction</b> could be satisfied under the U.S. Constitution, but not under the Illinois Constitution. Hence, the Seventh Circuit limited its analysis as to whether exercising personal <b>jurisdiction</b> over Hemi would comport with the federal guarantee of due process.|$|E

In contrast, if the relative size differentials are sub-stantial, i. e. there are very small and large <b>jurisdictions</b> in the system, tax h(e) avens and tax hells emerge.

5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it <b>jurisdiction</b> over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such <b>jurisdiction.</b> More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate <b>jurisdiction</b> to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all <b>jurisdiction</b> not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered <b>jurisdiction</b> {{until such time}} as the <b>jurisdiction</b> may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the <b>jurisdiction</b> to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered <b>jurisdiction</b> to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
