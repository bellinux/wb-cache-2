40|$|A new {{mechanism}} for the generation of a self-exited oscillation of combustion in a <b>generic</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber typical for aero-engine combustors is described. The cause of the oscillation is the phase change from liquid to vapour which happens when the preheat temperature of the air flowing through the burner exceeds the boiling temperature at the operating pressure and the fuel flow is so low that heat transfer to the liquid fuel causes evaporation within the fuel channels of the burner. Liquid fuel and vapour alternatively enter the airstream of the burner. This leads to an instable situation for the flame. Measurements of chemiluminescence and liquid fuel show nearly complete extinction and reignition for the limit cycle. Prevention of the oscillation is possible by better thermal management on the fuel path...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} {{of heat and}} power to dwellings from micro-cogeneration systems is gaining credence around the developed world as a possible means to reduce the significant carbon emissions associated with the domestic sector. However, achieving the optimum performance for these systems requires that building design practitioners are equipped with robust, integrated models, which will provide a realistic picture of the cogeneration performance in-situ. A long established and appropriate means to evaluate the energy performance of buildings and their energy systems is {{through the use of}} dynamic building simulation tools. However, until now, only a very limited number of micro-cogeneration device models have been available to the modelling community and generally these have not been appropriate for use within building simulation codes.

40|$|Mesoscale {{internal}} combustion engines {{for a variety}} of new combustion system applications have dimensions that are far smaller than conventional macroscale engines, yet unlike true microscale engines allow significant mean flow and turbulence to be created in the combustion chamber by the injection process. The resulting flow allows minimization of the combustion time by augmenting flame propagation across the combustion chamber to provide maximum power and efficiency. However injection and ignition locations that give minimum combustion times in traditional macroscale engines are of limited relevance in such small-scale engines. This study has therefore examined premixed flame propagation in a <b>generic</b> mesoscale <b>combustion</b> chamber for various injection and ignition configurations to develop guidelines for minimizing combustion times in mesoscale engines. Numerical simulations based on the G-equation, coupled with mean flow and turbulence fields for various injection configurations, reveal key features of flame propagation and combustion times for combinations of injection and ignition sites.

40|$|The European Commission co-funded {{research}} project LAPCAT I - Long-Term Advanced Propulsion Concepts and Technologies - was performed within the timeframe spring 2005 until spring 2008. The project was coordinated by the European Space Research and Technology Center, ESA-ESTEC and the consortium consisted of 11 partners from industry, research institutions and universities. The objectives of LAPCAT I were {{to identify and}} assess critical propulsion technologies required to reduce long-distance flights, e. g. from Brussels to Sydney, to less than 4 hours. Achieving this goal intrinsically requires a new flight regime for commercial transport with Mach numbers ranging from 4 to 8. At these high speeds, classical turbo-jet engines are not feasible {{and need to be}} replaced by advanced airbreathing engines. Different combined cycles, i. e. turbine based combined cycles (TBCC) and rocket based combined cycles (RBCC) were evaluated both on fundamental research level and in the framework of vehicle system studies.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} pressure to manufacture more efficient engines that produce lowerexhaust emissions, {{there is a}} corresponding need for {{a greater understanding of}} the combustion processes within these engines. Specifically, it is the interaction between the fuel and the engine that represents one of the greatest research challenges. As the systemsbecome increasingly sophisticated, the fuel companies are experiencing an increased demand for high specification fuels with tighter tolerances. Now, more than ever, the fueldesign and engine design need to work as one integrated system to meet these expectations. In this project, an attempt was made to produce a computationally efficient mathematical model of the fuel ignition characteristics {{that could be used in}} a CFD simulation of an internal combustion engine or any other <b>generic</b> <b>combustion</b> system. The validation of the model provided useful insight into the need for good quality experimental data for the fuels of interest, highlighting the need for pure ignition delay curves without engine effects, which is a limitation of many of the current models. When modelling a single fuel droplet, the importance of the temperature profile in the vicinity of the evaporating particle was clearly illustrated, as well as the variation in the local air/fuel ratio. These effects were shown to playoff against each other - the centre of the droplet being coldest and hence yielding a longer ignition delay while, at the same time, the high equivalence ratio near the centre had the effect of shortening the ignition delay. Using a simple, two dimensional model and using n-Heptane as the fuel, a realistic prediction of the overall ignition delay was obtained. More importantly, the critical zone of the initial auto ignition was identified. These simulations show how this model can be used in an environment that exhibits both gradients of temperature and equivalence ratio. It also shows the importance of including such in-homogeneities when creating engine models that include fuel injection. This approach can easily be extended into any type of combustion simulation involving fuel droplets where local temperature and equivalence ratios have a controlling effect on the ignition. Some recommendations for future work include the modelling of the IQT™ with the possibility of reconciling the ignition delay of the IQT™ and the cetane test...|$|E
40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyse}} the gas turbine based energy {{conversion}} systems {{with the emphasis}} on combustion chambers. The investigation is mainly experimental at a component level. The majority of investigations concentrate on gaseous fuel firing. The influence of swirl, heat release and combustor geometry on the turbulent flows in a generic premixed gas turbine combustor, is investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). The goal is to characterize the main flow structures and turbulence in a model combustor that is relevant to gas turbines during Natural Gas firing. An explanation for the underlying mechanisms is presented to describe the effect of swirl, heat release and outlet contraction on the flow field. CO, NOx and total unburned HC were measured at the outlet of the combustor, and the influence of mass flow rate, inlet temperature, and addition of CO 2 – diluent was investigated. The combustor’s behaviour, particularly in the lean part of its range of operation, was investigated to assess some of the problems associated with combustion in suggested power plants for CO 2 rich bio-fuels and CO 2 capture/sequestration. The partially reformed mixtures can be formed using biomass. Before combusting these mixtures in a gas turbine, experimental work was done on the <b>generic</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber to examine the off-design combustor behaviour when switching from natural gas to the wet and dry generic hydrogen-rich mixtures. The thesis reports work on liquid atomisation. Although technical applications make use of well distributed and finely dispersed sprays, the injectors may operate under off-design conditions of low Weber numbers. A low We water spray subjected to an air cross-flow which similar to pre-vaporisers of lean premixed pre-vaporising (LPP) burners is studied. PIV and PDA have been used to quantify both the continuous and dispersed phases. A long range microscope has been used to characterize the column breakup process. Investigation of synthetic liquid fuel combustion in the generic combustor {{has been a part of}} this thesis. An experimental comparison of the synthetic jet fuel and jet A 1 is performed. Emissions of NOX, CO and HC, ignition and extinction points, liner temperatures, soot levels in the combustor are studied. Modern gas turbine compressors are sensitive to changes in profile shape and to surface roughness with their highly loaded blades. The remedy to fouling problem is washing. The thesis work includes an investigation of the two-phase flow in the bellmouth of the compressor during off-line washing conditions. The main emphasis has been on studying the characteristics of the injected spray used for cleaning of the compressor. The used nozzles are akin to pressure swirl nozzles for liquid fuel injection. To provide with accurate boundary conditions for the spray, laser-based measurements of a spray, originating from an authentic wash nozzle, have been conducted. The other branch of this study aims to describe the behaviour of a generic combustor under off-design conditions that are reflecting the current trend of bio-fuels in the gas turbine power industry. Since it is rather rare to have custom-built gas turbines for low calorific value operation, the engine will be forced to operate outside its design envelope. Typical restraints are decrease in Wobbe-index and surge- and flutter-margins for turbomachinery. In this study, an advanced performance deck has been used to quantify the impact of firing low calorific value gases in a generic type gas turbine. A single-shaft gas turbine characterized by a compressor and an expander map is considered. Emphasis has been put on predicting the off-design behavior. The combustor is discussed and related to previous experiments which include investigation of flammability limits, Wobbe-index, flame position, etc...|$|E
40|$|This project {{deals with}} {{questions}} related to <b>generic</b> diesel <b>combustion</b> research and optically accessible engines are used to study the combustion process. Images of the combustion are analyzed together with in-cylinder pressure and exhaust gas emission measurements. The results {{can be divided into}} two main categories: one about evaluations of optically accessible engines and one about studies of emissions and heat release. The focus is on the link between the combustion event and engine-out emissions. The reason for putting efforts on the first category is to get more reliable information from the second one. First, the mechanical behaviour during operation of optical engines is discussed. Optical engines may suffer from distortion of the in-cylinder volume trace due to mechanical deformation from mass, pressure and thermal forces. This distortion causes errors in heat release calculations. A method to account for the errors is therefore developed which makes the calculations insensitive to mechanical deformations. The optical access also affects the engines heat transfer properties which can cause differences in heat release and engine-out emissions compared to all-metal engines. Fortunately, it is possible to compensate for the differences and achieve realistic engine-out emissions and combustion phasing by adjusting the charge temperature. The engine-out soot emissions are the result of a complex series of events including fuel air mixing, premixed combustion, mixing controlled combustion, and late soot oxidation. The first part of the emission section in this thesis deals with factors that are known to be important for the soot formation and estimates how they affect the engine-out soot emissions. The goal is to identify characteristics of the soot formation that are important for the engine-out smoke level and thereby the soot particle mass. Two studies are included in this chapter, one about air entrainment and one about early soot formation. It is indicated that the rate of soot-formation during the quasi-steady jet-phase has a rather weak relation to the level of engine-out soot. This is despite the usage of few, small, nozzle holes leading to a long injection duration with {{a large portion of the}} combustion taking place during the fuel injection period. The observation is explained as follows: First, a large fraction of the soot is formed in the transition between the premixed and spray-driven combustion which weighs down the importance of the quasi-steady jet-phase. Second, factors that enhance the soot formation during the jet phase in some cases also enhances the soot oxidation during this phase. Third, correlations to emissions of CO and UHC further point to the importance of the oxidation process and characteristics of the heat release indicates that this is partly related to the late cycle. The second part of the emission section deals with the sources of CO and UHC during low temperature combustion. It is suggested that the squish volume is crucial for the engine-out CO and UHC levels during low load. Two combustion concepts with different injection strategies are investigated, one with very early start of injection (SOI) and one with SOI close to TDC. The squish volume is indicated to be the major source of not fully oxidized products in both cases which shows that the importance of this source is not easily erased...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} contribution to anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 is from electricity generation, i. e. emissions from large fossil fuelled power plants. Carbon Capture and Storage technologies offer the possibility for continued use of fossil fuels while almost eliminating the CO 2 emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising CO 2 capture technology which {{can be applied to}} electricity generation. Oxy-fuel combustion is currently being developed for power plants with pulverized coal combustion and for plants with circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion, the latter being the focus of this thesis. The large flexibility in heat extraction that CFB combustion offers through heat extraction possibilities within and outside the furnace enables combustion at low temperature (around 850 C) even at high inlet oxygen concentrations. This potential to operate at high O 2 inlet concentrations implies a possibility for a considerable reduction in the furnace dimensions. Furthermore, the high thermal capacity of the bed particles allows combustion with a relatively even temperature profile in the unit. Based on experimental data and previous modeling experience from air fired CFB combustion, this work develops modeling tools for assessing oxy-fuel CFB combustion across a wide range of operational conditions. Firstly, the additional requirements of oxy-fuel CFB boilers in comparison to air-fired CFB boilers are identified by means of modeling, closing the heat balance under different oxygen inlet concentrations for a 278 MWth CFB. Second, a <b>generic</b> model for <b>combustion,</b> valid for both air- and oxy-fired CFB combustion is proposed, including heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions and accounting for axial and lateral gas and solids mixing. The model results are compared with experimental data from two oxy-fuel-fired CFB units of 100 kW and 4 MW, yielding satisfactory results. Model simulations are carried out for a broad range of CFB-furnace operational conditions, investigating the progress of combustion using CO as an indicator. The model predicts that in the 278 MWth unit, heat extraction from the return leg is required at inlet O 2 concentrations above 29 % and the net external solids flux must increase when applying inlet O 2 concentrations beyond approximately 34 %. The model and experimental results imply that for similar inlet concentrations of O 2 (i. e. around 21 %) oxy-firing results in a higher CO peak concentration, as compared to the air-fired condition. In addition, the modeling shows that both the CO peak concentration and lateral gas mal-distribution increase with increasing O 2 inlet concentration...|$|R
40|$|Methane is a {{promising}} propellant for future liquid rocket engines. In the cooling channels of a regeneratively cooled engine, {{it would be}} close to the critical point. This results in drastic changes in the fluid properties, which makes cooling analysis a challenge. This thesis describes a two-pronged approach to tackle this problem. Simple and fast engineering tools allow for the development of insight in the design space using rapid iterations and parametric analyses. However, they are often rather inaccurate. In contrast, detailed multi-dimensional tools for numerical analysis are more accurate, but they require more computation time. Both approaches are developed for the analysis of regenerative cooling channels of oxygen/methane engines. Each approach uses complex but accurate models for the thermodynamic and transport properties of methane. OMECA (short for One-dimensional Methane Engine Cooling Analysis) is a one-dimensional tool that was developed in Python from scratch. This tool divides a nozzle into stations and analyses the one-dimensional thermal equilibrium at each station. It makes extensive use of semi-empirical equations to calculate the heat transfer at both the hot gas side and the coolant side. The tool is compared to a coupled multi-physics analysis tool, showing that the accuracy of the wall temperature is rather poor, with discrepancies of up to 150 ~K. Both at the hot gas and coolant side, large deviations are present. However, if the input heat flux is correct, OMECA predicts the coolant pressure drop and temperature rise with a 10 % accuracy. To obtain a higher accuracy at the coolant side, the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM is adapted for analysis of supercritical methane. Of particular note is the custom library that interpolates the fluid property tables at runtime. The selected solver is applicable to steady-state compressible flows. The software is then systematically validated using three validation cases. With experimental validation data obtained through cooperation with CIRA, an accuracy of 15 K for the wall temperature prediction is demonstrated. The pressure drop is predicted within 10 %. Traditionally, the launcher industry uses copper alloys as wall material in regeneratively cooled combustion chambers. They offer a high allowable temperature and high thermal conductivity, but are also heavy and expensive. Recently, several companies have demonstrated aluminium combustion chambers. Aluminium alloys have weight and cost advantages, but have lower allowable temperature and thermal conductivity. The developed tools for cooling analysis are therefore employed to compare aluminium and copper for a <b>generic</b> 10 ~kN <b>combustion</b> chamber. It is discovered that a thermal barrier coating must be employed to protect the hot gas side of an aluminium combustion chamber, otherwise regenerative cooling is not feasible. Even with such a coating, the pressure drop required to cool the coated aluminium chamber is three times higher than the pressure drop required for a copper chamber. A difference in pressure drop has effects on the vehicle level. A larger pressure drop in the cooling channel of a rocket engine necessitates a higher feed pressure. For a pressure fed engine, this means the tank must be stronger and heavier. It is found that even at modest fuel mass, the increase in tank mass is eight times as large as the decrease in engine mass offered by aluminium. This shows that using aluminium for the chamber wall is not advantageous with respect to copper for a pressure fed, regeneratively cooled, oxygen/methane rocket engine.

40|$|The {{modern world}} {{is based on}} an {{extensive}} transport network in which passenger vehicles play a major role. Although passenger vehicles have improved significantly in recent decades, they still contribute to the pollution of our environment and global warming. Consequently, new ways of reducing their emissions are needed. Moreover, most modern passenger vehicles are propelled by a combustion engine that operates on non-renewable fuels such as gasoline or diesel produced from crude oil. However, such fossil fuels are limited resources, so there is also a need to reduce the fuel consumption of passenger vehicles. As such, improvements in engine technology will {{play a central role in}} the development of more efficient and cleaner passenger vehicles. In recent years, alternatives to the internal combustion engine such as electric motors and fuel cells have attracted increasing attention. While these technologies are undergoing rapid development and electric vehicles in particular are gaining market share, the combustion engine remains the dominant power source for passenger vehicles. The most common type of combustion engine used in passenger vehicles is the gasoline engine. Several advanced combustion concepts have been developed to make gasoline engines cleaner and more efficient. One such concept is stratified combustion, which is discussed in this thesis. In gasoline engines, stratified combustion increases fuel efficiency. However, it also tends to produce high particulate emissions and can reduce combustion stability. These problems mainly occur because stratified combustion involves a complex mixing process that generates a heterogeneous air/fuel mixture with both rich and lean regions. This thesis describes work undertaken to minimize or eliminate these drawbacks, particularly the increased particulate emissions, while maintaining low fuel consumption. Most of the studies presented herein were performed with metal and optical single-cylinder engines, but a four-cylinder production engine was also used in some cases. Tests were performed in steady state mode at various engine operating points. All engines utilized in the studies were fitted with a Spray-Guided Direct-Injected (SGDI) system and multi-hole solenoid-actuated fuel injectors. Depending on scope of the study, the engines were equipped with different measurement devices such as instruments for measuring pressures and temperatures or emissions of HC, NOx, CO, CO 2, O 2 and particulates (both mass and number). The results obtained during this thesis work have been presented in five publications. The first of these publications describes a study on the relationship between particulate emissions during stratified combustion and <b>generic</b> <b>combustion</b> variables such as the fuel injection pressure, as well as injection and ignition timings. This was done to identify variables that could be manipulated to reduce particulate emissions. The later publications describe how measured particulate emissions are affected by forced induction, increased fuel injection pressure, the use of novel ignition systems, air movements, and the use of different sampling systems. Key objectives of these studies were to find ways of reducing particulate emissions and increasing combustion stability. It was found that stratified combustion in SGDI gasoline-fueled engines fitted with a solenoid multi-hole injector can increase fuel efficiency but does not alleviate the problem of high particulate emissions. In addition, a positive correlation between the extent of non-premixed flames and particulate mass and number emissions was identified. The use of novel ignition systems was shown to expand the ignition window, while boosting and increasing the fuel injection pressure were found to reduce soot levels. Finally, the internal relationship between the ignition and injection timings was found to strongly affect combustion stability and soot levels, primarily because it influenced the dilution of the air-fuel mixture and the risk of the fuel spray striking the piston top. The thesis concludes with some suggestions for ways of improving stratified combustion and directions for future research...|$|E
