50|$|HomePlug {{devices are}} not {{compatible}} with certain power strips, surge protectors, and uninterruptible power supplies incorporating filters, which block the high-frequency signal. In such cases, the installer must plug devices directly into building <b>electrical</b> <b>receptacles.</b> If a spare power {{point is not}} available, a double adapter {{can be used in}} many cases with the incompatible device {{on one side and the}} HomePlug device on the other.|$|R
5000|$|A {{building}} code {{example is the}} use of ungrounded ("2-prong") <b>electrical</b> <b>receptacles.</b> Over time, these older devices were deprecated in favor of the safer grounded ("3-prong") receptacles. The obsolete ungrounded receptacles were still permitted by [...] "grandfathering" [...] in existing electrical wiring, but became prohibited from new installations. Ungrounded receptacles are still available for legal purchase, but are intended solely for repairs to existing older electrical installations.|$|R

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} <b>electrical</b> <b>receptacle</b> or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors. Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit breakers as switching elements.|$|R
50|$|The {{picture to}} the right shows the {{interior}} of a standard residential service, North American General Electric style breaker panel. The three power wires - two hot and one neutral - can be seen coming in at the top. The neutral wire is connected to the neutral busbar to the left with all the white wires, and the other two are the hot wires attached to the main breaker. Below it are the two rows of circuit breakers with the circuits' red and black hot wires leading off. Three wires (hot black, neutral white, and bare ground) can be seen directly exiting the box and running to a NEMA 5-15 <b>electrical</b> <b>receptacle</b> with a power cord plugged into it. The incoming bare stranded ground wire can be seen {{near the bottom of the}} neutral bus bar.|$|R
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and <b>electrical</b> <b>receptacle,</b> all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer housing}} of the FOEP is a pressure-tight {{canister}} 181⁄16 inches (458.8 mm) {{in diameter and}} 18½ inches (470 mm) long. The bottom closure and removable top lid are both slightly domed to prevent implosion should pressure reversals be encountered. The inner assembly structure is fastened to a support ring approximately 6 inches {{from the bottom of}} the canister and consists of upper and lower bulkheads joined by a cylinder. Cutouts in the cylinder permit access to the centrifuge, which houses the frogs. Near the top of the canister are two <b>electrical</b> feed-through <b>receptacles</b> for the power supply and data line.|$|R

2500|$|An early American <b>electrical</b> {{plug and}} <b>receptacle</b> {{was invented by}} Harvey Hubbell and {{patented}} in 1904. Hubbell's first design was a receptacle which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs), but with a separable plug with pins or blades (...) [...] The 1906 Hubbell catalog shows this plug with a flush mounting receptacle for use in wall or floor. Other manufacturers adopted the Hubbell pattern, and by 1915 they were widespread. [...] In 1913, Hubbell patented a parallel blade plug (...) [...] In 1916, Hubbell received a further patent for a polarized version of the parallel blade plug where one blade was both longer and wider than the other (...) [...] In the modern polarized version of NEMA 1-15, both blades are the same length, and only the width varies.|$|R
