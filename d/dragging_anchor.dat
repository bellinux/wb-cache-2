Most existing judgement methods depend on distinguishing feature of dragging vessel from normal anchoring, so vessels usually have moved a certain distance when duty officers find <b>anchor</b> <b>dragging.</b> Thus it is necessary to develop a practical <b>anchor</b> <b>dragging</b> early warning techonology. Based on the special change of anchor cables. Vibration frequency while <b>anchor</b> <b>dragging,</b> a new <b>anchor</b> <b>dragging</b> early warning system(ADEWS) was designed. The system was composed of two main facilities: acceleration sensor and teminal unit. The acceleration sensor was fixed on anchor cables to monitor its vibration frequency, and the teminal unit in the bridge was designed to analyze change characteristic of frequency and release early warnning. For facilitis of this new ADEWS is simple, it is easy to be equipped on vessels. Furthermore, the system can automatically analyze vibration frequency and release early warning, so it has advantages of high feasibility and reliability. These advantages can lessen duty officers work burden and reduce the dependece on duty officers individual experience. Therefore, ADEWS based on Vibration frequency analysis possesses a good application prospect in practical engineering...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe world’s energy {{resources}} on land are getting depleted, and mush attention {{is given to}} the development of offshore fields. Over the past years, new reserves located offshore have been regularly discovered. Once the hydrocarbons have been extracted, it is necessary then to transport them to the storage places, refineries or gas processing plants, and to deliver to the consumers. There are several ways of hydrocarbon transportation. One of the most cost-effective and popular means of oil and gas transportation is pipelines. Construction and operation of subsea pipelines are known to be very hazardous and risky processes. In order to ensure reliable and safe operation of submarine lines, it is essential to design them according to the international standards and codes. However, observance of rules sometimes does not guarantee safe pipeline operation. Some undesirable events can occur from time to rime. One of such events is <b>dragging</b> <b>anchor</b> incident, which poses great threat to the subsea lines. The consequences of this incident may be huge, involving environmental pollution, asset losses and even fatality. The mitigation of these outcomes becomes problematic, expensive and impossible. That is why it is recommended to carry out relevant investigations before the mitigation measures are planned and implemented. This work is mainly focused on the anchor damage assessment of subsea pipelines. The comprehensive discussion on a PARLOC 2001 database is done in order to determine major pipeline incidents, their causes and consequences. The questions regarding pipe-anchor interaction scenario have been studied a lot. It has been found that the extent of pipeline damage is heavily dependent on its unique properties. In addition, not only the pipeline data, but also a combination of vessel characteristics and anchoring equipment parameters has been very useful for the analyses. Based on the results of AIS ship traffic data processing, main pipe damage criteria checks have been performed. The findings indicate that not all the anchors have potential of hooking and approaching the pipeline resting on the seafloor. Key parameters here are anchor class (size), chain length, ship speed and water depth. Moreover, the geometrical configuration of all the anchors has been taken into account as well. Not only a theoretical approach, but a model scale test has been carried out {{in order to understand the}} variation of anchor towing depth with different ship velocities. The comparison of analytical solution results with the experimental results is also included in this thesis. Anchor pulling consequences are established in accordance with the global scale analyses performed in the FE program SIMLA for a certain number of sensitivity cases for both small (16 -inch) and large (40 -inch) diameter pipelines. The pipelines responses have been determined, and their cross-sectional capacities have been checked. In addition, pipelines failure frequencies have been estimated. This work shows how critical it is to have detailed ship and equipment class data for doing pipeline integrity assessment. In accordance with the results obtained, the <b>dragging</b> <b>anchor</b> interference assessment methodology is developed...|$|E
40|$|Master thesis in Offshore technologyThe {{combination}} {{of oil and}} gas reservoirs in sea areas with high shipping traffic brings some challenges for engineers. One of these challenges is related to subsea pipeline systems specially where water depth is classified as shallow or intermediate. Due to large number of vessels passing the area with shallow water depth, interaction between anchors of these vessels and the offshore pipeline can occur. If a <b>dragging</b> <b>anchor</b> hits and subsequently hooks the pipeline, the pipeline could be ruptured. When an offshore pipeline ruptures while it is in operational mode, the operation must be stopped immediately and a repair team has to repair the pipeline system as quick as possible. On the key steps for repairing the pipeline is to remove and replace damaged length of the pipeline. Hence evaluation of the damage length is important. In this project, the response of a ruptured pipeline by an anchor load was studied to predict and define the damaged length. In order to solve the problem, the solution method is split in three parts. In first step, the flow condition of hydrocarbons inside the pipeline as well the fluid interaction with the pipeline is calculated using one dimensional pipe flow software OLGA. During the second step, the mechanical response of the pipeline to load applied by the caught anchor is determined. The reaction of the pipeline from the moment after impact until rupture is studied using finite element analysis. ANSYS Workbench 14 software is used in this step. The third step determines the deformation of the subsea pipeline after rupture. A jet of released hydrocarbons will lead to a thrust force on the ruptured cross‐section. This force causes the ruptured pipeline to buckle. Purpose of this part is to identify where local buckling occurs and whether the pipeline collapses due to buckling or not. If the pipeline fails at buckled region, pipe’s sections from the buckled pipe’s cross‐section to ruptured pipe’s cross‐section have to be cut. This step is also done with finite element analysis using the ANSYS software. In this project a pipe section with length of 3000 m and outer diameter of 42 ’’ is modelled in ANSYS. Obtained results show that the displacement of the pipeline before rupture is already severe. According to the results, after rupture, the result is thrust force leads to either sides of the ruptured pipeline to buckle and fail at two regions. Hence, repair team has to cut the pipeline from the buckled pipe’s crosssections. The thrust force from the escaping fluid jet leads to additional length of pipe to be cut...|$|E
40|$|An {{ever-increasing}} {{number of}} cables and pipelines are being {{laid on the}} bottom of lakes, channels, rivers, seas, and oceans. Various hazards threaten these pipelines and cables, which in case of occurrence can cause (severe) environmental and/or economic damage. Pipelines and cables can be protected against these attacks by dumping protective rock layers over the pipelines or cables. The main hazard concerning this research is the attack of a <b>dragging</b> <b>anchor</b> preceded by the cutting process of the anchor chain while dragged over / through the rock cover. For dragging anchors the effect of any lifting force is detrimental to its holding capacity. A good design of the rock cover can reduce the cutting of an anchor chain in the rock cover, resulting in an earlier lifting of the anchor. No generally applicable design tool exists for dimensioning these rock covers and especially in relation to anchor chains. Therefore the objective is set to find and test a theoretically based relation for the interaction between an anchor chain and a protective rock layer. The simplified solutions for describing the interaction between an anchor chain and clay are used as a basis for the interaction between the chain and rocks. The interaction forces are described as uniformly distributed forces in parallel and lateral directions of the anchor chain. There are several types of rock covers feasible but the loosely dumped rock cover on top of the existing seabed is chosen for this research. The bearing capacity of the rock berm is modelled as the bearing capacity of a strip footing on a shallow foundation. Since the bearing capacity equations do not provide information of loads in the lateral direction to the strip footing the formulas are adjusted to the research situation. A theoretical model with dimensionless normalized axis is used. The model describes a failure curve with all possible combinations of parallel and lateral forces applied to the rock berm by the anchor chain and normalised by the bearing capacity of the rock berm. A physical model has been designed to validate the theoretical model. In the physical model five different anchor chains have been dragged through three different sizes of rock covers with a few different constant anchor holding capacities. The forces {{on both sides of the}} rock cover are indirectly measured by the load cells on both sides of the model. The guiding wheels in the model cause significant friction in the model during dragging. In experiments without the presence of a rock cover a friction factor is determined to quantify the force loss over a guiding wheel. This friction factor lies within a range of 0. 10 <friction factor< 0. 16. It turned out that this friction factor has a major influence on every single data point when plotted in the theoretical model plot. However correlation is found between the data sets acquired by the experiments and the normalized failure curve presented above with the use of a semi-arbitrarily determined friction factor for each experiment. The semi-arbitrarily friction factor lies within the range specified above and is only changed when structural modifications to the model are made. The bearing capacity of the rock berm, which is mainly influenced by the effective width of the anchor chain and the internal friction angle of the rocks, only determines the location of the acquired data in the theoretical model plot. Different bearing capacities scale the dataset into the origin. Because of the uncertainty of the exact bearing capacity of the rock cover research on this subject is recommended. With the bearing capacity known the location of the acquired dataset on the theoretical normal plot can be determined. It is also recommended to do new physical model tests in which the forces on both sides of the rock berm can be directly measured eliminating the effect of friction in guiding wheels.
