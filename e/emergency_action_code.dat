50|$|The <b>Emergency</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Code</b> (EAC) is a three {{character}} code displayed on all dangerous goods classed carriers, {{and provides a}} quick assessment to first responders and emergency responders (i.e. fire fighters and police) of what actions to take should the carrier carrying such goods become involved in an incident (traffic collision, for example). EAC's are characterised by a single number (1 to 4) and either one or two letters (depending on the hazard).|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} of a {{chemical}} incident, the EAC may specify that an evacuation may be necessary as the chemical poses a public hazard which may extend beyond the immediate vicinity. If evacuation is not possible, advice to stay in doors and secure all points of ventilation may be necessary. This condition is denoted by an E at the end of any <b>emergency</b> <b>action</b> <b>code.</b> It is an optional letter, depending {{on the nature of the}} chemical.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom (and also Australia, Malaysia, and New Zealand) use the Hazchem {{warning plate}} system which carries {{information}} on how an emergency service should deal with an incident. The Dangerous Goods <b>Emergency</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Code</b> List (EAC) lists dangerous goods; it is reviewed every two years and is an essential compliance document for all emergency services, local government {{and for those who}} may control the planning for, and prevention of, emergencies involving dangerous goods. The latest 2015 version is available from the National Chemical Emergency Centre (NCEC) website.|$|E

50|$|Hazchem is {{a warning}} plate system used in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for {{vehicles}} transporting hazardous substances, and on storage facilities. The top-left section of the plate gives the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Code</b> (EAC) telling the fire brigade what actions to take if there's an accident. The middle-left section gives the UN Substance Identification Number describing the chemical. The lower-left section gives the telephone number that should be called if special advice is needed. The warning symbol at top-right indicates what danger the chemical presents. The bottom-right of the plate carries a company logo (the flower is a sample logo).|$|E
50|$|NCEC was {{commissioned}} by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) to edit the EAC List 2013 publication, outlining the application of Hazchem Emergency Actions Codes (EACs) in Britain for 2013. The Dangerous Goods <b>Emergency</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Code</b> (EAC) List is reviewed every two years and is an essential compliance document for all emergency services, local government {{and for those who}} may control the planning for, and prevention of, emergencies involving dangerous goods. The current EAC List is 20013. NCEC has been {{at the heart of the}} UK EAC system since its inception in the early 1970s, publishing the list on behalf of the UK Government until 1996 and resuming its management in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Protection {{is divided}} up into three {{categories}} of personal protective equipment, Full, BA and BA for fire only. Full denotes that full personal protective equipment provisions must be used around and {{in contact with the}} chemical, which will usually include a portable breathing apparatus and water tight and chemical proof suit. BA (acronym for breathing apparatus) specifies that a portable breathing apparatus must be used at all times in and around the chemical, and BA for fire only specifies that a breathing apparatus is not necessary for short exposure periods to the chemical but is required if the chemical is on alight. BA for fire only is denoted within the <b>emergency</b> <b>action</b> <b>code</b> as a white letter on a black background, while a black letter on a white background denotes breathing apparatus at all times. When changing the background colour is not possible (such as with handwriting), the use of brackets means the same as a black background. [...] "3YE" [...] means the same as a white letter on a black background.|$|E

40|$|Part-I of this two-part paper {{develops}} {{an optimal}} algorithm for transient stability control to coordinate preventive <b>actions</b> and <b>emergency</b> <b>actions</b> for {{a subset of}} contingencies with the same unstable mode. In this part, the cases of several subsets of contingencies with different unstable modes are dealt with. Some preventive actions benefiting a subset of contingencies may go against the stability of others; thus coordination among the optimal schemes for individual subsets is necessary. The coordination is achieved by properly replacing preventive <b>actions</b> with <b>emergency</b> <b>actions</b> for some individual subsets. It is formulated as a classical model of economic dispatch with additional generating costs due to the <b>emergency</b> <b>actions.</b> Such an optimal algorithm is proposed based on the algorithm in the Part-I and verified by simulations on a Chinese power system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) {{finds that}} <b>emergency</b> <b>action,</b> under the {{authority}} of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), is necessary to revise the fishing year (FY) 2010 catch limits for pollock, managed by the Northeast (NE) Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The principal goal of this <b>emergency</b> <b>action</b> is to respond to recent scientific information. Information resulting from a benchmark stock assessment for pollock (SAW 50 Pollock Assessment, June 2010) indicates that the pollock stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring and, therefore, the FMP should be revised in order to incorporate and respond to such information. This Environmental Assessment (EA) analyzes the environmental impacts of an <b>emergency</b> <b>action,</b> which compares alternatives, as required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to quickly respond to this recent scientific information until such time that the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) can incorporate the new information into the FMP.

40|$|Objects are {{reminiscent}} of actions often performed with them: knife and apple remind us on peeling the apple or cutting it. Mnemonic representations of object-related <b>actions</b> (<b>action</b> <b>codes)</b> evoked {{by the sight of}} an object may constrain and hence facilitate recognition of unrolling actions. The present fMRI study investigated if and how <b>action</b> <b>codes</b> influence brain activation during action observation. The average number of <b>action</b> <b>codes</b> (NAC) of 51 sets of objects was rated by a group of n = 24 participants. In an fMRI study, different volunteers were asked to recognize actions performed with the same objects presented in short videos. To disentangle areas reflecting the storage of <b>action</b> <b>codes</b> from those exploiting them, we showed object-compatible and object-incompatible (pantomime) actions. Areas storing <b>action</b> <b>codes</b> were considered to positively co-vary with NAC in both object-compatible and object-incompatible action; due to its role in tool-related tasks, we here hypothesized left anterior inferior parietal cortex (aIPL). In contrast, areas exploiting <b>action</b> <b>codes</b> were expected to show this correlation only in object-compatible but not incompatible action, as only object-compatible actions match one of the active <b>action</b> <b>codes.</b> For this interaction, we hypothesized ventrolateral premotor cortex (PMv) to join aIPL due to its role in biasing competition in IPL. We found left anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) to co-vary with NAC. In addition to these areas, <b>action</b> <b>codes</b> increased activity in object-compatible action in bilateral PMv, right IPS, and lateral occipital cortex (LO). Findings suggest that during action observation, the brain derives possible actions from perceived objects, and uses this information to shape action recognition. In particular, the number of expectable actions quantifies the activity level at PMv, IPL, and pMTG, but only PMv reflects their biased competition while observed action unfolds. © 2014 Schubotz, Wurm, Wittmann and von Cramon...|$|R
