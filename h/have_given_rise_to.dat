Fifteen parameters have been scored for each population to {{understand the relationship between}} different races. The main objective is to trace phylogeny in populations of U. indica to construct phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree obtained is an unrooted tree. The parsimony tree describes that Shimoga and Chamundi hill populations have parallely evolved and forms the out group. Dopaegowdanapura population <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Gopalaswamy betta, Gopalaswamy betta <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Banganavadi and Banganavadi <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> one population which is missing in the tree and the missing population <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Gorur on one hand and to Krishna Raja Sagar island and Gandhi Krishi Vighnayana Kendra on the other hand. Krishna Raja Sagar island and Gandhi Krishi Vighnayana Kendra shares a common clade.

The Parsimony tree shows that these populations have evolved parallel. Dopaegowdanapura is the oldest from which all others are evolved. Ranganathittu and Basavanahalli form the youngest and latest. Therefore it is an unrooted tree with distance. Each population varied in their morphology and chromosome number and called as cytotypes. Difference in morphological character is mainly because of genetic characters. Habitat does not seem to play major role to mould morphological features...|$|R

5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.|$|E

Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The Hetumoger {{confederation}} was {{strengthened by}} the arrival of the Kabars, who (according to Constantine) joined the Hungarians following their unsuccessful riot against the Khazar Khaganate. The Hungarians and the Kabars are mentioned in the longer version of the Annals of Salzburg, which relates that the Hungarians fought around Vienna, while the Kabars fought nearby at Culmite in 881. Madgearu proposes that Kavar groups were already settled in the Tisza plain within the Carpathian Basin around 881, which may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the anachronistic reference to Cumans in the Gesta Hungarorum {{at the time of the}} Hungarian conquest.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a new {{variety of}} steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure {{to produce a}} formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses {{a specific type of}} strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E

5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{many types}} of tiling puzzle, from {{traditional}} jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the rep-tile, a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. Inspired by Gardner's articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. Squaring the square {{is the problem of}} tiling an integral square (one whose sides have integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is squaring the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.|$|E
5|$|The diverse ethno-linguistic {{groups of}} Tripura <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a {{composite}} culture. The dominant ethnic groups are Bengali, Tripuri (Debbarma, Tripura, Jamatia, Reang, Noatia, Koloi, Murasing, Chakma, Halam, Garo, Kuki, Mizo, Uchoi, Dhamai, Roaza, Mogh, Manipuri, and other tribal {{groups such as}} Munda, Oraon and Santhal who migrated in Tripura as a tea labourers. Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main indigenous, non-Tripura culture. Indeed, many elite tribal families which reside in towns have actively embraced Bengali culture and language in the past, but in today's generation more Tripuris are embracing their culture. The Tripuri kings were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; Bengali language was {{the language of the}} court. Elements of Bengali culture, such as Bengali literature, Bengali music, and Bengali cuisine are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar. All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56mya). Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess. A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochromeb gene {{and the presence of}} the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups. Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65mya according to molecular studies, although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55mya for this divergence. However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.|$|E
