Four types of laws applicable to closing valve, namely, instantaneous, linear, concave, and convex laws, are considered. These closure laws describe the speed variation of the <b>hydrogen-natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> as the valve is closing. The numerical solution is obtained using the reduced order modelling technique. The results show that changes in the pressure wave profile and amplitude depend {{on the type of}} closing laws, valve closure times, and the number of polygonal segments in the closing function. The pressure wave profile varies from square to triangular and trapezoidal shape {{depending on the type of}} closing laws, while the amplitude of pressure waves reduces as the closing time is reduced and the numbers of polygonal segments are increased. The instantaneous and convex closing laws give rise to minimum and maximum pressure, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The 'Freedom Car' Initiative {{announced}} by the Bush Administration has placed a significant emphasis on development of a hydrogen economy in the United States. While the hydrogen-fueled fuel-cell vehicle that {{is the focus of}} the 'Freedom Car' program would rely on electrochemical energy conversion, and despite the large amount of resources being devoted to its objectives, near-term implementation of hydrogen in the transportation sector is not likely to arise from fuel cell cars. Instead, fuel blending and ''hydrogen-assisted'' combustion are more realizable pathways for wide-scale hydrogen utilization within the next ten years. Thus, a large potential avenue for utilization of hydrogen in transportation applications is through blending with natural gas, since there is an existing market for natural-gas vehicles of various classes, and since hydrogen can provide a means of achieving even stricter emissions standards. Another potential avenue is through use of hydrogen to 'assist' diesel combustion to permit alternate combustion strategies that can achieve lower emissions and higher efficiency. This project focused on developing the underlying fundamental information to support technologies that will facilitate the introduction of coal-derived hydrogen into the market. Two paths were envisioned for hydrogen utilization in transportation applications. One is for hydrogen to be mixed with other fuels, specifically natural gas, to enhance performance in existing natural gas-fueled vehicles (e. g., transit buses) and provide a practical and marketable avenue to begin using hydrogen in the field. A second is to use hydrogen to enable alternative combustion modes in existing diesel engines, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition, to permit enhanced efficiency and reduced emissions. Thus, this project on hydrogen-assisted combustion encompassed two major objectives: (1) Optimization of <b>hydrogen-natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> composition and utilization through laboratory studies of spark-ignition engine operation on H{sub 2 }-NG and numerical simulation of the impact of hydrogen blending on the physical and chemical processes within the engine; and (2) Examination of hydrogen-assisted combustion in advanced compression-ignition engine processes. To that end, numerical capabilities were applied to the study of hydrogen assisted combustion and experimental facilities were developed to achieve the project objectives...|$|E
40|$|Energy storage {{technology}} {{is needed for}} the storage of surplus baseload generation and the storage of intermittent wind power, because it can increase the flexibility of power grid operations. Underground storage of hydrogen with natural gas (UHNG) is proposed as a new energy storage technology, {{to be considered for}} utility-scale energy storage applications. UHNG is a composite technology: using electrolyzers to convert electrical energy to chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. The latter is then injected along with natural gas into existing gas distribution and storage facilities. The energy stored as hydrogen is recovered as needed; as hydrogen for industrial and transportation applications, as electricity to serve power demand, or as hydrogen-enriched natural gas to serve gas demand. The storage of electrical energy in gaseous form is also termed “Power to Gas”. Such large scale electrical energy storage is desirable to baseload generators operators, renewable energy-based generator operators, independent system operators, and natural gas distribution utilities. Due to the low density of hydrogen, the <b>hydrogen-natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> thus formed has lower volumetric energy content than conventional natural gas. But, compared to the combustion of conventional natural gas, to provide the same amount of energy, the hydrogen-enriched mixture emits less carbon dioxide. This thesis investigates the dynamic behaviour, financial and environmental performance of UHNG through scenario-based simulation. A proposed energy hub embodying the UHNG principle, located in Southwestern Ontario, is modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Then, the performance of UHNG for four different scenarios are assessed: injection of hydrogen for long term energy storage, surplus baseload generation load shifting, wind power integration and supplying large hydrogen demand. For each scenario, the configuration of the energy hub, its scale of operation and operating strategy are selected to match the application involved. All four scenarios are compared to the base case scenario, which simulates the operations of a conventional underground gas storage facility. For all scenarios in which hydrogen production and storage is not prioritized, the concentration of hydrogen in the storage reservoir is shown to remain lower than 7 % for {{the first three years of}} operation. The simulation results also suggest that, of the five scenarios, hydrogen injection followed by recovery of hydrogen-enriched natural gas is the most likely energy recovery pathway in the near future. For this particular scenario, it was also found that it is not profitable to sell the hydrogen-enriched natural gas at the same price as regular natural gas. For the range of scenarios evaluated, a list of benchmark parameters has been established for the UHNG technology. With a roundtrip efficiency of 39 %, rated capacity ranging from 25, 000 MWh to 582, 000 MWh and rated power from 1 to 100 MW, UHNG is an energy storage technology suitable for large storage capacity, low to medium power rating storage applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} {{the framework of}} a mathematical formulation for modelling and evaluating natural gas pipeline networks under hydrogen injection. The model development is based on gas transport through pipelines and compressors which compensate for the pressure drops by implying mainly the mass and momentum balances on the basic elements of the network. The model was initially implemented for natural gas transport and the principle of extension for <b>hydrogen–natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> is presented. The optimization procedure has been formulated by means of a nonlinear technique within the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) environment. This work deals with the adaptation of the current transmission networks of natural gas to the transport of <b>hydrogen–natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The objective function is the amount of hydrogen for a given transmission power. Typical quantitative results are presented, showing that the maximum fraction of hydrogen that can be added to natural gas is around 6 mass percent for the studied example. According to this study, an adaptation of the current networks of transmission of natural gas to the transport of hydrogen seems to be possible with low contents of hydrogen. This paper shows that the design of large new hydrogen infrastructures can be seen as more challenging and is expected to necessitate substantial additional effort to attain wide deployment under safety conditions...|$|R

Waiting for the cutting-edge appliances (i. e.

This paper deals {{with the results of}} an experimental campaign carried out on a Single Cylinder ICE, fuelled with NG (natural gas) and H 2 NG @ 15 % vol. In detail, energy performances were assessed at rated and partial loads. From data analysis, it emerged that the electrical efficiency increased up to 2. 28 %, {{at the expense of the}} heat recovery one, having added hydrogen. Additionally, due to the higher water content in exhaust gas when H 2 NG is burned, it was investigated on how heat recovery efficiency has been affected by condensing operating conditions. Finally, to estimate this benefit, an expeditious procedure was developed building three maps for H 2 NG blends condensing properties from 0 % up to 30 % vol. of H 2. Their outputs provided the condensation efficiency value and the absolute gain of heat recovery one with varying exhaust gas temperatures and hydrogen fraction in the mixture...|$|R

The mixture ratio between a base gas of N 2 or CO 2 and the additive PFC gas was fixed as 9 : 1; namely, 90 %N 2 / 10 %PFC or 90 %CO 2 / 10 %PFC <b>gas</b> <b>mixture.</b> The PFC <b>gases</b> have even smaller {{global warming potential}} (GWP) than SF 6 gas and have good insulation properties as SF 6 gas. Thus, PFC <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> {{is expected to be}} a SF 6 substitute without highly pressurizing the gas over the conventional pressure of 0. 5 to 0. 6 MPa. In this study, in order to compare the partial discharge (PD) inception voltage VPD and breakdown voltage VB properties between N 2 and CO 2 -based <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures,</b> as well as between the additive gas of PFC and SF 6 gas, we investigated these properties of the <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> with a needle to plane electrode under ac high voltage application.
