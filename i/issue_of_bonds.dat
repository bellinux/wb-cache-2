500|$|Under the memorandum, $706million {{from the}} {{high-speed}} rail bond would be matched by state, regional, and local transportation {{funds to pay}} for the estimated $1.5billion needed for CalMod. However, since the bonds had not yet been issued, the money was not available, and a prior environmental impact report that had been issued for electrification in 2009 needed to be reissued before construction could start. In September 2012, the California Transportation Commission released $39.8million to modernize CBOSS. A month later, the expected funding from high-speed rail bonds rose to $1.5billion, which alongside electrification provided funding for the planned Downtown Extension (DTX), which would move the northern terminus of the Caltrain line from 4th and King to the Transbay Transit Center. CHSRA approved the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> in December 2016.

2500|$|Bonds {{are issued}} by public authorities, credit institutions, {{companies}} and supranational {{institutions in the}} primary markets. The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a syndicate, buy the entire <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes {{the risk of being}} unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by bookrunners who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the tombstone ads commonly used to announce bonds to the public. [...] The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.|$|E
60|$|The German counter-proposals were {{somewhat}} obscure, and also rather disingenuous. It {{will be remembered}} that those clauses of the Reparation Chapter which dealt with the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> by Germany produced on the public mind {{the impression that the}} Indemnity had been fixed at $25,000,000,000, or at any rate at this figure as a minimum. The German Delegation set out, therefore, to construct their reply {{on the basis of this}} figure, assuming apparently that public opinion in Allied countries would not be satisfied with less than the appearance of $25,000,000,000; and, as they were not really prepared to offer so large a figure, they exercised their ingenuity to produce a formula which might be represented to Allied opinion as yielding this amount, whilst really representing a much more modest sum. The formula produced was transparent to any one who read it carefully and knew the facts, and it could hardly have been expected by its authors to deceive the Allied negotiators. The German tactic assumed, therefore, that the latter were secretly as anxious as the Germans themselves to arrive at a settlement which bore some relation to the facts, and that they would therefore be willing, in view of the entanglements which they had got themselves into with their own publics, to practise a little collusion in drafting the Treaty,--a supposition which in slightly different circumstances might have had a good deal of foundation. As matters actually were, this subtlety did not benefit them, and they would have done much better with a straightforward and candid estimate of what they believed to be the amount of their liabilities on the one hand, and their capacity to pay on the other.|$|E

Bonds representing payments in excess of $15,000,000,000 {{are not to be}} issued until the Commission is satisfied that Germany can meet the interest on them. But {{this does not mean that}} interest is remitted in the meantime. As from May 1, 1921, interest is to be debited to Germany on such part of her outstanding debt as has not been covered by payment in cash or kind or by the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> as above,[114] and [...] "the rate of interest shall be 5 per cent unless the Commission shall determine at some future time that circumstances justify a variation of this rate." [...] That is to say, the capital sum of indebtedness is rolling up all the time at compound interest. The effect of this provision towards increasing the burden is, on the assumption that Germany cannot pay very large sums at first, enormous. At 5 per cent compound interest a capital sum doubles itself in fifteen years. On the assumption that Germany cannot pay more than $750,000,000 annually until 1936 (i.e. 5 per cent interest on $15,000,000,000) the $25,000,000,000 on which interest is deferred will have risen to $50,000,000,000, carrying an annual interest charge of $2,500,000,000. That is to say, even if Germany pays $750,000,000 annually up to 1936, she will nevertheless owe us at that date more than half as much again as she does now ($65,000,000,000 as compared with $40,000,000,000). From 1936 onwards she will have to pay to us $3,250,000,000 annually in order to keep pace with the interest alone. At the end of any year in which she pays less than this sum she will owe more than she did at the beginning of it. And if she is to discharge the capital sum in thirty years from 1930, i.e. in forty-eight years from the Armistice, she must pay an additional $650,000,000 annually, making $3,900,000,000 in all.[115] ...|$|E

50|$|The {{investment}} banker Michael Milken realized that fallen angels had regularly been valued {{less than what}} they were worth.

Speculative grade bonds thus became ubiquitous in the 1980s as a financing mechanism in mergers and acquisitions.

50|$|Often {{a company}} {{acquiring}} another pays a specified amount for it. This {{money can be}} raised {{in a number of}} ways. Although the company may have sufficient funds available in its account, remitting payment entirely from the acquiring company's cash on hand is unusual. More often, it will be borrowed from a bank, or raised by an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds.</b> Acquisitions financed through debt are known as leveraged buyouts, and the debt will often be moved down onto the balance sheet of the acquired company. The acquired company then has to pay back the debt. This is a technique often used by private equity companies. The debt ratio of financing can go as high as 80% in some cases. In such a case, the acquiring company would only need to raise 20% of the purchase price.|$|E
