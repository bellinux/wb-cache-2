40|$|AbstractMany {{standard}} weirs in Fayoum district (Egypt) {{have been}} perforated by 1, 2 or 3 pipes, to convey much {{water in the}} downstream direction. Measurements of discharge with these structures are complicated due to existence of the openings. In this research, an experimental study was carried out to investigate the flow over clear over <b>fall</b> <b>weir</b> with bottom circular opening. Nine weir models with different heights were tested in a horizontal laboratory flume. Three weir heights were used with each one, three pipes with different diameters were tested. The results of the flow over the weir with a circular opening were {{compared with those of}} the weir without an opening having the same dimensions. It was found that there is a large difference between them. Multiple regression equations based on energy principal and dimensional analysis theory were developed for computing the discharge over clear over <b>fall</b> <b>weir</b> with a bottom opening...|$|R

5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the clinostat for simulating microgravity is the <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> machine (FFM). Small samples (such as cell suspensions) are allowed to <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> under gravity for about a metre, with the period of <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> lasting just under a second. They are then pushed {{back to the top}} of the apparatus by a briefly applied large force (c. 20 g for 20 ms - the [...] "bounce"), and allowed to fall again, and so on. The principle of the machine is that most of the time is spent in zero g <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> The periods spent under high g are assumed to be too short to be detected by the physiological mechanism of the biological samples, which consequently only perceive the time spent in <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b>|$|R

40|$|In Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) {{there are}} 3 Diverse Safety Rods (DSR) in {{addition}} to normal control rods {{to shut down the}} reactor. During a reactor SCRAM, electromagnet holding the DSR gets de-energized and DSR falls under gravity into the reactor core {{and at the end of}} the <b>free</b> <b>fall,</b> it is decelerated by a sodium dashpot and it is brought to rest. Development of a system for measuring <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> time and total travel time of DSR using acoustic technique is in progress. The <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> time is the time elapsed between the instant at which the electromagnet de-energizes and the instant at which dashpot action initiated. At the end of <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> DSR hit top end of the dashpot and will generate a shock signal. Similarly at the end of braking (deceleration) time another shock pulse is generated.

5000|$|The force {{known as}} [...] "weight" [...] is {{proportional}} to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> For example, when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in <b>free</b> <b>fall),</b> it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or {{the surface of a}} planetary body such as the Earth or the Moon. This force keeps the object from going into <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances, and is thus determined by the acceleration of <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> On the surface of the Earth, for example, an object with a mass of 50 kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into <b>free</b> <b>fall.</b> By contrast, {{on the surface of the}} Moon, the same object still has a mass of 50 kilograms but weighs only 81.5 newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a <b>free</b> <b>fall</b> on the moon. Restated in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight W of an object is related to its mass m by W = mg, where g = [...] is the acceleration due to Earth's gravitational field, (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object).|$|R
