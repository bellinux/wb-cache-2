5000|$|Decline: 1890s. As {{snapshot}} {{and personal}} photography became commonplace among the public, {{the popularity of}} the cabinet card and cabinet card specific albums waned.

After 1900, card photographs generally had a much larger area surrounding the print quite often with an embossed frame around the image on <b>heavy,</b> gray <b>card</b> stock.|$|R

In many sets, all the accessories were die-cast metal instead of plastic, a nice touch, if somewhat impractical if one wished to pose the figures holding them! Not to be outdone, the FAO Schwarz offerings contained two figures in each set (and for a more reasonable price of $89.99, than their usual $125+ range); the [...] "West Point & Annapolis Cadets" [...] and the [...] "Air Force Academy Cadet & American Cadet Alliance Marine". Then the late sixties [...] "Adventures of G.I.

The latter issues were [...] "adventure team" [...] -based sets such as [...] "Black Spider Rendezvous", [...] "Undercover Agent", [...] "Skydive to Danger", and [...] "Eight Ropes of Danger", and featured a fuzz-head, kung fu grip version of the TC figure. Some of the last releases such as Skydive contained a fuzz head, kung fu grip 40th Anniversary body (darker skin tone, head closer to original painted-head) instead of the TC version, and the packaging was of the lighter weight card, closer in design to that used for the Classic Collection-based Adventure Team figures, such as Search For The Yeti.|$|E

40|$|How {{does one}} mediate {{between nature and}} the city as {{development}} continues to arise out of necessity? What {{is the significance of}} the connection between nature and city and how can they be articulated? What is the relationship between architecture and nature in the context of densely settled area? This thesis attempts to address these questions through the application of environmental consciousness with three different scales: urban, community and individual. The site is known as Boston State Hospital Site in Mattapan where existing dense neighborhoods and abundant natural environments meet. Moreover, Boston Nature Center of Audubon Society is a major component of the site. Given the mixture of dichotomous settings, this thesis attempts to show how inter penetration between built environment and natural setting can proceed to bring urban living quality through Eco-housing development. by Yongjoo Kim.

5000|$|Static model {{aircraft}} are commonly built using plastic, but wood, metal, card and paper {{can also be}} used. Models are sold painted and assembled, painted but not assembled (snap-fit), or unpainted and not assembled. The most popular types of aircraft to model are commercial airliners and military aircraft. Aircraft can be modeled in many [...] "scales". The scale notation {{is the size of}} the model compared to the real, full-size aircraft called the [...] "prototype". 1:8 scale will be used as an example; it is read as: [...] "1 inch (or whatever measurement) on the model is equal (: means equal) to 8 inches on the real (prototype) airplane". Sometimes the scale notation is not used; it is simply stated: [...] "my model is one eighth (1/8) scale", meaning [...] "my model is one eighth the size of the real airplane" [...] or [...] "my model is one eight as large as the real airplane". Popular scales are, in order of size, 1:144, 1:72 (the most numerous), 1:48, 1:32, 1:24, 1:16, 1:8 and 1:4. Some European models are available at more metric scales such as 1:50. The highest quality models are made from injection-molded plastic or cast resin. Models made from Vacuum formed plastic are generally for the more skilled builder. More inexpensive models are made from <b>heavy</b> paper or <b>card</b> stock. Ready-made die-cast metal models are also very popular. As well as the traditional scales, die-cast models are available in 1:200, 1:250, 1:350, 1:400, and 1:600 scale.|$|R
