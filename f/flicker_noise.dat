25|$|Noise: Amplifiers {{generate}} random voltage at {{the output}} {{even when there}} is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> of the devices. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.|$|E
25|$|Shot {{noise is}} {{produced}} by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. Shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using heterodyne amplification. Another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved range resolution. The one notable exception to heterodyne (downconversion) radar systems is ultra-wideband radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see List of UWB channels.|$|E
50|$|Tuning range, tuning {{gain and}} phase noise are the {{important}} {{characteristics of a}} VCO. Generally low phase noise is preferred in the VCO. The noise present in the control signal and the tuning gain affect the phase noise; high noise or high tuning gain imply more phase noise. Other important elements that determine the phase noise are the transistor's <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> (1/f noise), the output power level, and the loaded Q of the resonator. (see Leeson's equation). The low frequency <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> affects the phase noise because the <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> is heterodyned to the oscillator output frequency due to the active devices non-linear transfer function. The effect of <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> can be reduced with negative feedback that linearizes the transfer function (for example, emitter degeneration).|$|E

40|$|The bulk of {{the video}} content {{available}} today over the Internet and over mobile networks suffers from many imperfections caused during acquisition and transmission. In the case of user-generated content, which is typically produced with inexpensive equipment, these imperfections manifest in various ways through <b>noise,</b> temporal <b>flicker</b> and blurring, {{just to name a}} few. Imperfections caused by compression <b>noise</b> and temporal <b>flicker</b> are present in both studio-produced and user-generated video content transmitted at low bit-rates. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm designed to reduce temporal <b>flicker</b> and <b>noise</b> in video sequences. The algorithm takes advantage of the sparse nature of video signals in an appropriate transform domain that is chosen adaptively based on local signal statistics. When the signal corresponds to a sparse representation in this transform domain, <b>flicker</b> and <b>noise,</b> which are spread over the entire domain, can be reduced easily by enforcing sparsity. Our results show that the proposed algorithm reduces <b>flicker</b> and <b>noise</b> significantly and enables better presentation of compressed videos...|$|R
50|$|The {{avalanche}} breakdown also has multistate noise. The noise output power randomly switches among several output levels.

50|$|<b>Flicker</b> <b>noise</b> {{is found}} in carbon-composition {{resistors}} and in thick-film resistors, where it {{is referred to as}} excess noise, since it increases the overall noise level above the thermal noise level, which is present in all resistors. In contrast, wire-wound resistors have the least amount of <b>flicker</b> <b>noise.</b> Since <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> is related to the level of DC, if the current is kept low, thermal noise will be the predominant effect in the resistor, and the type of resistor used may not affect noise levels, depending on the frequency window.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flicker</b> <b>noise</b> is {{electronic}} noise with a 1/ƒ frequency spectrum; as f increases, {{the noise}} decreases. <b>Flicker</b> <b>noise</b> arises {{from a variety}} of sources, such as impurities in a conductive channel, generation and recombination noise in a transistor due to base current, and so on.

50|$|One {{powerful}} technique involves {{moving the}} signal {{of interest to}} a higher frequency and using a phase-sensitive detector to measure it. For example, the signal of interest can be chopped with a frequency. Now the signal chain carries an AC, not DC, signal. Accordingly, you can filter out the DC by using AC-coupled stages. This filtering of DC also attenuates the <b>flicker</b> <b>noise.</b> You then use a synchronous detector that samples the peaks of the AC signal, which are equivalent to the original DC value. In other words, first low-frequency signal is shifted to high frequency by multiplying it with high-frequency carrier, and it {{is given to the}} device affected by the <b>flicker</b> <b>noise.</b> The output of the device is again multiplied with the same carrier, so the previous information signal comes back to baseband, and <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> will be shifted to higher frequency, which can easily be filtered out.|$|E

40|$|Allan Deviation {{computations}} {{of linear}} frequency synthesizer {{systems have been}} reported previously using real-time simulations. Even though it takes less time compared with the actual measurement, it is still very time consuming to compute the Allan Deviation for long sample times with the desired confidence level. Also <b>noises,</b> such as <b>flicker</b> phase <b>noise</b> and <b>flicker</b> frequency <b>noise,</b> can not be simulated precisely. The use of frequency domain techniques can overcome these drawbacks. In this paper the system error model of a fictitious linear frequency synthesizer is developed and its performance using a Cesium (Cs) atomic frequency standard (AFS) as a reference is evaluated using frequency domain techniques. For a linear timing system, the power spectral density at the system output can be computed with known system transfer functions and known power spectral densities from the input noise sources. The resulting power spectral density can then be used to compute the Allan Variance at the system output. Sensitivities of the Allan Variance at the system output to each of its independent input noises are obtained, and they are valuable for design trade-off and trouble-shooting...|$|R
40|$|Humans use saccadic eye {{movements}} to fixate {{different parts of}} their visual environment. While stimulus features that determine {{the location of the}} next fixation in static images have been extensively studied, temporal stimulus features that determine the timing of the gaze shifts received less attention. It is also unclear if stimulus features at the present gaze location can trigger gaze shifts to another location. To investigate these questions, we asked observers to switch their gaze between two blobs. In three different conditions, either the fixated blob, the peripheral blob, or both blobs were flickering. A time-frequency analysis of the <b>flickering</b> <b>noise</b> values, time locked to the gaze shifts, revealed significant phase locking in a time window 300 to 100 ms before the gaze shift at temporal frequencies below 20 Hz. The average phase angles at these time-frequency points indicated that observer´s gaze was repelled by decreasing contrast of the fixated blob and attracted by increasing contrast of the peripheral blob. These results show that temporal properties of both, fixated, and peripheral stimuli are capable of triggering gaze shifts...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} {{correlation}} theory methods {{to obtain a}} model for the near-carrier oscillator power-spectral density (PSD).

These expressions form the basis of an enhanced oscillator spectral model that has a Gaussian PSD at near-carrier frequencies followed by a sequence of power-law regions. New results for the effect of white phase <b>noise,</b> <b>flicker</b> phase <b>noise</b> and random walk frequency modulated phase noise on the near-carrier oscillator PSD are derived. In particular, in the case of 1 /f phase noise, we show that despite its lack of stationarity it is possible to derive a closed form expression for its effect on an oscillator PSD and show that the oscillator output can be considered to be wide-sense stationary...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a new, efficient technique for analyzing noise in large RF circuits subjected to true multitone excitations. Noise statistics in such circuits are time-varying, hence cyclostationary stochastic processes, characterized by har-monic power spectral densities (HPSD’s), {{are used to}} describe noise. HPSD’s are used to devise a harmonic-balance-based noise algorithm with the property that required computational resources grow almost linearly with circuit size and nonlinearity. Device noises with arbitrary spectra (including thermal, shot, and <b>flicker</b> <b>noises)</b> are handled, and input and output correlations, {{as well as individual}} device contributions, can be calculated. HPSD-based analysis is also used to establish the nonintuitive result that bandpass filtering of cyclostationary noise can result in stationary noise. Results from the new method are validated against Monte Carlo simulations. A large RF integrated circuit (> 300 nodes) driven by a local oscillator (LO) tone and a strong RF signal is analyzed in less than two hours. The analysis predicts correctly that the presence of the RF tone leads to noise folding, affecting the circuit’s noise performance significantly.

We estimate torque noise of the source and observe <b>flickering</b> <b>noise</b> (f^- 1). We achieve to measure the longest observed timescale for a noise process among accretion powered X-ray pulsars by extending the noise estimate for a time scale ranging from 31 days to 44 years. Spectral analysis of individual RXTE-PCA observations indicates a significant correlation between iron line flux and unabsorbed X-ray flux. Pulse phase resolved spectra of the source indicate a broadening of iron line complex at the bin corresponding to the pulse minimum.

50|$|In analog circuits, {{designers}} are also concerned with noise {{that arise from}} physical sources, such as thermal noise, <b>flicker</b> <b>noise,</b> and shot noise.

5000|$|Shot {{noise in}} {{electronic}} circuits consists of random fluctuations {{of the electric}} current in a DC current which originate due to fact that current actually consists of a flow of discrete charges (electrons). Because the electron has such a tiny charge, however, shot noise is of relative insignificance in many (but not all) cases of electrical conduction. For instance 1 ampere of current consists of about [...] electrons per second; even though this number will randomly vary by several billion in any given second, such a fluctuation is minuscule compared to the current itself. In addition, shot noise is often less significant as compared with two other noise sources in electronic circuits, <b>flicker</b> <b>noise</b> and Johnson-Nyquist noise. However, shot noise is temperature and frequency independent, in contrast to Johnson-Nyquist noise, which is proportional to temperature, and <b>flicker</b> <b>noise,</b> with the spectral density decreasing with the frequency. Therefore at high frequencies and low temperatures shot noise may become the dominant source of noise.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the depth-ordering of {{surfaces}} {{in the natural}} world {{is one of the most}} fundamental operations of the primate visual system. Surfaces that undergo accretion or deletion (AD) of texture are always perceived to behind an adjacent surface. An updated ForMotionOcclusion (FMO) model (Barnes 2 ̆ 6 Mingolla, 2013) includes two streams for computing motion signals and boundary signals. The two streams generate depth percepts such that AD signals together with boundary signals generate a farther depth on the occluded side of the boundary. The model fits the classical data (Kaplan, 1969) as well as the observation that moving surfaces tend to appear closer in depth (Royden et al., 1988), for both binary and grayscale stimuli. The recent ‘Moonwalk illusion’ described by Kromrey et al. (2011) upends the classical view that the surface undergoing AD always becomes the background. Here surface that undergoes AD appears to be in front of the surrounding surface; a result of the random <b>flickering</b> <b>noise</b> in the surround. As an additional challenge, we developed an AD display with dynamic depth ordering. A new texture version of the Michotte rabbit hole phenomenon (Michotte, Thinès, 2 ̆ 6 Crabbé, 1964 / 1991) generates depth that changes in part of the display area. We will show simulations that explain the workings of the new version of the model. The model now uses a simplified push-pull mechanism to generate depth-order signals. Because the FMO model separates the computation of boundaries from the computation of AD signals, it is able to explain the counter-intuitive Moonwalk stimulus. We will show detailed simulations explaining the Moonwalk illusion as well as the textured Michotte rabbit hole phenomena...|$|R
