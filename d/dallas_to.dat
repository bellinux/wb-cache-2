Nowitzki led <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> a tight finish towards the playoffs, finishing 50–32 for the season (6th in the West), after a slow 2–7 start. In the playoffs, the German led <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> an upset win over long-time rival San Antonio (the third seed), winning the first-round series, 4–1.

5|$|During the 1930s, a Dallas company {{known as}} the General American Finance System, {{struggling}} through the Great Depression, began to finance drilling operations in the state using oil reserves as collateral. This allowed <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> establish itself as the financing center for the oil industry. The Great American Finance System eventually reorganized itself as the General American Oil Company of Texas, which became an oil producer {{in its own right}} and, decades later, was purchased by Phillips Petroleum.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B.

Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{new road}} also led {{indirectly}} to {{the downfall of}} the area's public transportation system. Between 1925 and 1932, the Texas Interurban Railway, an electric commuter rail service that ran from <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> Denton, operated a station in Lewisville. Business leaders in the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce welcomed the service at the time, proudly citing the city's progressive citizenship. The area's low population density could not sustain the venture, however, and in 1932, the line went out of business and immediately halted service.|$|E

5|$|Malhotra {{welcomed the}} trade to Dallas as an {{opportunity}} for more playing time, as he was sparsely used with the Rangers. However, he saw limited success with the Stars. Following his trade, he recorded one point, a goal, in 16 games to finish the 2001–02 season. He was re-signed by <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> a two-year contract on June 27, 2002. In 2002–03, he recorded 10 points over 59 games. He appeared in his first Stanley Cup playoffs as the Stars qualified for the 2003 post-season as the top seed in the Western Conference.

5|$|The Dallas Cowboys, {{who were}} {{unsuccessful}} claiming Quinn 10 days earlier, claimed {{him after he}} was waived by the Colts. In Dallas, Quinn became the Cowboys second-string quarterback after Troy Aikman was injured and Jason Garrett became the starter. He played in three games for the Cowboys in 1998, completing one pass for 10yards. In 1999, Quinn did not play in a game for Dallas. During the 2000 offseason, Garrett {{signed as a free}} agent with the New York Giants and quarterback Paul Justin was signed by <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> compete for the backup spot with Quinn.

5|$|After {{losing the}} 2004 season opener, the Giants, behind Warner, {{went on to}} win five of their next six games to stand at 5–2. The Giants then lost two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4. It was at this point that Coughlin {{announced}} that Eli Manning would become the starter {{for the rest of the}} season. Manning struggled in his first four starts, and the Giants did not score more than 14 points in any game. However, they played better in narrow losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The Giants won their final game of the year against rival <b>Dallas,</b> <b>to</b> finish the season 6–10. Top performers on the season included Tiki Barber, who established a personal career high in rushing yardage with 1,518yards, and also contributed 52 catches and 15 touchdowns. Following the season Ron Dayne was released. Dayne had experienced several mediocre seasons while Shaun Alexander, who the Giants bypassed to draft Dayne, had developed into a consistent Pro Bowler.|$|E
5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games. Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games, he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E

Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, as they entrusted the stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones, but their surviving compatriots determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> the cruise liner.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Johnson missed most of {{the season}} with a knee injury, and New York dropped to 4–10, {{resulting}} in Tarkenton being traded back to the Vikings. The Giants rallied somewhat in 1972 to finish 8–6. Journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton) led the league in completion percentage and had his best season. Other standouts and Pro Bowl selections that year were running back Johnson, who rushed for 1,182 yards (breaking his own team record) and caught 45 passes, tight end Bob Tucker, who followed up his 1971 NFC-leading 59-catch season with 55 in 1972, and defensive stars Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall. The Giants boasted the top offense in the NFC and after a season-finishing 23–3 win at <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> secure their second winning campaign in three years, the future looked bright. However, after the 1972 season, New York would endure one of the worst periods in its history.|$|E
5|$|In New York City during November 1930, Szilard {{succeeds in}} recreating the elixir, {{only to have}} it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard.

Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo {{falls in love with}} Szilard's immortal homunculus Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> a barrel {{at the bottom of the}} Hudson River to punish him for killing Gandor members.|$|E

5|$|The primary freeway {{running through}} Lewisville is Interstate 35E, which runs north–south through the city. Before it was built, US Highway 77 (now Mill Street) {{was the main}} through route, {{connecting}} the city with Denton {{to the north and}} <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> the south. In 1998, the Texas Department of Transportation carried out a Major Investment Study to examine the possibility of expanding the section of Interstate 35E between Interstate 635 and U.S. Route 380, the primary focus being an stretch from Texas State Highway 121 to the bridge crossing Lewisville Lake. The project is scheduled to add one general-purpose lane in each direction, in addition to a managed toll lane. The project is expected to allow the city to substantially renovate its portion of the I-35 Corridor. Construction on {{the first phase of the}} project is projected to begin in summer 2013 and finish in late 2016.|$|E
5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win the NFC East title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. By Week 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating <b>Dallas</b> <b>to</b> the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans to fire him. However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win the NFC East. The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the NFC East with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career.|$|E
