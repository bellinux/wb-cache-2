In post conflict circumstances, as evident in Liberia and Sierra Leone (the two countries we examine), three particular challenges to achieving the goals stand out: a history of <b>economic</b> <b>reversals,</b> extremely weak institutional capacity, and popular distrust of government.

40|$|Of all {{the states}} hit by the 1997 - 98 Asian {{economic}} crisis, Indonesia has suffered the most, and been the hardest case for economists to explain. This paper suggests that Indonesia ’s collapse was not unique, but part of a small class of economic catastrophes caused by the interaction of two factors: personalistic authoritarian rule and financial openness. It argues {{that the combination of}} these two factors tends to produce economic collapse when investors believe the regime will soon end. To test the argument it develops an index of 45 personalistic regimes that ended between 1974 and 1999, ranks them according to an original index of financial openness, and examines their growth records during their final four years in office. It finds that those regimes that combined personalistic features with financial openness tended to suffer from unusually sharp economic reversals in their final two years. To illustrate the argument it uses the case of Indonesia, showing that investor panic was closely linked to rumors that Suharto was ill or would step down. By themselves, personalistic rule and financial openness are each compatible with high growth rates. When combined, however, they create the preconditions for a calamitous <b>economic</b> <b>reversal.</b> ...|$|E

In this village, a household fee ranking system was used from the 1910 s {{to the beginning of the}} 1960 s that efectively demonstrated not only the prestige of upper class households but also showed the social order in nine clans. During the prewar period, the ranking system based on the households' income and land ownership matched the traditional order of head and branch relations with in each clan. However, during the postwarperiod, the political status of households also became important in the ranking system. In addition, agricultural land reform changed the economic status of households. Within some clans, the traditional social order observed in the household fee greatly changed.

40|$|The Irish {{crash that}} began in 2008 has been {{described}} {{as one of the most}} dramatic <b>economic</b> <b>reversals</b> ever experienced by an industrialised country. There is a strong consensus about the economic roots of the crisis: the country experienced a classic asset bubble. Much more difficult to explain however, is how a mature democracy sleep-walked into a crisis that had so much precedent and in retrospect seems to have been so apparent. The policy decisions made in the boom period must shoulder much of the blame, but they were not created in a vacuum. This thesis systematically examines the discourse on the Irish economy from a broad range of commentators in the years prior to the crash, including international and domestic organisations, academics, the newspapers, and politicians. It demonstrates that key mainstream analysts anticipated how the property boom would end on the basis of estimated fundamental house prices and demand levels. This implicitly assumed that these fundamentals would remain strong as the boom abated, and ignored the potential for a market panic. By contrast, the most prescient analysts relied heavily on international precedent, and recognised that property price falls would be closely correlated with the increase observed during the boom. A key dimension of the discourse was therefore how the lessons of financial history were applied or disregarded.

40|$|The {{farm crisis}} of the 1980 s {{was one of the}} {{defining}} American moments of the late twentieth century. The Midwest’s farmers, long revered as the protectors of America’s agrarian heritage, saw <b>economic</b> <b>reversals</b> of a magnitude unseen since the Great Depression. Many had expanded their operations in the 1970 s on the basis of rising land prices, only to see the value of their farms plummet {{in the early days of}} the 1980 s. Farm income fell significantly, while the number of farm foreclosures skyrocketed. Families began to show signs of stress, as rates of spousal abuse, clinical depression, and suicide rose. 1 In the face of palpable distress, government agencies and volunteer groups rushed support activities into place. Although it was largely a midwestern event, the farm crisis pervaded the national consciousness, with stories in the New York Times, songs on the radio, and movies in the theaters. The stars of those movies testified to Congress about the passing of a way of life and the pain of the heartland’s farmers. This economic and social crisis captured the interest of the public like no other in the late twentieth century. It also transformed the rural Midwest, dramatically reducing the numbers of farmers and gutting many a small town.

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{rapid growth}} rates achieved by many African {{countries in the}} last decade have raised hopes that the continent is finally on a path to economic convergence with Asia and Latin America, but history suggests that such optimism could be misplaced. zz Previous periods of rapid growth across Africa have often been followed by phases of economic decline which have erased many of the gains countries have achieved in per capita income. The continent’s transition to modern economic growth will thus require a break in the boom-and-bust pattern which has characterized its economic performance during much of the 20 th century. zz European experience since the Middle Ages suggests that the pattern of growth based on increasing demand for export staples, followed by <b>economic</b> <b>reversals,</b> has often resulted in limited overall gains in per capita income. This pattern was only broken following the introduction of significant institutional change. zz Placing Africa’s recent economic performance in a wider historical perspective highlights the fact that the continent’s level of per capita income is comparable to pre-industrial Europe and that the institutional changes needed to ensure sustained economic growth have yet to take place. Growth reversals remain a serious threat to Africa’s future prosperity, and therefore it is incumbent on policymakers to focus a great deal more on the introduction of measures that can encourage the development of a robust civil society. www. warwick. ac. uk/go/cage � www. chathamhouse. orgAfrica’s Growth Prospects in a European Mirror: A Historical Perspective page...|$|R

40|$|The article’s main {{objective}} is to investigate the empirical link between the fiscal balance and the current account (i. e. the twin deficits phenomenon). The article focuses on transition economies which are according to their different characteristics divided into three major groups, i. e. Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Southern and Eastern Europe (SEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In fact, the inconsistency between public sector instability and currency overvaluations which led to current account balance deterioration was denoted {{as one of the}} key determinants of the balance of payments (currency) crisis seen in transition economies like Czech Republic (1997) and Russia (1998). Moreover, the importance of the so- called Horioka-Feldstein puzzle in transition economies is examined in order to draw some conclusions about the regions’ integration with international capital markets. For this purpose, pooled cross-sectional and time-series techniques are used to characterize the properties of current account variations across selected groups of transition economies in the 1990 - 2003 period. The empirical results suggest that high budget deficits in transition countries have signaled relatively low level of substitutability between private and public savings, implying a relatively high correlation between fiscal and external imbalances. Accordingly, special emphasis should be paid to the fiscal policy shift in these economies. Indeed, the main element of the <b>economic</b> policy <b>reversal</b> in transition countries should involve a substantial reduction of fiscal deficits in the future {{in order to reduce the}} probability of a balance of payments (currency) crisis. Finally, the article provides some evidence of the existence of the Horioka-Feldstein puzzle in transition economies. ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} the fiscal policy of primary commodity exporters. After the initial boom in fiscal spending that accompanies a commodity boom, he asks, why do commodity-exporting countries tend to maintain higher spending levels despite {{a drop in}} commodity prices. He identifies three factors that might explain the tendency: a pressure (from political constituents, for example) to keep spending, the difficulty of reversing policy (or disinvesting - the costs of firing people, for example), {{and the effects of}} limited indebtedness, or credit-rationing constraints. Fiscal policy must be developed with these three factors in mind. Using a fiscal policy optimizing model, the author examines evidence for the existence of these three factors. He uses the model's unconstrained and constrained Euler equations to estimate the Lagrange multipliers associated with the limited indebtedness constraint. The empirical work is done using data from Africa's franc zone countries. The persistence of pressure to spend may not play an important role, says the author. More important in explaining the tendency to maintain spending levels after a commodity boom ends are liquidity constraints and the costs of policy <b>reversal.</b> <b>Economic</b> Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,National Governance,Economic Stabilization,ICT Policy and Strategies...|$|R

40|$|Rural Ireland, and in {{particular}} the agricultural sector, is undergoing significant restructuring, {{within the context of a}} rapidly urbanising society that has been radically transformed economically and socially in the past ten to twenty years. The decade since the mid- 1990 s in Ireland has witnessed an <b>economic</b> transformation, the <b>reversal</b> of emigration and unemployment, rapid urbanisation and suburbanisation, and the continued concentration of population in the urbanised East (Central Statistics Office, 2003). The importance of agriculture as an employer has declined and the rural economy has become more diversified (Frawley and O'Meara, 2004). Young farmers are at the centre of these rural restructuring processes, making decisions to become farmers or not in the context of competing pressures. The economic and social landscape of farming is undergoing transformation, in which the viability of farming as an occupation and as a lifestyle in modem Ireland is being reduced. This means that some of the central pillars upon which Irish farm masculinities have been built are under threat, which has implications for the construction of masculine identities. However, at the same time, family farming carries with it certain responsibilities and retains a very strong socio-cultural meaning and importance, bound up closely with masculine identities. These competing pressures are in tension with one another and are lived out through the lives of farmers and their families. They are particularly apparent in the lives of young farmers and farm successors, who are the individuals who are facing or have recently faced, decisions regarding farm succession, inheritance or transfer of holdings, and their own futures...|$|R
