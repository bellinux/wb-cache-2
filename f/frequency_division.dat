5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E

Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E

50|$|Each top-octave note is fed to {{a simple}} digital counter IC, which divides by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, {{generating}} all the lower octaves of that note.

40|$|Accumulating evidences have {{revealed}} that neuronal oscillations with various frequency bands in the brain have different physiological functions. However, the <b>frequency</b> band <b>divisions</b> in rats were typically based on empirical spectral distribution from limited channels information. In the present study, functionally relevant frequency bands across vigilance states and brain regions were identified using factor analysis based on 9 channels EEG signals recorded from multiple brain areas in rats. We found that <b>frequency</b> band <b>divisions</b> varied both across vigilance states and brain regions. In particular, theta oscillations during REM sleep were subdivided into two bands, 5 - 7 and 8 - 11 Hz corresponding to the tonic and phasic stages, respectively. The spindle activities of SWS are different along the anterior-posterior axis, lower oscillations (~ 16 Hz) in frontal regions and higher in parietal (~ 21 Hz). The delta and theta activities were co-varied in the visual and auditory cortex during wakeful rest. In addition, power spectra of beta oscillations were significantly decreased in association cortex. These results provide us some new insights into understand the brain oscillations across vigilance states, and also indicate that the spatial factor should not be ignored when considering the <b>frequency</b> band <b>divisions</b> in rats...|$|R

(The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter cutoff frequency cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.|$|E

500|$|Modulation {{can also}} be used to {{transmit}} the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the [...] "carrier wave") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [...] An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel [...] "96FM"). In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing (FDM).|$|E
500|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, it was acoustic resonance {{that inspired}} filtering applications, {{the first of}} these being a telegraph system known as the [...] "harmonic telegraph". Versions are due to Elisha Gray, Alexander Graham Bell (1870s), [...] and others. Its purpose was to simultaneously transmit a number of telegraph messages over the same line and represents an early form of <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing (FDM). FDM requires the sending end to be transmitting at different frequencies for each individual communication channel. This demands individual tuned resonators, as well as filters to separate out the signals at the receiving end. The harmonic telegraph achieved this with electromagnetically driven tuned reeds at the transmitting end which would vibrate similar reeds at the receiving end. Only the reed with the same resonant frequency as the transmitter would vibrate to any appreciable extent at the receiving end.|$|E
40|$|Exploring {{adult stem}} cell {{dynamics}} in normal and disease states is crucial to both better understanding their in vivo role and better realizing their therapeutic potential. Here we address the <b>division</b> <b>frequency</b> of Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) in testes of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that GSC <b>division</b> <b>frequency</b> is under genetic control of the highly conserved Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathway. When EGF signaling was attenuated, we detected a two-fold increase {{in the percentage of}} GSCs in mitotic division compared to GSCs in control animals. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments using a marker for cells in S-phase of the cell cycle showed that the GSCs in EGF mutant testes divide faster than GSCs in control testes. The increased mitotic activity of GSCs in EGF mutants was rescued by restoring EGF signaling in the GSCs, and reproduced in testes from animals with soma-depleted EGF-Receptor (EGFR). Interestingly, EGF attenuation specifically increased the GSC <b>division</b> <b>frequency</b> in adult testes, but not in larval testes. Furthermore, GSCs in testes with tumors resulting from the perturbation of other conserved signaling pathways divided at normal frequencies. We conclude that EGF signaling from the GSCs to the CySCs normally regulates GSC <b>division</b> <b>frequency.</b> The EGF signaling pathway is bifurcated and acts differently in adult compared to larval testes. In addition, regulation of GSC <b>division</b> <b>frequency</b> is a specific role for EGF signaling as it is not affected in all tumor models.

It is also important to note that this complexity only applies when the filter size has no relation to the signal size. A wavelet without compact support such as the Shannon wavelet would require O(N2). (For instance, a logarithmic Fourier Transform also exists with O(N) complexity, but the original signal must be sampled logarithmically in time, which is only useful for certain types of signals.) ...|$|R

500|$|Mechanical {{filter design}} was {{developed}} by applying the discoveries made in electrical filter theory to mechanics. However, a very early example (1870s) of acoustic filtering was the [...] "harmonic telegraph", which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but mechanical resonance (in particular, acoustic resonance) was very familiar to engineers. This situation was not to last for long; electrical resonance had been known to science for some time before this, {{and it was not}} long before engineers started to produce all-electric designs for filters. In its time, though, the harmonic telegraph was of some importance. The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing thus saving enormously on line installation costs. The key of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal. Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency, which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning.|$|E

The tools have enabled an in-depth comprehension of the different phenomena, which have been observed in simulation with good agreement with experimental results. The study of the mechanism generating the instability has led to a simplified equivalent circuit from which the optimum stabilization network has been determined.

This has been achieved with negligible degradation of the amplifier performance in terms of drain efficiency and output power.
