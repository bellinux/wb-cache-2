[...] "I knew Lemon had a strong arm, and once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not going to hit with consistency as an outfielder, I {{thought it would be}} worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher", Boudreau later wrote.

Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position. Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider, a key pitch in his repertoire. That same year, Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon [...] "some day will become the best pitcher in the American League." [...] Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49ERA. He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox. During the last two months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including two 11-inning outings.|$|E

5000|$|Film {{director}} Billy Wilder and {{his longtime}} co-writer I. A. L. ('Izzy') Diamond had just offered him {{the role of}} Jeff Sheldrake in the 1960 movie The Apartment that went to Fred MacMurray instead. Wilder later said: [...] "I saw him and his wife, Jan Sterling, at a restaurant, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perfect, and I asked him {{right there in the}} parking lot. About two days before we were to start, he had a heart attack and died. Iz and I were shattered." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vernon {{came into}} the parlor, wearing a yarmulke like {{everyone}} else since this was a Jewish ceremony. He was led in by his arm, and brought up to Shemp's casket. The man accompanying Vernon told him, [...] "This is Shemp.". Vernon was staring straight ahead at the wall — {{it was then that}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> blind. Vernon felt Shemp's hand, then his face very gently. Everyone else had been filing past the casket quickly, but Vernon took his time, giving a last goodbye to his friend. It {{was one of the most}} moving things I ever saw.|$|E
5000|$|... "I locked {{myself in}} my home and I just started writing.

The more we started {{listening}} to it the studio the more my producer started going, 'Dude, you know, you can just call this what it is.' I was like, 'What are you talking about?' And he goes, 'Why don't you just call this Tommy Lee?' After thinking about it for a while, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. That's when I made that decision, to just go under my own name rather than a 'band' name." ...|$|E
60|$|Silently {{we entered}} {{the gate of the}} burial ground, and slowly {{approached}} the mound under which my mother's body rested, and as I studied the thin form and bending head of my intrepid sire, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in very truth treading the edge of his own grave. My eyes grew dim with tears and my throat ached with a sense of impending loss, and a pity for him which I could conceal only by looking away at the hills.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{precious}} collaborator I have ever had, I say it straightaway and don't {{even have to}} hesitate, was Nino Rota — between us, immediately, a complete, total, harmony ... He had a geometric imagination, a musical approach worthy of celestial spheres. He thus {{had no need to}} see images from my movies. When I asked him about the melodies he had in mind to comment one sequence or another, <b>I</b> clearly <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not concerned with images at all. His world was inner, inside himself, and reality had no way to enter it.|$|R

5000|$|I {{had tried}} to cast Lance Henriksen on The X-Files several times, {{he had always been}} either {{unavailable}} or uninterested. Anyway I remained a fan of his, I was in bed working in Vancouver and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working there too. So I found out where he was staying and wrote a personal note, had a fan slip it under his door, and said that I'd tried to get him on the show and hoped to work with him in the future. Little did he know when I was then writing Millennium I was writing with only him in mind, with no idea whether or not he'd actually do the project. So I wrote the project, approached him, he was very excited about it, we made a deal and the rest is now history.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after graduating}} from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve. After the year of active duty, he {{enrolled}} at Stanford Graduate School of Business. In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article: [...] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined {{the type of person who}} was an entrepreneur--and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" [...] In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, [...] "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," [...] essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1938, as {{the crisis}} leading to Munich developed, I {{began to worry}} about my parents’ safety. I had a premonition I would be needed in Berlin. I got {{a leave of absence}} from The Ledger and left by ship for Bremen with the {{intention}} of continuing to Berlin. During the crossing, Prime Minister Chamberlain began his visits to Hitler and the situation looked very grim. When the ship landed first at Southampton, I received a telegram from my father telling me to get off the ship and go to my godfather’s in London, where my father would meet me. My mother had been left in Bruges, Belgium, with some other British subjects who had left Berlin for fear of being caught after an outbreak of war. When I met my father <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not well and had a bad case of bronchitis. After picking up my mother in Bruges the family returned to Berlin. My father’s health grew worse, and after about ten days, when he had developed pneumonia (there were no antibiotics then), he died." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|R
60|$|The Ghost {{suddenly}} {{changed her}} course, keeping away, {{and it came}} to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible. Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> preparing to heave to, and dropped to the deck to be in readiness. We were now dead before the wind, the boat far away and abreast of us. I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss for the moment of all strain and pressure, coupled with a swift acceleration of speed. She was rushing around on her heel into the wind.|$|R
60|$|I {{watched him}} for a long time, wondering, why it was that such a doglike animal was not a better swimmer. As <b>he</b> neared me <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{weakening}} rapidly. I had gathered a handful of stones to be ready for his assault when he landed, but in a moment I let them fall from my hands. It was evident that the brute either was no swimmer or else was severely injured, for by now <b>he</b> <b>was</b> making practically no headway. Indeed, it was with quite apparent difficulty that he kept his nose above the surface of the sea.|$|R
50|$|Hamilton later recalled:Milius made me {{read the}} script to Evel. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> kind of a {{sociopath}} and was totally messed. Then all of sudden Evel started to adopt lines out of the movie for himself. So his persona in the movie became more of his persona in real life. He would have been every kid’s hero on one hand, but then he went and took that baseball bat and broke that guy’s legs and that finished {{his career in the}} toy business. Evel was very, very difficult and he was jealous of anybody that was gonna play him. He wanted to portray himself and he did go and make his own movie later on. He had a great perception of this warrior that he thought he was and that was good. Then he had this other side of himself where he’d turn on you in a minute. Success is something that you have earn. You have to have a humility for it, because it can leave you in a second. It may remember you but it can sure leave you. I think if you don’t get that and you don’t have gratitude for what you are and where you are it doesn’t come back and it goes away forever.|$|E

30|$|When I was in school, I had {{a classmate}} who {{invited me to}} her home. Nearby, {{there was a little}} house where (I later learned) her {{grandfather}} stayed and practiced meditation. I never saw him, but my classmate told that he meditated and recited mantras all the time, with only short pauses for taking food and drink. Now <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in an intensive retreat and was a dedicated Buddhist practitioner. At the time, I was very impressed by the thought of this old man sitting in meditation posture and continuously reciting mantras. It caused me to reflect, because, at the time, this was something extraordinary (Chodron 2016).|$|R

'An oratorio!', he said, 'no, let's make it an opera!', and he began to dig through the Bible while I outlined the plan of the work, even sketching scenes, and leaving him only the versification to do. For some reason I began the music with Act 2, and I played it at home to a select audience who could make nothing of it at all.|$|R

I just require that it is enough that I don’t slowly sink into debt. Then I would feel like a chump. I must say I felt like a bit of a chump last year when the head of the University Health Network Tom Closson announced his retirement to “spend more time with his family ” and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> annually paid $ 710, 000, he wh...|$|E
40|$|I first {{encountered}} Eric Davidson in 1969 when, {{as a graduate}} student in the MBL Embryology Course, I heard him lecture. He spoke in general {{about the role of the}} nucleus in development. I now realize he organized his lecture on the basis of the introduction to his 1968 book, Gene Activity in Early Development and included some of the ideas published in his 1969 Science paper written with Roy Britten. That paper presented ideas that he built on throughout his career. In my naïve view, it seemed like Eric was belaboring an established tenet. Did not everyone accept that DNA in the nucleus was the genetic material and the blueprint for development? But it was not until much later in my education that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reacting to ongoing controversies occupying the last 16 years since the publication of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick. To emphasize that controversy I remember that Lionel Jaffe, who studied the role of calcium waves in many kinds of biological processes including development, several times during the lecture refuted Eric's focus on the nucleus...|$|E

[...] "When I received this message, I felt the person who wrote it was thoughtful and cared about the situation of the world.

5000|$|The {{title of}} the book is a {{reference}} to how Jackson [...] "started over" [...] after divorcing her abusive manager Jack Gordon. She stated, [...] "I think it's important for everybody to start over in their life when it's not going properly or the way they think it should go or should be going, or if there's problems in their life." [...] The title is shared with her comeback record, Starting Over, which was released on the same day as the book. According to Jackson, the album's autobiographical songs inspired the book. Jackson told Us Weekly that she decided to write the book when women contacted her after seeing Jackson's 2005 interview on 20/20. [...] "This book was written for people who have endured abuse. Women cannot allow men to rob their self-esteem and self-worth. I want them to know that they can use their voice to make a change." [...] Jackson began working on the book in February 2008 and completed it in Spring 2011. Even though Jackson was pictured with her brother Michael on the hardcover edition, she stated that [...] "the book is not about Michael. 85 percent of that book is about me starting over and encouraging women." [...] "The company wanted me to incorporate Michael and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of my life}} and he just passed so people are going to think I was selfish if I didn't include him." ...|$|R

In {{the centre of the}} garden a great live-oak spread its sheltering branches. Around the gnarled trunk was a seat. And on the seat,--her sewing fallen into her lap, her lips parted, her eyes staring wide, sat the young lady whom we had seen on the levee the evening before.

[...] A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw them off the scent, and in the same stroke provide a retroactive explanation for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern {{came up with the idea}} of Kingsley having a brother named Daniel who sometimes impersonates him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as Daniel Kingsley in Amazing Spider-Man #249.|$|R
