5|$|It {{has been}} 4 <b>days</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> crash, September 25, 2004. Locke awakens from Oceanic Flight 815's crash and wiggles his toes, {{realizing that he}} is no longer paralyzed. Boars raid the body-filled fuselage, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the {{survivors}} discover that their food is exhausted, and wonder what to do. Locke reveals to hold many hunting knives, and suggests to go after the boar in the jungle. On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) an antenna, which after being set will help triangulate the signal of the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese used astronomical studies {{mainly to}} {{construct}} and revise their calendar. In contrast to the Julian calendar (46 BCE) and Gregorian calendar (1582 CE) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (古四分历), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days (like the Julian calendar of Rome). Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (太初历) in 104 BCE which measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 <b>days.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar. Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233–1316 CE) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar. Besides {{the use of the}} calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle—constructed by celestial stems (gan 干) and Earthly Branches (zhi 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.|$|E

25|$|Easter is {{the third}} Sunday in the paschal lunar month, or, in other words, the Sunday after the paschal lunar month's 14th day. The 14th of the paschal lunar month is {{designated}} by convention as the Paschal full moon, although the 14th of the lunar month may differ from {{the date of the}} astronomical full moon by up to two <b>days.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> ecclesiastical new moon falls on a date from 8 March to 5 April inclusive, the paschal full moon (the 14th of that lunar month) must fall on a date from 21 March to 18 April inclusive.|$|E
25|$|But these differences, though {{demonstrating a}} Lagašite respect of {{religious}} figures simply {{in the amount}} of time and energy they required, is not as telling as the language Gudea uses to justify any punishment. Whereas Sargon or Naram-Sin simply demand punishment to any who change their words, based on their power, Gudea defends his words through tradition, “since the earliest <b>days,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> seed sprouted forth, no one was (ever) supposed to alter the utterance of a ruler of Lagaš who, after building the Eninnu for my lord Ningirsu, made things function as they should”. Changing the words of Naram-Sin, the living god, is treason, because he is the king. But changing the words of Gudea, simple governor of Lagaš, is unjust, because he made things work right.|$|E

25|$|On November 6, the {{formation}} talks became the longest in Belgian history. When the Parliament confirmed {{the formation}} of an interim Government, it had been 196 <b>days</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Belgian people had voted out the previous coalition. It was the second longest formation period in European history, after the Dutch record of 208 days in 1977. Talks were interrupted twice by the resignation of the formateur, which left the political parties waiting for a new appointment by the King. Guy Verhofstadt was appointed as mediator on December 3, with the task not only of looking into {{the formation of}} a new government, but also of investigating how the government could handle certain urgent policy matters. Pressed by time, and some say by the King, on 19 December, Verhofstadt concluded a deal on a Government and presented it to Parliament on 21 December; on the same day the Ministers took the oath of office.|$|E
25|$|Fernandes {{broke away}} from the {{erstwhile}} Janata Dal and formed the Samata Party in 1994, which became a key ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a party which is the current form of the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh. BJP formed a short-lived government in the 1996 general elections along with the Samata Party and other allies. The government survived only for 13 <b>days,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> BJP could not gather enough support from other parties to form a majority. Fernandes later served in the opposition along with BJP during the two United Front governments (1996–1998) led by Janata Dal ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral. After the collapse of the United Front ministry led by Gujral, BJP and its allies won a slender majority in the 1998 general elections. The government lasted only for 13 few months, due to the non-co-operation of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader Jayalalitha.|$|E

He handed the library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building, which brought Coatney to tears. He called the donation a [...] "small contribution", and reminisced about the difficult experiences he faced as a child, stating that he sometimes {{did not know how}} he would find his next meal. In January 2010, Wade and Alonzo Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti", which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three <b>days</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the [...] "Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti" [...] had already raised over $800,000. Wade stated, [...] "I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, {{and we will continue to}} accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead." [...] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and has served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.|$|E

2500|$|The {{manner in}} which the trial was {{conducted}} was widely criticised inside and outside Romania. However, Ion Iliescu, Romania's provisional president, said in 2009 that the trial was [...] "quite shameful, but necessary" [...] in order to end the state of near-anarchy that had gripped the country in the three <b>days</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Ceaușescus fled Bucharest. [...] Similarly, Victor Stănculescu, who had been defense minister before going over to the revolution, said in 2009 that the alternative would have been seeing the Ceaușescus lynched on the streets of Bucharest.|$|E

2500|$|Falkenhayn, {{commanding}} the Yildirim Army Group, finally arrived from Aleppo {{to establish his}} headquarters in the German Hospice on the Mount of Olives during the evening of 5 November. However, despite the delay of six <b>days</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> capture of Beersheba, [...] "the attack [...] was now about {{to be carried out}} in the most favourable circumstances." [...] This was largely because at least seven Ottoman infantry regiments, including the 19th Division, had been drawn into the defence of the road from Beersheba to Jerusalem, and the fighting for Ras en Naqb and Tel el Khuweilfe. Only two regiments were holding the [...] Ottoman front line, which stretched along the Wadi esh Sheria to the west.|$|E

Yzerman tallied 39 goals and 87 points in his rookie season and finished second in Calder Memorial Trophy (rookie of the year) voting. That season, Yzerman also became the first 18-year-old to play in an NHL All-Star Game (18 years, 267 <b>days)</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> current format was adopted in 1969. This stood as an NHL record for 27 years until Jeff Skinner broke it by eight days.|$|E
2500|$|Sleipners first hostile {{encounter}} with the German foe occurred on 12 April. At this date Captain Ullring decided to act on information received on 10 April that two German vessels were making {{their way down the}} coast towards the south. The ships were the 1,080-ton merchant [...] of Duisburg and the 420-ton trawler Thüringen. When the war broke out on 9 April the two ships had been at Ålesund, but they had sailed off immediately after news of the German attack spread. As the two ships moved south the local people along their route became anxious that there might be German landing troops hidden on board the vessels and Capt. Ullring felt the need to decisively {{put an end to the}} situation. As the German ships had anchored up in the bay Stettevika near Skodje the local municipal police officer, Henrik Daae Quale, was contacted to coordinate his actions with those of the Romsdalsfjord Naval District. Quale had in the <b>days</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> invasion organised a militia force of around 100 civilian volunteers armed mostly with Krag-Jørgensen rifles and shotguns, though with a sprinkling of more improvised arms such as clubs, pitchforks and knives. Although to a large degree without military training Quale's men were motivated to do their bit in the defence of their local area.|$|E
