After Tseng began researching Tasers three years ago, Taser International contacted him, asking him to reconsider his media statements and offering funding.|$|E
2500|$|Ablation (AF ablation) is {{a method}} that {{increasingly}} is used to treat cases of recurrent AF that are unresponsive to conventional treatments. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses radiofrequency energy to destroy abnormal electrical pathways in heart tissue. Other energy sources include laser, cryothermy and high intensity ultrasound. The energy emitting probe (electrode) is placed into the heart through a catheter inserted into veins in the groin or neck. Electrodes that can detect electrical activity from inside the heart are also inserted, and the <b>electrophysiologist</b> uses these to [...] "map" [...] {{an area of the}} heart to locate the abnormal electrical activity before eliminating the responsible tissue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment of}} WPW is {{the destruction of}} the abnormal electrical pathway by radiofrequency catheter ablation. This procedure is performed by cardiac electrophysiologists. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is not performed in all individuals with WPW because [...] inherent risks are involved in the procedure. When performed by an experienced <b>electrophysiologist,</b> radiofrequency ablation has a high success rate. Findings from 1994 indicate success rates of as high as 95% in people treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation for WPW. If radiofrequency catheter ablation is successfully performed, the condition is generally considered cured. Recurrence rates are typically less than 5% after a successful ablation. The one caveat is that individuals with underlying Ebstein's anomaly may develop additional accessory pathways during progression of their disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{next step}} is pacing the heart, this means he/she will speed up or slow down the heart by placing the {{electrode}} at certain points along the conductive pathways {{of the heart and}} literally controlling the depolarization rate of the heart. The doctor will pace each chamber of the heart one by one, looking for any abnormalities. Then the <b>electrophysiologist</b> tries to provoke arrhythmias and reproduce any conditions that have resulted in the patient's placement in the study. This is done by injecting electric current into the conductive pathways and into the endocardium at various places. Last, the <b>electrophysiologist</b> may administer various drugs (proarrhythmic agents) to induce arrhythmia.

An understanding of echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear cardiology, X-ray computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and vascular ultrasound is indispensable for cardiologists, <b>electrophysiologists</b> {{as well as}} radiologists, and it is currently recommended that physicians should be trained in several imaging modalities.

40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years the {{molecular}} substrate of {{a diversity of}} primary electrical diseases has been unraveled.
