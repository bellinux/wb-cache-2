40|$|International audienceThis article {{centers on}} a group of upper-middle-class gentrifiers living in a {{neighborhood}} in the South End of Boston, and their complex attitude towards diversity. I use data from my fieldwork in the South <b>End,</b> based <b>on</b> ethnographic <b>observation</b> and 77 interviews with residents active in local organizations, such as neighborhood associations. These residents explicitly stress their endorsement of diversity, in terms of class, race, but also sexual orientation, and their commitment to maintaining it. I examine the meaning they give to this principle, the actions they take in its name and the kind of relations they establish with those 'others' who embody such diversity. I argue that the gentrifiers' love of diversity, which cannot be reduced to sheer hypocrisy, is intrinsically linked to their capacity to control it, thus shedding light on the changing definition of social distinction in upper-middle-class culture...|$|R

The play does not deal with god, but does have aspects of man versus society in the debate between theater and new media. It begins and ends with a moral code (the idea that love conquers all and should be given unconditionally), contains a mood of ridicule and wit, but deals with characters that are both above and below us. It has a tragic hero (Esme), an innocent victim (Amy), and perhaps a nemesis (Dominic), {{as well as a}} teacher (Esme) and a buffoon (Frank). There is certainly suffering, as well as multiple confrontations and a climax, insight, and a marriage (although the marriage is not technically a happy one, and is not at the <b>end).</b> Based <b>on</b> these <b>observations,</b> one can conclude that Amy's View is a tragicomedy.|$|R

In a very careful and elaborate analysis, he distinguishes the various elements in our tactile experiences-the touching of one's own body, the touching of objects other than one's own body, the experience of movement, the exploration of surfaces by the hands: he traces the growth of the statue's perceptions of extension, distance and shape. The third section deals with the combination of touch with the other senses.

40|$|In {{order to}} study types of {{motorized}} vehicles red light running and their characteristics, {{the concept of}} critical distance was introduced, combining with the start and end of red light, to classify motorized vehicles red light running into three categories: deliberate and unintentional red light violation at red onset and red light violation at red <b>end.</b> Based <b>on</b> video <b>observation</b> data, the number of motorized vehicles that commit any of the afore-mentioned three types of red light violation was statistically analyzed, and then their characteristics under various traffic control and management conditions were explored using z-test method.

At the end of red light, there are a few vehicles violating red light as well. Additionally, the rates of red light running are obviously varying between those three classifications of red light running under the conditions of countdown timer, automatic red light camera, green flashing device, different speed limits and peak period...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent activities {{carried out}} {{for the development of}} an innovative anthropomorphic robotic hand, called the DEXMART Hand. The main goal of this research is to face the problems that affect current robotic hands by introducing suitable design solutions aimed at achieving simplification and cost reduction while possibly enhancing robustness and performance. In particular, the design of the DEXMART Hand mechanical structure, the purposely developed actuation system and the sensory apparatus are presented and discussed. The sensors, which are fully integrated within the hand structure, enable precise force as well as displacement control of the phalanges and wrist. Moreover, the lack of suitable and purposely developed control tools that make these devices very difficult to use has been considered. To this <b>end,</b> based <b>on</b> the <b>observation</b> of the human hand behavior during interaction with common day-to-day objects, a simple control strategy that exploits postural synergies has been developed and used for a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of the DEXMART Hand in reproducing human like grasping...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the effect of friction force on the contact behavior of an elastica inside a circular channel with clearance. The elastica is partially clamped at both the input and output ends of the channel. Coulomb friction {{is assumed to be}} present at the output <b>end</b> and <b>on</b> the constraining walls. Focused is placed on the relative motion between the input end and the output end of the elastica. Shooting method is adopted to solve for the quasi-static behavior of the elastica movement. Four types of contact patterns between the elastica and the constraining channel walls may occur when the input end moves {{in and out of the}} channel; they are rolling point contact, combined rolling and sliding point contact, rolling line contact, and sliding line contact. When the input end undergoes a sinusoidal motion, the output end either ceases to move at all, or follows exactly the input end motion. These two phases of output end motion occur subsequently, one immediately after the other. In general, the output end lags behind the input <b>end.</b> Experimental <b>observations</b> <b>on</b> the lagging phenomenon at the output end confirm the theoretical prediction...|$|R

The network was indirectly tied to the North American datum by the use of (1) satellite observing stations of other observing systems whose coordinates were previously determined, (2) relative positions of these and nearby Secor stations, as determined by local surveys, and (3) geodetic heights composed of leveled (orthometric) heights plus geoid heights obtained from a geoid map...|$|R
