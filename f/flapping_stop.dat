40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the emergence of the}} phonetic variants (often called allophones) of alveolar phonemes in the speech production of 2 -year-olds. Our specific question was: Does the child start by producing a "canonical" form of a phoneme (e. g., /t/ with a clear closure and a release burst), only later learning to produce its other phonetic variants (e. g., unreleased <b>stop,</b> <b>flap,</b> and glottal <b>stop)</b> ? Or, does the child start by producing the appropriate phonetic variants in the appropriate contexts and only later learn that they are phonetic variants of the same phoneme? In order to address this question, we investigated the production of three phonetic variants (unreleased <b>stop,</b> <b>flap,</b> and glottal <b>stop)</b> of the alveolar stop codas /t, d/ in the spontaneous speech of 6 American-English-speaking mother-child dyads, using both acoustic and perceptual coding. The results showed that 2 -year-old children produced all three variants significantly less often than their mothers, and produced acoustic cues to canonical /t, d/ more often. This supports the view that young children start out by producing a fully articulated canonical variant of a phoneme in contexts where an adult would produce non-canonical forms. The implications of these findings for early phonological representations are discussed. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} Rotary-Wing Aeroservoelasticity {{approach}} to the modeling, analysis {{and control of the}} blade-sailing phenomenon in the helicopter-ship dynamic interface (DI), based on the identification, response evaluation and control of flow and ship motion induced loads, during the engagement/disengagement flight regimes, in order to establish some principles for the design and safe operation of shipboard rotorcraft systems. The nonlinear aeroelastic analysis revealed that the nonlinearity due to large flapping deflections and to the centrifugal forces is not relevant for normal operating conditions, whereas the nonlinear effects due to the <b>flapping</b> <b>stops</b> in articulated rotors influence significantly the blade-sailing vibrations. These nonlinear effects related to the stops can be tackled with approximate stiffness functions. The nonlinear analysis confirmed that hingeless rotor blade-sailing vibrations are lower than that of the articulated rotor, however, the differences are small for rotors with similar structural/geometric characteristics. The blade-sailing phenomenon in the DI and the flapping response during engagement/disengagement shipboard operations can be analyzed trough an oscillator system with nonlinear stiffness related to the droop and <b>flap</b> <b>stops</b> and time-varying coefficients related to the undisturbed flow velocity and to the parameters of the proposed active proportional-derivative individual blade control (PD-IBC). The aeroelastic analysis also showed that blade sailing is a cooperative phenomenon. Though the mean flow vertical velocity gradient across the rotor be the single most important factor, the combination of horizontal wind velocities, fluctuating flow vertical velocities, gravity and ship motion effects may give rise to excessive flapping vibrations. The proposed active proportional-derivative state feedback individual blade control (PD-IBC) can obtain blade-sailing flapping vibration reduction of 30 % for shipboard articulated rotors at moderate wind-over-deck (WOD) conditions/advance ratios, without monitoring the DI environment, and a reduction greater than 40 % if combined with shipboard rotor plant modifications, involving an increase of the blade flapwise stiffness and an aerodynamic design of the ship flight deck, considering the current blade pitch input limits of the actuators. Therefore, the implementation of active feedback aeroelastic control methods {{may be one of the}} most important measures for blade-sailing mitigation in the DI...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of the engage and disengage operations of a helicopter rotor during which blades can come in intermittent contact with the droop or <b>flap</b> <b>stops.</b> The problem is formulated {{within the framework of}} finite element based flexible multibody dynamics that allows the analysis of rotorcraft systems of arbitrary topology with the potential of contact among various components of the system. Contact is assumed to be of finite duration, and the forces acting between the contacting stops are explicitly computed during the simulation. The modeling of contact consists of three parts: the evaluation of the relative distance between the stops, a unilateral contact condition which is transformed into a holonomic constraint by the addition of a slack variable, and a contact model which describes the relationship between the contact force and the local deformation of the contacting bodies. The proposed analysis procedure is validated by comparison with experimental data, and the aeroelastic analysis of shipboard engage and disengage operations of a H- 46 rotor is presented...|$|R

50|$|From most open (least stricture) to most close (most stricture), {{there are}} several {{independent}} relationships among speech sounds. Open vowel → mid vowel → close vowel → approximant → fricative → plosive is one; <b>flap</b> → <b>stop</b> is another; and trill → trilled fricative yet another. The IPA chart has been organized so that the raising diacritic moves {{the value of a}} letter through these series toward the top of the chart, and the lowering diacritic toward the bottom of the chart, but this only works for some of the consonants. While it would be convenient if all consonants could be so ordered, consonants are too diverse for a single dimension to capture their relationships. In addition, many of the points along the series may be nasalized or lateralized as well, and these parameters are independent of stricture.|$|R
5000|$|Flapping or tapping, {{also known}} as {{alveolar}} flapping, intervocalic flapping, or t-voicing, is a phonological process found in many dialects of English, especially North American English, Australian English and New Zealand English, by which the consonants [...] and sometimes also [...] may be pronounced as a flap in certain positions, particularly between vowels (intervocalic position). In some cases, the effect is perceived by some listeners as the replacement of a [...] sound with a [...] sound; for example, the word butter pronounced with flapping may be heard as [...] "budder". In fact, [...] and sometimes [...] are pronounced in such positions as an alveolar flap , a sound produced by briefly tapping the alveolar ridge with the tongue. Also, in similar positions, the combination [...] may be pronounced with a nasalized <b>flap</b> or <b>stop,</b> making winter sound similar or identical to winner.|$|R
40|$|Formulations of {{flapping}} as {{a symbolic}} phonological rule suggest clear articulatory differences between <b>flaps</b> and <b>stops,</b> and often offer no overt explanation for why phrase boundaries should block the alternation. The present study explores the articulatory foundation {{of the distinction between}} flaps and non-flaps in word-final position. We examine kinematic and acoustic data for these articulations in phrase-final and phrase-medial positions and in falling- and level-stress contours. It is shown that a discrepancy exists between acoustic and articulatory durational patterning – while acoustic durations of flaps are shorter than those of non-flaps overall, their articulatory durations are not uniformly so. It is important to consider multiple potential articulatory sources – both spatial and temporal – for the acoustic shortness that characterizes flaps, including spatial reduction, temporal articulatory shortening, and changes in intergestural coordination. The kinematic data indicate that different sources of word-final flap shortness exist for different speakers and different prosodic conditions, suggesting that gradient variability in the spatiotemporal patterning of tongue-tip constrictions yields acoustic shortening in word-final flaps. ...|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{conditions}} for flapping is unknown, {{although it is}} widely understood that it occurs in an alveolar stop, [...] or , when placed between two vowels, provided the second vowel is unstressed (as in butter, writing, wedding, loader). Across word boundaries, however, it can also occur before a stressed word-initial vowel (as in get over [...] ). This extends to morphological boundaries within compound words (as in whatever [...] ). The [...] "vowel" [...] that precedes the flap {{may also be a}}n approximant, [...] (as in party), or sometimes [...] (as in faulty). The following vowel may also be a syllabic consonant, , [...] or [...] (as in bottle, bottom, butter), but flapping before [...] (button, Latin) is rare. The stress constraint applies to secondary stress as well, prohibiting words like botox, detail and latex from <b>flapping.</b> Word-initial <b>stops</b> are usually not flapped, except in the preposition/particle to and words derived from it, such as today, tonight, tomorrow and together (as in go to sleep [...] ). In Australian English, numerals thirteen, fourteen and eighteen are often flapped despite the second vowel being stressed.|$|R

50|$|Although in zoos {{flamingos}} usually appear stationary, {{they are}} able to fly. They have specific feathers used to take flight. These feathers are easily distinguished in James's flamingo's because they're the only black feathers on the bird. In order to begin flying they run a few steps and then begin to flap their wings. When they want to land, the opposite process occurs and as they touch down to a surface they continue to run as they decelerate they <b>stop</b> <b>flapping</b> their wings. Flamingos have been noted to fly up to 60 km/h. This measurement refers to a migration of an entire flock but there is evidence that due to the limited regions in which this species is found, they do not migrate very far and therefore, may not reach this speed when going shorter distances.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{numerical}} simulation of the unsteady two-dimensional flow during the deployment and retraction of the slats and flaps of a transport aircraft wing section, using the compressible unsteady RANS solver DLR Tau with the Chimera technique. The unsteady simulations reveal a sudden growth of the flow separation on the flap {{after the end of}} the movement of the devices. Except when this happens, the unsteady lift coefficient of the flap moving alone can be predicted by quasi-steady corrections. The motion of the slat has a much more complicated impact on the flow. Generally speaking, the time-delays are high. If confirmed, these effects may have a significant impact on flight dynamics. A Fourier analysis reveals a low-frequency oscillation which may be an eigenmode of the flap. It also reveals how the vortex shedding predicted at the trailing edge of the flap develops when the slat and the <b>flap</b> have <b>stopped</b> moving. This may be a relevant acoustic source. The Chimera method enables a great flexibility, but it introduces significant numerical dis-turbances for both steady and unsteady solutions. This study shows that they are mainly caused by interpolations performed from a fine mesh to a mesh having a lower resolution. An integral formulation is suggested to improve the non-conservative behavior of the method. The reliability of these results still has to be assessed thanks to other numerical simulations, as wind-tunnel or in-flight tests seem unfeasible. ...|$|R
