40|$|Pedestrian dead {{reckoning}} (PDR) {{is widely used}} for indoor localisation. Its principle is to recursively update {{the location of the}} pedestrian by using step length and step heading. A common method to estimate the heading in PDR is to use magnetometer measurements. However, unlike outdoor environments, the Earth’s magnetic field is strongly perturbed inside buildings making the magnetometer measurements unreliable for heading estimation. This paper presents a new method to reduce heading estimation errors when magnetometers are used. The method consists of two components. The first component uses a machine learning algorithm to detect whether a <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> is within a specific error margin. Only heading estimates within the error margin are retained and passed to the second component, while the other estimates are discarded. The second component uses data fusion to average the heading estimates from multiple people walking in the same direction. The rationale of this component is based on the observation that magnetic perturbations are often highly localised in space and if multiple people are walking in the same direction, then only some of their magnetometers are likely to be perturbed. Data fusion between users can be carried out in a distributed manner by using a consensus algorithm with information sharing over wireless links. We tested the performance of our method using 92 datasets. The method is shown to provide an average <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> error of approximately 2 °, which is more than 6 -fold lower than the error of the <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> based only on raw magnetometer measurements (without any filtering and fusion). Assuming highly accurate step-length observation, the improved heading estimation leads to an average localisation accuracy of 55 cm, which is an 80 % improvement over PDR localisation using only raw magnetometer measurements...|$|E

However, a neuronal-circuit architecture for computing heading remains unknown in any species. In this thesis, I describe a set of neurons in the Drosophila central complex whose wiring and physiology provide a means to shift an angular <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> when the fly turns. I show that these clockwise- and counterclockwise-shifting neurons each exist in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that suggest opposing roles for each subtype at the start and end of a turn. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the fly 2 ̆ 7 s heading in the dark, and their stimulation induces {{a shift in the}} heading signal in the expected direction. I also provide evidence that the angular position of visual landmarks is flexibly associated with the fly’s internal <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> as it explores its environment. A specific circuit-level model based on known cell types is proposed to account for this flexible association. The central features of the biological circuits described here are analogous to computational models proposed for headdirection cells in rodents and may inform how neural systems, in general, perform angular calculations...|$|E

40|$|GPS carrier-phase {{measurements}} {{from two}} GPS antennas {{can be used}} to calculate the heading of the baseline that can be drawn between the two antennas. An integer ambiguity problem has to be solved, and the system is called GPS attitude determination (GPSAD). This way of calculating the heading is cheaper than the traditional ways to do it, but it requires GPS reception. This thesis investigates how and if an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can support the GPS-based system, and divides the question into four problems: <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> during GPS outages, reducing the ambiguity search space, cycle slip detection and multipath mitigation. A relatively cheap IMU was used, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) was implemented to continue to supply heading estimates during GPS outages with a drift less than 1 /min in the studied case. When the GPS reception is good enough after an outage, the EKF supplies the GPSAD with an interval of the <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> to reduce the ambiguity search space. It has been investigated how to detect and deal with cycle slips, and the conclusion is that an IMU can help with detecting the slips, although nothing has been implemented. Multipath is still an issue, but some approaches to reduce the effect are suggested. The overall performance of the system is greatly increased {{with the help of an}} IMU. Performance increasing work can still be done, especially for the cooperation between the GPSAD and the EKF...|$|E

The sensor information used is a three-axis magnetic detector, true airspeed, angle of attack, barometric altitude, flight control rate gyros and load factor. The sensor data is fused together in an Extended Kalman filter (EKF). Each sensor by itself is of relatively poor quality.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{repeatedly}} that visual and inertial sensory information on the heading of self-motion is fused by the CNS {{in a manner consistent}} with Bayesian Integration (BI). However, a few studies report violations of BI predictions. This dichotomy in experimental findings previously led us to develop a Causal Inference model for multisensory heading estimation, which could account for different strategies of processing multisensory heading information, based on discrepancies between the heading of the visual and inertial cues. Surprisingly, the results of an assessment of this model showed that multisensory <b>heading</b> <b>estimates</b> were consistent with BI regardless of any discrepancy. Here, we hypothesized that Causal Inference is a slow-top down process, and that <b>heading</b> <b>estimates</b> for discrepant cues show less consistency with BI when motion duration increases. Six participants were presented with unisensory visual and inertial horizontal linear motions with headings ranging between ± 180 °, and combinations thereof with discrepancies up to ± 90 °. Motion profiles followed a single period of a raised cosine bell with a maximum velocity of 0. 3 m/s, and had durations of two, four, and six seconds. For each stimulus, participants provided an <b>estimate</b> of the <b>heading</b> of self-motion. In general, the results showed that the probability that <b>heading</b> <b>estimates</b> are consistent with BI decreases as a function of stimulus duration, consistent with the hypothesis. We conclude that BI is likely to be a default mode of processing multisensory heading information, and that Causal Inference is a slow top-down process that interferes only given enough time...|$|R

40|$|Personal {{tracking}} {{has become}} an integral part of many context-based applica- tions that rely on user’s current location to deliver their services. Although satellite- based Global Positioning System (GPS) is a popular tracking technology, it is not reliable in indoor and underground tracking scenarios due to the lack of line-of-sight to the satellites. Consequently, smartphone sensors, such as accelerometers and magnetometers, are increasingly being used as a GPS-less tracking solution in such environments. This thesis examines two important GPS-less tracking scenarios, one involving an indoor pedestrian and the other an underground train passenger. For the first case, it considers pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), which recursively updates the location of the pedestrian by using step length and step heading. A common method to estimate the heading in PDR is to use magnetometer measurements. However, unlike outdoor environments, the Earth’s magnetic field is strongly perturbed inside buildings making magnetometer measurements unreliable for <b>heading</b> <b>estimate.</b> This thesis presents a novel collaborative approach to reduce heading estimation errors when magnetometers are used. The proposed method consists of three components. The first component uses machine learning to detect whether a <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> is within a specific error margin. Only heading estimates within the error margin are retained and passed to the second component, which uses data fusion to average the heading estimates from multiple people walking in the same direction. The third component uses signal strengths of radio beacons transmitted by the users to detect the fellow pedestrians walking in the same direction. The rationale of this method is based on the observation that magnetic perturbations are often highly localised in space, and if multiple people are walking in the same direction, then only some of their magnetometers are likely to be perturbed. Extensive evaluations using real data show that the proposed collaborative magnetometer sensing can reduce heading error by 83 % and increase PDR tracking accuracy by 80 %, compared to existing PDR methods that do not use collaboration. For the second scenario, i. e. for tracking a train passenger, this thesis proposes to use vibration energy harvester (VEH) as a new sensor to identify a given train route. Our key hypothesis is that every train track creates unique vibration patterns that are reflected in VEH data. We exploit this unique and repeatable VEH pattern to identify individual train routes. Viability of the proposed VEH-based tracking is demonstrated by collecting passenger motion data along four distinct train routes in the city of Sydney. Because VEH does not consume any energy, the proposed VEH-based train route identification provides a more energy-efficient solution to personal tracking than existing accelerometer-based passenger tracking...|$|E

Guidance, navigation, and control algorithms are presented, enabling the M-UAS to autonomously explore cluttered indoor areas without relying on any off-board computation or external navigation aids such as GPS. The system uses a scanning laser rangefinder and a streamlined Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to provide a position and <b>heading</b> <b>estimate,</b> which is combined with other sensor data to form a six degree-of-freedom inertial navigation solution.

40|$|As {{arboreal}} primates {{move through}} the jungle, they are immersed in visual motion that they must distinguish from the movement of predators and prey. We recorded dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) cortical neuronal responses to visual motion stimuli simulating self-movement and object motion. MSTd neurons encode the heading of simulated self-movement in three-dimensional (3 -D) space. 3 -D heading responses can be evoked either by the large patterns of visual motion in optic flow or by the visual object motion seen when an observer passes an earth-fixed landmark. Responses to naturalistically combined optic flow and object motion depend on their relative directions: an object moving {{as part of the}} optic flow field has little effect on neuronal responses. In contrast, an object moving separately from the optic flow field has large effects, decreasing the amplitude of the population response and shifting the population’s <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> to match the direction of object motion as the object moves toward central vision. These effects parallel those seen in human heading perception with minimal effects of objects moving with the optic flow and substantial effects of objects violating the optic flow. We conclude that MSTd can contribute to navigation by supporting 3 -D heading estimation, potentially switching from optic flow to object cues when a moving object passes in front of the observer...|$|E

40|$|Human heading {{perception}} {{based on}} optic flow {{is not only}} accurate, it is also remarkably robust and stable. These qualities are especially apparent when observers move through environments containing other moving objects, which introduce optic flow that is inconsistent with observer self-motion and therefore uninformative about heading direction. Moving objects may also occupy large portions of the visual field and occlude regions of the background optic flow that are most informative about heading perception. The fact that heading perception is biased {{by no more than}} a few degrees under such conditions attests to the robustness of the visual system and warrants further investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether recurrent, competitive dynamics among MSTd neurons that serve to reduce uncertainty about heading over time offer a plausible mechanism for capturing the robustness of human heading perception. Simulations of existing heading models that do not contain competitive dynamics yield heading estimates that are far more erratic and unstable than human judgments. We present a dynamical model of primate visual areas V 1, MT, and MSTd based on that of Layton, Mingolla, and Browning that is similar to the other models, except that the model includes recurrent interactions among model MSTd neurons. Competitive dynamics stabilize the model's <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> over time, even when a moving object crosses the future path.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in smartphone technology have increased user demand for indoors applications. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Inertial Navigation System (INS) {{are the two}} advanced systems for navigation technology. However, it is still difficult for GNSS to provide an accurate and practical navigation solution, especially in environments {{with little or no}} signal availability. These failings should be easy to overcome; because of their portability and multiple embedded hardware sensors, smartphones seem well positioned to make pedestrian navigation easy and convenient in any environment. Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) {{is one of the most}} commonly used technologies used for pedestrian navigation, but it is not always accurate because its positioning errors tend to accumulate over time. Therefore, this research introduces a new tool to overcome this failing; a Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacon can maintain and improve the accuracy of PDR. Moreover, a BLE beacon can be initialized from any user position in an indoor environment. The random and unpredictable positions of pedestrians inevitably result in the degradation of navigation guidance systems’ data. To rectify this problem, we have implemented activity recognition technology to notify the proposed system so as to provide a more accurate <b>heading</b> <b>estimate.</b> This study proposes a Personal Navigation System (PNS) based on this technology; it can estimate navigation solutions in real time and combines the advantages of PDR and Bluetooth positioning technology. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the system and the efficacy of our proposed algorithms. Preliminary results show the average relative precision of PDR to be about 2. 5 %, when using a mobile hand-held device. The error of initial position from 2 -D beacon positioning is less than two meters.

40|$|Human body {{motion capture}} systems based on {{inertial}} sensors (gyroscopes andaccelerometers) {{are able to}} track the relative motions in the body precisely, oftenwith the aid of supplementary sensors. The sensor measurements are combinedthrough a sensor fusion algorithm to create estimates of, among other parame-ters, position, velocity and orientation for each body segment. As this algorithmrequires integration of noisy measurements, some drift, especially in the positionestimate, is expected. Taking advantage of the knowledge about the tracked sub-ject, a human body, models have been developed that improve the estimates, butposition still displays drift over time. In this thesis, a GNSS receiver {{is added to the}} motion capture system to givea drift-free measurement of the position as well as a velocity measurement. Theinertial data and the GNSS data complements each other well, particularly interms of observability of global and relative motions. To enable the models of thehuman body at an early stage of the fusion of sensor data, an optimization basedmaximum a posteriori algorithm was used, which is also better suited for thenonlinear system tracked compared to the conventional method of using Kalmanfilters. One of the models that improves the position estimate greatly, without addingadditional sensing, is the contact detection, with which the velocity of a segmentis set to zero whenever it is considered stationary in comparison to the surround-ing environment, e. g. when a foot touches the ground. This thesis looks at botha scenario when this contact detection can be applied and a scenario where itcannot be applied, to see what possibilities an addition of GNSS sensor couldbring to the human body motion tracking case. The results display a notable im-provement in position, both with and without contact detection. Furthermore,the <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> is improved at a full-body scale and the solution makes theestimates depend less on acceleration bias estimation.

40|$|The retinal flow during normal {{locomotion}} contains components due to {{rotation and}} {{translation of the}} observer. The translatory part of the flow-pattern is informative of heading, because it radiates outward {{from the direction of}} heading. However, it is not directly accessible from the retinal flow. Nevertheless, humans can perceive their direction of heading from the compound retinal flow without need for extra-retinal signals that indicate the rotation. Two classes of models have been proposed to explain the visual decomposition of the retinal flow into its constituent parts. One type relies on local operations to remove the rotational part of the flow field. The other type explicitly determines the direction and magnitude of the rotation from the global retinal flow, for subsequent removal. According to the former model, nearby points are most reliable for estimating one's heading. In the latter type of model the quality of the <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> depends on the accuracy with which the ego-rotation is determined and is therefore most reliable when based on the most distant points. We report that subjects underestimate the eccentricity of heading, relative to the fixated point in the ground plane, when the visible range of the ground plane is reduced. Moreover we find that in perception of heading, humans can tolerate more noise than the optimal observer (in the least squares sense) would do if only using optic flow. The latter finding argues against both schemes because ultimately both classes of model are limited in their noise tolerance to that of the optimal observer, which uses all information available in the optic flow. Apparently humans use more information than is present in the optic flow. Both aspects of human performance are consistent with the use of static depth information in addition to the optic flow to select the most distant points. Processing of the flow of these selected points provides the most reliable estimate of the ego-rotation. Subsequent estimates of the heading direction, obtained from the translatory component of the flow, are robust with respect to noise. In such a scheme heading estimates are subject to systematic errors, similar to those reported, if the most distant points are not much further away than the fixation point, because the ego-rotation is underestimated...|$|E

This thesis is about a robust filtering method known as the interval Kalman filter (IKF), an extension of the Kalman filter (KF) to the domain of interval mathematics. The key limitation of the KF is that it requires precise knowledge of the system dynamics and associated stochastic processes. In many cases however, system models are at best, only approximately known. To overcome this limitation, the idea is to describe the uncertain model coefficients in terms of bounded intervals, and operate the filter within the framework of interval arithmetic. In trying to do so, practical difficulties arise, such as the large overestimation of the resulting set estimates owing to the over conservatism of interval arithmetic. This thesis proposes and demonstrates a novel and effective way to limit such overestimation for the IKF, making it feasible and practical to implement. The theory developed is of general application, but is applied in this work to the heading estimation of the Springer unmanned surface vehicle, which up to now relied solely on the estimates from a traditional KF. However, the IKF itself simply provides the range of possible vehicle headings. In practice, the autonomous steering system requires a single, point-valued estimate of the heading. In order to address this requirement, an innovative approach based on the use of machine learning methods to select an adequate point-valued estimate has been developed. In doing so, the so called weighted IKF (wIKF) estimate provides a single <b>heading</b> <b>estimate</b> that is robust to bounded model uncertainty. In addition, in order to exploit low-cost sensor redundancy, a multi-sensor data fusion algorithm compatible with the wIKF estimates and which additionally provides sensor fault tolerance has been developed. All these techniques have been implemented on the Springer platform and verified experimentally in a series of full-scale trials, presented in the last chapter of the thesis. The outcomes demonstrate that the methods are both feasible and practicable, and that they are far more effective in providing accurate estimates of the vehicle’s heading than the conventional KF when there is uncertainty in the system model and/or sensor failure occurs.

Procedures for determining the speed of travel and heading were developed by simulating tracks and then adding Fastloc-GPS location errors. The levels of detail achievable for speed and <b>heading</b> <b>estimates</b> were illustrated by using empirical Fastloc-GPS data for a green turtle (Chelonia mydas, Linnaeus, 1758) travelling over 3000 km across the Indian Ocean.

These values improved to 18 and 70 m, respectively, when 6 satellites were used. Simulations indicated that for animals travelling around 2 · 5 km h- 1 (e. g. turtles, penguins and seals) and depending on the number of satellites used in the location calculation, robust speed and <b>heading</b> <b>estimates</b> would usually be obtained for locations only 1 - 6 h apart.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a head pose and facial feature estimation technique that works {{over a wide}} range of pose variations without a priori knowledge of the appearance of the face. Using simple LK trackers, <b>head</b> pose is <b>estimated</b> by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) pose estimation using the feature tracking as constraints. Factored sampling and RANSAC are employed to both provide a robust pose estimate and identify tracker drift by constraining outliers in the estimation process. The system provides both a <b>head</b> pose <b>estimate</b> and the position of facial features and is capable of tracking {{over a wide range}} of head poses. 1...|$|R

Nevertheless with noisy sensor signals and high hand dynamics, estimating accurate attitude angles remains a challenge for achieving long term positioning accuracy. A new attitude estimation algorithm based on a quaternion parameterization directly in the state vector and two opportunistic updates, i. e. magnetic angular rate update and acceleration gradient update, is proposed. The benefit of this method is assessed both at the theoretical level and at the experimental level. The error on the <b>heading,</b> <b>estimated</b> only with the PDR navigation algorithms, is found to less than 7 ° after 1 km of walk...|$|R
