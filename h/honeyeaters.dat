5|$|<b>Honeyeaters</b> {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which <b>honeyeaters</b> are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, <b>honeyeaters</b> have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E
5|$|<b>Honeyeaters</b> such as {{the eastern}} spinebill are {{attracted}} to the flowers. As the bird gathers the nectar, the pollen, which has fins, attaches itself to the feathers on {{the heads of the}} birds and is carried to other flowers, aiding cross pollination. A study in forests near Hobart in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area {{at the same time the}} common heath was in flower in March, and left once flowering had finished. Other <b>honeyeaters,</b> {{such as the}} strong-billed, crescent and yellow-throated <b>honeyeaters,</b> fed occasionally at common heath flowers. Field work in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia recorded the white-plumed and New Holland <b>honeyeaters,</b> as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house mouse (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's <b>honeyeaters.</b> Several other <b>honeyeaters</b> were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned <b>honeyeaters,</b> noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced <b>honeyeaters</b> and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E

50|$|The Fiji wattled <b>honeyeater</b> or {{northern}} wattled <b>honeyeater</b> (Foulehaio taviunensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>honeyeater</b> family Meliphagidae. It was considered conspecific with the Polynesian wattled <b>honeyeater</b> and the kikau.|$|R
50|$|The grey-eared <b>honeyeater</b> or dark-brown <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichmera incana) is a {{passerine}} bird of the <b>honeyeater</b> family {{which is}} found in Vanuatu and New Caledonia in the south-west Pacific. It is sometimes known as the silver-eared <b>honeyeater</b> but this name is also used for the silver-eared <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichmera alboauricularis) of New Guinea.|$|R
5|$|<b>Honeyeaters</b> are {{a diverse}} and {{widespread}} group of nectar and insect-eating birds found across Australia and surrounding regions. Eleven species {{are found in}} Tasmania, of which four are endemic, including Australia's largest honeyeater, the yellow wattlebird.|$|E
5|$|<b>Honeyeaters</b> {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, <b>honeyeaters</b> end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} has shown <b>honeyeaters</b> {{to be related}} to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large Meliphagoidea superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species that}} have been {{observed}} foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Lewin's <b>honeyeater</b> (Meliphaga lewinii), brown <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichmera indistincta), tawny-crowned <b>honeyeater</b> (Gliciphila melanops), yellow-faced <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-plumed <b>honeyeater</b> (L.penicillatus), white-cheeked <b>honeyeater</b> (Phylidonyris niger), New Holland <b>honeyeater</b> (P.novaehollandiae), noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus), noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants. The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire.|$|R
50|$|Other {{common names}} for the {{crescent}} <b>honeyeater</b> include chinawing, Egypt and horseshoe <b>honeyeater.</b> Gould called it the Tasmanian <b>honeyeater.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mangrove}} <b>honeyeater</b> (Gavicalis fasciogularis) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>honeyeater</b> family Meliphagidae. The species was once considered to be conspecific with the varied <b>honeyeater,</b> but it is now treated as a separate species. These two species form a superspecies with the singing <b>honeyeater.</b>|$|R
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater is {{generally}} {{held to be}} {{the only member of the}} genus, although its plumage suggests an affinity with <b>honeyeaters</b> of the genus Melithreptus. It has been classified in that genus by Glen Storr, although others felt it more closely related to wattlebirds (Anthochaera) or miners (Manorina). A 2004 molecular study has resolved it as close to Melithreptus after all. Molecular clock estimates indicate the blue-faced honeyeater diverged from the Melithreptus <b>honeyeaters</b> somewhere between 12.8 and 6.4 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. It differs from them in its much larger size, brighter plumage, more gregarious nature and larger patch of bare facial skin.|$|E
5|$|The shrub {{grows on}} sandy soils in {{seasonally}} wet lowland {{areas as well}} as hills and dunes. It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground lignotuber. Pollinators include <b>honeyeaters,</b> particularly the western spinebill, which can access the nectar with its long curved bill, and the silvereye, which punctures the flower tube. The most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia, it has a long flowering period and attracts <b>honeyeaters</b> to the garden. It is harvested for the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, {{and it is}} {{much larger than the}} similarly coloured Melithreptus <b>honeyeaters.</b> Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-spotted <b>honeyeater</b> co-exists {{with the}} graceful <b>honeyeater.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} fed at (and pollinated by) {{a range of}} <b>honeyeater</b> species, {{including}} the white-cheeked <b>honeyeater</b> (Phylidonyris nigra), brown <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichmera indistincta), spiny-cheeked <b>honeyeater</b> (Acanthagenys rufogularis), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) and western wattlebird (A. lunulata). Carnaby's black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) eat seed from follicles, dropping old flower cones around the plant.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, taxonomists {{had placed}} pied <b>honeyeater</b> (Certhionyx variegatus), banded <b>honeyeater</b> (Cissomela pectoralis) and black <b>honeyeater</b> (Sugomel nigrum) in the genus Certhionyx, however revised DNA {{analysis}} indicates that these species are not closely related (Driskell & Christidis (2004). Christidis and Boles placed the pied <b>honeyeater</b> in the clade Acanthagenys {{in its own}} monotypic genus.|$|R
5|$|Analysis of DNA {{showed that}} the closest {{relative}} of the red wattlebird is the yellow wattlebird of Tasmania, the pair splitting from the ancestor of the regent honeyeater—their next closest relative. <b>Honeyeaters</b> {{are related to the}} Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large Meliphagoidea superfamily.|$|E
5|$|The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) {{belongs to}} the <b>honeyeaters,</b> a group of birds found mainly in Australia and New Guinea which have highly {{developed}} brush-tipped tongues adapted for nectar feeding. It is a medium-small brownish bird, with yellow-olive panels in the tail and wing and a yellow tuft behind the eye.|$|E
5|$|The fairywrens are {{a family}} of small, insectivorous {{passerine}} birds endemic to Australia and New Guinea. Most closely related to <b>honeyeaters</b> and pardalotes, they are {{more closely related to}} crows than to true wrens of the Northern Hemisphere. Two species are native to Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a member}} of the genus Melithreptus with several species, of similar size and all black-headed apart from this species, in the <b>honeyeater</b> family Meliphagidae. Molecular markers show the brown-headed <b>honeyeater</b> is most closely related to the black-chinned <b>honeyeater,</b> with the strong-billed <b>honeyeater</b> an earlier {{offshoot}} between 6.7 and 3.4 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Gilbert's <b>honeyeater</b> (Melithreptus chloropsis), {{also known}} as the Swan River <b>honeyeater</b> or western white-naped <b>honeyeater,</b> is a {{passerine}} bird of the <b>honeyeater</b> family Meliphagidae native to south-western Australia. A mid-sized <b>honeyeater,</b> it is olive green above and white below, with a black head, nape and throat and a white patch over the eye and a white crescent-shaped patch on the nape. The bill is brownish-black and the eyes a dull red. The sexes have similar plumage.|$|R
50|$|The common smoky <b>honeyeater</b> (Melipotes fumigatus) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>honeyeater</b> family Meliphagidae. It {{is one of four}} species in the genus Melipotes, all closely related and forming a superspecies. After another similar species, the wattled smoky <b>honeyeater,</b> was {{discovered}} in 2005 in the Foja Mountains it has also been called the common smoky <b>honeyeater.</b>|$|R
5|$|The flowers hold profuse {{amounts of}} nectar and are pollinated by <b>honeyeaters.</b> Although L.formosa is {{uncommon}} in cultivation, it is straightforward {{to grow in}} soils with good drainage and a partly shaded to sunny aspect. It is readily propagated by seed. Unlike all {{other members of the}} genus Lambertia, L.formosa is greatly resistant to the soil pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so <b>honeyeaters</b> are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, <b>honeyeaters</b> tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where <b>honeyeaters</b> move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller <b>honeyeaters.</b> This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E
