5|$|Vegetation {{clearing}} and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation, which fill in pools, degrade river ecosystems and make {{rivers and streams}} uninhabitable for Murray cod. This <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> removal of riparian (riverbank) vegetation which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial {{members on the}} Council may also pose additional problems. There is a possibility of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a quasi-judicial role. There may be confusion as regards the legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Abnormalities of diastolic function, {{ranging from}} {{asymptomatic}} heart disease to overt heart failure, {{are common in}} hypertensive patients. Patients with diastolic heart failure have a preserved ejection fraction, which {{is a measure of}} systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction is an early consequence of hypertension-related heart disease and <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Light pollution, {{also known}} as photopollution, is the {{presence}} of anthropogenic light in the night environment. It <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> excessive, misdirected or obtrusive uses of light, but even carefully used light fundamentally alters natural conditions. As a major side-effect of urbanization, it is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments.|$|E
25|$|People with schizophrenia, {{schizoaffective}} disorder or bipolar disorder {{may have a}} predisposition to metabolic syndrome that <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, possible limited access to care, and antipsychotic drug-induced adverse effects.

25|$|Wife beating {{was made}} illegal nationally in the United States by 1920. Although the exact rates are disputed, {{there is a}} large body of {{cross-cultural}} evidence that women are subjected to domestic violence significantly more often than men.

25|$|The {{spread of}} HIV in Mexico <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> stigma and discrimination, which {{act as a}} barrier to prevention, testing and treatment. Stigmatization occurs within families, in health services, with the police, and in the workplace. A study {{conducted}} by Infante-Xibille in 2004 of 373 health care providers in three Mexican states described discrimination within the health services. Testing was conducted only with perceived high-risk groups (often without informed consent), and AIDS patients were often isolated.|$|E

Virtually {{none of the}} receivers made before 2008 support the new codec, however, thus making them partially obsolete once DAB+ broadcasts begin and completely obsolete once the old MPEG-1 Layer 2 stations are switched off. Most new receivers are both DAB and DAB+ compatible; however, the issue <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> some manufacturers disabling the DAB+ features on otherwise compatible radios to save on licensing fees when sold in countries without current DAB+ broadcasts.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this, {{one of which is}} the lax {{attitude}} some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in {{a significant impact on the}} bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.|$|E
25|$|Although Gremlins share {{numerous}} {{parts and}} components with other AMC models, finding parts for a restoration project can be difficult. This <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that}} many Gremlins were chopped up during the late 1970s and the 1980s to make dirt-track racers. The body of choice on the dirt circuit was the Gremlin and AMC Eagle. The subcompact bodies fit Modified chassis and of special interest was the Gremlin's slab top and sides with a contour that was easy to duplicate in sheet metal.|$|E
25|$|In {{this article}} {{constant}} pressure blackout and shallow water blackout refers to blackouts {{in shallow water}} following hyperventilation and ascent blackout and deep water blackout refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that in}} the case of blackout on ascent, hyperventilation induced hypocapnia also may be a contributory factor even if depressurisation on ascent is the actual precipitator.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Army camps and {{facilities}} {{designed by the}} Corps of Engineers, including the former Camp O'Ryan in New York State, have reportedly had {{a negative impact on}} the surrounding communities. Camp O'Ryan, with its rifle range, has possibly contaminated well and storm runoff water with lead. This runoff water eventually runs into the Niagara River and Lake Ontario, sources of drinking water to millions of people. This situation <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> a failure to locate the engineering and architectural plans for the camp, which were produced by the New York District in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage.|$|E
25|$|The main {{land use}} within {{the site is}} grazing by sheep. Deer grazing is also common. The woods in the park are {{currently}} severely overgrazed by sika deer. Grazing has caused damage to many terrestrial habitats, causing heath and blanket bogs to degrade and preventing woodland regeneration. In the upland areas erosion caused by grazing <b>is</b> <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> the exposed nature of the terrain. Pressures from native grazers like red deer and Irish hare have increased since their main natural predators, the wolf and golden eagle, became extinct. Grazing and disturbance of vegetation greatly aids the spread of rhododendron.|$|E
