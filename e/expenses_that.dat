25|$|The {{additional}} support {{provided by the}} Japanese government has rapidly expanded since 1978. Although initially handled on an ad hoc basis, since 1987 the US and Japanese governments have signed a series of Special Measures Agreements (SMA) formally establishing the Japanese commitment of support. The most recent SMA, covering the five-year period from 2011–2015, was signed in January 2011. The agreements cover the categories of <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> will {{be paid for by}} the Japanese government rather than specify specific monetary amounts.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{distinguished}} {{the payment}} {{that had been}} ordered in this case from <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> a State might incidentally incur after an injunction is issued in order to comply; the costs of post-judgment compliance are ancillary, whereas the costs of making up for pre-judgment non-compliance were more like an award of damages to the plaintiff.

25|$|In October 1946, Stanley {{approached}} fur-dealer Cyril Ross, {{the common}} acquaintance from the Manchester train, {{with a business}} proposition.

Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for floatation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E
25|$|Most Democrats {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{the courts and the}} National Labor Relations Board have applied the duty of fair {{representation}} to regulate the manner in which unions enforce the union security provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Unlike the standard applied to unions' decisions concerning grievance handling and collective bargaining negotiations, the courts and the Board have regulated this area very extensively. They have specified the types of <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> a union can include in the fees that it charges employees who choose not to join the union but are required to pay dues under an agency shop or union shop clause, the accounting procedures used to calculate those amounts, the procedures which the union and employees must follow if an individual worker objects to paying the full amount of dues or challenges the union's calculation of the lesser amount that non-members can be required to pay, and the procedures that the union must follow before it can force the employer to fire an employee for non-payment of dues. Even stricter standards are applied to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act and to unions of governmental employees on constitutional grounds.|$|E

25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E

Still, in 1952 Berg was hired by the CIA to use his old contacts from World War II to gather information about the Soviet atomic science. For the $10,000 plus <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> Berg received, the CIA received nothing in return. The CIA officer who spoke with Berg when he returned from Europe said that he was [...] "flaky". Berg continued to serve his assignment for the CIA until 1954, when his contract expired. The CIA chose not to renew it. Berg tried again to serve the CIA and the CIA again declined.|$|E

[...] They decried the short-term <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> would be borne by Castile and questioned the role of Castile in this new political framework, given the possibility that the land would become a mere imperial province. [...] The situation erupted when the royal government summoned the most radical of the city councilors away from the city, intending to send back more easily controllable replacements on a royal salary. [...] The order came on April 15; one day later, as the councilors prepared to leave, a large crowd opposed to the departure rioted and drove out the royal administrators instead. [...] A citizen's committee was elected under the leadership of Juan López de Padilla and Pedro Laso de la Vega, naming themselves a Comunidad. [...] On April 21, the remaining administrators were driven from the fortifications of the Alcázar of Toledo.|$|E

[...] In 1694, the nearby city of Poznań listed a bill for <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> included entries for [...] "Grodzisk beer" [...] at the rate of 15 guilders per barrel that had been purchased as gifts for important people. [...] At that cost, {{it can be seen that}} the product was valued as a premium beverage, since local beer produced in Poznań at the time cost only five to six guilders per barrel. [...] Other records from Poznań in 1712 show that the two mayors of the city were receiving Grodziskie beer as a portion of their compensation for their service. [...] By the 18th century, the beverage's reputation had spread throughout Poland, and it became one of the most expensive beers in the country.|$|E

500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel {{or any of the other}} <b>expenses</b> <b>that</b> are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
