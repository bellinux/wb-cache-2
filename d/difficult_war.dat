25|$|In November, Napoleon {{directed}} {{the bulk of}} the Grande Armée across the Pyrenees and dealt a series of devastating blows to the vacillating Spanish forces, receiving the surrender of Madrid in scarcely a month's time. Fate was particularly cruel to the victors of Bailén: Castaños was himself routed by Marshal Lannes at the Battle of Tudela in November 1808, while Reding was ridden down and trampled by the French cavalry at the Battle of Valls in 1809, dying of his wounds. Marshal Soult overran much of Andalusia the following year and on January 21, 1810, his men recovered the lost Eagles from the cathedral of Bailén. Before long, only Cádiz remained firmly in Spanish hands, and a <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> lay ahead to drive the invader from Spain.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Teuta in 229 BC, Demetrius {{was well}} {{prepared}} for the Roman invasion. He first placed a garrison in Dimallum, an Illyrian city-fortress from Apollonia. He eliminated his opponents in other places, those Illyrians who opposed his rule, and stationed 6,000 of his best forces on his home island Pharos. As before, both consuls of the year accompanied the Roman expedition, but the leading role was given to Aemilius Paullus, who was to be killed in the great Roman disaster at Cannae three years later. The Adriatic took on particular importance in Rome's preparations for the Second Punic War which was to last from 218 to 201 BC. Anticipating a long and <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> far away from Rome, the Roman Senate decided first to set matters right in Illyria.|$|E
50|$|Through his {{wars and}} the glory of Versailles, Louis became, to a certain degree, the arbiter of taste and power in Europe and both his château and the {{etiquette}} in Versailles were copied by the other European courts. Yet the <b>difficult</b> <b>wars</b> {{at the end of}} his long reign and the religious problems created by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes made his last years dark ones.|$|R

2500|$|The Steuben Society {{was founded}} in 1919 as [...] "an educational, fraternal, and {{patriotic}} organization of American citizens of German background". In the <b>difficult</b> post-World <b>War</b> I years the Society helped the German-American community to reorganize. It {{is now one of}} the largest organizations for Americans of German descent.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{establishment}} of Soviet rule in Baku in April 1920, Ordzhonikidze, probably acting on his own initiative, advanced on Georgia {{in support of a}} planned Bolshevik coup in Tbilisi. When the coup failed, the Georgian government was able to concentrate all its forces on successfully blocking the Soviet advance over the Georgian-Azerbaijani border. Facing a <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> with Poland, Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin ordered a start to negotiations with Georgia. In the Treaty of Moscow signed on 7 May 1920, Soviet Russia recognized Georgia's independence and concluded a non-aggression pact. The treaty established the existing borders between the two nations de jure and also obliged Georgia to surrender all third-party elements considered hostile by Moscow. In a secret supplement, Georgia promised to legalize the local Bolshevik party.|$|E
25|$|The wartime {{years from}} 1939 to 1945 was a {{metamorphosis}} for the creative print movement. The First Thursday Society, which {{was crucial to}} the postwar revival of Japanese prints, was formed in 1939 through the groups of people who gathered {{in the house of}} Kōshirō Onchi in Tokyo. The group met once a month to discuss subjects of woodblock prints. First initial members included Gen Yamaguchi (1896–1976) and Jun'ichirō Sekino (1914–1988). American connoisseurs Ernst Hacker, William Hartnett and Oliver Statler also attended. They revived Western interest in Japanese prints in the form of creative print movement. The First Thursday Collection (Ichimoku-shū), a collection of prints by members to circulate to each other, was produced in 1944. Such a group and publication provided comradeship and a venue for artistic exchange and nourishment during the <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> years when resource was scarce and censorship severe.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{served on}} the Virginia governor's Council of State from 1777 to 1779, at which point {{he was elected to}} the Congress of the Confederation. The country faced a <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> against Great Britain, as well as runaway inflation, {{financial}} troubles, and lack of cooperation between the different levels of government. Madison worked to make himself an expert on financial issues, becoming deeply involved in congressional committees, becoming a legislative workhorse and a master of parliamentary coalition building. Frustrated by the failure of the states to supply needed requisitions, Madison proposed a standing army, a permanent navy, and the ability of Congress to compel states to meet their war-time obligations. Madison also persuaded Virginia to give up its claims to northwestern territories—consisting of most of modern-day Ohio and points west—to the Continental Congress. After serving Congress from 1781 to 1783, Madison won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.|$|E
5000|$|The {{organisation}} {{was widely}} derided as a bureaucratic [...] "talking shop" [...] with little power. It struggled {{to enforce its}} decisions, and its lack of armed force made intervention exceedingly <b>difficult.</b> Civil <b>wars</b> in Nigeria and Angola continued unabated for years, and the OAU could do nothing to stop them.|$|R

50|$|When Napoleon {{expelled}} the Bourbons from Spain, {{he placed}} Joseph {{on the throne}} and gave the throne of Naples to Marshal Murat, former Commander-in-Chief of the French troops in Spain and husband of Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister.

2500|$|... "Almost {{a quarter}} century ago, {{a third world country}} won the final battle of a long and <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> through the use of an {{unexpected}} and decidedly modern strategy. The tutorial embodied in this victory is worth remembering today, in an age when {{there is a tendency to}} rely more on technology than on strategy and to assume that our enemy's strategic skills are as backward as his nation's economy, social structure and technological base...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{he has been}} criticized for being anti-Israeli and {{supporting}} Palestinian radicalism. [...] "Is it wrong to ask of reporters in a country that {{is in the midst of}} a <b>difficult</b> <b>war</b> to show a little more empathy for their people and their country?" [...] asked Amnon Dankner of the Maariv newspaper. Ben-Dror Yemini, the editor of the opinion page of Maariv, called Levy one of the [...] "propagandists for the Hamas". Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, wrote [...] " [...] the current Israeli heroes , from whom the Palestinians garner support for their ways, [...] Gideon Levy...." [...] In 2008, Arutz Sheva reported that Levy's article about the Jerusalem bulldozer attack was translated into Arabic for a Hamas website. In 2006, Gideon Ezra, Israel's former deputy Minister of Internal Security, suggested that the General Security Services should monitor Levy as a borderline security risk.|$|E

Vanderveer had long been succeeded by two other pastors when, in 1848, the church reported to the classis that it had increased its membership by 85 people since that time. In 1854 L.L. Comfort took over as pastor; he would oversee the church during the <b>difficult</b> Civil <b>War</b> years. Afterwards, in 1870, he composed a hymn to mark the church's centennial.|$|R

25|$|Eventually, Rome annexed Corsica and Sardinia by revisiting {{the terms}} of the treaty that ended the first Punic War. As Carthage was under siege and engaged in a <b>difficult</b> civil <b>war,</b> they grudgingly {{accepted}} the loss of these islands and the subsequent Roman conditions for ongoing peace, which also increased the war indemnity levied against Carthage after the first Punic War. This eventually plunged relations between the two powers to a new low point.|$|R
