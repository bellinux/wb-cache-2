50|$|The Mk 67 {{submarine}} launched {{mobile mine}} {{is based on}} a Mark 37 torpedo body. It entered service in 1983 and is capable of swimming as far as 10 miles through or into a channel, harbor, shallow water area and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to the vessel laying it. After reaching the target area it sinks to the sea bed and acts like a conventionally laid <b>influence</b> <b>mine.</b> The exploder in the Mk 67 warhead is computerised and incorporates magnetic, acoustic and pressure sensors.|$|E

50|$|The Stonefish <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> is {{manufactured}} by a British company (BAE Systems). Originally, the weapon was supplied to the Royal Navy, {{but it has}} also been exported to friendly countries such as Australia, which has both warstock and training versions of Stonefish. There has been conjecture that South Africa, Chile, Iraq, Libya and possibly other countries may have gained access to either some early Stonefish information or to similar technology. The mine is named after the stonefish, a venomous fish of the same name.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{influence}} mines {{are designed}} to discriminate against false inputs and are therefore much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed {{to respond to the}} unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately guess and mimic the required target signature in order to trigger detonation. The task is {{complicated by the fact that}} an <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.|$|E
50|$|Later, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled {{plates and}} broken backs. This {{appeared}} {{to be due to}} a new type of mine, detecting ships by their proximity to the mine (an <b>influence</b> <b>mine)</b> and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the shock wave of the explosion. Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and Churchill ordered the intact recovery of one of these new mines to be of the highest priority.|$|E
50|$|Ajonpää and Kallanpää {{were bought}} from Denmark during the Continuation War and were {{intended}} for clearing <b>influence</b> <b>mines.</b> Both ships survived the wars, Ajonpää was retired 1960 and Kallanpää on 1962.|$|R
50|$|When <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> {{are laid}} in an ocean minefield, {{they may have}} various {{combinations}} of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures {{which may or may}} not overlap. The fuzes on <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.|$|R

50|$|However, a British company (BAE Systems) does {{manufacture}} the Stonefish <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> {{for export}} to friendly {{countries such as}} Australia, which has both war stock and training versions of Stonefish, in addition to stocks of smaller Italian MN103 Manta mines. The computerised fuze on a Stonefish mine contains acoustic, magnetic and water pressure displacement target detection sensors. Stonefish can be deployed by fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, surface vessels and submarines. An optional kit is available to allow Stonefish to be air-dropped, comprising an aerodynamic tail-fin section and parachute pack to retard the weapon's descent. The operating depth of Stonefish ranges between 30 and 200 metres. The mine weighs 990 kilograms and contains a 600 kilogram aluminised PBX explosive warhead.|$|E
50|$|The {{mines in}} SPMB {{are stored in}} {{palletized}} containers housed inside the vehicle. A burying mechanism is installed at {{the stern of the}} vehicle. The commander can select the type of mine from a panel and it moves on a conveyor belt. An arming device arms the mines before it is buried in the ground. The system carry around 480 mines and can bury 240 mines in an hour.The SPMB can lay four types of anti-tank mines such as ND MK-1, Indian magnetic <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> Adrushy mine MK-I, Adrushy mine-II and French electrically fuzed HPD F2. The prototype of the system has been developed and as of 2009 it was in trials.|$|E
50|$|First {{used during}} the First World War, their use became more general in the Second World War. The sophistication of <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> fuzes has {{increased}} considerably {{over the years as}} first transistors and then microprocessors have been incorporated into designs. Simple magnetic sensors have been superseded by total-field magnetometers. Whereas early magnetic mine fuzes would respond only to changes in a single component of a target vessel's magnetic field, a total field magnetometer responds to changes in the magnitude of the total background field (thus enabling it to better detect even degaussed ships). Similarly, the original broadband hydrophones of 1940s acoustic mines (which operate on the integrated volume of all frequencies) have been replaced by narrow-band sensors which are much more sensitive and selective. Mines can now be programmed to listen for highly specific acoustic signatures (e.g. a gas turbine powerplant or cavitation sounds from a particular design of propeller) and ignore all others. The sophistication of modern electronic mine fuzes incorporating these digital signal processing capabilities makes it much more difficult to detonate the mine with electronic countermeasures because several sensors working together (e.g. magnetic, passive acoustic and water pressure) allow it to ignore signals which are not recognised as being the unique signature of an intended target vessel.|$|E

5000|$|At {{approximately}} 09:20, when Rich {{was about}} 300 yd from the minesweeper , {{which was in}} the process of taking Glennon in tow, a mine exploded 50 yd off Richs starboard beam. This tripped circuit breakers, knocked out the ship's lighting, shook up the ship hard, and knocked sailors off their feet, but caused no structural damage. Within a minute, the engine room reported that they were [...] "ready to answer all bells". Three minutes later, a second mine went off directly under the ship. Approximately 50 ft of her stern was blown off, from frame 130 aft, just aft of the 1.1 in mount in 'X' position. Even though the blown-off stern section caught fire, survivors clung to her wreckage, and it sank shortly afterward. There was a 3 ft sag in the main deck, and two torpedoes ran hot in their tubes. A third mine — another <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> — exploded below the ice machine room forward, delivering the final blow two minutes later. The forward section was totally wrecked, the flying bridge demolished, and forward fire room severely damaged, and the mast came crashing down. Life rafts were ordered cut loose, and Rich was ordered abandoned. Several PT boats in a squadron commanded by Lt. Cdr. John D. Bulkeley came alongside Rich to take off personnel. All this time, they were being shelled by German shore batteries. A few minutes later, she sank in about 40 ft of water at [...] Of her crew, 27 were killed, 73 were wounded, and 64 were missing; in all, 91 were killed outright or died of wounds following their rescue. Rich was the only American destroyer escort lost in the invasion force. Lt. Cdr. Michel — who suffered a broken leg — was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism in the incident.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in concern from the public regarding the mental health and wellbeing of mine workers. This has been mainly due the incidence of suicide with the Fly-in, Fly-out (FIFO) mine worker population as well as the high turnover rate of employees. Investigating the stressors and buffers that <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> worker job and relationship satisfaction with regards to differing work rosters will provide a better understanding of mine worker wellbeing. A total of 171 participants (81 male, 90 female) who were over 18 years of age and worked within the mining industry in Australia were recruited to participate within this study. Three distinct profiles were created indicating satisfaction levels for different work structures. Work factors were more likely to influence residential mine employee work satisfaction whilst social connectedness and support systems were important for long roster FIFO employee's work satisfaction. A work satisfaction profile could not be generated for the short roster FIFO employee but instead a balance between work and life was found to be important short roster FIFO employee relationship satisfaction. These findings have implications for workplaces in the management employee wellbeing as work rosters can be used to tailor support systems towards individual needs...|$|E
40|$|The Sikorsky H- 60 {{airframe}} {{is planned}} {{to be the only}} rotary wing aircraft in the Navy's inventory through 2015. The CH- 60 variant will support the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) mission, replacing the current MH- 53 E and it's MK- 106 towed influence system. The CH- 60 's towing capacity will be significantly less than the MH- 53 E, so new equipment, designated the Shallow Water <b>Influence</b> <b>Mine</b> Sweeping (SWIMS) system. Capability of SWIMS is expected to be significantly less than that of the MK- 106 system. Smaller size and aircraft commonality will enable SWIMS to deploy on most surface combatants, providing forward presence and reducing employment time of an AMCM suite into a Mine Danger Area (MDA).

40|$|LKAB’s Kiirunavaara Mine, {{located in}} {{northern}} Sweden, has exhibited seismic behaviour since the mining production extended below 700 m depth. Iron ore is mined from the 4. 5 km long orebody via sublevel caving at {{a production rate}} of 28 million tonnes per annum. The deepest current production level is at approximately 800 m depth, and current mining plans call for mining to about 1200 m depth. It is thus of critical importance for LKAB to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the stress and rock mass behaviour at the mine. The Kiirunavaara orebody has complex geometry and geology, which is represented using the discontinuum distinct element code 3 DEC. As part of a larger series of models investigating the influence of strength and structural geology on rock mass behaviour, the results of multiple continuum models are presented. The goals of these continuum models included: i) obtain a better understanding of the virgin stress field and redistribution of stresses caused by mining, ii) further define the extent of mining induced plastic failure, and iii) increase the understanding of existing failure mechanisms at the mine. The elastic and plastic continuum models accurately produced principal stresses similar to measurements recently conducted at two sites in the mine, confirming the previously estimated virgin stress state. Spatial correlations between plastic failure in the model and seismicity in the hangingwall and footwall were found. However, these correlations were not consistent throughout either material for any evaluated set of material properties; either the plastic failure in the footwall or hangingwall corresponded well with seismicity. This may be because a set of rock mass properties which represent rock mass failure at this scale have not been evaluated or that some underlying failure mechanisms causing seismicity are not represented in the models, for example, failure along discontinuities. Some events larger than moment magnitude of 1. 2 in the hangingwall, in particular shear source mechanisms events, do not correspond well with plastic failure from the model. These results potentially indicate that geological structures, which are not represented in these models, <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> behaviour. The improved understanding of input data, rock mass behaviour, and failure mechanisms as a result of these models has a direct impact upon mine excavation design and future rock behaviour investigations, and will be used in the continued research, as well as in mine planning.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} stability, closure {{behaviour}} and rock fracture development associated with mine tunnels with particular reference to Coal Measures conditions. A detailed survey has been carried out of relevant theories and mathematical concepts which relate to tunnel stability and the effects of in situ stresses. Of special importance has been identifying appropriate mathematical theories which relate to the field of scholarship undertaken. The literature survey has found useful application especially in giving guidance on those areas needing further investigation. The author discusses mathematical theories in relation to the research undertaken. The major area of investigation has been the effect of different in situ stress fields on various aspects of tunnel design and geometrical configuration. Attention has focussed on available research methods which allow ease of investigation of the parameters governing mine tunnel stability. After careful consideration, the author selected physical modelling using small scale sand plaster models of different mine tunnel and geological conditions. Much research effort has been directed at establishing the properties of such physical modelling materials, mathematical scaling aspects and the type of test rig for carrying out the investigations. Time was spent on establishing the accuracy and suitability of the research method employed. A range of experiments were carried out whereby the horizontal and vertical components of the in situ stress field were varied. The tests were repeated using the common range of mine tunnel profiles which exist in UK coal mines, namely arch, circular, square and rectangular. The research enabled the fracture pattern to be observed in association with the different tunnel profiles tested under the various stress field conditions employed. Closure of the model tunnels was observed in relation to the increasing stress field. Discussion has focussed on how various combinations of horizontal to vertical components of in situ stress <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> tunnel stability. The results are discussed in relation to the choice of support type. In particular, the merits of standing support types such as square sets, steel arches and concrete linings are discussed in relation to the results of the research. The thesis draws attention to the practical application of the research method to investigate various mining situations as encountered in UK coalfields and in the Datong coalfield in North China, of which the author has particular experiences regarding rock mechanics and mine tunnel stability...|$|E
