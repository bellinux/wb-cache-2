A pre-qualification survey was sent out in May 2014, and six firms were pre-qualified to bid on PCEP construction, which was eventually awarded to Balfour Beatty Construction.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report</b> was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report</b> process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E

The 2007 environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report</b> recommended constructing the new roadway along {{the route of the}} old one, rather than moving the entire highway south.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013, {{the station}} owners {{sent a letter}} of concern to the state, seeking that the Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Report</b> for the museum and {{footbridge}} consider a breadth of possible impacts, particularly from the footbridge. The museum itself received a Finding Of No Significant Impact in March 2014. The Environmental Impact Evaluation for the footbridge, released in July 2014, analyzed seven alternatives for the footbridge location. Alternative 5a, located east of the baggage building and including a section to the garage, was the preferred alternative. The state committed $20 million towards {{the cost of the}} potential footbridge.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report</b> suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a U.S. Border Patrol {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address {{the high rate of}} accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report</b> as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR54, which was finished in 2003.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a shared}} {{interest}} {{to better understand}} the impacts of drought and the potential utility of using drought <b>impacts</b> <b>reporting</b> as a tool for monitoring conditions, researchers from the Carolinas RISA (Dow, Lackstrom, and Brennan), the Climate Assessment for the Southwest (Crimmins and Ferguson), and the Southwest Climate Science Center (Meadow) decided to convene a workshop in Tucson in March 2013. The primary goal was to assemble a small group of university and agency scientists involved with drought impacts monitoring to discuss opportunities and barriers associated with drought <b>impacts</b> <b>reporting,</b> recommend best practices for implementing a drought <b>impacts</b> <b>reporting</b> system, and develop a path forward for addressing or overcoming barriers. The longer-term objective of the initial meeting was to explore the feasibility of creating a community of practice that could share information and integrate activities related to drought <b>impacts</b> research and <b>reporting...</b>|$|R

5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report.</b> A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} constructed {{between the}} Meadowbrook and Northern state parkways in 1956 was undergoing a new $61 million (1989USD) reconstruction {{project in the}} late 1980s. Although it was previously redesigned in 1968, it was still the site of about 180 accidents per year—over six times the statewide average for accident frequency. The junction was to be rebuilt with three lanes in each direction for the Northern State {{in the middle of}} exit31A, a direct ramp between the westbound Northern State Parkway and the southbound Meadowbrook, connections from Glen Cove Road to both parkways, and the relocation of exit and entrance ramps within the interchange. Construction began in May1988, and the project was expected to be completed on October31, 1991. It was proceeding on schedule until the village of Westbury filed a suit against NYSDOT in February1989. The lawsuit claimed that NYSDOT did not follow proper environmental guidelines while designing the project because their environmental <b>impact</b> <b>report</b> failed to consider the impacts of a nearby future widening project on the Northern State Parkway. This widening project, considered a second phase of the interchange reconstruction, had no intended date of construction.|$|E
