In this study, nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) was used to investigate internal bruising in watermelon compressed in longitudinal and transverse directions by parallel plates. The applied forces on models were equal to 10 % of breaking force or 152 N and 92 N, respectively for Crimson sweet and Charleston gray varieties in the longitudinal direction. The simulation results show that equivalent stresses in the red flesh are higher than the failure stress in both varieties (27 kPa and 37 kPa for Crimson sweet and Charleston gray, respectively), However, the maximum equivalent stresses located near the surface of watermelon are well below the failure stresses of rind (1. 2 MPa and 1. 1 MPa for Crimson sweet and Charleston gray, respectively). This indicates that the bruise of the red flesh is the primary form of mechanical damage of watermelons under compression in both directions.

40|$|The New Zealand Kiwifruit Industry {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} in the world. New Zealand grown kiwifruit is {{exported}} to more than 60 countries with Europe, Japan, Asia and U. S being the major markets. Currently, wooden bins are used for picking, handling and storing kiwifruit. Horticulture industries in many countries including the U. S, Europe, and Australia started using plastic harvesting bins over 40 years ago due to additional benefits of using plastic. However, this technology is still not put into practice in New Zealand mainly due to wood availability, familiarity with wooden bins and lack of knowledge reflecting the benefits of plastic harvesting bins. In this study, physical damage to kiwifruit in contact to different types of wooden and plastic harvesting bins was quantified and compared. The objective of the research was to indentify various physical damage mechanisms to kiwifruit and their relative significance during harvesting and storage. Mechanical damage was simulated as compression, abrasion and impact tests, conducted under laboratory conditions. The main finding of this research was that contact with wooden surfaces caused a significant amount of visible damage to kiwifruit, more so than any plastic surface. In terms of venting, 10 mm vents in plastic showed least amount of damage. Compression on 10 mm plastic vents resulted in only 10 % fruit rejection, which was the minimum among all tests under ambient and coolstorage conditions. Almost all tests with wood resulted in 100 % fruit rejection; this means that the whole bottom layered fruit would be rejected from a wooden bin. No significant differences were observed in percentage mass loss of fruit compressed on different wooden surfaces for both 10 and 25 N firmness fruit under ambient and coolstorage conditions. This suggested that for wood, having flat or vented surface does not make a difference in percentage mass loss. It was found that impacting fruit on wooden and flat plastic surfaces caused about 30 % <b>fruit</b> <b>bruising,</b> however, no bruising was observed in fruit impacted on vented plastic surfaces. It can be concluded that plastic bins are superior to wooden bins due to less fruit wastage and bruising.

In addition, plastic bin would recover more than its cost by savings on less fruit rejection...|$|E
40|$|Bruising {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the major sources of harvest and postharvest fruit damage in New Zealand operations. Using Porter's (1985) value system as a framework, a model was developed to investigate the value of apples lost due to bruising from harvest to ship-side, in the Hawkes Bay District. The cost of bruising was identified using the model for the apple varieties Braeburn, Fuji, Granny Smith, Pacific Rose, and for both large and small packhouse based operations. The initial problem statement was developed by applying the "rich" pictures approach which is part of Checkland's (1975) soft systems methodology. To achieve the research objectives, two case studies based on three orchards and two packhouses were investigated to model the value system for apples. The first case study involved two large orchards supplying a large commercial packhouse that packed more than 350, 000 TCEs per season. The second study involved a small orchard, that supplied its own on-orchard packhouse, which packed less than 100, 000 TCEs per season. Two value systems were developed for the fruit handling systems of the two case studies. An important factor in calculating the value of fruit on the orchard was the inclusion of an allowance for the grower's return on equity. The value system began once the on-orchard costs of producing apples, including operating costs, fixed costs and return on equity (set at 20 %), were covered. Once the initial value of fruit had been established, commercial rates for picking, trucking, and other steps in the processing and distribution chain, were used to establish the value system. This approach enabled the losses attributable to bruising to be costed. Losses increased through the system steadily and were greatest at the market end of the value system than on the orchard. Losses due to bruising, up until and including packing, were found to be much higher for the grower than for any other participant in the value system. This was because the grower forfeited export earnings, as well as paying the direct costs of producing and handling reject fruit. For the Braeburn, Fuji, and Pacific Rose, varieties the total cost of 1 % bruising was equivalent to approximately a 3 % loss in export earnings. The loss in value attributable to bruising for Pacific Rose was more variable due to limited amount of data available collected. The total cost for 1 % bruising of the most bruise susceptible variety, Granny Smith, was estimated to exceed 4 % of export earnings. The total loss to the growers of the apple industry needs to be minimised to ensure the growth of the industry. Since the growers are suffering high losses of returns and small, if any, return on equity due to <b>fruit</b> <b>bruising,</b> {{it is unlikely that the}} growers can afford to invest in strategies that can reduce bruising. If new strategies are to be implemented, the returns need to surpass the investment made. Keywords: Value system, Porter process, bruising, fruit value...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{pomegranate}} {{journey from}} orchard to supermarket is very complex and pomegranates {{are subjected to}} the variety of static and dynamic loads {{that could result in}} this damage and bruise occurring. Bruise area and bruise volume are the most important parameters to evaluate fruit damage occurred in harvest and postharvest stages. The bruising is defined as damage to fruit flesh usually with no abrasion of the peel. The two different types of dynamic loading which can physically cause <b>fruit</b> <b>bruising</b> are impact and vibration. The impact and vibration loadings may occur during picking or sorting as the pomegranates are dropped into storage bins and during transportation. The focus of this work was on the impact loading as this appeared to be the most prevalent. In view of the limitations of conventional testing methods (ASTM D 3332 Standard Test Methods for Mechanical Shock Fragility of Products), the method and procedure for determining dropping bruise boundary of fruit were also established by adapting free-fall dropping tests. Materials and Methods: After the ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates had been selected, they were numbered, and the weight and dimension of each sample were measured and recorded. Firmness in cheek region of each fruit was also measured. Fruit firmness was determined by measuring the maximum force during perforating the sample to a depth of 10 mm at a velocity of 100 mm min- 1 with an 8 mm diameter cylindrical penetrometer mounted onto a STM- 5 Universal Testing Machine (SANTAM, Design CO. LTD., England). Free-fall dropping tests with a series of drop heights (6, 7, 10, 15, 30 and 60 cm) were conducted on fresh ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates. Three samples were used for each dropping height, and each sample was subjected to impact on two different positions. Before the test was started, it was necessary to control the sample's drop position. The cheek of sample was placed on the fruit holder. An aluminum plate mounted on upper part of the piezoelectric force sensor was the dropping impact surface of the device. After dropping impact, the sample was caught by hand to prevent a second impact due to sample rebound. After impact, the samples were stored at room temperature for 48 h, during which time bruise tissues and arils turned brown. The bruise area and bruise volume of each sample were calculated according to equations (1 and 2). Results and Discussion: Dropping impact acceleration versus time curves for the typical samples at ten drop heights are shown in figure 5. Drop height notably affected the impact acceleration. The peak force increased while contact times decreased with increasing drop height, which resulted in an increase of peak acceleration. Figure 6 shows the dropping impact velocity change during contact by theoretical calculation. The results showed that the velocities at the beginning of contact and the rebound velocities of the samples increased with increasing the drop height. Critical drop height of pomegranate in certain bruise area was determined and linear relationship between drop height and bruise volume for ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates were obtained. It is clear that there were obvious differences between dropping bruise boundaries of pomegranates and the conventional damage boundary of products (as shown in figure 9). For the conventional damage boundary, the vertical line, critical velocity (Vc), represents the velocity change below which no damage occurs, regardless of the peak pulse acceleration. The horizontal line, critical acceleration (AC), represents the acceleration at which the product will be damaged if velocity exceeds VC. At the same time, for a conventional product, there is only one damage boundary at one shock condition. However, for fruit, a change in drop height (velocity) will lead to a change in bruise ratio. A series of bruise boundaries can be determined for different bruise ratios. Moreover, even if the velocity approaches zero, the fruit can still be bruised if its acceleration exceeds a certain value. These relationships provide an effective basis to predict and control drop bruising, which may be achieved through the design of reasonable cushioning packaging for fruit. Conclusions: This research applied the concept of dropping bruise for pomegranate fruits. Because of the limitations in using conventional testing methods to test product of a viscoelastic nature, such as fruit, free fall dropping tests were adapted to determine dropping bruise fragility and bruise boundary for ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates at different drop heights. For viscoelastic products such as fruit, even if the dropping impact velocity approached zero, the fruit could be bruised as long as the impact acceleration exceeded a certain value (critical acceleration). A series of bruise boundaries can be established for different levels of bruise ratios, i. e., a contour of constant bruise ratio can be drawn on the velocity acceleration plane...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the studies on detection of <b>fruit</b> <b>bruises</b> and watercore in their tissues. Both passive and active pulse phase thermography was applied to early detect tissue defect. Watercore occurrence in &# 8216;Gloster&# 8217; apples was evaluated from heating curves. It was found that the derivative of apple temperature in time per apple mass is a good parameter to identify apples with and without watercore. For apples with water-core the rates of temperature increase per mass in particular initial stages of heating were considerably lower than for apples without watercore affected tissue irrespective of the part of the fruit surface from which the measurements were made. Pulsed-phase thermography (PPT) method was used to detect early apple bruises in &# 8216;Idared&# 8217; and &# 8216;Gloster&# 8217;. In PPT method the studied object is heated with an individual thermal pulse (most frequently a rectangular pulse) and the temperature decay on the surface is analysed on a pixel by pixel basis as a mixture of harmonic waves, thus enabling the computation of phase and amplitude images. The analysis of phasegrams made it possible to determine the relation between the frequency response, phase delay and defect depth.
