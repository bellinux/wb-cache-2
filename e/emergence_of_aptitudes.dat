A procedure {{to control for}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> test scores is introduced and explained along with a system for categorizing enlisted ratings by {{their relationship to the}} Navy's stated mission. Graphical depictions of black and Hispanic representation in Navy occupations are then shown by aptitude group and occupational category. This is followed by a brief examination of minority participation in the Navy's petty officer paygrades from 1982 through 1990. The results of the study reveal that the disproportionate representation of minorities in Navy ratings persists even when aptitude is controlled, suggesting the importance of factors unrelated to aptitude in determining representation. The thesis concludes with a discussion of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the methodology used to measure the influence <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> scores on minority representation in Navy ratings.

Method: The population of the study included students of Islamic Azad University Ardabil Branch. The research sample consisted of 313 students who were studying in Islamic Azad University Ardabil Branch. To collect the data Coping Sterategies scale, Sensation Seeking scale, Self-Efficacy inventory and Substance Use Aptitude scale were used. Data was analyzed using of Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses. Findings: The result of Pearson correlation coefficients showed that self-efficacy, sensation seeking, emotin coping sterategies and problem solving coping sterategies related to aptitude substance use in students. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that self-efficacy, sensation seeking and coping sterategies explained 43 percent <b>of</b> variance <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> <b>of</b> substance use in students. Conclusion: The results indicated that self-efficacy, sensation seeking and coping sterategies are significant predictors in predicting <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> <b>of</b> substance use in adolescents.

ObjectivesA meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether aptitude assessment can be used to predict variability in the acquisition and performance of laparoscopic skills. MethodsPubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched to November 2014 for published and unpublished studies reporting the measurement of a form <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> for laparoscopic skills. The quality of studies was assessed with QUADAS- 2. Summary correlations were calculated using a random-effects model. ResultsThirty-four studies were found to be eligible for inclusion; six of these studies used an operating room performance measurement. Laparoscopic skills correlated significantly with visual-spatial ability (r= 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 25 - 0. 39; p ConclusionsIn general, aptitude assessments are associated with laparoscopic skill level.
