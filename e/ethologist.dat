5|$|During Beebe's later years, Simla was an {{important}} gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, <b>ethologist</b> Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, <b>ethologist</b> Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh {{that had been a}} gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.|$|E
5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern <b>ethologist</b> was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Specialist ambush predators of {{visitors}} to flowers include crab spiders, which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects; predatory bugs, and praying mantises, {{some of which}} (the flower mantises of the tropics) wait motionless, aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers. Beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees; the <b>ethologist</b> Niko Tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf Philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day: all the prey he observed were honeybees. Other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies.|$|E

He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning <b>ethologist</b> Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and Doctor of Philosophy degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year.

From a practical standpoint, early comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few species. <b>Ethologists</b> were more interested in understanding behaviour across a wide range of species to facilitate principled comparisons across taxonomic groups. <b>Ethologists</b> have made much more use of such cross-species comparisons than comparative psychologists have.|$|R

25|$|Because {{ethology}} {{is considered}} a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern <b>ethologist</b> was Charles Darwin, whose book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals influenced many ethologists.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that life initially arose as autocatalytic chemical networks. British <b>ethologist</b> Richard Dawkins wrote about autocatalysis as a potential explanation for {{the origin of life}} in his 2004 book The Ancestor's Tale. In his book, Dawkins cites experiments performed by Julius Rebek, Jr. and his colleagues in which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). One product was a variant of AATE, which catalyzed the synthesis of themselves. This experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which could be interpreted as a rudimentary form of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and <b>ethologist</b> Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E

40|$|The author pleads for a {{modification}} of ethological science that allows for the presentation of even tentative hypotheses, based on what is at present disparagingly referred to as "anecdotal data". It is argued that such data are crucial for the neglected study of the habituation of free-ranging large mammals. In such studies of learning, relevant behavioural observations lie outside the <b>ethologist's</b> control, and can only be replicated by further chance encounters. Observations in their anecdotal form should therefore {{be made available to}} other <b>ethologists</b> despite their lack of quantifiable data.

Observational studies of young children in natural settings provided other behaviours that might indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects, bringing them to the mother but not to others. Although <b>ethologists</b> tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, they pressed for more data, objecting to psychologists writing as if there were an [...] "entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures."

Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led to the conclusion that [...] "we appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people".
