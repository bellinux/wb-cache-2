The drawback of Signal Processing based <b>Image</b> <b>Geometry</b> Correction is the extra expense of the hardware {{that is used to}} perform it.

40|$|<b>Geometry</b> <b>images</b> are {{a kind of}} {{completely}} regular remeshing {{methods for}} mesh representation. Traditional <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> have difficulties in achieving optimal reconstruction errors and preserving manually selected geometric details, due to the limitations of parametrization methods. To solve two issues, we propose two adaptive <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> for remeshing triangular meshes. The first scheme produces <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> with the minimum Hausdorff error by finding the optimization direction for sampling points based on the Hausdorff distance between the original mesh and the reconstructed mesh. The second scheme produces <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> with higher reconstruction precision over the manually selected region-of-interest of the input mesh, by increasing the number of sampling points over the region-of-interest. Experimental results show that both schemes give promising results compared with traditional parametrization-based <b>geometry</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Image</b> <b>Geometry</b> Correction (often {{referred}} to as Image Warping) {{is the process of}} digitally manipulating image data such that the image’s projection precisely matches a specific projection surface or shape. [...] <b>Image</b> <b>geometry</b> correction compensates for the distortion created by off-axis projector or screen placement or non-flat screen surface, by applying a pre-compensating inverse distortion to that image in the digital domain.|$|E
50|$|Edge Blending is a {{companion}} application to <b>image</b> <b>geometry</b> correction. Edge blending enables the seamless projection {{of a large}} image using several overlapping projectors. Since Keystone Distortion (and frequently the requirement of projection onto a non-flat surface) is a built-in requirement of almost all Edge Blending systems, the pairing of Edge blending and <b>image</b> <b>geometry</b> correction in the same video signal processor is a natural one.|$|E
50|$|Calculation of the <b>image</b> <b>geometry</b> {{correction}} transformationThe <b>image</b> <b>geometry</b> correction transformation can {{be calculated}} by predictive geometry (i.e. calculating exactly where an image should land on a regular surface such as sphere or a cylinder), or by an automatic optical feedback system (i.e. a camera {{can be used to}} evaluate the alignment of test images), or by user iteration (i.e. movement of points by an operator). In all methods, the transformation is generally described as a 2-dimensional array. The number of points in the 2-dimensional array that are required to do an accurate <b>Image</b> <b>Geometry</b> Correction depends on the surface involved. In the case of Keystone Correction, 4 points are all that are required to completely describe any projection situation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A large {{fraction}} of known galaxy-lens systems require {{a component of}} external shear to explain the observed <b>image</b> <b>geometries.</b> In most cases, this shear {{can be attributed to}} a nearby group of galaxies. We discuss how the dark-matter mass distribution of groups of galaxies can influence the external shear for strongly lensed sources and calculate the expected weak lensing signal from groups for various mass profiles. Most galaxies in the universe are neither in clusters nor isolated, but found in groups. To date, it is not known whether there exists a significant group dark-matter halo, similar to that for clusters of galaxies, or whether most of the matter is associated with the individual galaxies themselves. A recent weaklensing study of a number of groups has shown that it is possible in principle to determine the mass profile of groups using their weak lensing signal (Hoekstra 1999). Because many models of strong lens systems require a substantial external shear to explain the observed <b>image</b> <b>geometries</b> and magnifications (Keeton, Kochanek & Seljak 1997, Kneib et al. 1998), we investigate how the dark matte...|$|R
40|$|<b>Geometry</b> <b>images</b> {{resample}} {{meshes to}} represent them as texture for efficient GPU processing by forcing a regular parameterization that often incurs {{a large amount of}} distortion. Previous approaches broke the <b>geometry</b> <b>image</b> into multiple rectangular or irregular charts to reduce distortion, but complicated the automatic level of detail one gets from MIP-maps of the <b>geometry</b> <b>image.</b> We introduce triangular-chart <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> and show this new approach better supports the GPU-side representation and display of skinned dynamic meshes, with support for feature preservation, bounding volumes and view-dependent level of detail. Triangular charts pack efficiently, simplify the elimination of T-junctions, arise naturally from an edge-collapse simplification base mesh, and layout more flexibly to allow their edges to follow curvilinear mesh features. To support the construction and application of triangular-chart <b>geometry</b> <b>images,</b> this paper introduces a new spectral clustering method for feature detection, and new methods for incorporating skinning weights and skinned bounding boxes into the representation. This results in a ten-fold improvement in fidelity when compared to quadchart <b>geometry</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} of 3 D {{models in the}} form of <b>Geometry</b> <b>Images</b> (GI) is an emerging and appealing concept due to the reduction in complexity from R 3 to image space and wide availability of mature image processing tools and standards.

40|$|Surface {{geometry}} {{is often}} modeled with irregular triangle meshes. The process of remeshing refers to approximating such geometry using a mesh with (semi) -regular connectivity, which has advantages for many graphics applications. However, current techniques for remeshing arbitrary surfaces create only semi-regular meshes. The original mesh is typically decomposed into {{a set of}} disk-like charts, onto which the geometry is parametrized and sampled. In this paper, we propose to remesh an arbitrary surface onto a completely regular structure we call a <b>geometry</b> <b>image.</b> It captures <b>geometry</b> as a simple 2 D array of quantized points. Surface signals like normals and colors are stored in similar 2 D arrays using the same implicit surface parametrization — texture coordinates are absent.

40|$|Figure 1 : 512 bunnies {{tested for}} {{collisions}} A new collision detection algorithm GI-COLLIDE is presented. The algorithm works with <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> and codes bounding spheres as a perfectly balanced mip-map–like hierarchical data structure. The largest <b>geometry</b> <b>image</b> {{in the hierarchy}} stores the bounding spheres of the quadruples of the vertices from the input <b>geometry</b> <b>image.</b> Center of the sphere is calculated {{as the center of}} the corresponding min-max AABB and stored as the pixel’s RGB value. The alpha value stores the sphere radius. In this way each level represents bounding spheres of the previous level. The upmost level of the hierarchy is the bounding sphere of the entire object. Collisions between objects are detected by the standard tree traversing and checking the overlaps among the bounding spheres. The exact collision is detected by a triangle-triangle test at the lowest level. The bounding sphere coding is implicit. A sphere at any level can be found efficiently only by indexing the <b>geometry</b> <b>image.</b> Once objects are represented as <b>geometry</b> <b>images</b> the collision detection can be performed efficiently using directly this representation and {{it is not necessary to}} use any other.
