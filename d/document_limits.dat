Overall, instead of finding straight-forward conclusions of a practical nature, a series of study-specific conclusions were found that were often mutually exclusive. Further analyses of existing data were conducted in an attempt to tease out meaningful hypotheses concerning the relationship between offender age and sexual recidivism. Numerous potentially interacting variables were uncovered including participation in treatment, type of risk measure used, type of sexual offender, jurisdiction, and even a differen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{strengths}} of probabilistic topic modeling {{is the ability to}} reveal hidden relations via the analysis of co-occurrence patterns on dyadic observations, such as document-term pairs. However, in many practical settings, the extreme sparsity and volatility of cooccurrence patterns within the data, when the majority of terms appear in a single <b>document,</b> <b>limits</b> the applicability of topic models. In this paper, we propose an efficient topic modeling framework in the presence of volatile dyadic observations when direct topic modeling is infeasible. We show both theoretically and empirically that often-available unstructured and semantically-rich meta-data can serve as a link between dyadic sets, and can allow accurate and efficient inference. Our approach is general and can work with most latent variable models, which rely on stable dyadic data, such as pLSI, LDA, and GaP. Using transactional data from a major e-commerce site, we demonstrate the effectiveness as well as the applicability of our method in a personalized recommendation system for volatile items. Our experiments show that the proposed learning method outperforms the traditional LDA by capturing more persistent relations between dyadic sets of wide and practical significance. ...|$|E
40|$|XML {{plays an}} {{important}} role in delivering data over the Internet, and the need to store and manipulate XML in its native format has become increasingly relevant. This growing need necessitates work on developing native XML operators, especially for one as fundamental as sort. In this paper we present NEXSORT, an algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of XML to efficiently sort an XML document in external memory. In a fully sorted XML document, children of every non-leaf element are ordered according to a given sorting criterion. Among NEXSORT’s uses is in combination with structural merge as the XML version of sort-merge join, which allows us to merge large XML documents using only a single pass once they are sorted. The hierarchical structure of an XML <b>document</b> <b>limits</b> the number of possible legal orderings among its elements, which means that sorting XML is fundamentally “easier ” than sorting a flat file. We prove that the I/O lower bound for sorting XML in external memory is Θ(max{n, n log m (k/B) }), wherenis the number of blocks in the input XML document, m is the number of main memory blocks available for sorting, B is the number of elements that can fit in one block, and k is the maximum fan-out of the input document tree. We show that NEX-SORT performs within a constant factor of this theoretical lower bound. In practice we demonstrate, even with a naive implementation, NEXSORT significantly outperforms a regular external merge sort of all elements by their key paths, unless the XML document is nearly flat, in which case NEX-SORT degenerates essentially to external merge sort. ...|$|E
40|$|Along-strike {{variations}} in orogenic development {{can be difficult}} to constrain. Resulting assumptions projecting similarity or variability along strike can lead to erroneous conclusions at the orogen scale. Young orogens provide opportunities to <b>document</b> <b>limits</b> of along-strike projection and test factors that may control lateral variability. Here we present new constraints on the history of uplift, exhumation and shortening in the Timor orogen from West Timor, Indonesia. Structural mapping documents a foreland thrust stack of Jurassic-Miocene Australian margin strata and a hinterland antiformal stack of Permo-Triassic Australian continental units duplexed below Banda Arc lithosphere. Biostratigraphy within the piggyback Central Basin reveals earliest deepwater synorogenic deposition at 5. 57 – 5. 53 Ma, uplift from lower to middle bathyal depths at 3. 35 – 2. 58 Ma, and uplift from middle to upper bathyal depths at 2. 58 – 1. 30 Ma. Hinterland Permo-Triassic strata yield apatite (U-Th) /He ages of 0. 33 – 2. 76 Ma, apatite fission track ages of 2. 19 – 3. 53 Ma and partially reset zircon (U-Th) /He ages. These thermochronology ages are youngest or most strongly reset {{in the center of the}} antiformal stack and yield modeled exhumation rates of 0. 45 – 3. 31 km/Myr. A balanced cross section reveals a minimum of 300 km of shortening including 210 km of Australian continental subduction below the Banda forearc. When compared to published results from Timor-Leste, these data show that the timing of initial collision, synorogenic basin uplift, and total shortening amount were broadly similar across the island. Therefore, despite along-strike changes in orogen morphology and significant small-scale spatial variability in deformation, first-order structural similarity dominates at large scales. We suggest that along-strike {{variations in}} orogen morphology are due to changes in the distribution of deformation within the orogen driven by differences in backstop strength, internal wedge strength and basal décollement friction as well as the presence of the wedge-top Central Basin in West Timor...|$|E
