40|$|This work {{focused on}} HF RFID systems, {{where it was}} a goal to {{increase}} {{the reliability of the}} system. Especially in environments with metallic parts many problems occur. It became clear that many problems took place at the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> of the RFID system. Therefore, we focussed on the design of <b>loop</b> <b>antennas</b> in order to increase the reliability of HF RFID systems. Although HF RFID systems are widely adopted by the industry, it was shown that the implementation of an RFID system for a specific environment involves a lot of design choices. Considering the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna,</b> several important design parameters have {{to be taken into account}} if we are aiming for a proper functioning HF RFID system. Metal objects in the vicinity of the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> can have a high impact on the functionality of the system. In some cases a redesign of the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> is needed. A redefinition of several design parameters and a solution, in terms of a new antenna concept, was proposed to take care of metal objects in the vicinity of the antenna. It has been made clear that an environment with metal objects has to be handled with care. If we only consider simple environments with one metal plate or object, we can design the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> analytically. But when the environment becomes more complex, one needs a strong tool to create a reliable <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> for these environments. The main result of this thesis is the creation of an automated antenna design tool (AADT) which takes care of metals in the vicinity and creates an optimized <b>loop</b> <b>antenna.</b> The optimized <b>loop</b> <b>antennas</b> are based on parametric shapes and self-defined RFID goal functions. Two practical and challenging test cases served as an evaluation of the AADT in which an optimized <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> was implemented.
