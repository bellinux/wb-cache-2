Our results provide evidence for high rates of glycosylation in muscle. The highest activities were obtained with GDP-mannose: dilichylmonophosphate mannosyltransferase, a key enzyme in glycosylation process (220 pmol/mg per h in mitochondria and 1, 550 pmol/mg per h in microsomal membranes). Substantial individual variations were observed for dolichol pathway glycosyltransferases but low individual variations were found for glycosyltransferases involved in maturation of glycoproteins.

The organelles involved come into close contact, {{but do not}} fuse, thereby giving rise to notable microdomains; these microdomains allow rapid communication between the organelles. Plasma membrane-associated membranes (PAMs), which are microdomains of the plasma membrane (PM) interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are dynamic structures that mediate transport of proteins, lipids, ions and metabolites. These structures have gained much interest lately owing to their roles in many crucial cellular processes. Here we provide an optimized protocol for the isolation of PAM, PM and ER fractions from rat liver {{that is based on}} a series of <b>differential</b> <b>centrifugations,</b> followed by the fractionation of crude PM on a discontinuous sucrose gradient.

Breaking vegetative amoebae by shear stress with a steel ball cell cracker preserves the integrity of subcellular organelles and in particular that of lysosomes, the rupture of which is very deleterious to further purifications.

40|$|The {{intracellular}} {{distribution of}} the low-molecular-weight GTP-binding protein rap 2 B was investigated in resting and agonist-activated human platelets. In both cases, platelets were lysed by Triton X- 100, and cell fractions were obtained by <b>differential</b> <b>centrifugations.</b> Using a specific polyclonal antiserum, we found that rap 2 B in resting platelets was completely detergent-soluble. When platelets were aggregated with thrombin, the thromboxane analogue U 46619, or the Ca(2 +) -ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, {{a significant amount of}} rap 2 B became associated with the cytoskeleton. This association was paralleled by a decrease of rap 2 B in the Triton X- 100 -soluble fraction. Translocation of rap 2 B to the cytoskeleton strictly depended on platelet aggregation, and maximal incorporation was found when approximately 50 % aggregation was measured. Inhibition of fibrinogen binding to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex completely prevented the interaction of rap 2 B with the cytoskeleton. These results clearly demonstrate that changes in the intracellular localization of rap 2 B occur during platelet activation and represent evidence that this low molecular weight GTP-binding protein may be involved in platelet function...|$|R

In this way, cytochrome P450 in microsomes is concentrated and isolated. Microsomes have a reddish-brown color, due {{to the presence of}} the heme.

5000|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>centrifugation</b> is {{a common}} {{procedure}} in microbiology and cytology used to separate certain organelles from whole cells for further analysis of specific parts of cells.

Finally, purification may be done through equilibrium sedimentation, and the desired layer is extracted for further analysis. Separation is based on size and density, with larger and denser particles pelleting at lower centrifugal forces. As an example, unbroken whole cells will pellet at low speeds and short intervals such as 1,000g for 5 minutes. Smaller cell fragments and organelles remain in the supernatant and require more force and greater times to pellet.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{isolation}} of microvilli from kidney brush border is described. The method depends on the preferential aggregation of other subcellular structures by bivalent metal ions. MgCl 2 is added to a homogenate of cortical tissue prepared from frozen rabbit kidneys. Aggregated material is removed by a low-speed centrifugation and the supernatant centrifuged at 15000 g to yield a pellet enriched in microvilli. This is resuspended and given a second treatment with Mg 2 +. The purified preparation is obtained after four short <b>differential</b> <b>centrifugations.</b> The six brush-border enzymes that were monitored were enriched 11 – 17 -fold compared with the original homogenate and were obtained in about 10 % yield. Marker enzymes for other subcellular components showed the preparation to be essentially free of mitochondria and to be less contaminated with endoplasmic reticulum and baso-lateral plasma membranes than are conventional brush-border preparations. The main contamination was of lysosomal origin, about half of which was attributable to adsorbed acid hydrolases rather than to intact lysosomes.

Few studies investigated their molecular targets, and {{the aim of this}} work was to identify the atypical anti-LKMA targets by proteomic tool. This proteomic approach consisted of (a) two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cytosolic and microsomal proteins obtained by <b>differential</b> <b>centrifugations</b> of rat liver and rat kidney, followed by (b) two-dimensional immunoblotting with sera of patients with de novo AIH (n = 8, including 2 with anti-LKMA antibodies) and then (c) identifications of interest spots performed by ion trap mass spectrometry. By this way several proteins at 25 kDa were unambiguously identified: isoforms of carbonic anhydrase III, members of different glutathione S-transferase (GST) families, and subunit beta 1 of proteasome. This is the first report of proteasome and carbonic anhydrase III as autoantigens in de novo AIH.

Erythroid progenitors (BFU-E and CFU-E) in bone marrow (BM) show a proapoptotic phenotype. Suspicion of DBA is reached after exclusion of other forms of BM failure syndromes. To improve DBA diagnosis, which is confirmed by mutation analysis, we tested a new approach based {{on the study of}} extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from plasma by <b>differential</b> <b>centrifugations</b> and analysed by flow cytometry.

Among the three EVs clusters we found, only the CD 34 +/CD 71 low population showed statistically significant differences between DBA patients and controls (p< 0. 05). The absence of this cluster is in agreement with the low levels of BFU-E found in DBA patients. The assessment of ROC curves demonstrated the potential diagnostic value of this population.
