5|$|Heart: {{cardiomyopathy}} (weakness of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle)</b> {{is a rare}} but recognized {{problem in}} Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is {{established}} by the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> to contract.|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>muscles</b> are {{distinct}} from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other. Furthermore, {{just as with}} smooth muscles, their movement is involuntary. <b>Heart</b> <b>muscles</b> are controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system.|$|R
50|$|Intracardiac {{injections}} are injections {{that are}} given {{directly into the}} <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> or ventricles. They are used in emergencies.|$|R
50|$|Rheumatic {{heart disease}} - <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> and valves damage due to rheumatic fever caused by Streptococcus pyogenes a group A streptococcal infection.|$|R
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle).</b> This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> damage.|$|E
5000|$|Heart failure - damaged <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> therefore, {{it becomes}} {{too weak to}} pump blood to the body (Newton & Joyce, 2012, p. 74).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{distinct}} types of muscles: skeletal <b>muscles,</b> cardiac or <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> and smooth (non-striated) muscles. Muscles provide strength, balance, posture, movement and heat {{for the body}} to keep warm.|$|R
50|$|Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) {{measures}} the electrical depolarization of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> using various electrodes placed near {{the chest and}} limbs. This measure of depolarization {{can be used to}} monitor heart rhythm.|$|R
5|$|The {{heart is}} cone-shaped, with its base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The heart is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle,</b> similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
50|$|Xanthosis is a brown {{pigmentation}} of skeletal and <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> of cattle. The {{condition is}} particularly seen in older animals, {{and in some}} wasting diseases. Prevalent in Ayrshire cattle and their crosses.|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{actions of}} INAH, PAS and SM were {{analysed}} {{by using the}} Straub's heart. 1. INAH stimulates the heart, while SM inhibits it markedly. The heart action of PAS is biphasic, first inhibiting then stimulating. 2. The cardiac stimulation produced by INAH and the cardiac inhibition produced by SM are both due to their direct effects on <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> because the effects on autonomic nerve fibres have been excluded pharmacologically. The biphasic action evoked by PAS is mainly due to its direct effect on <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> but partly connected with its biphasic effect on parasympathetic nerves...|$|R

5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle,</b> causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
50|$|Deconditioning due to {{decreased}} {{physical effort}} results in <b>muscle</b> loss, including <b>heart</b> <b>muscles.</b> Deconditioning {{due to lack}} of gravity or non-standard gravity action (e.g., during bed rest) results in abnormal distribution of body fluids.|$|R
50|$|Because IpTxi {{also works}} on the RyR {{channels}} of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> it could potentially {{be used as a}} drug against arrhythmia. This has not yet been proven, and must be studied in vivo first.|$|R
50|$|A {{pacemaker}} (or artificial pacemaker, {{so as not}} to {{be confused}} with the heart's natural pacemaker) is a medical device which uses electrical impulses, delivered by electrodes contracting the <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> to regulate the beating of the heart.|$|R
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{absolute}} {{neutron activation}} analysis (ANAA) technique {{was used for the}} determination of some elements on body organs, such as, kidney, <b>heart,</b> <b>muscles</b> and spleen of small-sized animals used on experiments in health area. The advantages and limitations of using this nuclear methodology were discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|Infantile-onset form {{is usually}} {{diagnosed}} at 4-8 months; muscles appear normal but are limp and weak {{preventing them from}} lifting their head or rolling over. As the disease progresses <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> thicken and progressively fail. Without treatment death usually occurs due to heart failure and respiratory weakness.|$|R
50|$|Complications in {{the form}} of endocarditis, liver {{inflammation}}, inflammation of the <b>heart's</b> <b>muscle,</b> joint inflammation, keratoconjunctivitis (occasionally extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the lacrimal gland/orbit), and neurologic complications (brain inflammation) may occasionally occur. Severe pneumonia requiring intensive-care support may also occur. Fatal cases have been reported (less than 1% of cases).|$|R

50|$|All foxgloves {{are highly}} toxic if eaten because they contain various cardiac glycosides such as digitoxin, digitalin, digitonin, digitalosmin, gitoxin and gitalonin. During digestion, aglycones and a sugar are {{released}} by the breakdown of these glycosides. The aglycones directly affect <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> and may slow the heart rate until cardiac arrest occurs.|$|R
