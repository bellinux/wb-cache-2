In the present study we investigated if low HPA-axis activity predicted future <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We included 1, 399 boys and girls from the Dutch general population, initially aged 10 - 12 years. At the first assessment, basal cortisol levels were assessed. At the first assessment and at follow-up 2 years later <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> were assessed with parent and self-report questionnaires. The results suggest that the association between low cortisol levels at 8. 00 p. m. and future <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> according to the parents was only present for boys. More importantly however, the results suggest that low HPA-axis activity is not a good predictor for <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors,</b> but could be valuable to identify those with a poor prognosis, once <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> are present in preadolescence...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} topics {{affecting}} the wellbeing of organizations, therefore, it has become a significant research area. The purpose of this study was to determine experiences and perceptions of nurses who were involved in <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Methods: A qualitative study was conducted by using a conventional content analysis. The data was obtained through 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews with nurses in six hospitals of Tehran city, Iran. A purposive sampling method was used.

40|$|It is {{important}} to investigate associations between biological factors and <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in children and adolescents. Antisocial, aggressive, and criminal behaviors in adults often begin early in life. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> are often thought {{to be associated with}} low activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Cortisol, the end-product of this axis, can be measured to investigate HPA-axis activity. Previous studies on this topic concerned clinical or high risk samples. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate to which extent HPA-axis functioning plays a role in <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in pre-adolescents from the general population. One thousand seven hundred and sixty eight 10 - to 12 -year-olds from the Dutch general population were investigated. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, the Youth Self-Report, and the Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire. Baseline morning and evening salivary cortisol levels were assessed. Unexpectedly, small associations were found between <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors,</b> including attention problems, and higher cortisol levels. However, all effect sizes of significant effects were very small. Our study indicated that HPA-axis functioning may be more relevant in clinical or high risk samples than at the general population level. The association between HPA-axis functioning and attention problems, that has gotten less attention than that with aggressive or delinquent behaviors, requires further research. Furthermore, because effect sizes were relatively small, it can be concluded that, in pre-adolescence, the measures of baseline HPA-axis functioning that were used for the present study can not be used as biological markers for <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics.

40|$|Abstract Background Nursing home {{residents}} with dementia gradually lose {{the ability to}} process information {{so that they are}} less likely to express pain in typical ways. These residents may express pain through <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> because they cannot appropriately verbalize their pain experience. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pain on <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in nursing {{home residents}} with dementia. Methods This is a secondary analysis of the Minimum Data Set (MDS 2. 0) assessment data on long-term care from the state of Florida. The data used in this study were the first comprehensive assessment data from NH residents with dementia aged 65 and older (N[*]=[*] 56, 577) in Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing homes between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. Variables examined were pain, wandering, aggression, agitation, cognitive impairment, activities of daily living impairments, and demographic characteristics. Ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of pain on <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results Residents with more severe pain are less likely to display wandering behaviors (OR[*]=[*]. 77, 95 % CI for OR[*]=[*][0. 73, 0. 81]), but more likely to display aggressive and agitated behaviors (OR[*]=[*] 1. 04, 95 % CI for OR[*]=[*][1. 01, 1. 08]; OR[*]=[*] 1. 17, 95 % CI for OR[*]=[*][1. 13, 1. 20]). Conclusions The relationship between pain and <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> depends on the type of behaviors. Pain is positively correlated with <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> that do not involve locomotion (e. g., aggression and agitation), but negatively related to <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> that are accompanied by locomotion (e. g., wandering). These findings indicate that effective pain management may help to reduce aggression and agitation, and to promote mobility in persons with dementia. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{exhibited}} by {{children and youth}} pose {{a major problem for}} students exhibiting the behaviors, their peers, parents, and teachers. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> including shouting, aggression, off-task behaviors, and noncompliance, correlate with poor social skills, low peer acceptance, higher rates of academic deficiencies, and in adulthood instability in relationships and employment. Self-management programs employ traditional behavior management methods and with self-management components to teach students to self-monitor or evaluate their behavior. By teaching students to be aware of and to manage their own behavior students may be better able to generalize appropriate behaviors to other less supervised settings, complete more work, and experience a sense of accomplishment for controlling their behavior. Past reviews of self-management literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of self-management interventions in changing <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> and documented limitations of the research. However, the most recent review was completed over a decade ago, therefore a current review of self-management programs for <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> was completed. The review indicated that recent literature has corrected some past limitations by studying a larger variety of age groups in different settings and by providing replicable intervention steps. Unfortunately, many variables continue to be neglected (e. g., generalization, maintenance, social validity, treatment integrity).

Results: Cortisol level effect in different periods: within duration of reaction to pain, sensitivity to pain and <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> have evaluated. In addition abnormal regulation of cortisol levels have shown a very strong relationship between sensitivity to pain and the <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Cortisol suppression was responsible for adjustment by the participants to stressful conditions. Conclusion: Previous investigations have shown {{that there is a}} low reaction to stressor which decreases the vitality as well as impairing a negative memory in low cortisol levels.

25|$|If a {{stallion}} {{is not to}} be {{used for}} breeding, gelding the male horse will allow it to live full-time in a herd with both males and females, reduce aggressive or <b>disruptive</b> <b>behavior,</b> and allow the horse to be around other animals without being seriously distracted. If a horse {{is not to be}} used for breeding, it can be gelded prior to reaching sexual maturity. A horse gelded young may grow taller and behave better if this is done. Older stallions that are sterile or otherwise no longer used for breeding may also be gelded and will exhibit calmer behavior, even if previously used for breeding.

25|$|Prior to {{the seminal}} article on {{functional}} analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology {{available to them}} at the time. Instead of treating {{the function of the}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>behavior,</b> behavioral psychologists would instead pre-assume consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, B.F. Skinner) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of Review: This article {{provides}} an updated {{review of the}} determinants of caregiver burden and depression, {{with a focus on}} care demands and especially the differential effects of various neuropsychiatric symptoms or symptom clusters. Moreover, studies on caregivers for frontotemporal and Lewy body dementias were referred to in order to identify differences and similarities with the mainstream literature based largely on Alzheimer caregivers. Recent Findings: As a group, neuropsychiatric symptoms are most predictive of caregiver burden and depression regardless of dementia diagnosis, but the effects appear to be driven primarily by <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> (e. g., agitation, aggression, disinhibition), followed by delusions and mood disturbance. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> are more disturbing partly because of the adverse impact on the emotional connection between the caregiver and the care-recipient and partly because they exacerbate difficulties in other domains (e. g., caring for activities of daily living). In behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, not only are these <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> more prominent but they are also more disturbing due to the care-recipient’s insensitivity to others’ feelings. In Lewy body dementia, visual hallucinations also appear to be distressing. Summary: The disturbing nature of <b>disruptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> cuts across dementia conditions, but the roles played by symptoms that are unique or particularly serious in a certain condition need to be explored further...|$|R
