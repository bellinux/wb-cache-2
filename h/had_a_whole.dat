5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|After the {{departure}} of the Matthews family, the wealthy Love family was introduced. They were made up of siblings Peter (John Hutton), Donna (Anna Stuart), Nicole (Kim Morgan Greene), and Marley (Ellen Wheeler), who was actually Donna's daughter. Their tyrannical father, Reginald (John Considine), came back from the dead to cause trouble for his children. He had spent the last twenty years living under the alias LaSalle and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> other family, a wife, Marissa (Denise Alexander), who was none other than Mary McKinnon suffering from amnesia, and an adopted son, Scott (Hank Cheyne).|$|E
25|$|After the Replacements {{signed with}} Twin/Tone, Westerberg {{began to write}} new songs and soon <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, {{time spent in the}} studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album. Although not {{important}} at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} Mayas {{believe in}} the existence, within each individual, of various souls, usually described in quasi-material terms (such as 'shadow', 'breath', 'blood', and 'bone'). The loss {{of one or more}} souls results in specific diseases (generically called 'soul-loss', 'fright', or susto). In Classic Maya texts, certain glyphs are read as references to the soul. Much more is known about the so-called 'co-essences', that is, animals or other natural phenomena (comets, lightning) linked with the individual (usually a male) and protecting him. In some cases (often connected to black sorcery), one can change into co-essences acting like a sort of 'werewolves' (see also nagual). The Classic Maya grandees <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> array of such soul companions, which were called wayob, and carried distinct hieroglyphic names. Among them were spook-like creatures, but also violent stars.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that the Grand Trunk road predated even Buddha's birth and was called Uttara Path, meaning, road to the North. During {{the time of the}} Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of western Asia and the Hellenistic world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily (Takshashila in present-day Pakistan, see inset in map). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Maurya empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to Pataliputra (present-day Patna in India). Chandragupta Maurya <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat Megasthenes who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of Purushapura, Takshashila, Hastinapura, Kanyakubja, Prayag, Pataliputra and Tamralipta, a distance of around 2600 kilometers.|$|E
25|$|The 1901 to 1904 Oldsmobile Curved Dash was {{the first}} mass-produced car, made from the first {{automotive}} assembly line, an invention that is often miscredited to Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company. (Ford {{was the first}} to manufacture cars on a moving assembly line.) After Olds merged Olds Motor Vehicle Co. with the Olds Gas Engine Works in 1899, it was renamed Olds Motor Works and moved to a new plant in Detroit, located at the corner of East Jefferson Avenue and MacArthur Bridge. By March 1901, the company <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> line of models ready for mass production. However, a mistake by a worker caused the factory to catch fire, and it burned to the ground, with all of the prototypes destroyed. The only car that survived the fire was a Curved Dash prototype, which was wheeled out of the factory by two workers while escaping the fire. A new factory was built in Lansing, and production of the Curved Dash commenced.|$|E

25|$|Patrese didn't last much longer, his gearbox failing {{and then}} the {{stationary}} car was hit by Roberto Moreno, forcing both of them out. Piquet, who did not stop, was passed by Alesi for second with Prost taking fourth off Stefano Modena soon after. Alesi was having gearbox troubles and was holding back Piquet as Prost began to attack both of them. On lap 70, Piquet passed Alesi and Prost followed him through. Prost then shifted sides getting ahead of Piquet as well. Modena passed Alesi for fourth and Alesi soon retired with gearbox troubles. Unflustered by all this, Senna won from Prost, Piquet, Modena, Satoru Nakajima and Aguri Suzuki. This {{would be the last}} Formula One Grand Prix on the streets of downtown Phoenix, Arizona and the last Formula One race in the United States for 9 years; Formula One would return to a very different part of the United States in 2000 – the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new road course built within the facility just for the Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Jay-Z {{released}} his twelfth studio album Magna Carta... Holy Grail, {{in an interview}} he revealed that two songs on the album were initially recorded for Watch the Throne, the song [...] "Oceans" [...] which features Frank Ocean and the song [...] "Holy Grail" [...] which went on to feature Justin Timberlake (Although Timberlake's contribution to the track was not anticipated at the time, until the duo collaborated on Timberlake's 2013 comeback single [...] "Suit & Tie" [...] and [...] "Murder" [...] from The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2 respectively). West and Jay-Z argued for four days about having them included on the Watch the Throne, however West eventually relented and the duo recorded [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". In an interview with Zane Lowe, Jay-Z said: [...] " [...] no lyrics on 'Holy Grail' and I recorded 'Oceans' and I played those records for Kanye," [...] Jay explained. [...] "And he was like, 'No those {{have to go on}} Watch the Throne,' so we spent four days arguing about those records and I was explaining to him why it wasn't right for this project and I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> idea for making this album called Magna Carta...

500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E
