5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt <b>into</b> <b>{{national}}</b> and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was married}} {{three times and}} fathered seven {{children}}. Miller married Barbara Crow, from Shamrock, Texas, when she was 17. The couple had four children. The first child, Michael, died shortly after birth due to heart issues. They had three more children — Alan, Rhonda, and Shari. By the time Shari was born, Miller's career was blossoming <b>into</b> <b>national</b> popularity. The family remained in Inglewood {{for a short time}} after Miller found fame. The increasing interest in Miller caused struggles for the performer: He suffered from depression and insomnia, and had a drug addiction which contributed {{to the end of his}} first and second marriages. Miller was also notorious for walking off shows and fighting.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, {{prominent}} {{individuals and organizations}} have recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions.

These {{included}} 13 hat-tricks (three of which were consecutive – once against Crewe Alexandra and twice against Chester), two instances of four goals in a match (against Workington and Carlisle United), and two of five goals in a match (against Bradford Park Avenue and the Tranmere Rovers).

5|$|WHO has {{set out a}} {{strategy}} for traditional medicines with four objectives: to integrate them as policy <b>into</b> <b>national</b> healthcare systems; to provide knowledge and guidance on their safety, efficay, and quality; to increase their availability and affordability; and to promote their rational, therapeutically sound usage. WHO notes in the strategy that countries are experiencing seven challenges to such implementation, namely in developing and enforcing policy; in integration; in safety and quality, especially in assessment of products and qualification of practitioners; in controlling advertising; in research and development; in education and training; and in the sharing of information.|$|E
5|$|Deregulation in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the Big Bang in 1986, also encouraged the bank to enter the securities business. County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged <b>into</b> <b>National</b> Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Though Tech joined {{athletic}} {{conferences in}} other sports during the 1980s, it remained a football independent until 1991, when Virginia Tech {{became a member of}} the Big East conference. In 1993, Tech received an invitation to the Independence bowl, beginning a 16-year streak that has seen the Hokies invited to a bowl game at the conclusion of every season since then. In 1995, the Hokies defeated the Texas Longhorns in the 1995 Sugar Bowl, vaulting them <b>into</b> <b>national</b> prominence. In recent years, Virginia Tech football teams have been ranked among the best in the country according to season-ending polls. In 2000, Virginia Tech participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, which served as the national championship game of the 1999 college football season. In addition to that appearance, the Hokies have participated in several other Bowl Championship Series games, which represent the highest tier of postseason accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration <b>into</b> <b>national</b> law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
