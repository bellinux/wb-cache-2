40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} composition on the kinetics of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, well characterized silica supported Fe-Co alloy catalysts were prepared and studied. The influence of temperature and particle size of the metallic crystallites on the carburization processes which occur on Fe catalysts during the synthesis reaction was also investigated using silica supported Fe and an unsupported Fe powder. Three major conclusions were derived from these investigations: (1) The pore structure of the support and the drying procedure used to remove the excess water and decompose the metallic salts following the incipient wetness preparation for the supported Fe-Co catalysts significantly influences {{the distribution of the}} metals on the support. (2) The hydrocarbon selectivities of the bimetallic catalysts were unlike simple physical mixtures of Fe and Co catalysts, but were intermediate to those of Fe and Co. Initial rates showed a strong iron influence. (3) The carbides which form during the synthesis reaction are dependent on the particle size of the metallic crystallites and the temperature of the synthesis reaction. ^ The techniques used to characterize the catalysts in this investigation include Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, <b>differential</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis,</b> transient drying studies, and N(, 2) adsorption studies. Mossbauer spectroscopy was the primary investigative tool used, and most of the analysis was done at atmospheric pressure utilizing a reactor/absorption cell which allowed in situ analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the physical {{properties of the}} macrolide antibiotics: Erythromycin dihydrate (EM-DH), Roxithromycin monohydrate (RM-MH) and Azithromycin dihydrate (AZM-DH). The abovementioned hydrate compounds were investigated {{in terms of the}} hydrate-anhydrate crystal structure stability, dehydration and observed polymorphism under controlled temperature heating programs. Identified hydrate and anhydrate polymorphs were subjected to physical stability testing during controlled storage. EM-DH was characterized by thermal analysis (DSC, TGA), X-ray diffraction, FTIR and microscopy. Dehydration of EM-DH at temperatures of 100, 157 and 200 °C (followed by supercooling to 25 °C) produced the form (I) anhydrate (Tm = 142. 9 °C), form (II) anhydrate (Tm = 184. 7 °C) and amorph (II) (Tg = 118 °C) respectively. The attempts to produce amorph (I) from melting (in vicinity of form (I) melt over temperature range 133 °C to 144 °C) and supercooling was unsuccessful due to the high crystallization tendency of the form (I) melt. Brief humidity exposure and controlled temperature (40 °C) / humidity storage for 4 days (0 - 96 % RH) revealed hygroscopic behaviour for the anhydrate crystal (forms (I) and (II)) and amorph (II) forms. Form (II) converted to a nonstoichiometric hydrate where extent of water vapour absorption increased with increased storage humidity (2. 1 % absorbed moisture from recorded TGA at 96 % RH). Amorph (II) exhibited similar trends but with greater water absorption of 4. 7 % (recorded with TGA) at 96 % RH. The pulverization and sieving process of amorph (II) (at normal environmental conditions) was accompanied by some water vapour absorption (1. 1 %). A slightly lower absorbed moisture content of 3. 3 % (from TGA) after controlled 4 days storage at 40 °C/ 96 % RH was recorded. This suggested some physical instability (crystallization tendency) of amorph (II) after pulverization. The thermally induced dehydration of RM-MH by DSC-TG was evaluated structurally (SCXRD), morphologically (microscopy) and by kinetic analysis. Various kinetic analysis approaches were employed (advanced, approximation based integral and <b>differential</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> methods) in order to obtain reliable dehydration kinetic parameters. The crystal structure was little affected by dehydration as most H-bonds were intramolecular and not integral to the crystal structure stability. Kinetic parameters from thermally stimulated dehydration indicated a multidimensional diffusion based mechanism, due to the escape of water from interlinked voids in crystal. The hygroscopicity of the forms RM-MH, Roxithromycin-anhydrate and amorph glass (Tg = 81. 4 °C) were investigated. Roxithromycinanhydrate (crystalline) converted readily to RM-MH which were found to be compositionally stable over the humidity range 43 - 96 %RH. Amorphous glass exhibited increased water vapour absorption with increasing storage humidity (40 °C/ 0 - 96 % RH). TG analysis suggested a moisture content of 3. 5 % at 96 % RH after 4 storage days. DSC and powder XRD analysis of stored pulverised amorphous glass indicated some physical instability due to water induced crystallization. Commercial AZM-DH and its modifications were characterized by thermal analysis (DSC, TGA), SC-XRD and microscopy. Thermally stimulated dehydration of AZM-DH occurred in a two-step process over different temperature ranges. This was attributed to different bonding environments for coordinated waters which were also verified from the crystal structure. Dehydration activation energies for thermally stimulated dehydration were however similar for both loss steps. This was attributed to similarities in the mode of H- bonding. Different forms of AZM were prepared by programmed temperature heating and cooling of AZM-DH. The prepared forms included amorphous glass (melt supercooling), amorphous powder (prepared below crystalline melting temperature), crystalline anhydrate and crystalline partial dehydrate. Humidity exposure indicated hygroscopic behaviour for the amorphous, crystalline anhydrate and crystalline partial dehydrate modifications. Both the crystalline anhydrate and partial dehydrate modifications converted to the stoichiometric dihydrate form (AZM-DH) at normal environmental conditions at ambient temperature. Both the amorph glass and amorph powder exhibited increased moisture absorption with increased humidity exposure. TG analysis of the pulverised amorph glass indicated a moisture content of 5. 1 % at 96 % RH after 4 storage days. The absence of crystalline melt in DSC and presence of Tg (106. 9 °C) indicated the sample remained amorphous after pulverisation and storage for 4 days at 40 °C/ 96 % RH...|$|E

40|$|Ion cutting {{achieved}} by the implantation of hydrogen or the co-implantation of hydrogen and helium {{is among the most}} common methods for the formation of Silicon on Insulator (SOI) structures used in the semiconductor industry. In this method, hydrogen is implanted into silicon at a high fluence and is heated in order to induce and exfoliation event. During this exfoliation event, a silicon wafer is cleaved along the depth at which the maximum damage concentration occurs, and the cleaved material bonds chemically to any underlying material being used as a handle substrate. The ion implantation process induces a variety of defect species which evolve as they are annealed at varying temperatures and times and the characteristics of these defects and the reactions which dominate their formation are critical for low temperature substrates such as LCD glass. 	 This study observes the annealing characteristics of a variety of structural and electronic defects induced by ion implantation, including hydrogen decorated monovacancies and hydrogen decorated interstitials. The states arising from these decorated point defects were analyzed using Multiple Internal Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (MIT-IR) and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). A method for observing implant-related defects on a MOS Capacitor using a DLTS measurement was developed. A new method for extracting the activation energy and the capture cross section of states observed with DLTS through the use of the Full Width at 2 ̆ 2 Nth 2 ̆ 2 Maximum was also developed.

40|$|The <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> of IAsys {{biosensor}} association data usually relies {{upon the}} assumption of constant ligate concentration. In certain circumstances this assumption {{may no longer be}} valid. In a similar vein, the analysis of the dissociation phase assumes the concentration of ligate to be negligible in the liquid phase - an assumption that may not be sustainable for high-affinity interactions. In this paper we derive analytical solutions of the second-order <b>differential</b> <b>kinetic</b> equations for the association and dissociation phases, together with a binding isotherm that also allows for changes in concentration of both the ligand and the ligate. Using these equations it is possible to determine the conditions under which the pseudo- first-order assumption ceases to be valid. It is found that the effect of ligate depletion on the association rate constant becomes significant only when binding low ligate concentrations to ligand on surfaces with high binding capacities or high affinities. Similarly, the rebinding in the dissociation phase is dependent upon the affinity and the ligand capacity together with the starting dissociation response compared to the capacity. Finally, depletion also affects the form of the binding isotherm, particularly in situations involving high matrix capacities for ligate and high-affinity interactions...|$|R

40|$|Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data is {{intrinsically}} dynamic, and <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> of dynamic PET data can substantially augment {{the information provided}} by static PET reconstructions. Yet despite the insights into disease that <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> offers, it is not used clinically and seldom used in research beyond the preclinical stage. The utility of PET <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> is hampered by several factors including spatial inconsistency within regions of homogeneous tissue and relative computational expense when fitting complex models to individual voxels. Even with sophisticated algorithms inconsistencies can arise because local optima frequently have narrow basins of convergence, are surrounded by relatively flat (uninformative) regions, have relatively low-gradient valley floors, or combinations thereof. Based on the observation that cost functions for individual voxels frequently bear some resemblance to each-other, this paper proposes the federated optimisation of the individual <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> problems within a given image. This approach shares parameters proposed during optimisation with other, similar voxels.
