40|$|We {{show that}} tax {{competition}} in the EU is shaped by four interrelated institutional mechanisms: 1) Market integration, by reducing the transaction costs of cross-border tax arbitrage in the Single Market, 2) enlargement, by increasing the number and heterogeneity of states involved in intra-EU tax competition, 3) tax coordination, by restricting the range of competitive instruments {{at the disposal of}} governments, and 4) supranational judicial review by limiting the scope of unilateral <b>defences</b> against <b>tax</b> competition (judicialization). As a consequence, tax competition is significantly stronger in the EU, and the race to the bottom in corporate tax rates more pronounced than {{in the rest of the}} world...|$|R
50|$|The Port Wall in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales, is a late {{thirteenth century}} stone wall, which was {{constructed}} for the twin purposes of <b>defence</b> and <b>tax</b> collection by permitting {{users of the}} town's market only one point of access through the wall at the Town Gate. The wall originally formed a semi-circle extending for some 1100 m, roughly southwards from Chepstow Castle to the River Wye. It enclosed an area of 53 ha, including the entire town and port as it existed at that time. Substantial sections of the wall remain intact, and both the Port Wall and the Town Gate are Grade I listed buildings. The Port Wall is a Scheduled monument.|$|R

50|$|At first, {{administrative}} organisation {{was based on}} small provinces. During the rule of Justinian I, the Cyclades, Cyprus and Caria, together with Moesia Secunda (present-day northern Bulgaria) and Scythia Minor (Dobruja), were brought together {{under the authority of}} the quaestura exercitus set up at Odessus (now Varna). Little by little, themes were put into place, starting with the reign of Heraclius {{at the beginning of the}} 7th century. In the 10th century the theme of the Aegean Sea was established; it included the Cyclades, the Sporades, Chios, Lesbos and Lemnos. In fact, the Aegean theme rather than an army supplied sailors to the imperial navy. It seems that later on, central government control over the little isolated entities that were the islands slowly diminished: <b>defence</b> and <b>tax</b> collection became increasingly difficult. At the beginning of the 12th century, they had become impossible; Constantinople had thus given up on maintaining them.|$|R
40|$|The world's richest {{and most}} {{powerful}} countries have become increasingly concerned about revenue lost to tax havens, and fear that tax competition might spark a fiscal 'race to the bottom', yet they have failed to pressure much smaller and weaker tax haven states into reform. This article argues that the OECD-sponsored campaign against 'harmful' tax competition has been unsuccessful because regulative norms have severely constrained the means legitimately able to be employed. Early decisions on how the campaign was designed subsequently brought norms into play which have not only ruled out the use of coercion, but also the use of side payments, despite the massive potential benefits available to both sides from a deal between tax havens and OECD states. The failure to strike a deal cannot be explained by high transaction costs nor by corporate lobbying in <b>defence</b> of <b>tax</b> shelters. Regulative norms can thus affect economic bargaining {{in the international arena}} by preventing mutually advantageous exchanges that are nevertheless regarded as inappropriate. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} aggregate net effect of government funding on business R&D in 17 OECD Member countries {{over the past two}} decades. Grants, procurement, tax incentives and direct performance of research (in public laboratories or universities) are the major policy tools in the field. The major results of the study are the following: Direct government funding of R&D performed by firms has a positive effect on business financed R&D (except if the funding is targeted towards <b>defence</b> activities). <b>Tax</b> incentives have an immediate and positive effect on business-financed R&D; Direct funding as well as tax incentives are more effective when they are stable over time: firms do not invest in additional R&D if they are uncertain of the durability of the government support; Direct government funding and R&D tax incentives are substitutes: increased intensity of one reduces the effect of the other on business R&D; The stimulating effect of government funding varies with respect to its generosity: it increases up to a certain threshold (about 10 % of business R&D) and then decreases beyond; Defence research performed in public laboratories and universities crowds out private R&D; Civilian public research is neutral for business R&D...|$|R

50|$|In {{ancient times}} for <b>defence</b> against attack, <b>taxes</b> were {{raised on the}} island to {{construct}} Portland's first castle. Rufus Castle was reportedly built for William II, although the structure seen standing in ruins today is not of that date. In 1142, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, had captured the castle from King Stephen on behalf of Empress Maud. It had additional fortifications added in 1238 by Richard de Clare who owned it at that time. Around 1256, Aylmer de Lusignan obtained a licence to crenellate the 'insulam de Portand' and Robert, Earl of Gloucester, was granted a similar licence just 14 months later. It is generally presumed that Rufus castle {{is the site of}} any work that may have resulted from these licences and any remains that may date from the period exist only at foundation level, or have been lost to cliff erosion.|$|R
40|$|How best {{to improve}} climate {{mitigation}} measures while {{we wait for}} an international consensus on climate policy? This is a practical problem raising important normative issues. The problem is {{the urgent need for}} better climate mitigation measures that is time-sensitive: conditions can only deteriorate over time rendering the problem and the relevant stakes even more pressing. The normative issues raised include whether a second-best solution is compelling given these non-ideal conditions and what form such a solution ought to take. This article responds to issues raised in Rolf H. Weber’s insightful piece in this special issue, such as the balancing of mitigation policies and securing market competitiveness leading to Weber’s <b>defence</b> of border <b>tax</b> adjustment. This article critically examines Weber’s position on competitiveness and its connection to border tax adjustment as a second-best option from a justice-based perspective. It is argued that strategies based around taxation—such as the Global Resources Dividend, the polluter pays principle and border tax adjustment—are problematic and unconvincing alternatives...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} build a global {{cognitive}} theory in Archaeology is proposed. The archaeological method {{is based on a}} three level concept : knowledge acquiring, structuring and modelling, inspired by the XIX century work of Peirce, renewed by recent developments of cognitive Sciences and used today in many fields of Social and Human Sciences, System Engineering, and recently proposed in Archaeology (DJINDJIAN 1993). The knowledge acquiring level A is the result of simultaneous and retroactive use of two mechanisms: several specific analogical processes in archaeology (contemporary analogy, ethnographical analogy, experimental analogy) and a cognitive process, general to Human Sciences. Logical objects used by archaeological reasoning are artefacts, set of artefacts (archaeological layer, dwelling structure, burial, etc.) and methodological objects (unit, sample, core, etc.). Such objects may deliver three categories of data: intrinsic data, extrinsic data and administrative data. Intrinsic data (named I) are a view of an object, resulting in the interaction between the archaeological artefact and the archaeologist who is perceiving and describing it. Intrinsic data is a knowledge of the artefact. Extrinsic data (named E) are data recording the various artefact contexts: spatial and stratigraphic localisation, links with neighbouring artefacts, environment, etc. Extrinsic data depends on the quality of archaeological excavation and recording. In all the cognitive processes, knowledge A must be associated with the archaeologist, ARCH, who is at the origin of the interaction artefact/archaeologist, the process of producing the knowledge, Pc, and the validation process Pv, controlling the reasoning: (A, ARCH, Pc, Pv). The structuring level, S, is discussed in relation with the question of enrichment of structures towards the emergence of a system, through a dedicated method called the systemic triple method (DJINDJIAN 1980) : 1. Definition of the system S; 2. Perception and description of intrinsic data I; 3. Recording of extrinsic data E; 4. Formalisation of the structuring process: intrinsic structuring (matrix artefact x intrinsic data, O x I), extrinsic structuring (occurrence or Burt matrix intrinsic data x extrinsic data, I x E); 5. Exploratory data analysis on O x I or I x E; 6. Retroactions on I and E; 7. Iterative enrichment by integration of new I and new E; 8. Validation (using another artefact system, a new E, etc.). The modelling level is then examined with a discussion of the limits of the formal logic in Archaeology: empirical-inductive, where “every structure is Culture”, or hypothetical-deductive methods, where “all the models are fitting well” falling in the weakness of so-called paradigmatic models. A new more restricting method is proposed, called the cognitive model method, CMM. The main features of CMM are: explicit, formalised, repetitive, stable, systemic, refutable, predictive, discursive and auditable. A general method {{to build a}} cognitive model is then given, in ten steps; some of them are already known and referenced, others are new and detailed: 1. Improving the knowledge A; 2. Discovering the structures S inside data; 3. Enrichment of structures S; 4. Systemic organisation in hierarchical subsystems; 5. Building models R; 6. Validating models R; 7. Retroactions for enrichment and stabilisation of the models R; 8. Model simulation for predictions; 9. Writing the archaeological discourse; 10. Auditing the discourse. The systemic organisation in hierarchical sub-systems is based on a five level system: 1. Technological know-how; 2. Economic activities: craft production, raw material supplying, subsistence resources, energy resources, buildings (dwellings, infrastructure), territory management, manufacturing, exchange and trading, etc.; 3. Social organisation: workflow, specialisation of professions, social groups, social hierarchies, family structures, community administration, <b>defence,</b> <b>taxes,</b> authority systems, etc.; 4. Symbolic sub-system: ideas and beliefs; 5. Global system. In conclusion, such approaches of methodological development are the most reliable but also the most difficult way to reach a real scientific status for Archaeology...|$|R
40|$|The {{power to}} tax enables a State to organise its tax law {{on the basis of}} its {{national}} standards with respect to economic effectiveness and equity.   Taxes are a decisive financial factor for the governmental expenditure, the regulation of business, the promotion of the public goods and the competition between States.   The revenue of taxes can represent a method of income and wealth distribution, a social control by increasing taxes on products regarded as harmful such as tobacco and alcohol, and pollution can be limited by tax concessions.   Tax sovereignty is therefore one of the most sensitive issues for the member States and its transfer considered an undesirable diminution in national sovereignty. Improvements in communication and transport are creating new opportunities but also posing complex challenges for tax systems (e. g. the sale of goods and services via the Internet has noticeably increased in recent years).   In the light of the increasing globalisation, States are forced to create a favourable environment for the investments of international enterprises.   Thus, States try to prevent a shift of economic activities from home to abroad and at the same time to attract investments of foreign enterprises.   This competition is generally acceptable since it avoids a spiralling increase of taxes, provides better State performance and public structures, unless it does not turn into harmful tax competition. Member States are required to eliminate tax obstacles for private individuals and businesses, which wish to work and operate freely within the Single Market since the <b>defences</b> in national <b>tax</b> systems have become increasingly evident and have a growing influence on economic decisions of individuals and enterprises. In addition to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice with regard to the provisos of the EC Treaty, in particular the fundamental freedoms, the Commission has aimed at harmonising or co-ordinating the Member States tax system within the field of indirect as well as direct taxation with varying degrees of success.   This has mainly been caused by the reluctance of the Member States to agree to the measures demanded by the Commission. This processor will become even more difficult in face of the European Union’s fifth and biggest enlargement with ten new Member States on 1 May 2004.   However, the European Union has the chance to lay down the fundamental provisions towards a “European Tax System” in the European Constitution.   Agreement not only upon these important issues has still not been reached.
