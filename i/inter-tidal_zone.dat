2500|$|The {{open sea}} {{is a complex}} habitat in its own right. It exists in three spatial {{dimensions}} and also varies over time and tide. For example, where freshwater flows into the Irish Sea in river estuaries its influence can extend far offshore as the freshwater is lighter and [...] "floats" [...] {{on top of the}} much larger body of saltwater until wind and temperature changes mix it in. Similarly, warmer water is less dense and seawater warmed in the <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zone</b> may [...] "float" [...] on the colder offshore water. The amount of light penetrating the seawater also varies with depth and turbidity. This leads to differing populations of plankton {{in different parts of the}} sea and varying communities of animals that feed on these populations. However, increasing seasonal storminess leads to greater mixing of water and tends to break down these divisions, which are more apparent when the weather is calm for long periods.|$|E

50|$|Practical {{underwater}} adhesion is {{an engineering}} challenge since current technology {{is unable to}} stick surface strongly underwater because of barriers such as hydration layers and contaminants on surfaces. However, marine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater {{under the harsh conditions}} of the ocean. They use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones</b> of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the direct {{discharge}} of storm water runoff into coastal waters through storm drain systems can cause pathogen contamination, even where separate storm and sanitary sewer systems are in place. For instance, Weiskel et al. ([1996]) found that about 16 % of the total fecal coliform inputs were caused by storm water entering Buttermilk Bay in Massachusetts. In addition, coastal rivers draining largely undeveloped watersheds with extensive riparian wetlands can be a natural source of fecal pathogens to coastal waters (Viau et al. [2011]; Staley et al. [2014]; Roberts et al. [2013]; Liang et al. [2013]; Wilkes et al. [2014]). On-site septic systems can also contribute significant amounts of fecal pathogens to coastal waters in low-lying fine-grained geological settings where saturated soils enhance pathogen growth. Weiskel et al. ([1996]) reported that shoreline wrack deposits could act as a reservoir of fecal bacteria, and the removal of wrack deposits from <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones</b> can improve the water quality of adjacent coastal waters.|$|R

50|$|The {{creation}} of Hinge Park and Habitat Island has incorporated freshwater wetlands, rocky <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones,</b> and shoreline forest habitats into the dense urban environment of Olympic Village. These novel habitats have promoted biodiversity {{by becoming a}} unique gathering spot for wildlife. Wildlife sightings in Hinge Park and Habitat Island include coyotes, river otters, raccoons, herring, beavers, and several species of waterfowl. Earlier in April 2013, a pair of beavers were first sighted in Hinge Park and have made the stormwater-fed wetland their home. Since establishing a local lodge in January 2015, the pair of beavers have quickly gained popularity over social media and is loved by many locals in the community. Since July 2016, up to three baby beaver kits have been spotted living with their parents. The urban habitat of Hinge Park is smaller than the usual habitats that beavers occupy, meaning the amount of available resources to allow the beaver population to thrive will be challenging.

40|$|From book jacket: In {{the humid}} forests of Cape Horn, a single tree can host more than 100 species of little {{epiphyte}} plants. The {{floor of the}} forest and the rocks are also covered by numerous species of liverworts, mosses, and lichens. The decision to stop at a tree or rock and explore these “miniature forests” generates an authentic ecotourism experience. In a small area we can spend several minutes or hours with a magnifying glass or camera discovering the colors, shapes, and textures of the most diverse organisms of Cape Horn.

40|$|Intertidal {{habitats}} {{provide important}} feeding areas for migratory shorebirds. Anthropogenic developments along coasts can increase ambient light levels at night across adjacent <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones.</b> Here, we report {{the effects of}} elevated nocturnal light levels upon the foraging strategy of a migratory shorebird (common redshank Tringa totanus) overwintering on an industrialised estuary in Northern Europe. To monitor behaviour across the full intertidal area, individuals were located by day and night using VHF transmitters, and foraging behaviour was inferred from inbuilt posture sensors. Natural light was scored using moon-phase and cloud cover information and nocturnal artificial light levels were obtained using geo-referenced DMSP/OLS night-time satellite imagery at a 1 -km resolution. Under high illumination levels, the commonest and apparently preferred foraging behaviour was sight-based. Conversely, birds feeding in areas {{with low levels of}} artificial light had an elevated foraging time and fed by touch, but switched to visual rather than tactile foraging behaviour on bright moonlit nights in the absence of cloud cover. Individuals occupying areas which were illuminated continuously by lighting from a large petrochemical complex invariably exhibited a visually based foraging behaviour independently of lunar phase and cloud cover. We show that ambient light levels affect the timing and distribution of foraging opportunities for redshank. We argue that light emitted from an industrial complex improved nocturnal visibility. This allowed sight-based foraging in place of tactile foraging, implying both a preference for sight-feeding and enhanced night-time foraging opportunities under these conditions. The study highlights the value of integrating remotely sensed data and telemetry techniques to assess the effect of anthropogenic change upon nocturnal behaviour and habitat use...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} are a known net source {{of greenhouse gases}} emissions but the atmospheric gas fluxes, particularly from the mangrove swamps occupying <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones,</b> are characterized poorly. Spatial and seasonal fluxes of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from soil in Mai Po mangrove swamp in Hong Kong, South China and their relationships with soil characteristics were investigated. The N 2 O fluxes averaged from 32. 1 to 533. 7 mu g m(- 2) h(- 1) and the CO 2 fluxes were between 10. 6 and 1374. 1 mg m(- 2) h(- 1). Both N 2 O and CO 2 fluxes in this swamp showed large spatial and seasonal variations. The fluxes were higher at the landward site than the foreshore bare mudflat, and higher fluxes were recorded in warm, rather than cold, seasons. The landward site had the highest content of soil organic carbon (DC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO 3 [...] N) and total phosphorus (TP), while the bare mudflat had the highest ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 +-N) concentration and soil denitrification potential activity. The N 2 O flux was related, positively, to CO 2 flux. Soil NO 3 [...] N and TP increased N 2 O flux, while soil OC and TP concentrations contributed to the CO 2 flux. The {{results indicated that the}} Mai Po mangrove swamp emitted significant amounts of greenhouse gases, and the N 2 O emission was probably due to soil denitrifcation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Results of nitrate and {{phosphate}} concentrations {{measured using}} hand-held ‘Hach’ monitors are presented, both over individual tidal cycles and over longer term deployments at Pagham Harbour, West Sussex, UK. This macrotidal lagoon (offshore tidal range 3. 0 m neaps– 6. 5 m springs) is {{a site of}} key importance as a nature reserve and a home for several rare species of plants and animals. In particular, the effects of fresh water-salt water stratification over 4 tidal cycles at two tidal-fresh water boundaries is presented. It is shown that obtaining periodic vertical profile measurements during individual tidal cycles helps to quantify the transport mechanisms of nutrients from the tidal limits into {{the main body of}} the lagoon. Of key interest is the interaction between sediment-bound nutrients with the surrounding water in which the sediment is suspended during parts of the tidal cycle. Synthesis of these results with existing knowledge about sediment-water-nutrient interactions reveals how it is possible for nutrients to become trapped at the muddy tidal limits of the lagoon. In certain cases it is shown that nutrient-rich water from fresh water streams only gradually mixes with the denser, salt water of the incoming tide. Whilst a degree of salinity-induced stratification may be expected during the flood tide, these observations suggest that the water column is stratified with respect to both N and P, even well into the ebb tide. Thus at sites where stratification is important, there is a tendency for nutrients to remain preferentially near the water surface, and thus come into contact with fine, less mobile sediments near the surface of <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones,</b> which are themselves, in general, accreting. Since the overlying water is generally slow-moving during high water, it is postulated that saline-induced vertical stratification of estuarine water is an important mechanism in promoting nutrient build-up in muddy inter-tidal areas of this kind...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the influence of}} the duration of periodical waterlogging with artificial seawater on the photosynthetic and physiological responses of Kandelia candel L. Druce seedlings, the pre-dominant species of subtropical mangroves in China. Artificial tidal fluctuations applied here closely mimicked the twice daily tidal inundation which mangroves experience in the field. All the seedlings were immersed in artificial seawater during 70 -day cultivation. Similar trends with increasing duration of immersion occurred in photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO 2 concentration, where significant decreases occurred only in long time treatments of 10 or 12 h. Water used efficiency and chlorophyll contents showed lower in medium periods and higher in long periods of immersion. This indicates that the increase in pigment contents of leaves was ineffective in promoting P-n under long time immersion. Light saturation points under short time waterlogging (0 - 4 h) occurred at light intensities of 800 - 1000 mu mol/m(2) /s, and at around 400 mu mol/m(2) /s in long time treatments (8 - 12 h). Long periods of tidal immersion therefore significantly inhibited photosynthesis of mature leaves. Alcohol dehydrogenase and oxidase activity in roots both increased under longer immersion periods, suggesting that roots are sensitive to anaerobiosis under long term waterlogging. The activities of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in mature leaves increased in 8 h and 10 h treatments, respectively. The content of malondialdehyde in mature leaves increased under long time treatments. Abscisic acid accumulation in mature leaves also had a sharp increase from 8 h to 12 h inundation. Even though the anti-oxidative enzymes were induced by waterlogging, this was not sufficient to protect the seedlings from senescence. The results suggested that K. candel seedlings completely tolerated tidal immersion by seawater up to about 8 h in each cycle, which matches the natural distribution of K. candel in <b>inter-tidal</b> <b>zones</b> of China.
