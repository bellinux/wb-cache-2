This project sought to {{investigate}} spin-offs of the telemetric heat stress monitoring system (THSM) developed at LANL. Hazardous-materials workers and firefighters wear clothing that protects them from external hazards, but the sealed environment of a protective suit makes its wearer susceptible to heat stress. Heat stress occurs when the body`s natural cooling mechanisms fail: it can cause collapse and death.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{investigation into the}} effect of <b>incipient</b> <b>heat</b> damage on the mechanical properties of a carbon-epoxy composite. Specimens were exposed {{to a range of}} temperatures varying from 0 °C to 280 °C for one hour and then tested to quantify the effects of this high temperature exposure on the short-beam shear, Mode I and II interlaminar fracture toughness, and the Mode I fatigue properties. The results showed that as the exposure temperature increased, the short-beam shear suffered a reduction, whereas the Mode I and Mode II fracture toughness increased after an initial reduction. The fatigue disbond growth rates were largely un-affected under heat exposure below 280 °C. This complex behaviour in the degradation in fracture toughness is likely due to the increased fibre bridging brought about by the reduction in matrix strength...|$|R
40|$|Because of a corium-coolant interaction, {{a bed of}} volumetrically heated {{particles}} {{submerged in}} the coolant will be formed either in the vessel or in the cavity under a hypothetic reactor core melt down accident. Hence, coolability of the debris bed {{is essential to the}} reactor safety. A large scale test facility with extensive instrumentation was constructed to simulate the coarse corium debris bed. The facility which employed a variable 100 kw DC power generator had a cylindrical test bed 101. 6 cm in height and 21. 6 cm in diameter. The bed was assembled by packing alternating layers of heaters and stone gravel. ^ The effects of power distribution, bed depth, submergence, particle shape, and pressure on coolability of debris beds have been investigated. Also, the dryout transient phenomena such as dryout inception behavior, dryout inception position, and dryout propagation in three dimensions have been studied. The results indicate that the dryout delay time is simply related to the applied power. The relationship, called the constant energy line, is useful to uniquely define the <b>incipient</b> dryout <b>heat</b> flux. It also provides a convenient and highly accurate means for the experimental measurement of the <b>incipient</b> dryout <b>heat</b> flux. ^ A model based on the flooding phenomenon was developed to predict the dryout inception position. The results are encouraging. New functions based on the present data for relative permeabilities of turbulent flow were suggested. With these functions, the theoretical model not only predicts the present dryout data but also successfully predicts the void-fraction data obtained from the cocurrent flow experiment and the sparging experiment. ...|$|R
40|$|Various {{transport}} {{phenomena in}} micro-channel heat sinks were investigated {{in this thesis}} work. Included are single-phase pressure drop and <b>heat</b> transfer, <b>incipient</b> boiling <b>heat</b> flux, two-phase flow instability, flow patterns, flow boiling heat transfer, flow boiling pressure drop, and critical heat flux (CHF). A micro-channel heat sink experimental facility was designed and constructed. The micro-channel heat sink was fabricated from oxygen-free copper and contained twenty-one parallel rectangular 231 x 713 μm (215 x 821 μ m for critical heat flux experiments) micro-channels. Deionized water was the working liquid. Single-phase pressure drop and heat transfer were studied experimentally and numerically, with excellent agreement. Experiments were performed to measure <b>incipient</b> boiling <b>heat</b> flux. A mechanistic model based on bubble departure criterion was developed, whose predictions showed good agreement with the experimental data. Two types of two-phase hydrodynamic instability were identified: severe pressure drop oscillation and mild parallel channel instability. The former was eliminated by throttling a control valve upstream of the heat sink. Moderate to high heat fluxes produced mostly annular flow. Experiments were also conducted on flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop. Previous heat transfer correlations were assessed and deemed inaccurate. Previous two-phase pressure drop correlations were also examined, and a new correlation was proposed which shows better accuracy than prior correlations. An annular flow model was developed, incorporating unique features of two-phase micro-channel flow. Good agreement was achieved between the model predictions and experimental data for both flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop. Experimental critical heat flux (CHF) {{was found to be}} independent of inlet temperature, but CHF increased with increasing mass velocity. A new CHF correlation was proposed for two-phase micro-channel heat sink that shows excellent accuracy in predicting existing heat sink data. Based on the fundamental understanding of the various transport phenomena associated with two-phase micro-channel flow, a comprehensive methodology was developed for optimizing the design of a two-phase micro-channel heat sink. The proposed optimization methodology yields an acceptable design region encompassing all possible micro-channel dimensions corresponding to a prescribed coolant flow rate or pressure drop. ...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{transport}} in microchannels is investigated {{to better}} understand the fundamentals of fluid flow and heat transfer that occur at the microscale. Pressure drop and heat transfer measurements are obtained to validate the applicability of conventional theory in predicting single-phase fluid flow and heat transfer behavior in microchannels. The results suggest that conventional theory and carefully selected correlations are entirely capable of predicting single-phase transport characteristics in the microchannels considered. To supplement the experimental measurements, a detailed computational fluid dynamics analysis is performed to study the three-dimensional, steady-state, convection-conduction conjugate problem in a microchannel heat sink. Local temperature, heat flux and Nusselt number distributions are obtained. Approximate analytical models are presented to aid in the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks to satisfy the thermal performance requirement. A graphical method is outlined to assess the suitability of pumps for particular microchannel heat sinks. ^ A non-intrusive diagnostic technique, infrared micro-particle image velocimetry is developed for measuring flow fields within MEMS devices with micron-scale resolution. Experiments conducted demonstrate the efficacy of this technique for flow measurement in silicon-based microdevices. ^ Convective flow boiling in microchannels is studied to advance the understanding of flow boiling and two-phase flow in microchannels. Boiling heat transfer is experimentally characterized. Onset of nucleate boiling is studied with a high-speed imaging system and the heat flux at incipience is measured in a microchannel heat sink under various flow conditions. An analytical model is developed to predict the <b>incipient</b> <b>heat</b> flux as well as the bubble size at the onset of boiling. An investigation of bubble motion and evolution is performed using high-speed photography to reveal the complex bubble dynamics during nucleate boiling in microchannel flows. Convective boiling heat transfer coefficients are measured and compared to predictions from existing correlations proposed for larger channels. While an existing correlation is found to provide satisfactory prediction of the heat transfer coefficient in subcooled boiling in the microchannels, saturated boiling is not well predicted by the correlations for macro- and mini-channels. A new superposition model is developed to correlate the heat transfer data in the saturated boiling regime in microchannel flows. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Incipient boiling {{and burnout}} heat fluxes were studied for sub-cooled forced {{convection}} annular flow.

This gave diameter ratios from 100 : 1 to 50 : 1. The water flow rate varied from 685, 000 to 2, 710, 000 LBM/(hr. ft. ²) at a constant temperature of 208. 4 °F and a constant pressure of 18. 7 psia.

6000|$|This Tobacco-College is the Grumkow-and-Seckendorf chief {{field of}} action. These two gentlemen {{understand}} thoroughly {{the nature of}} the Prussian Tobacco-Parliament; have studied the conditions of it to the most intricate cranny: no English Whipper-in or eloquent Premier knows his St. Stephen's better, or how to hatch a measure in that dim hot element. By hint, by innuendo; by contemplative smoke, speech and forbearance to speak; often looking one way and rowing another,--they can touch the secret springs, and guide in a surprising manner the big dangerous Fireship (for such every State-Parliament is) towards the haven they intend for it. Most dexterous Parliament-men (Smoke-Parliament); no Walpole, no Dundas, or immortal Pitt, First or Second, is cleverer in Parliamentary practice. For their Fireship, though smaller than the British, is very dangerous withal. Look at this, for instance: Seckendorf, one evening, far contrary to his wont, which was prostrate respect in easy forms, and always judicious submission of one's own weaker judgment, towards his Majesty,--has got into some difficult defence of the Kaiser; defence very difficult, or in reality impossible. The cautious man is flustered by the intricacies of his position, by his Majesty's indignant counter-volleys, and the perilous necessity there is to do the impossible {{on the spur of the}} instant;--gets into emphasis, answers his Majesty's volcanic fire by <b>incipient</b> <b>heat</b> of his own; and, in short, seems in danger of forgetting himself, and kindling the Tobacco-Parliament into a mere conflagration. That will be an issue for us! And yet who dare interfere? Friedrich Wilhelm's words, in high clangorous metallic plangency, and the pathos of a lion raised by anger into song, fall hotter and hotter; Seckendorf's puckered brow is growing of slate-color; his shelf-lip, shuttling violently, lisps and snuffles mere unconciliatory matter:--What on earth will become of us?--"Hoom! Boom!" [...] dexterous Grumkow has drawn a Humming-top from his pocket, and suddenly sent it spinning. There it hums and caracoles, through the bottles and glasses; reckless what dangerous breakage and spilth it may occasion. Friedrich Wilhelm looked aside to it indignantly. [...] "What is that?" [...] inquired he, in metallic tone still high. [...] "Pooh, a toy I bought for the little Prince August, your Majesty: am only trying it!" [...] His Majesty understood the hint, Seckendorf still better; and a jolly touch of laughter, on both sides, brought the matter back into the safe tobacco-clouds again. [Forster, ii. 110.] ...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in high aspect ratio mini-channels has important applications for materials test reactors using plate-type fuel. These fuel plates typically possess coolant channels with hydraulic diameters {{on the order}} of 4 mm or less. The single and two-phase heat {{transfer in}} such channels has not been well-characterized, especially in regard to the onset of nucleate boiling. While surface effects are known to dramatically influence the incipience of boiling, they have not been widely considered under forced convection. Since the limiting safety system setting for the MITR is the onset of nucleate boiling, there is considerable interest in better characterizing the phenomenon in such channels. This study presents a first-of-a-kind, two-phase flow facility designed to measure the single-phase heat transfer coefficient and onset of nucleate boiling in a high aspect ratio mini-channel over a wide range of flow conditions while also permitting high speed visualization of the entire surface. The single-phase heat transfer coefficient is measured for mass fluxes ranging from 750 kg/m 2 -sec up to 6000 kg/m 2 -sec and for sub-coolings ranging from 20 °C to 70 °C. The onset of nucleate boiling superheat and heat flux are measured for mass fluxes ranging from 750 kg/m 2 - sec to 3000 kg/m 2 -sec and for sub-coolings ranging from 10 °C to 45 °C. Measurements are supported with high speed videography to visualize bubble incipience when conditions permit. The influence of surface wettability on the incipience point is also investigated by performing tests on a surface oxidized at high temperature in air. Using a boundary layer analysis along with experimental data obtained in the study, a semi-analytical correlation is developed to predict the single-phase heat transfer coefficient in high aspect ratio rectangular channels. The correlation accounts for effects from secondary flows and heating asymmetry, and is suitable for both the transition and fully turbulent flow regimes. The new correlation predicts the Nusselt number with a mean absolute error of 4. 9 % in the range of 2. 2 <Pr< 5. 5 and 4000 <Re< 70, 000. The onset of nucleate boiling heat flux on the reference surface is adequately predicted with the correlation of Bergles and Rohsenow, as long as the appropriate single-phase heat transfer prediction is used. However, the oxidized surface displays a modest increase in the <b>incipient</b> <b>heat</b> flux due to the improved wettability. This effect is not captured in the correlation of Bergles and Rohsenow, but is accounted for in other correlations such as that of Davis and Anderson. Surface science measurements are presented for prototypical materials test reactor fuel surfaces to quantify effects of roughness, oxidation, and surface contamination on wettability. Overall, surface cleanliness is found to {{have a profound effect on}} wettability, and in turn, is expected to influence boiling incipience. by Eric Christopher Forrest. Thesis: Ph.
