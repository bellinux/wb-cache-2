The result of works in the field of the theory of burning was creation of fundamentally new effective method <b>of</b> jet stabilizing <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> fuels. Also this research resulted in creation of self-regulating combustion and fire-box equipment chambers with high power indexes, hypotoxicity of products of burning and low-toxic burning of alternative fuels.

40|$|This study {{employed}} a laboratory-scale fluidized bed incinerator {{to investigate the}} emission characteristics of chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols and dioxins in the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> organic and inorganic chlorides with different additives CaO and CuO. Experimental results showed that most benzene and phenol compounds were present in gas phase but most dioxins were present in solid phase. More gas-phase chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols were emitted from the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> inorganic chloride than organic chloride. With additive CaO, the emission rate of HCl and the formations of chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols through Deacon Reactions were reduced, especially at higher operation temperature 800 degrees C. With additive CuO, the decompositions of benzene and phenol compounds were enhanced; however, more chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols were formed in specific cases such as incinerating organic chloride at lower temperature 600 degrees C. <b>Incineration</b> <b>of</b> organic chloride produced more dioxins than inorganic chloride. Adding CaO could reduce the formations and TEQ of dioxins in the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> organic chloride, but increased that in the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> inorganic chloride. This was attributed to that the fluidization quality and combustion efficiency of fluidized bed incinerator were invalid by the sintering or fusing of fluidized media with CaO and NaCl at high temperature...|$|R

40|$|<b>Incineration</b> <b>of</b> urban {{solid waste}} accidentally {{contaminated}} by orphan sources or radioactive material {{is a potential}} risk for environment and public health. Moreover, production and emission of radioactive fumes can cause a heavy contamination of the plant, leading to important economic detriment. In order to prevent such a hazard, in February 2004 a radiometric portal for detection of radioactive material in incoming waste has been installed at AMSA (Azienda Milanese per i Servizi Ambientali 2) “Silla 2 ” urban solid waste <b>incineration</b> plant <b>of</b> Milan. Radioactive detections performed from installation time up to December 2006 consist entirely of low-activity material contaminated from radiopharmaceuticals (mainly 131 I). In this work {{an estimate of the}} dose that would have been committed to population, due to <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> the radioactive material detected by the radiometric portal, has been evaluated. Furthermore, public health and environmental effects due to <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> a high-activity source have been estimated. <b>Incineration</b> <b>of</b> the contaminated material detected appears to have negligible effects at all; the evaluated annual collective dose, almost entirely conferred by 131 I, is indeed 0. 1 man mSv. Otherwise, <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> a 3, 7 1010 Bq (1 Ci) source of 137 Cs, assumed as reference accident, could result in a light environmental contamination involving a large area. Although the maximum total dose, owing to inhalation and submersion, committed to a single individual appears to be negligible (less than 10 − 8 Sv), the environmental contamination leads to a potential important exposure due to ingestion of contaminated foods. With respect to “Silla 2 ” plant and to the worst meteorological conditions, the evaluated collective dose results in 0, 34 man Sv. Performed analyses have confirmed that radiometric portals, which are today mainly used in foundries, represent a valid public health and environmental protection also in urban waste incineration plants...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} chemical kinetic {{reaction mechanism}} is developed to describe <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> the chemical warfare nerve agent sarin (GB), based on commonly used principles of bond additivity and hierarchical reaction mechanisms. The mechanism {{is based on}} previous kinetic models of organophosphorus compounds such as TMP, DMMP and DIMP that are often used as surrogates to predict <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> GB. Kinetic models of the three surrogates and GB are then used to predict their consumption in a perfectly stirred reactor fueled by natural gas to simulate <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> these chemicals. Computed results indicate that DIMP {{is the only one}} of these surrogates that adequately describes combustion of GB under comparable conditions. The kinetic pathways responsible for these differences in reactivity are identified and discussed. The most important reaction in GB and DIMP that makes them more reactive than TMP or DMMP is found to be a six-center molecular elimination reaction producing propene. ...|$|R

In 1960 s and 1970 s, forest fires occurred in the following order; carelessness of visitors to their ancestral tombs, children's playing with fire, burnings on the ridges between fields or rice paddles, <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> garbage, and incompletely extinguished cigarette butts stand {{in order for the}} highly causes of the fire. However, after 80 s, the order was changed to burnings on the ridges between fields or rice paddles, incompletely extinguished cigarette butts, <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> garbage, carelessness of gravesites, and children's playing with fire. The fire occurrences by gravesites and children's playing with fire were largely decreased except the fire which was broken out mistakenly by mountain-goers, but the one by burnings on the ridges between fields or rice paddles, <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> garbage, and incompletely extinguished cigarette butts showed a continuously increase.

40|$|Safe <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> {{harvested}} hyperaccumulators containing high {{content of}} heavy metals to avoid secondary environmental pollution {{is a problem}} for popularizing phytoremediation technology. The As volatilization behavior and its mechanism during <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> Pteris vittata, an As-hyperaccumulator, was investigated. Incineration results reveal that 24 % of total As accumulated by P. vittata (H-As) containing high As content (1170 mg/kg) is emitted at 800 °C, of which 62. 5 % of the total emitted As is volatilized below 400 °C. A study of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) shows that part of As(III) was identified in the thermal decomposition residue of dried P. vittata (H-As), As 2 O 5 + P. vittata (L-As) containing low As content (14. 7 mg/kg), and As 2 O 5 + charcoal (C) at 200 °C, suggesting that carbon originating from biomass incineration might catalyze As(V) reduction. This speculation was tested through thermogravimetric experiments, in which either C or P. vittata (L-As) markedly catalyzed the volatilization of pure As 2 O 5 at low temperature. Therefore, the reduction of As(V) to As(III) is responsible for As volatilization during <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> P. vittata below 400 °C. This study provides important insights into As behavior during <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> As-hyperaccumulators, which is helpful to safely dispose harvested biomass with high As content. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|R
