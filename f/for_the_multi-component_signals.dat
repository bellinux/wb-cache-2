Firstly, using the properties of FRFT and mask processing, Multi-component LFM sig-nals are filtered and demodulated {{into a number of}} stationary single frequency signals. Then the one-dimensional (1 -D) direction estimation of LFM signals can be achieved by combining with the tradi-tional spectrum search method in the fractional Fourier (FRF) domain. As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>multi-component</b> LFM <b>signals,</b> there is no cross-term interference, the mean square error (MSE) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) are also analyzed which perfects the method theoretically, simulation results are provided to show the validity of our method. The proposed algorithm is also extended to the uniform circular array (UCA), which realizes the two-dimensional (2 -D) estimation. Using the characteristics of time-frequency rotation and demodulation of FRFT, the observed LFM signals are demodulated into a series of single frequency ones; secondly, operate the beam-space mapping to the single frequency signals in FRF domain, which UCA in array space is changed into the virtual uniform circular array (ULA) in mode space; finally, the DOA estimation can be realized by the traditional spectral estimation method. Compared with other method, the complex time-frequency cluster and the parameter matching computation are avoided; meanwhile enhances the esti-mation precision by a certain extent. The proposed algorithm can also be used in the multi-path and Doppler frequency shift complex channel, which expands its application scope. In a word, a demodulated DOA esti-mation algorithm is proposed and is applied to 1 -D and 2 -D angle estimation by dint of ULA and UCA re-spectively.

30|$|Bird song {{analysis}} {{is only one}} of various several applications of time-frequency (TF) analysis of non-stationary signals and a significant number of approaches in this important field has been suggested. Since its introduction to bird song analysis in the 50 s, the sonogram (or TF spectrum) {{has become one of the}} most established tools in context of bird song investigation, and computationally efficient and robust algorithms for spectrogram-based TF analysis can be found using, e.g., multitapers (MTs). Originally, MTs were introduced by Thomson, [10], who proposed the discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences for estimation of a low-variance spectrum with pre-specified resolution. Nowadays, the noise-robust Thomson MTs are well-established in the context of stationary spectrum analysis and have found various application areas. Recently, the Hermite MTs, [11], have gained popularity, especially in applications with particular interest in estimation of the TF spectrum of non-stationary signals, [12 – 16]. As the MT spectrogram is known to reduce variation in amplitude and to limit resolution in time and frequency, it is tailored <b>for</b> <b>the</b> analysis of <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> with jitter, or variance, in both location of the components and their amplitudes, [17]. In contrast to TF distributions, that aim at optimal resolution of signal components and cross-term suppression, [18], MT spectrograms are more suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> type of data considered in this paper, as MTs are expected to smooth out small differences in time and frequency locations and therefore lower the in-class variance.|$|R

40|$|Fossil fuel {{reserves}} {{are projected to}} be decreasing, and emission regulations are becoming more stringent due to increasing atmospheric pollution. Alternative fuels for power generation in industrial gas turbines are thus required {{able to meet the}} above demands. Examples of such fuels are synthetic gas, blast furnace gas and coke oven gas. A common characteristic of these fuels is that they are multi-component fuels, whose composition varies greatly depending on their production process. This implies that their combustion characteristics will also vary significantly. Thus, accurate and yet flexible enough combustion sub-models are required for such fuels, which are used during the design stage, to ensure optimum performance during practical operating conditions. Most combustion sub-model development and validation is based on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) studies. DNS however is computationally expensive. This, has so far limited DNS to single-component fuels such as methane and hydrogen. Furthermore, the majority of DNS conducted to date used one-step chemistry in 3 D, and skeletal chemistry in 2 D only. <b>The</b> need <b>for</b> 3 D DNS using skeletal chemistry is thus apparent. In this study, an accurate reduced chemical mechanism suitable for multi-component fuel-air combustion is developed from a skeletal mechanism. Three-dimensional DNS of a freely propagating turbulent premixed flame is then conducted using both mechanisms to shed some light into the flame structure and turbulence-scalar interaction of such multi-component fuel flames. It is found that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>multi-component</b> fuel flame heat is released over a wider temperature range contrary to a methane flame. This, results from the presence of individual species reactions zones which do not all overlap. The performance of the reduced mechanism is also validated using the DNS data.
