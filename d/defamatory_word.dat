5000|$|In her book, Denying the Holocaust, Lipstadt called Irving a Holocaust denier, falsifier, and bigot, {{and said}} that he {{manipulated}} and distorted real documents. Irving claimed to have been libelled under the grounds that Lipstadt had falsely labelled him a Holocaust denier, falsely claimed that he had falsified evidence or deliberately misinterpreted it, by which false accusations his reputation as an historian was defamed. Though the author was American, Irving filed his suit in the English High Court, where the burden of proof in libel cases is on the defendant, unlike the US where the burden is on the plaintiff. He was able to file the lawsuit in England because the book was published there (before 1996, if Irving had wished to sue Lipstadt, {{he would have had to}} launch his legal action in an American court; English libel law applies only to alleged acts of libel committed in England and Wales).

During the campaign, Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) refused to air a segment produced by the Ekindi campaign on 2 October, judging that the segment included [...] "'vociferous attacks' against the CPDM and 'insulting and <b>defamatory</b> <b>words</b> against Paul Biya'". The National Communication Board reviewed this decision and decided to allow the segment to be aired on 7 October. Further messages from the Ekindi campaign on 9 October and 10 October {{were not allowed to}} be aired, however; according to the government, this was because Ekindi was [...] "not respecting legal provisions". According to the official results of the 1992 election, Ekindi received 0.79% of the vote (a total of 23,525 votes) and placed fifth. His best performance was in the Far North Province, where he won 9,903 votes.|$|R

5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie the plaintiff down; once the case came to court the bill could be amended to include any action or actions the plaintiff wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for <b>defamatory</b> <b>words</b> (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for trover and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived {{to see the results}} of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|R
50|$|Qualified {{privilege}} {{attaches to}} the occasion upon which the communication is made, {{and not to the}} communication itself. The legal effect of the defence of qualified privilege is to rebut the inference, which normally arises from the publication of <b>defamatory</b> <b>words,</b> that they were spoken with malice. Where the occasion is shown to be privileged, the bona fides of the defendant is presumed and the defendant is free to publish, with impunity, remarks which may be defamatory and untrue about the plaintiff. The privilege is not absolute, however, and can be defeated if the dominant motive for publishing the statement is actual or express malice. (Malice, in this context, is established by showing the defendant spoke dishonestly, or in knowing or reckless disregard for the truth.) Qualified privilege may also be defeated when the limits of the duty or interest have been exceeded. The fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily protect all that is said or written on that occasion. The information communicated must be reasonably appropriate {{in the context of the}} circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{political}} crimes in and women’s political activity in 18 th century Sweden. The cases of political crimes which has been used range from 1700 - 1789 and they form an outline of the patterns of political crime in this century. These cases contain different types of political crimes, but most common ar defamation of the royal family, defamatory writings, rumor-spreading and treason. To study women’s political activity, seven cases ranging from 1749 to 1758 have been more closely studied. All of these cases belong to the category defamation of the royal family. The study has shown that the frequency of cases of political crime fluctuates and incidents are most common between 1740 to 1759. Furhtermore different kind of crimes are more common in different periods of time. Treason is most common between 1710 and 1714 and cases of rumor-spreading only exist between 1740 and 1759. Few cases of these crimes being commited by women have been found, in only 19 out of 426 cases is the perpetrator a woman. These cases show that the demfamatory words whih are used depend on who they are used towards. The king is criticized for his politics, whereas the queen’s character is insulted. The study has also shown that there is no evidence that it was considered odd for women to commit these crimes, which can be connected to the different view on gender in early modern times.

40|$|Semantic reanalysis {{produces}} lexemes {{that bear}} positive connotations in AAE {{in contrast with}} their "Mainstream" American English (MAE) (Lippi-Green, 1997) homonyms. For example, bad-AAE, awesome, versus bad-MAE, characterized by negative qualities. This present survey of semantic reanalysis in AAE shows that lexical meaning is subject to analogous types of linguistic variation commonly discussed in variationist studies. It helps {{lay the foundation for}} a quantitative study of African American English (AAE) lexemes and semantic change through an exploration of semantic reanalysis. Previous investigations of semantic reanalysis (e. g. Smitherman, 1977) claim that using <b>defamatory</b> <b>words,</b> like bad, in positive ways derives from an African tradition, i. e. hypothesizing that these are semantic calquings from Niger-Congo languages. Although semantic reanalysis appears in West African languages, it is also used by minority groups with no West African connection. Additionally, although the sociohistorical evidence suggests that AAE is a restructured English variety, semantic reanalysis is not a necessary strategy for restructured Englishes. The inadequacy of Afro-genetic accounts, together {{with the fact that the}} linguistics literature lacks a cohesive discussion of AAE semantic reanalysis, has motivated the present study. It offers more accessible, verifiable and generalizable explanations for AAE semantics. This study reveals that AAE's distinct semantics cannot be attributed to Niger-Congo retention but rather to the ecology around which AAE emerged. I propose that AAE semantics derive from sociohistorical factors that have shaped the variety. I also suggest that semantic reanalysis is a productive, community-wide phenomenon that a number of AAE speakers employ as a form of responsive discourse, i. e. to differentiate themselves from non-community members. These results are based on quantitative and supplementary qualitative analyses of data from 53 AAE-speaking adults from the Rankin community in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Participants provided definitions and positive/negative evaluations of a variety of lexemes, including semantically reanalyzed words. Responses were coded using AAE and MAE dictionaries alongside my own native-speaker intuitions. Frequency analyses helped assess the pervasiveness of semantic reanalysis in the AAE community. Mixed-effects regression tests identified a generation-stratified pattern of variation wherein participants born after 1959 [...] i. e. post-de jure segregation [...] were more familiar with reanalyzed words...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aims of this project were to produce a calendar of {{the records of the}} Court of Chivalry in the 1630 s and then use this material to analyse concepts of noble honour. Recent work has highlighted the importance of honour in the social and cultural life of early modern England, and our project has confirmed and illustrated this. In March 1634 (not 1633 as the standard accounts have hitherto asserted) the ancient Court of Chivalry, the supreme forum for trial in matters of honour, was established {{for the first time on}} a regular basis, with weekly meetings and routine procedures based on Roman Civil Law. This happened largely because the Earl Marshal was given authority to hear pleas of slander and <b>defamatory</b> <b>words</b> or actions, on the basis of a Jacobean proclamation empowering him to intervene in disputes liable to provoke a duel. In the period between March 1634 and its suspension as a result of investigation by the Long Parliament in December 1640 the court heard well over a thousand cases, most of them relating to defamatory language and all of them brought by plaintiffs able to demonstrate their noble lineage. The records generated by these processes which were scattered among the archives at the College of Arms and Arundel Castle in Sussex - have long constituted one of the great unused sources for the history of Charles I's reign. Surviving material covers every stage of the courts proceedings and we have reconstituted the surviving archive on a case by case basis. We have produced a published calendar of the archive Cases in the High Court of Chivalry 1634 - 1640 (Harleian Society, 2006 - 7) - which provides an extensive scholarly account of the courts proceedings and then summarises the content and case papers of each of the 738 cases for which we have been able to recover material. We have also set up web site The Court of Chivalry 1634 - 1640, www. court-of-chivalry. bham. ac. uk - which contains our transcripts and summaries of all the case papers, together with explanatory and introductory material, over a million words of text with extensive illustrations. Main Topics : This digital resource contains transcriptions of the case a papers for the 738 Court of Chivalry cases for which we have been able to recover details over this period. These are listed in alphabetical order of plaintiffs' names with the plaintiff and defendant appearing in the heading for each separate numbered document within the file. These cases cover a wide range of litigation over matters such as defamation, disputes over precedence, coats of arms, heralds visitations etc. all heard before the court between 1634 and 1640. They provide a mine of information for the social and cultural historian, as well as the local historian and genealogist. <br...|$|R
5000|$|In 793, Emperor Dezong sent eunuch {{messengers}} to Lu, secretly instructing him {{on several}} matters: that as for important matters, he should directly submit proposals to Emperor Dezong without first consulting Zhao; {{that he had}} heard reports that Miao Can (苗粲), the son of the deceased chancellor Miao Jinqing, had spoken <b>words</b> <b>defamatory</b> to Emperor Dezong, but because the matter was unclear, {{he wanted to make sure}} that Lu sent Miao Can and his brothers, all of whom shared names with ancient monarchs, [...] to posts with few authorities; and that he believed that Lu was being overly avoiding entanglement by refusing to accept any gifts. Lu wrote a lengthy response, pointing out, as to discussing the matters with Zhao, that chancellors properly should discuss important matters with each other; that, as to Miao Can's matter, that the law must be observed and where there was no evidence that Miao had carried out wrongdoing, it would be wrong to exile him based on innuendo; and, as to the matter of accepting gifts, that refusing all gifts was the best method to avoid appearance of favoritism.|$|R
