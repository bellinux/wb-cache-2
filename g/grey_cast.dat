[...] The crankcase contains a forged steel crankshaft which runs in five main bearings, and cast pistons with increased size gudgeon pins. [...] It has two valves per cylinder (eight valves in total), which are {{operated by a}} toothed belt-driven forged steel single overhead camshaft (SOHC) via hydraulic valve lifters, with the valves being closed by two concentric valve springs.

2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|E

50|$|MaterialsCast iron in {{the form}} of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron has been used for {{commercial}} pipeline construction since the 1800s in Europe. <b>Grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron has high resistance to mechanical and chemical influences. However, it is a very brittle material with low impact strength. Through a refined manufacturing process the tensile strength and flexural stiffness are dramatically improved. With the addition of magnesium graphite into the <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron melt, graphite flakes are transformed into spherical graphite nodules and with appropriate heat treatment the embrittlement is prevented yielding a material of increased ductility and strength. Ductile cast iron is composed of 90-95% iron {{in the form}} of scrap metal. It {{should be noted that the}} high dynamic stresses generated by driving in some cases exceed the service level design stresses. The driving process can be thought of as a quality control measure of wall thickness and crystalline structure.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron is characterised by its graphitic microstructure, {{which causes}} {{fractures}} {{of the material}} to have a grey appearance. It is {{the most commonly used}} cast iron and the most widely used cast material based on weight. Most cast irons have a chemical composition of 2.5-4.0% carbon, 1-3% silicon, and the remainder iron. <b>Grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron has less tensile strength and shock resistance than steel, but its compressive strength is comparable to low- and medium-carbon steel. These mechanical properties are controlled by {{the size and shape of}} the graphite flakes present in the microstructure and can be characterised according to the guidelines given by the ASTM.|$|E
