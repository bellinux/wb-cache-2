40|$|ICBM- 3 - 3 rd International Conference on Biogas MicrobiologyLinear olefins with 16 to 18 carbon atoms are {{frequently}} used as hydrophobic groups in oil soluble surfactants and as lubricating fluids. The production of olefins in petrochemical plants generates olefin contaminated wastewater {{that can be}} treated anaerobically in methanogenic bioreactors, coupling degradation to energy recovery. However, this conversion is generally slow, due to olefins ́ insolubility in water and poor bioavailability for microorganisms. Addition of an easy degradable carbon source may enhance the growth of hydrocarbon degrading methanogenic communities. In this study, <b>hexadecene</b> degradation by a methanogenic enrichment was stimulated by addition of yeast extract (0. 5 g·L- 1), lactate (4. 5 mmol·L- 1) or crotonate (4. 5 mmol·L- 1) as co-substrates. After stimulation with yeast extract or lactate, the microbial communities were able to convert <b>hexadecene</b> to methane 5 and 2. 5 times faster, respectively, than non-stimulated cultures. <b>Hexadecene</b> conversion to methane was not enhanced by crotonate addition. Further incubations with fermented yeast extract did not improve methane production from <b>hexadecene,</b> {{which suggests that the}} positive stimulatory effect of yeast extract was due to the extra carbon source and not to the supply of essential co-factors. The microbial community composition of the <b>hexadecene</b> degrading enrichments was studied by 16 S rRNA sequencing. Bacteria from the Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria(Deltaproteobacteria), Spirochaetes, Synergistetes and Thermotogaephyla were identified, with Syntrophobacterales, Spirochaetales and Synergistales as the most abundant orders. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominated over acetoclastic methanogens. Currently the isolation and identification of key microbial players involved in <b>hexadecene</b> degradation are ongoing.

40|$|UV-initiated (254 nm) hydrosilylation of <b>hexadecene</b> on Si(111) -H {{has been}} studied in the {{presence}} of various aliphatic and aromatic molecules (additives). Many of these additives cause an enhancement in the pseudo-first-order rate coefficient (kobs) of hydrosilylation, some up to 2007 faster than observed in neat <b>hexadecene.</b> It is proposed that these additives capture the photoejected electron from the surface, thereby increasing the probability of reaction of the alkene with the surface hole (h+), leading to Si 2 ̆ 013 C bond formation. While the ability of these additives to increase kobs is related to their reduction potential, aromatic additives are particularly efficient; we suspect {{this is due to the}} relatively strong physisorption of the aromatic molecules leading to a favorable geometry for electron transfer. The presence of these additives permits the use of a much lower intensity of UV light (30 3 ̆bcW/cm 2), reducing the probability of photodegradation of the monolayer, and maximum coverage can be reached within minutes.

40|$|Synthetic ether analogues (prototypes: miltefosine, {{perifosine}} and cdelfosine) {{of natural}} phospholipids are {{a family of}} anti-cancer drugs {{with a wide range}} of pharmacological behaviour. There is a growing interest in anti-cancer ether phospholipids owing to their seleC;! 1 vity against tumours which has resulted in a much lower toxicity, as compared with other classical anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. However, due to the presence of the phosphate diester, these compounds can be quickly biodegraded by enzymes of phospholipid metabolism. Consequently, the aims of this research project were to synthesise isosteric analogues of miltefosine, perifosine and edelfosine by replacing the two phosphorus-oxygen bonds with phosphorus-carbon bonds. Several methodologies for the preparation of phosphorus-carbon bonds were investigated and phosphinic acid analogues of miltefosine, perifosine and edelfosine were efficiently synthesised in good overall yields. The first phosphorus-carbon bond of miltefosine and edelfosine analogues was prepared by a radical hydrophosphorylation addition reaction, and the second by conversion to the P(III) silyloxy intermediate, followed by Michael-type addition to acrylonitrile and acidic hydrolysis of the silyl groups. Miltefosine analogue was synthesised in a total of six steps from <b>hexadecene,</b> in 69 % overall yield, and edelfosine analogue was synthesised in a total of ten steps from hexadecanol, in 8. 5 % overall yield.

Many studies have shown that under anaerobiosis, hydro-carbon oxidation can be coupled to sulfate reduction (28), and several sulfate-reducing bacteria have been reported to oxidize n-alkanes and/or n-alkenes (13, 15). Most of these strains are mesophilic, except Desulfothermus naphthae strain TD 3, which oxidizes alkanes at 55 to 65 °C (23). How-ever, in deep hot environments (e. g., oil reservoirs), it has been established that oil biodegradation could occur at tem-peratures up to 85 to 90 °C (3).

40|$|Two methods, the Toroidal Technique and the Forced Rayleigh Scattering (FRS) method, {{were used}} in the {{determination}} of the size of magnetic particles and their aggregates in magnetic fluids. The toroidal technique was used in the determination of the complex, frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility chi(omega) = chi ' (omega) - i chi" (omega) of magnetic fluids consisting of two colloidal suspensions of cobalt ferrite in <b>hexadecene</b> and a colloidal suspension of magnetite in isopar m with corresponding saturation magnetisation of 45. 5 mT, 20 mT and 90 mT, respectively. Plots of the susceptibility components against frequency f over the range 10 Hz to 1 MHz, are shown to have approximate Debye-type profiles with the presence of relaxation components being indicated by the frequency, f(max), of the maximum of the loss-peak in the chi"(omega) profiles. The FRS method (the interference of two intense laser beams in the thin film of magnetic fluid) was used to create the periodical structure of needle like clusters of magnetic particles. This creation is caused by a thermodiffusion effect known as the Soret effect. The obtained structures are indicative of as a self diffraction effect of the used primary laser beams. The relaxation phenomena arising from the switching off of the laser interference field is discussed in terms of a spectrum of relaxation times. This spectrum is proportional to the hydrodynamic particle size distribution. Corresponding calculations of particle hydrodynamic radius obtained by both mentioned methods indicate the presence of aggregates of magnetic particles...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, BaTiO 3 nanocrystals, Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 nanostructured microspheres, and cosubstituted Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 {{nanoparticles}} and ceramics {{were prepared}} using solvothermal, hydrothermal and citrate-gel methods. The ferroelectric {{properties of the}} prepared cosubstituted Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 ceramics were studied using P–E hysteresis loop, leakage, and polarization fatigue measurements. A two-phase solvothermal synthesis approach for the preparation of hydrophobic BaTiO 3 nanocrystals was developed. The two-phase method {{is based on the}} growth of nanocrystals at the oil/water interface by the reaction between metal surfactant complexes in the oil phase and a mineralizer in the water phase. Three kind of organic solvents, <b>hexadecene,</b> toluene, and heptane were used as the oil phase and compared to each other with respect to the product quality. The BaTiO 3 particles are crystalline with a mean size of 3. 7 nm and can be dispersed in a variety of organic solvents forming highly transparent dispersions. A hydrothermal method was developed for the synthesis of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 nanostructured microspheres consisting of granular nanoparticles and nano-platelets. The precursor powder was prepared using a diethylene glycol mediated coprecipitation method. Tailoring of the morphology was achieved by changing the precursor quantity, sodium hydroxide concentration, and reaction time. The formation mechanism of the nanostructured microspheres probably involves aggregation, followed by dissolution and recrystallization.

The synthesized nanoparticles were spherical ranging from 30 to 100 nm. Except Nb 5 +, other donor cations were introduced using the corresponding oxides that have advantages in terms of high purity, low cost, and availability. The Bi 3. 25 Pr 0. 75 Ti 2. 97 V 0. 03 O 12 ceramic is orthorhombic and its 2 Pr and 2 Ec values measured at 300 kV/cm were 35 μC/cm 2 and 148 kV/cm respectively.
