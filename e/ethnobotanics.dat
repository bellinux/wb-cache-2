Extracts were obtained with ethanol using distillation under reduced pressure and were characterized by qualitative assays and by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometery (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis revealed differences in Ichthyothere terminalis compounds according to locality. Plants from Cumaral contain saponins, coumarins, and tannins, while those from Abrego contains tannins, alkaloids, coumarins and flavoniods. Plants from Abrego contain octadecadien- 1 -ol (53. 5 %), caryophyllene oxide (30. 8 %), hexadecanol (24. 0 %), trans-β-caryophyllene (13. 6 %), cycloisolongifolene (11. 6 %), germacrene D (6. 0 %), and 9 -octadecen- 1 -ol (8. 0 %). Plants from Cumaral have citronellal (46. 4 %), p-cymene (6. 4 %), geraniol (5. 0 %), and citronellol (4. 6 %).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a key {{aspect of}} a sustainable pharmaceutical use of biodiversity: the increased demand of the pharmaceutical industry for biogenetic resources does not result in an increase of {{the market value of}} biodiversity. The increasing interest in biogenetic resources by the pharmaceutical industry since the late 1980 s has led, among other things, to contracts between large pharmaceutical firms and provider countries of biodiversity and to improved knowledge based on existing <b>ethnobotanic</b> research. The focus of this paper is on the incentives for different research and development strategies by the pharmaceutical industry and their impact on the resulting market value of biodiversity. Large pharmaceutical firms tend to analyse tropical gene resources as a whole, thereby ignoring the existing knowledge of traditional healers about the effectiveness of the species uses. By way of contrast, consulting the <b>ethnobotanic</b> knowledge would lead to an increase in the efficiency of research and development and therefore to an increase in the market value of biodiversity due to this new value-adding information. I will also argue that the regulatory instruments of patent protection are an incentive for the conservation of established research and development strategies. Thus the possibility of patenting prevents an increase of the market value of biodiversity through the creation of pharmaceuticals. biodiversity; biodiversity prospecting; patent system; pharmaceutical industry; sustainable development. ...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of plants}} for herbal {{medicine}} in the Indonesian aquaculture is still poorly known. The present study aimed to provide an inventory of the plants used by fish farmers, establishing their respective <b>ethnobotanic</b> importance and identifying the variables that determine the use and the choice of these plants in fish health management. A survey based on a semi-directive questionnaire was conducted using {{a representative sample of}} fish farmers (n = 504 from 176 villages) from the province of West Java. Of these fish farmers, 46 % [41 %, 50 %; CI 95 %] of them use plants in their farms and 79 species of plants belonging to 36 families have been identified. Most of these plants were common plants used also traditionally in human pharmacopeia. Four categories of plant use were identified namely: improvement of water quality; reduction of fish stress; increase of fish resistance to pathogens; and treatment of fish diseases (when an outbreak occurred). In order to appraise the significance of plant usage, the following <b>ethnobotanic</b> parameters were determined: the Use Value (UV), the Fidelity Level (FL) and the Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). The Use Value (UV) was generally low for plants except for Carica papaya which reached the highest UV scores. The majority of the plants were used according to personal experience of the fish farmers and the knowledge related to herbal therapy appeared variable among fish farmers. Only 26 species of plants had a UV > 0. 025. The highest Fidelity Level (FL) value was obtained for C. papaya. The Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) of each plant usage was relatively high for all four categories of use - ranging from 0. 78 to 0. 88 - but the same plant may have several therapeutic indications. The use of plants, as well as their variety and number, depended not only on fish species, production systems and production areas but also on social characteristics such as the professional experience of fish farmers and their ethnic origin. To our knowledge, this is the first <b>ethnobotanic</b> survey specifically applied to aquaculture. It was able to identify the species of plants used in the West Java Province, and how they are used. It also highlighted the significance of traditional Indonesian herbal therapy in aquaculture.
