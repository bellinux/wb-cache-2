Both {{compounds}} {{were easily}} obtained in using an aromatic iodination reaction with molecular iodine. The desired products were isolated in nearly quantitative yields after a simple extraction. The crude materials are pure according to NMR. ### Introduction 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dialkylanilines are useful {{building blocks for}} chemical synthesis as highlighted in several recent publications describing diversified applications: medicinal chemistry (1, 2, 3), materials (4) and ligand design for catalysis (5). These synthons are usually obtained by aromatic iodination of commercial 4, 6 -diiodoanilines. Most protocols imply the use of iodine monochloride, a hazardous fuming liquid (1, 4, 5), sophisticated reagents (benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (3, 6), [K(18 -crown- 6) ](ICl 2) (7) or molecular iodine {{in combination with other}} reagents (Ag 2 SO 4 (8) or iodic acid 2). However, almost 50 years ago, the first publication describing the aromatic iodination of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (9) implied a much simpler procedure using molecular iodine, which is also less hazardous than ICl. However, the isolation of the desired was reported only in moderate yield after a lengthy steam–distillation. While repeating this experiment we discovered that the crude material quantitatively recovered prior to distillation was analytically pure and could be used for further reactions. This simple protocol was simply scaled up to about 100 g of 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline and 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents 1. 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (liquid) - 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline (liquid) - molecular diiodine (solid) - diethyl ether - saturated aqueous sodium carbonate - saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate - CDCl 3 for NMR sample preparation ### Equipment 1. balance - fume hood - 2 L two-necked round-bottomed flask - funnel - 2 L separation funnel - 1 L or 2 L round-bottomed evaporation flask - 100 mL <b>dropping</b> <b>funnel</b> - mechanical stirrer - rotary evaporator - high vacuum pump - large crystallising dish - NMR spectrometer and tubes for NMR characterisation ### Procedure **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline** 1. Equip a 2 L two-necked flask with a mechanic agitator - Weigh out 119 g (0. 466 mol) of iodine in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. Dissolve it in 400 mL of diethyl ether. Pour the resulting solution into a 2 L two-necked flask using a funnel. Wash the funnel with a minimal amount of diethyl ether. - CAUTION: if the balance is not inside a fume hood, iodine must be weighed in a stoppered flask. In this case, the zero of the balance must be set with the round bottomed flask and the stopper. The flask is then removed from the balance and iodine added inside a fume hood. The flask is stopper and weighed. This process is repeated until the desired mass is reached. - Add 1 L of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. - Charge a <b>dropping</b> <b>funnel</b> with 80. 0 mL (75. 2 g, 424 mmol) of 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. Add the aniline dropwise in the stirred reaction mixture (approximate duration: 5 min). Gas evolution is observed. - CAUTION: In the case the gaseous evolution becomes too vigorous, addition and stirring can be temporarily halted. - Stir vigorously the resulting biphasic mixture for 2 h. Gas evolution continues in the beginning of this period. - PAUSEPOINT: It is possible to check the complete conversion by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase SiO 2, elution with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane v/v 2 : 8 Rf(2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 60, Rf(4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 55) - Destroy excess iodine by addition of sodium thiosulfate until the aqueous phases becomes perfectly colourless. - PAUSEPOINT: The colour of the aqueous phase is better observed by temporarily stopping agitation. - Separate the ethereal layer and extract the aqueous phase with 200 mL of diethyl ether. - Wash the combined organic phase with 300 mL of water, dry it over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporate using a rotary evaporator. - Dry the resulting dark liquid in high vacuum overnight. - Characterise the oily product by 1 H-NMR in CDCl 3. **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline** 1.

Gas evolution continues in the beginning of this period. - PAUSEPOINT: It is possible to check the complete conversion by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase SiO 2, elution with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane v/v 2 : 8 Rf(2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 50, Rf(4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisomethylaniline) = 0. 45) - Destroy excess iodine by addition of sodium thiosulfate with stirring until the aqueous phases becomes perfectly colourless. - PAUSEPOINT: The colour of the aqueous phase is better observed by temporarily stopping agitation. - Transfer the reaction mixture to the 2 L separation funnel. Separate the ethereal layer and extract the aqueous phase with 200 mL of diethyl ether. - Wash the organic phase with 300 mL of water, dry it over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporate using a rotary evaporator using a 2 L. - Pour the resulting oil in a crystallizing dish along with a minimal amount of diethyl ether to wash the flask. During the drying process 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline crystallises. - CAUTION: Crystallisation, which is exothermic, may occur abruptly resulting in the dish to become hot. - Characterise the oily product by 1 H-NMR in CDCl 3. ### Timing - 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline: 4 h + overnight drying. - 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline: 4 h + overnight drying. ### Anticipated Results Typical isolated yield for 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline 97 % (124. 7 g).

30|$|All the {{emulsions}} {{were prepared}} by seeded emulsion polymerization technique. The polymerization {{was carried out}} in a 250 -ml four-necked flask equipped with reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, <b>dropping</b> <b>funnels,</b> and temperature controller. Nitrogen atmosphere was maintained throughout the reaction. The flask was heated over a water bath. The remaining quantities of initiator, surfactant, buffer, and water were directly added into the reactor along with 10 % of total pre-emulsion prepared. The reactor was heated to constant temperature of 70 °C with a stirring rate of 300 rpm until slight blue color appeared. The reaction temperature was then raised to 78 - 80 °C and the remaining pre-emulsion was fed drop by drop into the flask for a period of 3.5 h. The reaction was further continued for 30 min after the addition of pre-emulsion was over. A digestive catalyst TBHP was added {{to take care of the}} unreacted monomer as it blocks the double bond present on the unreacted monomer so that it cannot lead to any further side reaction. The reaction was continued for another 10 min. The reaction temperature was then reduced to room temperature and the emulsion was filtered. All the emulsion polymers were synthesized following the aforesaid procedure under identical conditions.|$|R

30|$|Se/Te NWs were {{synthesized}} by a two-step solution process. First, {{fabrication of}} Te NCs by a chemical solution process similar to our previous report [23, 24]. Typically, 2 mmol of orthotelluric acid and 0.5 g SDBS {{were added to}} 100 mL pure water. The solution was then refluxed for 1 h until a clear solution was obtained. Then, the resulting solution was heated up to 95 °C {{at a rate of}} 10 °C/min in an argon atmosphere. After 30 min, 1.5 mL of hydrazine was quickly injected into the solution through a syringe and the solution turned black and cloudy immediately. The solution was kept at 95 °C for another 15 mins and then moved to an ice bath to quench the reaction to 0 °C. The resulting solution was refluxed at room temperature for different time periods in order to get NWs with different lengths. To obtain short Te nanorods and nanoparticles, the reflux time is about 1 or 2 days while it takes at least 6 days to obtain long Te nanorods. Second, to obtain the V-shaped or U-shaped Se/Te NWs, the resulting solution, which was refluxed for about 1 day, was heated to 95 °C, and then a 15 mL solution containing 1 mmol, 2 mmol, or 4 mmol selenious acid was added drop by <b>drop</b> through a <b>funnel</b> into the resulting solution containing trigonal Te nanorods and colloids. The corresponding feeding ratio between Se to Te is 1 : 2, 1 : 1, and 2 : 1, respectively. The solution was refluxed at 95 °C for another 3 h and cooled down to room temperature. On the other hand, to obtain Se/Te NW with a straight morphology, the resulting solution that had been refluxed for 4 days was heated to 95 °C, and then a 15 mL solution containing 2 mmol selenious acid was added drop by <b>drop</b> through a <b>funnel</b> into the resulting solution which contains trigonal Te nanorods and colloids. The solution was refluxed at 95 °C for another 3 h and cooled down to room temperature.|$|R
