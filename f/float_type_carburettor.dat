40|$|Vascular {{invasion}} of gastric carcinoma were studied in 102 cases of resected stomach cancer from {{view of the}} connective tissue's proliferation. 1) Blood vessel invasion were classified in three types, as follows: Extraluminal type, Embolus <b>type</b> and <b>Floating</b> <b>type.</b> Extraluminal type included {{invasion of}} tumor cell out of intima. The common type of blood vessel invasion in well diff. adenocarcinoma were embolus and <b>floating</b> <b>type,</b> while in poorly diff. adenocarcinoma were extraluminal type. 2) The lymph vessel invasion were more prominent in poorly diff. adenocarcinoma. 3) From electron microscopic observation of connective tissue's proliferation, in medullary carcinoma, embolus and <b>floating</b> <b>type</b> were more frequently than extraluminal type. Conversely, in scirrhous carcinoma. Extraluminal type was the most common. These findings indicated that type of vascular invasion might be strongly affected not only by cancerous proliferation but also by connective tissue's proliferation...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Float</b> <b>type</b> carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once the <b>float</b> <b>type</b> carburetor is under negative g conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, the float lifts {{toward the top of}} the fuel bowl as the float becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than the float and the fuel. The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel inlet valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{performs}} a comprehensive and comparative {{evaluation of the}} state of the art local features for the task of image based 3 D reconstruction. The evaluated local features cover the recently developed ones by using powerful machine learning techniques and the elaborately designed handcrafted features. To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, we choose to include both <b>float</b> <b>type</b> features and binary ones. Meanwhile, two kinds of datasets have been used in this evaluation. One is a dataset of many different scene types with groundtruth 3 D points, containing images of different scenes captured at fixed positions, for quantitative performance evaluation of different local features in the controlled image capturing situations. The other dataset contains Internet scale image sets of several landmarks with a lot of unrelated images, which is used for qualitative performance evaluation of different local features in the free image collection situations. Our experimental results show that binary features are competent to reconstruct scenes from controlled image sequences with only a fraction of processing time compared to use <b>float</b> <b>type</b> features. However, for the case of large scale image set with many distracting images, <b>float</b> <b>type</b> features show a clear advantage over binary ones...|$|R

As a background of this study, Goto City is an island municipality and suffering from depopulation because of low birth rate and longevity, and also, due to economic slide and decrease in employment. Goto City started the pilot project of <b>floating</b> <b>type</b> {{offshore wind power}} generation in 2009, supported by the Ministry of Environment.

This survey reveals significance and potential of this offshore project for Japan and Goto City, and finds out some challenges for the future. Next, out of several issues, this study focuses on the initial cost and considers how they can collect investment for expanding <b>floating</b> <b>type</b> offshore wind power generation. This article also refers to the possibility of communal investment as one of the ways to contribute to local revitalization. Finally, this study brings up several policy proposals for the project expansion in a way to benefit locality...|$|R

The 76 types are of die-cast zinc construction and were introduced in the early 1930s, replacing the earlier 6 series, which were of bronze construction, although basically the same design. The 276 type was introduced in 1940 in an attempt to improve the carburettor's durability in dusty and dirty operating environments.|$|R
