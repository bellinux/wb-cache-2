40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two types of drip {{irrigation}} line design on cotton yield, water use, and net returns. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} arid region of Xinjiang, Northwest China, during 2009 - 2010 growing years. The two types of lateral placement are commonly used by the local farmers in the area: <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> (two laterals controlling four rows) and single line designs (one lateral controlling four rows). The results indicated that less irrigation water was applied by single <b>line</b> compared with <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> design. This implies that more irrigation water could be saved using single line, by reducing the water consumption of cotton. The emergence rates for <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> were 2 and 6 % higher than those for single line design in 2009 and 2010. The seed cotton yields for <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> design were 5. 76 and 6. 41 Mg ha(- 1) which were 13 and 9 % higher than for single line design in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Single lines could however lower the investment cost compared to <b>double</b> <b>lines,</b> which produced 10 and 7 % more net income in 2009 and 2010, respectively. By contrast, the <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> was more profitable and suitable for the farmers in Northwest China than single line design...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Maricopa, Marana, and Glendale, Arizona in 2001 to measure cotton growth, yield, micronaire, and production costs in single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed systems on 32 and 40 inch beds. Canopy development was faster and canopy closure was greater in the <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> than in the single seed line systems and was greater in the 32 inch than in the 40 inch row systems. At Maricopa, the single line 32 inch system yield of 1571 lbs. /A was significantly greater than the yields of the other seed line/row spacing systems. The yields of the single line 40 and the <b>double</b> <b>line</b> 32 inch systems {{were not significantly different}} at 1476 and 1411 lbs. of lint/A, respectively, and the yields of the <b>double</b> <b>line</b> 32 and the <b>double</b> <b>line</b> 40 inch systems also were not significantly different at 1411 and 1396 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. There were no significant lint yield differences at the Marana or Glendale location. At Marana, the lint yields were 1063 and 1066 lbs. /A for the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> 40 inch row spacing systems, respectively. At Glendale, the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> 38 inch row spacing systems yielded 1474 and 1551 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. In all 2001 experiments, there was a trend for reduced micronaire in the <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed systems compared to the single seed line per bed systems. At Maricopa, the average micronaire was 5. 0 and 4. 7 for the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed 32 inch row system, respectively, and 5. 2 and 4. 9 for the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed 40 inch row systems, respectively. At Marana, the micronaire was 4. 7 and 4. 5 for the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed 40 inch row systems, respectively. At Glendale, the micronaire was 5. 1 and 4. 6 for the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed 38 inch row systems, respectively. Production costs were similar for the single and <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed systems. Additional research will be conducted in 2002 to determine the optimum plant populations and in-row plant spacings for <b>double</b> seed <b>line</b> per bed production systems...|$|R
