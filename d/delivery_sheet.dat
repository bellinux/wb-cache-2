25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from <b>delivery</b> <b>sheets</b> via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|R

The discussion aims at contributing to the identification of factors that impact production systems design, which includes the definition of buffer locations, buffer profiles, batch sizes, etc. The authors use a simulation model developed using STROBOSCOPE to represent five different scenarios for planning, fabrication, shipping, and installation of sheet metal ductwork in order to illustrate how production system design choices may affect the lead time needed to deliver a project. The data used to develop the model was obtained from time studies performed by the authors as well as from interviews conducted with field superintendents. In order to develop the model, the authors needed basic information about activities pertaining to the <b>delivery</b> of <b>sheet</b> metal ductwork. Modeled durations and quantities are approximations based on the data collected.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the maternal {{risk factors of}} low birthweight (LBW) in Thailand and to address the possible activities to {{reduce the incidence of}} LBW. Material and Method: The data were obtained from the Prospective Cohort Study in Thai Children (PCTC). Three thousand five hundred twenty two pregnancies initiated the follow-up in the year 2000 at four districts across Thailand. The birthweight was retrieved from the <b>Delivery</b> Summary <b>Sheet</b> of the hospitals. The babies born in the hospital were weighed within the first day of life. The babies born at home were weighed within 3 days after birth by the research assistants. Only singleton live births were included in the present study. Results: Three thousand three hundred twenty two live births with birthweight data, 8. 6 % were LBW. Mater-nal factors affecting LBW with high attributable fraction (AF) and moderate population attributable risk (PAR) were maternal extreme age (AF = 45. 96, PAR = 16. 24) and weight gain during pregnancy less than 10 kg. (AF = 40. 12, PAR = 16. 05). The factors with moderate AF and PAR were first and more than two parities (AF = 21. 9, PAR = 15. 51) and less consultation to health personnel (AF = 20. 96, PAR = 16. 98).

40|$|Direct {{intracardiac}} cell injection {{for heart}} repair is hindered by numerous limitations including: cell death, poor spreading of the injected cells, arrhythmia, needle injury, etc. Tissue-engineered cell sheet implantation {{has the potential}} to overcome some of these limitations. We evaluated whether the transplantation of a muscle-derived stem cell (MDSC) sheet could improve the regenerative capacity of MDSCs in a chronic model of myocardial infarction. MDSC sheet-implanted mice displayed a reduction in left ventricle (LV) dilation and sustained LV contraction compared with the other groups. The MDSC sheet formed aligned myotubes and produced a significant increase in capillary density and a reduction of myocardial fibrosis compared with the other groups. Hearts transplanted with the MDSC sheets did not display any significant arrhythmias and the donor MDSC survival rate was higher than the direct myocardial MDSC injection group. MDSC sheet implantation yielded better functional recovery of chronic infarcted myocardium without any significant arrhythmic events compared with direct MDSC injection, suggesting this cell <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery</b> system could significantly improve the myocardial regenerative potential of the MDSCs.

40|$|Different {{forms of}} CNT {{delivery}} {{have been discovered}} with several biomedical functions during past decades. The mechanisms of the cellular uptake of CNTs are mainly maintained due to the chemical nature, the cell type, and {{the features of the}} molecules, which are used to functionalize the nanotube exterior. Since single-wall carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) has unique chemical and physical properties, it is a great applicant for pH sensing. In addition, ion sensitive FET (ISFET) base on nanostructured SWCNT have covered a new method to help genetic investigators restructure metabolic pathways in cells, recognize the progression of disease, and expand diagnostics and therapeutics. Particularly, because PH sensing is very crucial for the constancy of enzymes, it is essential to extend the cost efficient types of this sensing. In this research, the conductance changes of the CNT-based ISFET device with different pH values can be modelled by ion concentration of the solution. In addition, the electrical current of channel is imagined as a function of pH levels, which can be controlled by a control factor (a). Thus, ISFET based nanostructured SWCNT is proposed focusing on the area of electrical detection of hydrogen ions of the electrolyte membrane. Besides, electrical detection of hydrogen ion applications is suggested to be used by modelling the <b>delivery</b> of SWCNT <b>sheets.</b> In the end, after comparing the proposed model and experimental data, {{it has been reported that}} there is a good compatibility between them...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of plasma properties at geosynchronous orbit for electron and ion energies between ∼ 1 eV and ∼ 45 keV, between 1990 and 2001. The variations of temperature and density are analyzed as functions of local time, magnetospheric convection strength, {{and the strength of}} the ring current. Various parameters derived from temperature and density are calculated to elucidate the temporal and spatial location of <b>delivery</b> of plasma <b>sheet</b> material into the inner magnetosphere. We find that the electron and proton densities are greatest in the dawn region for the periods of highest convection and ring current strength. We perform a superposed epoch analysis of 283 geomagnetic storms which occurred between 1991 and 2001 and examine the temporal variation of the plasma at geosynchronous orbit as a function of storm phase. This analysis demonstrates the local time variability of delivery from the plasma sheet into the inner magnetosphere and the concurrent changes in temperature and pressure. We demonstrate that the density of electrons in the plasma sheet is strongly dependent upon the magnetospheric convection strength and, for the first time, upon solar activity. Electron density at geosynchronous orbit is strongly correlated with solar activity. The average plasma sheet electron density at solar maximum can be a factor of two or more higher than that at solar minimum. We also outline a method to estimate the composition of the plasma sheet from MPA measurements and calculate the O+ and H+ density variations with solar cycle as a function of Kp and local time. We show that the O+ and H+ plasma sheet densities increase with increasing solar activity, as does the O+/H+ density ratio. During times of high solar activity and strong convection, the O+ and H+ densities may be comparable...|$|R

Comparison of the DGV data with LDV measurements shows very good agreement to within 1 - 2 m/s. The remaining discrepancy has a variety of causes, some are related to the reduced resolving power of the fiber imaging bundle system (graininess, smoothing), exact localization of the receiver head with respect to the scene, laser frequency drift or background influences.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview on the applicability of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) in combustion test facilities and summarizes experiences gained {{in a number of}} applications that were performed in the past 6 years. Emphasis is placed on the experimental aspects of each application rather than the interpretation of the acquired flow field data because many of the encountered problems and chosen solution strategies are unique to this area of planar velocimetry application. In particular imaging configurations, seeding techniques, data acquisition strategies as well as pre- and post-processing methodologies are outlined. The paper describes four similar applications of PIV in atmospheric and pressurized combustors containing single burners that are operated either with kerosene or natural gas. Aside from providing adequate optical access to the respective facilities the most challenging issue has been the reliable supply of non-volatile and non-reacting solid particle seeding. Given the rather large mass flows of up to 1 kg/s inside the combustors, sufficient seeding quantities could best be delivered by fluidized bed particle generators, sometimes even operated in parallel. The devices have been continually improved to allow constant delivery rates only during data acquisition periods, thus preventing unnecessary collection of seeding in the facility. The choice and handling of the seeding particle powder was found to be crucial for the overall success of the measurements. The first application describes initial trials on a swirled kerosene spray fuel nozzle at 3 bars and illustrates problems encountered due to flame luminosity as well as strong light scattering from the fuel droplets. The second application summarizes the challenges faced in obtaining phase-resolved, three-component velocity data from a generic atmospheric gas combustor using stereoscopic PIV. A much larger, swirl stabilized gas burner as utilized in stationary power generation was the subject of the third described application. Here a novel methodology of data acquisition and post-processing provides phase resolved velocity maps even of flows that have non-constant oscillation frequencies. Finally, the fourth application describes how the combination of PIV with DGV can yield three-component velocity data in areas of limited optical access using only one viewing window and one separate window (or probe) for light <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|R

Both DGV systems were mounted on a common traverse surrounding the glass-walled 1. 4 x 1. 8 m 2 test section of the ONERA F 2 wind tunnel. The traverse normally supports a three-component forward-scatter laser Doppler velocimetry system. The reproducible vortical flow field generated by the blunt tip of an airfoil (300 mm chord) was chosen for this investigation and was precisely surveyed by LDA just prior to this investigation. Both DGV systems shared the same continuous wave laser light source (argon ion, 514 nm), laser frequency stabilization and fiber optic light <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery</b> system. The principle differences between the DGV implementations are {{with regard to the}} imaging configuration. The ONERA Configuration relied on a single camera view that observed three successively operated light sheets. The DLR configuration used three camera views simultaneously to observe a single light sheet using a four-branch fiber imaging bundle. In both configurations off-normal viewing arrangements were present, the DGV system of ONERA observed two light sheets in forward scattering and one in back-scattering mode which had a roughly ten times lower signal level. The DLR system had all viewing directions at a similar forward scattering angle, such that all views had approximately the same signal levels at the exit of the fiber imaging bundle. The closed-circuit wind tunnel was seeded globally with sub-micron oil droplets using an oil-based smoke generator. Stream-tube seeding was used in addition to improve the back-scatter signal levels. CCD camera exposures varied from 0. 25 − 2. 0 seconds in forward scattering views to 2 − 5 seconds in back scattering views. The subsequent processing of the multi-view DGV data resulted in improvements of DLR’s DGV software package to deal, for instance, with artifacts introduced by the image fiber bundles. The availability of reproducible reference data from LDA allows a further quantification of error sources in the DGV measurements. Overall the agreement between the DGV and the LDA measurements is on the order of 1 m/s for the DLR system. Residual bias is believed to be caused by scene illumination stemming from the luminous light sheet within the seeded flow which cannot be easily quantified in absence of seeding (i. e. by background image acquisition). Also the spatial averaging imposed by the optical system dampens out velocity gradients such that vortex peaks are underestimated in comparison to the ONERA DGV system which has a higher optical fidelity (see Part II). Nonetheless the DLR system was shown to acquire reliable 3 -C velocimetry data using single recordings of the composite views. In principle the presented configuration would be well suited for pulsed DGV measurements using a single light sheet...|$|R

Enquanto estudo de caso abrange a análise de Processo do Ministério Público de Goiás, dos Relatórios da Comissão Especial de Investigação (CEI) e de Cassação da Câmara Municipal de Anápolis e do Processo da Assembléia Legislativa. Mesmo tendo como interesse maior o ano de 2003, o estudo apresenta informações sobre o FUNDEF em Anápolis de 2001 a 2006. Na análise desse período, o município ganha com o FUNDEF, por um lado devido à quantidade de alunos da sua rede municipal, por outro, por receber mais recursos que envia a esse Fundo. Constatou-se ainda que houve um aumento de 21, 86 % no número de alunos na rede municipal de ensino em razão da implantação do FUNDEF no período de 1996 a 2006. Entretanto, as escolas particulares tiveram um aumento maior, 95, 1 %. Na implantação do FUNDEF, os salários dos professores foram melhorados, porém, posteriormente, esses profissionais ficaram sem aumento salarial de 1998 a 2003. Em 2004, o aumento foi de apenas 6, 4 %. Na análise da situação do ensino fundamental em Anápolis, no período compreendido entre 2001 a 2003, verificou-se uma completa falta de cuidado com esse nível de ensino: carência da estrutura física das escolas, ausência de equipamentos em sala de aula e de material de consumo, atraso no pagamento de salários de 196 professores em pró-labore e uma lista de 30 pessoas que não eram professores do ensino fundamental e mesmo assim recebiam salários com recurso do FUNDEF. No que diz respeito à fiscalização desse recurso, verificou-se atraso na entrega dos balancetes tanto pela prefeitura à Câmara Municipal, quanto pelo Tribunal de Contas dos Municípios a mesma. Além disso, foi percebida a fragilidade do Conselho do FUNDEF e a morosidade da Câmara em aprovar a intervenção, o que ocorreu após uma mobilização na cidade com passeata e abaixo-assinado pedindo a saída do prefeito. Entretanto, mesmo com a entrada do interventor e a saída do prefeito, os problemas na área educacional continuaram acontecendo.

However, the private schools had a bigger growth, 95. 1 %. In the implantation of the FUNDEF the teachers salary was improved but, soon after, these professionals had no raise whatsoever form 1998 to 2003. In 2004 the raise was of only 6. 4 %. In the situation analyses of the basic teaching system in Anápolis, between the time period of 2001 to 2003, a complete lack of care was noticed in this level of teaching, poor physical structures of the schools, the lack of class room equipment and consumption material, salary payment delay of 196 teachers in pro-labor and a list of 30 people who were not teacher in the basic teaching systems who also received salaries with the resources of FUNDEF.
