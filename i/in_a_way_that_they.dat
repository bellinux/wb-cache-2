2500|$|At {{that time}} in England, politics, {{religion}} and education were unified <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not now.

Officially, there was no such thing as [...] "Whig and Tory" [...] at the time, but the labels are useful and were certainly employed by writers themselves. The two major parties were associated with religious and economic groups. The implications of this unification of politics, class, and religion are important. Although it is somewhat extreme and simplistic to put it this way, failing to be for the Church was failing to be for the monarch; having an interest in physics and trade was to be associated with dissenting religion and the Whig Party. When Swift attacks the lovers of all things modern, he is thereby attacking the new world of trade, of dissenting religious believers, and, to some degree, an emergent portion of the Whig Party.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on {{the scoring}} {{strengths}} of the batsman (off-side, leg-side, straight, square, front foot, back foot, power hitter, [...] "finds the gap", [...] "clears the field" [...] and so on), the captain must make adjustments to the field each time the batting pair score a run and change ends, which can possibly happen after every ball in an over. To {{meet the demands of}} a speedy over-rate (typically, about 15 overs an hour), the captain must arrange the fielders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can swiftly interchange positions for the two batsmen. This is especially important if one batsman is right-handed, while the other is left-handed. And also in limited overs cricket if the umpires deem the over rate of the team fielding first is too slow they can dock them overs so they may have less than 20/50 overs to reach their target score when it is their turn to bat.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two main}} characters, Weebl and Bob, are best friends, but are easily prone to harassing and {{insulting}} each other though these insults are mainly directed at Bob. Both characters are egg-shaped creatures with wide mouths that split {{their heads in}} half (like South Park's representation of Canadians), and move by rolling, hopping or swaying back and forth. They just mutter and 'talk' <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> seem to understand {{between the two of}} them. Weebl is the larger of the two, during the series it is revealed that Bob's small stature is due to a cheese overdose in the 1980s. [...] Many of their stories are centred around their love of pie, a devotion shared by most of the other characters in their world—these episodes generally depict one of their several (often failed) attempts to obtain it. We also know that the two characters don't have a house as Weebl sold it to buy a rocket ship. Some episodes are a vehicle to introduce a new character into the storyline, while others are parodies of cultural phenomena, such as Hello Kitty, Japanese karate and ninja movies, '80s anti-drug documentaries, Michael Moore's documentary film Fahrenheit 9/11, Kill Bill, the crime drama , the iPod [...] "silhouette" [...] ad campaign, the MTV show Pimp My Ride, the game show The Krypton Factor, Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I, the video game Portal, Final Fantasy VII, the Academy Awards and even retailers such as PC World ('Pissy Werld' in the show), IKEA (or 'PIKEA') and Matalan ('Catalan').|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} tracks on the album include [...] "Bonsai People", which is a Red Hot Chili Peppers type funk metal song. The lyrics compare childlike people to bonsai trees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are tiny (humble, God-fearing) but as a strong breed they can endure the rending of wind (temptation) since their roots are deeply entrenched into soil (word of God). [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] {{on the other hand}} is a dark, melodic black metal type song which begins with oppressive clean guitaring. With a haunting voice a person whispers the words [...] "Hell is a totally cool site, so let's get there, all right?". This sentence is probably an attempt to describe the attitude of some of the black metal fans; the lyrics tell that those who say things like that are under the 'spell of hell' which the devil uses to mislead people. Consecutively, {{it can be said that}} [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] was Deuteronomium's way of expressing their stance on the black metal movement which had at that time become very popular, with Emperor and likes being played on the Finnish metal radio program 'Metalliliitto', as the band members recall in an interview. [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] became Deuteronomium's best known song. The songs [...] "III" [...] and [...] "Northern Praise" [...] are also black metal influenced and present more worshipful lyrics, the forementioned is vocalized in Finnish and refers to the trinity of God. The latter is also a somewhat popular song as it is noted for being one of their best known songs. The self-titled song [...] "Street Corner Queen" [...] is a punk rock influenced death metal song about a prostitute, the lyrics tell that she sells love though deep inside she knows that it's not love at all, and that she seeks comfort from wrong ways. [...] "Druglord" [...] is another punk rock influenced death metal track. The lyrics are written from the perspective of a young person who suffers from drug addiction.|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "air drop" [...] {{sequence}} {{was conceived}} by stunt coordinator, Spiro Razatos, who also supervised on the franchise's two previous installments; Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6. Razatos told Business Insider {{that he wanted}} to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to [...] "feel real" [...] and fulfill audience's expectations. The stunt took months of prep-solving problems. Cameras needed to be mounted onto cars <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not be destroyed when the cars landed, and the crew had to figure out a safe way to get the cars out of the plane. They performed a dry run with a single car falling out of a plane and did this six times. Cars were dropped from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules high above the Arizona desert, but close up shots that show the cars landing on a mountain road were filmed in Colorado. There were two airplanes, flying at a height of 12,000 feet, each dropping two cars apiece. BRS parachutes enabled with GPS were secured to each of the cars before dropping off the C-130 plane. At about 5,000 feet, the parachutes deployed. Over 10 cameras were used for the sequence. In addition to cameras on the ground, there were cameras remotely operated inside the plane and another three mounted outside each car. Additional cameras were on a helicopter, where Razatos was stationed watching monitors. Three skydivers used in the shoot wore helmet cameras to help shoot the sequence from multiple angles. Sky divers would either jump out before cars or after them. While all the cars landed on their drop zones, 70% landed perfectly and 30% didn't. For the close-up scenes which show the actors inside their cars, a giant gimbal with a 360-degree range of movement were attached to each of the cars and was filmed against a green screen to reproduce their tumble through the sky. The last part of the scene, which shows the cars hitting the road was shot separately. To get that right, the team set up a pulley system that had cars six to ten feet above the ground. When they were dropped from the cranes, the stuntmen who were sitting in the driver's seats raced their engines at about 35 to 40 miles per hour and slid to the ground at full speed. Those cranes were then later removed from the film with computers. Razatos admits that the air drop sequence was [...] "all real" [...] {{and that it would be}} [...] "hard to top".|$|E
