25|$|When {{the first}} US Air Force flight {{arrived in the}} area, Route 4 was {{declared}} a <b>fire</b> <b>co-ordination</b> line between the artillery and the aircraft. To {{the west of the}} road the artillery fired to stop the communist assault, while to the east American air power dropped bombs, rockets, and fired 20-mm cannon fire. The massive and use of air strikes and artillery was the main reason for the eventual US victory.|$|E

An Air-Ground Operations School was opened in May to train forward air guides (FAGs) from the Army and in July, the KAF began providing forward air controllers to the Army's new Artillery <b>Fire</b> <b>Co-ordination</b> Centre (AFCC) that would relay targets from Army field commanders on the ground to the DASC. On August 15, 1973, a ceasefire came into effect in Indochina and US tactical and strategic air support was terminated, with the Khmer Air Force assuming full responsibility for all air operations in Cambodia. With the Khmer Rouge guerrillas controlling large parts of the countryside, the Khmer National Armed Forces were fighting an up-hill battle.|$|E
25|$|Tunguska {{underwent}} further improvement when, in 2003, the Russian {{armed forces}} accepted the Tunguska-M1 or 2K22M1 into service. The M1 introduced the new 9M311-M1 missile, which {{made a number}} of changes allowing the 2K22M1 to engage small targets like cruise missiles by replacing the eight-beam laser proximity fuze with a radio fuse. An additional modification afforded greater resistance to infrared countermeasures by replacing the missile tracking flare with a pulsed IR beacon. Other improvements included an increased missile range from 8 to 10km, improved optical tracking and accuracy, improved <b>fire</b> control <b>co-ordination</b> between components of a battery and the command post. Overall, the Tunguska-M1 has a combat efficiency 1.3â€“1.5 times greater than the Tunguska-M.|$|R
