60|$|A grisly little fiction {{concerning}} <b>her</b> <b>lovers</b> is Lady Tippins's point.

Mrs Veneering is charmed by the humour, and so is Veneering. Perhaps it is enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins's throat, like the legs of scratching poultry.|$|R

5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story.

The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
