[...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, because I thought, What if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the money back?"

500|$|By 1966, Cardinale {{was being}} {{cited as the}} most popular film star in Italy, even more than Mastroianni and Loren. Life stated that [...] "the Cardinale appeal {{is a blend of}} solid {{simplicity}} and radiant sensuality. It moves men {{all over the world to}} imagine her both as an exciting mistress and wife." [...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the money, I give it up. I do not want to become a cliché." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Quake movie critics found {{shortcomings}} in Diary of a Camper, they mentioned positive aspects, including the work's novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that [...] "the camera work {{was very nice}} and never once screwed up", and Lum gave the film [...] "a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [...] started the Quake Movie craze". Of the major Quake movie review sites, only The Cineplex gave Diary a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10. Matthews and Coates rated the film 20%, and 2 out of 10, respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, [...] "I feel I overreacted {{at the fact that}} DoaC was old. It's the first ever Quake movie. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Rangers massive credit for that.... But, by today's standards, the rating seems to fit." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter's uncle. Sheen {{admitted}} he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal, and knew {{little of the}} character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part. Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, [...] "I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the marching orders and so forth." [...] Webb said, [...] "You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [...] He has that sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, {{in terms of the}} dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-à-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents." [...] Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.|$|E

Till joined fellow League Two club Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 15 January 2009, having made 21 {{appearances}} and scored two goals for Grimsby {{up to that point}} during the season. He made his debut in a 3–1 victory at Chester on 17 January 2009 and in February the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after impressing manager Lee Richardson. Grimsby released him on 30 April 2009 and in retrospect he commented [...] "It has been a wake-up call if I am honest. I have realised that I can't coast if I want to get to where I want to be. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> 110 per cent every day, not just in games".

500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E

Angelina {{is getting}} into a bit of shenanigans and trouble along the way, {{just to make sure}} people are on their toes." [...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode". Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Orbison often excused his {{motionless}} {{performances by}} saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like [...] "Mean Woman Blues" [...] did offer that. He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, [...] "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs.

[...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it fun to just drive around, but I still wish there was something more unique to this game. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used to be a really stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up. I feel like the controls are more forgiving, too, and the open-world freedom makes the whole thing a lot more approachable." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Maya {{culture was}} an important inspiration for Asturias. He saw a direct relationship between magical realism and Indigenous mentality, saying, “...an Indian or a mestizo in a small village might describe how he saw an enormous stone turn into a person or a giant, or a cloud turn into a stone. That is not a tangible reality but one that involves an understanding of supernatural forces. That is why when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it a literary label I call it [...] "magic realism." [...] Similarly, scholar Lourdes Royano Gutiérrez argues that surrealist thought is not entirely different from the indigenous or mestizo worldview. Royano Gutiérrez describes this worldview as {{one in which the}} border between reality and dream is porous and not concrete. It is clear from both Asturias' and Gutiérrez' quotes that magical realism was seen as a suitable genre to represent an indigenous character's thoughts. The surrealist/magical realist style is exemplified in Asturias' works Mulata de tal and El señor Presidente.|$|E

However it was pushed back for undisclosed reasons, then in December it was revealed the band had left Sony Music, after the label had refused to release the album. On 11 November 2011 Rogue Traders finally released Night of the Living Drums, after they had re-signed to Sony. It was released as part of The Sound of Drums which is a double album that includes a compilation disc, The Greatest Hits, and the studio recording, Night of the Living Drums. Ash described The Sound of Drums conception, [...] "he catalyst was when we realised we were coming up to the band's 10-year anniversary.

2500|$|He had overheard {{the phrase}} [...] "as queer as a {{clockwork}} orange" [...] in a London pub in 1945 and {{assumed it was}} a Cockney expression. In Clockwork Marmalade, an essay published in the Listener in 1972, {{he said that he}} had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from William Everson on the television programme Camera Three in 1972, [...] "Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It's a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase [...] "as queer as a clockwork orange" [...] is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it an extra meaning. I've implied an extra dimension. I've implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the orange – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined. I've brought them together in this kind of oxymoron, this sour-sweet word." [...] Nonetheless, no other record of the expression being used before 1962 has ever appeared. Kingsley Amis notes in his Memoirs (1991) that no trace of it appears in Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Historical Slang.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Murray and Burton were {{confirmed}} as having declined {{to return to}} the series. For months, it was speculated {{that they would not be}} returning for the seventh season. Then, in February, The CW announced a series renewal without specifying which cast members had renewed their contracts. A video of Murray, seemingly unaware he was being filmed, saying the show was not bringing him back because they wanted to save money, and encouraging fans to rally behind him, intensified speculation. A video of Burton saying she would stay if she had creative control also surfaced, fueling speculation that The CW did not want to keep Burton on the show without Murray. To some fans, One Tree Hill without Murray and Burton sounded [...] "kind of like Seinfeld without Seinfeld... and Elaine". It elicited skepticism from fans who consider the heart of the show to be the dynamic between their characters, Lucas and Peyton. A TVGuide.com poll found that nearly half of respondents, however, were willing to take a [...] "wait and see" [...] approach to a revamped version of the series. In April, Schwann told a crowd in Paris that all of the actors had signed on for season 7, except for Murray and Burton. [...] "They're in negotiations right now and I know they've been offered great things, and hopefully they'll decide to come back", he said. [...] "If they don't, that's always a possibility... has made it through some of the riskier moves we've done." [...] In May, CW entertainment president Dawn Ostroff stated, [...] "We tried to get them to stay; we would have been thrilled if they wanted to." [...] She said that since Murray and Burton were moving on, Tree Hill now had to reinvent itself a bit– as it did in 2007, with the four-year flash-forward. [...] "A show going into its seventh year is very open to reinventing itself," [...] said Ostroff. [...] "And one thing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Mark Schwahn a lot of credit for is that he has kept the show so fresh all these years." ...|$|E
