60|$|There {{are many}} persons in whom such {{proposals}} will raise strong prejudices. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> follow out in thought {{the result of}} yielding to these prejudices. If we oppose in detail every means by which Germany or Russia can recover their material well-being, because we feel a national, racial, or political hatred for their populations or their Governments, we {{must be prepared to}} face the consequences of such feelings. Even if there is no moral solidarity between the nearly-related races of Europe, there is an economic solidarity which we cannot disregard. Even now, the world markets are one. If we do not allow Germany to exchange products with Russia and so feed herself, she must inevitably compete with us for the produce of the New World. The more successful we are in snapping economic relations between Germany and Russia, the more we shall depress the level of our own economic standards and increase the gravity of our own domestic problems. This is to put the issue on its lowest grounds. There are other arguments, which the most obtuse cannot ignore, against a policy of spreading and encouraging further the economic ruin of great countries.|$|E

You think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but to make money and drive sharp bargains. That's a fair description of me, {{but it is not the}} whole story. A man ought to care for something else, though I don't know exactly what. I cared for money-making, but I never cared particularly for the money.

Over the objections of my accountant, who saw all sorts of possible legal problems, I established a policy which still holds today.

However, Clarke is almost universally {{regarded as a}} conservative and {{has been referred to}} as [...] "right of most righties." [...] Clarke [...] "is frequently critical of Milwaukee Democrats, such as Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett; he speaks at many Republican functions, and he has the backing of the National Rifle Association," [...] which has raised funds for his re-election campaigns. Clarke has in turn been criticized by the local Democratic Party. On his website in 2014, Clarke stated that he questioned [...] "why the Office of Sheriff is a partisan election" [...] and wrote: [...] "I have never asked a person to vote for me because I run as a Democrat. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> vote for me based on my 35-year commitment to keeping citizens safe.

I want to narrate feelings like in novels. I photograph strangers, they invoke my desire, and <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come with me. I conceal my dreams and desires in images. Water paints with me; it merges the people and the landscapes together. Feelings can be revealed, but remain hidden. You can recognize these photographed places in your imagination. Mysteries will become your secrets, and I want to take you into your dreams. Here, in the images, my protagonists sing with tunes of joy and yearning. I borrow the words of the poet Tua Forsström: I said it was a dream, because I wanted to stay."Majuri is known for taking ethereal and magical photographs, often with water as a key element of the composition.

'Umar ibn Al-Khattāb asked Muḥammad why he did not accept his offer to kill him, to which he replied: [...] "Don’t you see ‘Umar if I had had him ('Abdullāh ibn Ubayy) killed, a large number of dignitaries would have furiously hastened to fight for him.

30|$|Students need {{to write}} dialogues in the examination. Various types of model dialogues are {{available}} in different guidebooks, like a dialogue between a student and a teacher, a doctor and a patient, two friends, a shop keeper and a customer.

30|$|During {{the next}} class, the same {{students}} {{engage in a}} parallel meditation when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> consider {{walking up and down}} the large outdoor staircase just outside of the studio. Students begin by reading together Kabat-Zinn’s chapter Going Up Stairs (Kabat-Zinn 1994). In this chapter, he describes his own experience of feeling, “frequently pulled by my need to be somewhere else” and challenges this pull by asking, “why does your response time have to be so fast that it pulls you out of the life you were living in the preceding moment” (Kabat-Zinn 1994, 201 - 203). Like Kabat-Zinn, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> consider if their transition between steps could be more graceful, whether they can pause to look around them, and to notice where their torso is in relation to their head, legs and feet as they step up or down. They then are divided up and asked to watch other students as they ascend and descend the numerous staircases around the building. Again students return to writing and drawing notes in their sketchbook/journals with the direction to refine their descriptive response using a piece of paper cut to 18 inches square and using only line drawing and pencil.|$|E
