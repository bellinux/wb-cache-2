Formerly, the area characterized by a mountainous topography was nearly entirely covered by endemic pine forests. Nowadays, farmers have transformed over 50 % of the watershed’s natural forests into different agricultural uses triggering erosion, which affects the population downstream. PROCARYN, a Dominican-German cooperative project develops different mechanisms to reverse the trend of <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration.</b> Focusing mainly on smallholder farmers who own considerable extensions of natural forests and plantations, the project supports them directly by co-fi nancing reforestation and forest management, technical support in forest management, training, commercialization support for forest products, fostering farmers ’ organisations and forest certifi cation according to the FSC principles and criteria. Indirect support refers to establishing good relations with the forest administration, providing practical experience for the formulation and revision of forestry policies, and supporting key stakeholders. First results reveal that, despite not very favourable conditions for forest management on smallholders ’ properties, they are willing to invest in the sustainable management of their forest resources and can contribute signifi cantly to reverse the trend of <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> in the upper watershed of the Yaque del Norte River...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of this work is to {{describe}} how the target variable "tree vitality" in terms of needle loss is affected by other explanatory variables. To describe such a relationship in a realistic way, we use generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) which allow to take spatial correlation of the data into account and in addition allow the inclusion of explanatory variables as predictors {{with the possibility of}} having non-linear effects. The GAMMs are fitted in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Data are available for two years 1988 and 1994. We select a set of best explanatory variables from a large set of variables including tree-specific variables, such as species, age, nutrients in the needles and site-specific variables such as altitude, relief type, soil depth and content of different nutrients in the top soil. In the two models for 1988 and 1994, different sets of explanatory variables were selected as best predictors. In both models, the effects of explanatory variables allowed a plausible interpretation. For example, the site-specific variables such as relief and soil depth were significant predictors, since these factors determine how well water and nutrient supply is balanced at a specific site. The selected sets of explanatory variables differed between 1988 and 1994, giving an indication of a possible change in the main causes of <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> between 1988 and 1994. From the set of nutrient variables measured in the soil and in the needles, in 1988 altitude a. s. l. and magnesium supply were among the explanatory variables, in 1994 a combination of Al in the soil and the N/K-ratio (in the needles) was selected in the model. In 1988 altitude a. s. l. was among the most important predictors in the model. This is in contrast to 1994 where altitude was not selected. This may {{have to do with the}} fact that in the early phase of forest health monitoring (1988) one of the main causes of <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> was magnesium deficiency. Later on this may have changed to a combination of soil acidification and nitrogen eutrophication. Thus by using an adequate model such as the GAMM, sets of explanatory variables for needle loss may be identified. By fitting two GAMMs, with different sets of "best" predictors, at two time points 1988 and 1994, we can detect changes in these sets of "best" predictors over time. This allows us to use the monitoring data with the tree vitality indicator crown condition/needle loss as a tool for forest health management, which may involve decisions about concrete counter measures like e. g. forest liming...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate and compare the importance of forest remnants and other components of the landscape for the collection of medicinal plants in the Mbanza-Ngungu Region, DRC. Between February 2009 and May 2012, semi-structured interviews and participatory observations were conducted in this region with 51 traditional healers selected by means of the 'snowball method'. Local importance of medicinal plants was determined by the medicinal Use Value parameter. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 20. 0 and based on chi-square test, analysis of variance and post hoc comparison of means. Our results show that the forest remnants remain the main medicinal species provider: 68 species against 62 for agro-ecosystems. However, the total number of citations for medicinal species uses is higher for agro-ecosystems (293) than for forest remnants (233), and this difference is significant (P < 0. 05). This could be explained, among others, by the fact that some forest remnants are respected or protected by the villagers for religious and ritual purposes (Sangi). This also points to the importance of agro-ecosystems and secondary vegetation as provider of medicinal plants around rural villages, as seen elsewhere in the tropics...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic habitat {{disturbance}} is a {{major threat}} to biodiversity worldwide. Yet, before population declines are detectable, individuals may suffer from chronic stress and impaired immunity in disturbed habitats, making them more susceptible to pathogens and adverse weather conditions. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the body mass and immunity of bats. We measured and compared body mass, chronic stress (indicated by neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios) and the number of circulating immune cells between several bat species with different roost types living in recovering areas, actively logged forests, and fragmented forests in Sabah, Malaysia. In a cave-roosting species, chronic stress levels were higher in individuals from fragmented habitats compared with conspecifics from actively logged areas. Foliage-roosting species showed a reduced body mass and decrease in total white blood cell counts in actively logged areas and fragmented forests compared with conspecifics living in recovering habitats. Our study highlights that habitat disturbance may have species-specific effects on chronic stress and immunity in bats that are potentially related to the roost type.

50|$|The main {{habitats}} of the buff-sided robin, including riparian and monsoon vine <b>forests,</b> {{have suffered}} <b>deterioration</b> and decline due to combined impacts of introduced grazing animals (cattle, water buffalo), feral pigs and altered fire regimes, with patches being damaged, fragmented and reduced in area {{by a combination}} of these factors. Monsoon vine forests have been particularly impacted by contemporary and recent fire regimes, driven by altered pastoral management, cultural management and other land use changes, with significant reductions in area as open forests advance. This retreat of monsoon vine forest is negatively impacting bird species that rely on these habitats, including the buff-sided robin. Land clearing has typically had less of an impact on habitats in northern Australian monsoonal savanna ecosystems, however land clearing is increasingly a component of pastoral intensification and agriculture projects, for example in the Kimberley (Ord River) and Northern Territory (Daly River) and north-west Queensland.|$|R
40|$|Coastal squeeze is the {{reduction}} in the space of coastal habitats to operate (Phan et al, 2014) and an important cause for coastline retreat, increase in flood risk, salinity intrusion etc. Land use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization, reduce the space of natural habitats, such as mangrove <b>forests,</b> and cause <b>deterioration</b> of these habitats, that leads to reduction of their natural protective and provisioning functions. Costs related to these function losses can be avoided by early recognition of coastal squeeze and early action. In this research we investigate how remote sensing imagery data can contribute to early recognition of coastal squeeze.

The coastal zone in Myanmar is subject to climate change, urbanization, extreme weather conditions (cyclones), increase in agri- and aquaculture and (illegal) felling of mangrove.

40|$|To {{cope with}} {{environmental}} constraints, organisms can show variation in phenotype, either by genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. These patterns are especially pronounced in ecosystems {{that are under}} anthropogenic influence. Due to human-induced disturbances such as logging and deforestation, tropical forests comprise such a system. To date, most studies have dealt with ecological responses at the community level relative to forest disturbance or degradation. However, the evolutionary consequences of tropical <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> on behaviour and functional morphology have received far less attention compared to temporal regions. From a resource-point of view, light conditions are essential for heliotherms such as butterflies. Because degradation of tropical cloud forests in the Taita Hills (Kenya) is very pronounced, the present study tested whether this induced changes in mate-location strategies, habitat-use, and functional flight morphology in a forest butterfly, Salamis parhassus. According to predictions from temperate regions, {{it was hypothesized that}} the species would change its mate location strategy from perching to patrolling in more disturbed forests, that this higher mobility results in a faster occupancy of light gaps, and that it accords with a higher wing loading within populations from undisturbed forests. These hypotheses were confirmed by field surveys and experiments. The present study demonstrates that degradation of tropical forests does not only affect communities (e. g. species richness), but also the behaviour and functional morphology of individual species.

40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> in Nepal which typifies {{the forest}} {{destruction}} {{problem in the}} developing world is attracting worldwide attention. The deterioration has a close connection with forest utilization of the rural inhabitants. Moreover, as production facilities are not developed and as there is no hope of heavy investment which could carry out extensive afforestation in this country, the participation of the inhabitants becomes essential for the reforestation and conservation programs. In this paper, various aspects of forest utilization by the inhabitants of a village in the Middle Mountains of Nepal are studied. In the area, forms of the forest utilization are basically reclaimation for cultivation and gathering of feed for animals which maintain the agro-pastoral system, together with extraction of firewood and timber for daily life. These exploitations have been accelerating in recent decades, affected by socio-economic changes from outside of the village. Consequences of this deterioration are damage by landslides, shortage of cultivable land and livestock, as well as conflicts among villages. All of these results cause oppression in rural life. From the comparison of the main uses of the forests, it became apparent that fodder lopping for livestock has the greatest influence upon both the forests and the lives of the inhabitants by its characteristics and the way of gathering rather than its amount. AS a solution to this problem, coordination of agro-pastoral production and forest conservation, and especially the plantation of fodder crops in the devastated area is recommended. For the practical management, consideration of the landuse and life-style of the inhabitants is necessaryネパールにおける森林荒廃は, 開発途上諸国での森林破壊問題の典型として注目を集めている。この森林荒廃は, 地域住民の森林利用と密接なつながりを持ったものであり, また, 生産基盤が未発達で, 多額の投資を行なって大規模な再造林を進める事も困難なこの国では, 森林の保全, 育成に住民の参加が不可欠な要素となる。本論では, こうした地域住民の森林利用を, ネパール中間山地の一山村において多面的に考接した。この地域における住民の森林利用は, 基本的に農牧システム維持のための農地開墾と家畜の飼料採取, 及び日常生活のための薪, 木材採取である。こうした森林からの搾取は, 外部からの社会的, 経済的影響を受け, ここ数年に著しく加速されてきており, 土砂崩壊による被害, 可耕地及び家畜の不足, 村落間の争議の増加などの現象引き起こし, 住民の生活を圧迫している。本論は, 村民の様々な森林利用形態のうち, 家畜の飼料採取が, 量の大きさよりもむしろその資源としての性格や, 採取法における特徴から, 森林資源と住民生活の両面に, 最も大きな影響を与えていることを明らかにした。この森林破壊問題を解決するためには, 農業生産と森林保全の両立がなされるべきであり, これには荒廃地への飼料木の植栽が有効であろう。また, 施業にあたっては, 住民の土地利用や生活様式を考慮する必要がある...|$|E

The National Focal Centre for forest monitoring in the Republic of Serbia, within the Institute of Forestry of the Republic of Serbia has been taking an active part in an international program of ICP Forest, with a view to improving its working activities and harmonizing them with other approaches to monitoring forests and forest ecosystems. Material and methods: In order to determine forest ecosystem processes, it is necessary to carry out detailed research of ecological and socio-economic consequences of <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> and to study the impacts of regional climate changes on forest communities. In the period from 2004 to 2009, observations were performed on 130 sample plots and data necessary for further analysis were collected. These plots are systematically arranged in either a 16 x 16 km or a 4 x 4 km grid system. The main parameters assessed on the sample plots are the degree of defoliation and discolouration as well as the extent of damage. A comparative analysis of the data obtained in this period will provide a better insight into the present state of beech forests in Serbia as well the effects of defoliation and discolouration trends. Results and conclusion: Beech is the most common broadleaved tree species on the Level I sample plots. Its health state is the result of adverse effects of complex factors of abiotic and biotic origin (i. e. effects of both living organisms and complex natural processes within the beech forests habitats). This paper presents some indicators of beech forest vitality whose occurrence show certain regularity and which can be interpreted as a trend.

40|$|In {{tropical}} rainforests, {{the sustainability}} of selective logging is {{closely linked to the}} extent of collateral stand damage. The capacity to measure the extent of such damage is essential for calculating carbon emissions due to forest degradation under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) process. The use of remote sensing to detect canopy gaps in tropical rainforests is an attractive alternative to ground surveys, which are laborious and imprecise. In French Guiana, the detection of logging-related gaps using very high spatial resolution optical satellite images produced by the Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 5 sensor is carried out by Office National des Forêts (ONF) (French National Forestry Agency). Gaps are detected using a segmentation method based on computer-assisted photointerpretation. Detection has been automated to improve and accelerate the process. We developed an automatic method, which involves estimating segmentation thresholds using a statistical approach. The principle of the method presented in this article is to model the forest's spectral signature by using a Gaussian distribution and calculate a divergence between that theoretical signature and the image histogram in order to detect gaps that constitute a reduction of forest cover. The segmentation threshold between gap and forest is thus no longer defined in the original radiometric area but as a discrepancy between theoretical distribution and histogram. Computing the divergence to define the threshold made it possible to efficiently automate the detection of all gaps and skid trails with a surface area greater than 100 m 2. The proportion of misclassified points measured during field surveys is 12 %, which is a high level of precision. The proportion of misclassified points obtained is 12 %.

40|$|Mountains occupy only 3 {{percent of}} Poland. They are the {{northern}} part of the European arc of the Carpathian and Sudety Mountains, extending about 700 km along the southern Polish border. They are of medium height (about 1, 500 m., maximum 2, 600 m. a. s. l.), and diversified in terms of climate, geology, soils, vegetation, and anthropogenic impacts. The forest vegetation of the Sudety and Carpathian Mountains forms three elevational zones. Forests occur in the foothills (as high as 600 m. a. s. l.), the lower mountain forest zone (as high as 1, 250 m. a. s. l.) and the upper montane forest zone (as high as 1, 500 m. a. s. l.). The original lower mountain forests consist mainly of the fir (Abies alba Mill.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), while upper montane forests consist of spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.). Centuries of economic activity have changed the species composition of mountain forests. The share of the spruce has increased considerably, and the percentage of the fir and beech has decreased significantly. In the Sudety and western part of the Carpathian Mountains prevalence of spruce is the highest (83 percent), while in the eastern part of the Carpathians, it does not exceed 10 percent. The percentage of beech in the Sudety and western part of Carpathian forests is below 20 percent, but about 40 percent in the eastern part of the Carpathians. Severe weather conditions, frequently poor habitats and improper management and considerable air pollution occurring in the past 50 years, followed by infestations of primary and secondary insects and spread of parasite fungi, have led to considerable destruction of mountain forests.

40|$|The Chi River Sub-basin Part II, in Northeast (NE) Thailand, {{experiences}} many anthropogenic activities due to {{the agricultural}} expansion and intensification, <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration,</b> and a high demand for resource utilization. Land use/land cover change (LULCC) associated with land management, agricultural and conservation practices within the basin can significantly affect hydrologic responses. Like other basins in NE Thailand, the Chi River Sub-basin Part II—comprising more than 60 % of agricultural lands—is characterized by severe floods, droughts, and sedimentation, which directly affect human well-being. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the influences of land management and conservation practices on discharge and sediment yield, and then to develop appropriate management solutions, which could provide alternatives to the current watershed management practices. Three management scenarios—current land use with conservation practices, land use planning (LUP) based on Watershed Classification (WSC), and WSC with conservation practices—were modeled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and the results were compared to the existing conditions. The findings indicated that LULCC and conservation practices—conserving the remaining forest, reforestation, applying strip cropping to agricultural land, and channel stabilization by plant cover and engineered constructions—had a little effect on discharge, but greatly influenced the sediment yield. Current land use with the addition of conservation practices resulted in a slight decrease in both total discharge and sediment yield. WSC resulted in a small decrease in discharge, but a dramatic increase in sedimentation. Lastly, WSC together with conservation practices resulted in a slight decrease in discharge and a small increase in sedimentation. These results informed that land management that adopts conservation practices has a strong effect on discharge and sediment yield. A decreased in forest cover when applied WSC resulted in a slight decrease in discharge, but much higher sediment yield. When conservation practices were applied, sediment yield was found to be significantly decreased. Therefore, watershed management should consider LUP, vegetation cover measures, and channel improvements to sustain the Chi River Sub-basin Part II. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia's economy receded in 1998, and the {{national}} currency has lost more than 70 % of its value. Expansion of agriculture {{is one of the}} main ways to overcome the crisis: 1) relatively independent of the dollar economy; 2) provision of basic needs commodities; 3) reduction of unemployment; 4) reduction of costly food imports; 5) Indonesian commodities cheaper in the export market - costs in rupiahs, earnings in US$. Another means is access to loans from IMF. The author reviews the likely effects on the forest sector. (1) Decreased demand for Indonesian plywood from main importers (Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) is largely compensated by increased demand from other countries and Malaysia's decision to restrict its wood product exports. (2) Expansion of agriculture will occur partly at the expense of forest cover: spontaneous clearing by farmers, and large scale clearings for agro-industry plantations, mainly oil palm, then cocoa, coffee, rubber trees, pepper, as well as shrimp ponds in mangroves. (3) Transmigration will probably not slow down, foreign aid compensating for the decline of State aid. (4) Unemployed people in the urban sector migrate to rural areas, and young people in the rural areas remain there which may increase pressure on forests for three reasons: a) incentives to expand plantations for export; b) incentives to produce food crops locally (rice, maize, soya) to reduce imports; c) shortage of capital for inputs, that may encourage extensive agriculture. (5) Expansion of mining in forest areas (coal, iron, and nickel) may lead to degradation of important protection forests. (6) The likely slowdown of major road programmes will reduce their direct and indirect impacts on forests. (7) Policy changes as a prerequisite to IMF loans will have negative effects on forest conservation when they encourage plantations for export (oil palms).

40|$|Aluminium (Al) {{toxicity}} {{is considered}} {{an important factor in}} <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> caused by soil acidification. A ratio of base cations (BC) to Al in the soil solution lower than 1 is widely used as an indicator for potentially adverse effects on tree health. In our view, the validity of the assumptions underlying the use of the BC:AI ratio as an indicator for Al toxicity in trees has never been evaluated properly. Here, we evaluate the importance of the base cations Ca and Mg in counteracting Al toxicity. Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies seedlings were grown on nutrient solution with a range of Al (0 - 0. 25 - 0. 5 - 1 - 2 mM) and base cation (0. 25 - 0. 5 - 2 mM) concentrations, giving BC:Al ratios of 1 at different levels of Al. Increasing concentrations of Al in solution caused growth reductions, which could not be counteracted by increasing concentrations of BC in solution with P. sylvestris and only partly counteracted with P. abies. Increased concentrations of Al in solution decreased the concentrations in shoot and root of both Ca and Mg, while increased concentrations of BC in solution increased tissue concentrations of BC. Growth reductions were, however, not a result of BC deficiencies, as growth reduction already occurred in tree seedlings that maintained adequate concentrations of Ca and Mg. All growth and uptake variables measured showed a higher or equal correlation with the absolute concentrations of Al or Al + BC in solution than with the BC:Al ratio. We conclude that Al toxicity is determined solely by the concentration of Al in solution. Shoot growth decreased significantly as dissolved Al increased at a constant BC:Al ratio of 1. In P. abies, but not in P. sylvestris, dissolved BC can positively affect uptake of BC and growth, which might partly alleviate the toxic effects of Al. Our results show that the mechanistic explanation for the effect of the BC:Al ratio is insufficient to describe Al toxicity. Care should be taken when using models based on the BC:AI ratio to predict the effect of Al on tree growth. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|From {{ancient times}} to the present day, forest public {{relations}} has been an issue on the agenda. This relationship’s purpose was initially needed for shelter and nutrition; however today this process has changed with urbanization, overpopulation and understanding the new functions of forests. When land ownership became a tool of production, offenses occurred in order to convert forestlands to agricultural lands. So {{the vast majority of}} the world’s forests have been lost for this reason. Today, deforestation is occurring in tropical countries that are expecting to gain agricultural area. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between urbanization and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of forest crimes, which are a major obstacle for sustainable forestry. Although forests cover about 27 % of Turkey’s territory, the forests are losing viability; the status of wood raw material per unit area and the total area of the country in the ratio of productive forests are becoming critical in Turkey. Turkey’s rugged terrain and factors such as human interventions, fires, deforestation for agriculture, illegal cuttings, or improper grazing reduce existing <b>forests</b> or cause <b>deterioration</b> of their structure. In the past, deforestation, as a result of human interventions in Turkey, was done by forest villagers who live in rural areas. The forest crimes depend on various socio-economic reasons and have many adverse effects on the sustainability of forest and forest existence. In developed countries, illegal interventions such as opening, grazing, cutting, occupation, use, settlement, or hunting crimes have been largely eliminated because of the absence of cadastral problems, the existence of more responsive people to protect the environment and forests and a rural population, which has a higher standard of living. In the last 20 years, there has been both a dramatic decrease in the population living in rural areas and a decrease of forest crimes in rural areas. On the other hand, legal and illegal forest attacks have been increasing due to urbanization in this process.

40|$|The main aim of {{the project}} is to {{interpret}} people’s relationship to nature with emphasis on the culture of huntergatherers in the mountain area of South Norway in the Mesolithic period. The palaeoenvironment and traces of human interaction with nature in Dyraheio are used {{as a basis for}} a South Norwegian perspective. Further, the relation between nature and settlement in the mountain area is analysed from a South Norwegian perspective. The cultural characteristics of hunter-gatherers are used to analyse the relation between people, settlement and nature, to propose a cultural meaning of reindeer for Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and a division of territories in South Norway. Dyraheio is located in the mountain area of Setesdal Vesthei in Southwest Norway in the low alpine vegetation zone. The climate is dominated by the Atlantic cyclones in the west, with more continental conditions in the east. This mountain area has harsh climatic conditions with 7 - 8 months of snow cover. The methods used in the study are palynology, radiocarbon dated pine mega fossils, stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates. The palynological analysis on samples of gyttja, peat and podsolic soil at the Late Mesolithic sites showed changes in the occurrence of charcoal particles. The variation in especially Onagraceae (probably fireweed, Epilobium angustifolium), ferns (Polypodiaceae), heather (Calluna, Empetrum and Ericales in general) and clubmosses (Lycopodium) is interpreted as being due to human action. Some of the variations of the palynomorphs may have resulted from gathering activities for food, for cleaning and use for resting places, for fuel and from vegetation management. The results indicate that people stayed more often and possibly for longer periods in these areas than recorded by archaeological observations alone. The environmental changes in the mountain areas of South Norway since deglaciation are synthesised. They occurred earlier in western areas than in eastern areas and earlier in higher areas than in lower areas. The forest limit was at its uppermost and most stable limit during the Early Holocene. Pine dominated the subalpine forest many places, especially in the east, and was mixed to varying degrees with birch. The “Holocene thermal optimum” started around 8000 BP (8900 cal BP). The dominance of pine started to decline around 6700 BP (7580 cal BP) {{and at the same time}} the first traces of a decline in the forest limit are recorded. Birch gradually became the dominant tree and the subalpine birch forest was established during the period 5700 - 4400 BP (6480 - 4970 cal BP) with a declining <b>forest</b> limit and <b>deterioration</b> of the climate. From about 4400 BP (4970 cal BP) grazing domestic animals influenced the composition of the vegetation. The grazing hampered the re-growth of trees as the animals were eating the young plants. Grazing husbandry also caused wearing and erosion of the soil. The “Holocene thermal optimum” ended in the period 4000 - 3500 BP (4470 - 3770 cal BP) and the subalpine birch forest was more open. The drop in the forest limit was considerable from 3700 - 3300 BP (4040 - 3520 cal BP) and low alpine vegetation spread over still larger areas at the same time as pasturing husbandry increasingly changed the vegetation into a cultural landscape similar to the one known in historical times and up to the present. Radiocarbon dates are used as a record of the Stone Age settlement in the mountain area. The dates show a continuous presence of people, and the only hiatus in the dataset is found during the Late Preboreal chronozone. This homogeneity indicates that hunter-gatherers regularly used the mountain area in an annual cycle. Presumably the range of the variations in nature was accepted and presupposed in the hunter-gatherer culture and generally satisfied the people’s living requirements. Nearly all the radiocarbon dated archaeological sites in the mountain area were located below the forest limit at the time of use. The subalpine forest was a better base than the alpine landscape to safeguard the regular economic resources of the society. This location provided easy access to resources in the alpine and subalpine areas, with more divergent biotopes than the alpine area alone. The subalpine forest probably also had richer and more varied resources than the alpine area and was the only vegetation zone where the three largest ungulates (reindeer, elk and deer) could be expected. When the forest limit dropped, the biotopes where settlement sites had been located were poorer and societal safety weakened. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{climate change}} is a global {{challenge}} that attracts much attention and debates at all levels. The current body of knowledge informs that human development quest has increased concentration of GHGs into the atmosphere thereby causing global warming. Most of the initial efforts to address climate change concentrated on mitigation. However, during the last decade, calls for implementing adaptation actions {{to deal with the}} impacts being experienced increased. Thus, adaptation is now a priority for developing countries particularly LDCs. Agriculture is an important sector worldwide but nowhere other than in the developing world is it the most crucial aspect to deal with. However, this sector {{is one of the most}} vulnerable and sensitive to change and variability of the climate. Significance of smallholder agriculture on livelihoods of a majority poor in the developing world and its vulnerability to impacts of climate change and variability motivated this study. Changes in farming practices in the Mkomazi sub-catchment, Tanzania (for example, shifts in crop production areas, crop growing patterns and type of crops grown most) were reported and observed. However, the real factors motivating such changes in the area remained unknown. Thus, the objective of this research was to explore, analyze and explain factors that motivate smallholder farmers in Mkomazi sub-catchment to change their farming practices overtime. It also sought to analyze socio-economic implications of the changes and recommend appropriate policy and strategic actions to assist smallholder farmers adapt and enhance their resilience. Using a mixed research approach and five data collection methods (household questionnaire survey, experts’ interviews, smallholder farmers FGD, rainfall and temperature records as well as stakeholder validation workshop), the study attempted to answer the following five research questions: Are there any possible changes in the local climate and how are they perceived and explained by smallholder farmers? Are there any changes in farming practices in the area? What factors motivate decisions to change farming practice? What are socio-economic implications of the changes in the local climate at household and community level? What are policy and strategic interventions to support smallholder farmers to adapt and enhance their long-term resilience? Results from the study revealed that the state of climate in the area is changing; rainfall shows a decreasing trend while temperature indicates an increasing trend. Smallholder farmers have also been changing their farming practices overtime. These farmers have introduced new crops and crop varieties; adopted crops and crop varieties, which are shorter cycle, drought tolerant and marketable; and they have also stopped cultivation of some crops as well as crop varieties. Smallholder farmers are engaging in various economic activities to diversify their income sources. The changes were motivated by multiple factors but the leading included changes in the climate, markets and high living costs and demand for personal and household needs. Change and variability of climate is the most dominant factor. Changes in the local climate and subsequent changes in farming practices had mostly negative implications at household and community levels. They include water shortage, decrease in income, food insecurity, threats to human health, social conflicts, increase in deforestation and <b>forest</b> degradation, and <b>deterioration</b> of life quality. Farmers recommended various interventions to support them to adapt in the following thematic areas: research and development to enhance resilience to changes in rainfall and temperature regimes; strengthening sustainable management of water resources to deal with increasing dry conditions and unpredictability of rainfall; and support diversification of household incomes through less climate sensitive income options. Other recommended aspects include enhancing access to incentives, subsidies and introducing crop insurance to farmers; and enhancing farmers’ adaptive capacity through provision of technological and technical support like adaptation technologies, early warnings, education and training. Using a combination of three categories of data (agro-ecological, social and meteorological) from five sources (questionnaire, interviews, FGD, climate records and a workshop), the study successfully brings up multiple considerations taken into account by smallholder farmers to make farm production decisions; and heterogeneity of crops and crop varieties for four villages within similar agro-ecological characteristics. The study recommends use of incentives mechanisms such as REDD+ and PES in addressing problems of unsustainable resource use while increasing availability of ecosystem goods and services like water. It also recommends a multi-stakeholders approach in addressing issues of awareness creation and adaptation education to smallholder farmers; availability of inputs, markets, and institutional capacity building. The study emphasizes on use of available opportunities at all levels to support smallholder farmers to adapt and enhance their long term resilience. Finally, the study recommends a scientific investigation to model climate variables against crop production to clearly identify the extent to which changes in the local climate economically affect smallholder farmers’ production and incomes. In addition, it is important to identify the contribution of each of the several economic activities and income sources farmers depend on, i. e. crop production, remittance, charcoal making, animal keeping, small-scale fishing, small business, tourism, selling labour, etc. These two studies will fill the gaps, which the current study did not manage to cover.

40|$|Despite intense publicity, {{habitat loss}} still remains {{a serious threat}} to biodiversity. Forest {{destruction}} is its frontrunner, both in terms of physical habitat under threat and potential for biodiversity loss. In the fragmented landscape of the Taita Hills, SE Kenya, several bird species are facing the threat of extinction from forest loss. They are absent from many of the remnant forest patches and/or are showing negative effects with increasing disturbance. Using a relatively common forest-dependent bird species - the whitestarred robin Pogonocichla stellata - as a model, the current status of this ecosystem was examined, and future patterns predicted in view of the unrelenting destruction. As expected, the robin population in the largest and most intact fragment (c 35 ha) was the healthiest, suggesting that this was indeed the best quality habitat patch: it had the highest population density, highest productivity (low nest predation and high juvenile to adult ratio) and lowest turnover rates. Effects of <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> were evident {{from the fact that the}} medium-sized patch (c 95 ha), which is undergoing severe degradation, was a worse habitat for the robin than the tiny patches (c 2 - 8 ha) : it had the lowest population density, lowest productivity (highest nest predation rates and lowest juvenile to adult ratio), and highest turnover rates. The explanation for this is twofold. Besides the smallest patches facing lower levels of habitat loss recently, they also had high levels of dispersal between them. They occasionally operated as a finegrained system with individuals moving between them in the space of a few days. In general, the robin metapopulation is demographically (rate of change, λ = 0. 996) and genetically (at migration- and mutation-drift equilibrium) stable at present. The populations in the largest and smallest patches were potential sources providing emigrants that were possibly crucial in sustaining the population in the medium-sized patch (given its low productivity and high turnover rates). Overall, these findings underscore the importance of within-patch processes, both for ensuring persistence of subpopulations and providing dispersers, as well as between-patch processes (chiefly dispersal) for ensuring metapopulation persistence. Thus, by furnishing ample sample sizes that enabled work to be carried out in all fragments throughout this landscape, the model species approach was useful for identifying the need for a two-pronged conservation strategy. First, a need to focus within fragments to reduce habitat loss and degradation, and second, to address among fragment issues relating to land-use and maintaining a forested landscape, in order to enhance connectivity between patches. Finally, based on the mechanisms by which disturbance and fragmentation are affecting bird populations e. g. predator influxes from the surrounding matrix, conservation recommendations for the Taita Hills are offered. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and lithology of {{a sequence of}} Mesozoic greywackes comprising the Torlesse terrane within the southern Ruahine Range has been mapped. At a scale of 1 : 25 000 the sequence was subdivided into informal lithozones {{with one or more}} lithozones constituting a higher order lithostratigraphic unit here referred to as a Lithotype. Each of three recognised Lithotypes occupies a consistent stratigraphic position throughout a 40 km long mapped area. From east to west the three Lithotypes are: (1) the Tamaki Lithotype; (2) the Wharite Lithotype; and (3) the Western Lithotype. The easternmost Tamaki Lithotype and the westernmost Western Lithotype consist of a relatively undeformed flysch-type sequence of distal turbidites. The centrally located wharite Lithotype structurally underlies the Tamaki Lithotype but overlies the Western Lithotype. It comprises a complex sequence of predominantly flysch-type sedimentary rocks, together with lithologically diverse, argillite-dominated, clast-bearing debris flow deposits; large sheet-like bodies of massive volcanics (and associated cherts) that have been emplaced by gravitational sliding; and intact pillow lava accumulations and horizons of red and green argillite of syndepositional origin. Major and trace element analyses of volcanic lithologies indicate that most samples were erupted in a mid-ocean ridge or intraplate setting. None appear to have been derived from an island arc setting. The bulk of the clastic sediments consist of reworked materials derived by the erosion of a mixed volcano-plutonic source and redeposited in a distal deep-water submarine fan environment. Blocks of allochthonous fossiliferous shallow-water lithologies indicate that the source terrane, in part, comprised rocks of Late Triassic age. Autochthonous fossils indicate that sedimentation continued until at least Late Jurassic time. Part of the stratigraphic sequence was severely deformed along a low angle thrust zone in Early Cretaceous time {{at the onset of the}} Rangitata Orogeny. An early phase of ductile deformation resulted in plastically and permanently deformed rocks. Ductile deformation is restricted to strata comprising the Wharite Lithotype which, with its allochthonous debris, in part, constitutes an olistostrome that has undergone tectonic deformation and hence also constitutes a melange. Thus it may be regarded as a tectonised olistostrome. Ductile deformation was succeeded by the development of shear fractures during subsequent phases of brittle deformation that affected strata comprising all three Lithotypes. Brittle deformation occurred in conjunction with episodes of faulting and folding during the second orogeny - the Kaikoura Orogeny in Pliocene to Recent times. Active faults that were initiated during the early phase of ductile deformation continued to be sites of active fault displacement throughout Quaternary and Holocene time. Late Quaternary tectonic features along these major active faults have been mapped. Minimum rates of vertical fault displacements since Ohakean time approximate 1 mm/yr in this area. Several phases of folding were recognised, including: (1) an early phase of syndepositional, highly asymmetric folds with well developed axial plane cleavage; and (2) three post-lithification phases of folding - e. g. (a) steeply plunging isoclinal folds; (b) subhorizontal, open asymmetric folds; and (c) steeply plunging open folds. Contacts between the three Lithotypes are not thought to be major tectonic breaks but are instead of primary depositional origin and have become sites of subsequent fault movement in Quaternary time. The three Lithotypes may therefore represent a near complete eastward dipping, westward younging overturned stratigraphic sequence. They are not fault-bound terranes. Metamorphism to prehnite pumpellyite grade, folding and rotation of the strata to its present steep attitude predates Late Cretaceous sedimentation. The westward rotation and imbrication of thrust sheets that are internally westward younging but form part of a regionally eastward younging succession of thrust sheets was the result of underthrusting at a convergent plate margin. The relationship between structural and lithological characteristics of the Torlesse bedrock and the magnitude of valley slope erosion in the southern Ruahine Range is investigated. Comparison of aerial photographs spanning a 28 year period between 1946 and 1974 indicate that erosion has increased by 91 %. The greatest proportion of this eroded area occurs on the steeper north- and west-facing slopes. Saturation of colluvium during major storm events is the prime triggering mechanism for the majority of shallow translational slope movements. Debris slides and debris avalanches predominate and result from failure at less than 1 m depth at the colluvium-bedrock contact. Rock slides are few in number and are structurally controlled, failing along bedding plane surfaces at greater than 1 m depth. Rock falls and rock topples are least numerous and only involve small quantities of material. An erosion rate of 1215 m 3 /ha/yr for the southern Ruahine Range is of the same order of magnitude as other New Zealand and overseas studies and although considered to be severe it is not unduly excessive. Much of the <b>forest</b> <b>deterioration</b> in this area is due to the opening of the canopy by the successive removal of large tracts of forest vegetation through mass movement processes during episodes of increased rainfall. Large-scale rotational and translational mass movement features including rock slumps, earth slumps, earth slides and ridge-top features (involving bedrock only), have been documented from 109 localities. A relationship between the incidence of rock slumps and major fault breccia zones has been established in this area. The majority of large-scale mass movement features failed in pre-historic time but two failed in historic time. The consequences of future mass movements upon lowland areas adjacent to the base of the Range is discussed. A map showing the relative stability of slopes and the predominant forms of slope movement most likely to occur under the present seismic, climatic, physiographic and human conditions is presente...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Atmospheric particles, or particulate matter, can be solid or liquid with diameters varying from around 0. 002 [micrometers] to roughly 100 [micrometers]. Atmospheric aerosol sources {{can be classified}} as primary or secondary, with the primary aerosol being directly emitted from the corresponding sources and the secondary particles being formed in the atmosphere, for example, from gas-phase chemical reactions that produce condensable vapors. At the same time aerosol particles are ultimately connected {{with the formation of}} water droplets and equivalently with the formation of clouds and fogs in the atmosphere. The first part of this thesis concerns the mathematical modeling of wet and dry acid deposition and of the relevant physicochemical processes. Acid deposition consists of the delivery of acidic substances, principally sulfuric and nitric acid, from the atmosphere to the earth's surface. Upon emission to the atmosphere, SO 2 and NOx, are photochemically oxidized, yielding sulfuric and nitric acid vapors. Sulfuric acid is rapidly incorporated into aerosol particles, while nitric acid may be scavenged by particles or droplets or remain in the gas phase. Even {{in the absence of an}} aqueous phase (no clouds or fog), the acidic gases and dry particles can be transported to and deposited at ground level; this process is called dry deposition. When an aqueous phase is present (inside a cloud or a fog), gas-phase species like SO 2, HNO 3, NH 3 and aerosol particles are scavenged by water droplets resulting in a solution that can be significantly acidic. Additional cloudwater or fogwater acidity beyond that attained purely from scavenging of gases and particles results from aqueous-phase chemistry, most notably oxidation of dissolved SO 2 to sulfuric acid. These acidic droplets can reach the earth's surface either as precipitation or as impacted cloud and fogwater, in the processes termed wet deposition. If they are not rained or deposited out the aqueous droplets can evaporate leaving as residue new aerosol particles that may themselves undergo dry deposition to the earth's surface. The effects of acid deposition include soil and lake acidification, <b>forest</b> decline and <b>deterioration</b> of cultural monuments. Mathematical models are a major tool in our effort to understand and ultimately control acid deposition. The development of such a mathematical model represents a major challenge as it requires the ability to describe the entire range of atmospheric physicochemical phenomena. As a first step in the modeling, a comprehensive chemical mechanism for aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry was developed and its detailed sensitivity analysis was performed. The main aqueous-phase reaction pathways for the system are the oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI) by H 2 O 2, OH, HO 2, O 2 (catalysed by Fe 3 + and Mn 2 +), O 3, and [ [...] . ]. The dominant pathway for HNO 3 (aq) acidity is scavenging of nitric acid from the gas phase. HCOOH is produced because of the reaction of HCHO(aq) with OH(aq). The gas-phase concentrations of SO 2, H 2 O 2, HO 2, OH, O 3, HCHO, NH 3, HNO 3, and HCl are of primary importance. Increase of the liquid water content of the cloud results in a decrease of the sulfate concentration, but an increase of the total sulfate amount in the aqueous-phase. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, a condensed mechanism was derived. The next step was the development of a model that actually predicts the amount of liquid water in the atmosphere solving the energy balance. This Lagrangian model combines for the first time a detailed description of gas and aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry with a treatment of the dynamics of radiation fog, that is the fog that is created due to the radiative cooling of the earth's surface to the space during the night. The model was evaluated against a well documented radiation fog episode in Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley of California over the period January 4 - 5, 1985. This application showed that the model predictions for temperature profile, fog development, liquid water content, gas-phase concentrations of SO 2, HNO 3, and NH 3, pH, aqueous-phase concentrations of [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ], and finally deposition rates of the above ions match well the observed values. The fog was found to lead to a drastic increase of deposition rates over those in its absence for the major ionic species, with most notable being the increase of sulfate deposition. Several important differences were found to exist between the characteristics of a radiation fog and a representative cloud environment. Radiation fogs typically develop under stable conditions (very low wind speed) resulting in weak mixing and significant vertical gaseous species concentration gradients. Because of the proximity of the fog to ground-level sources of pollutants like SO 2 and NOx, the corresponding gas-phase concentrations can reach much higher levels that in a cloud. In such a case, pathways for aqueous-phase sulfate production that are of secondary importance in a cloud environment may become significant in a fog. The next level of treatment beyond assuming that all the water droplets have the size and chemical composition is to explicitly model the size-composition distribution of droplets as a result of nucleation on aerosol particles. A third model was developed to study the distribution of acidity and solute concentration among the various droplet sizes in a fog or a cloud. The major finding of this study was that significant solute concentration differences can occur in aqueous droplets inside a fog or a cloud. For the fog simulated, during the period of dense fog, the solute concentration in droplets larger than 10 [micrometers] diameter increased with size, in such a way that droplets of diameter 20 [micrometers] attain a solute concentration that is a factor of 3. 6 larger than that in the 10 [micrometer] droplets. Chemical processes tend to decrease the total solute mass concentration differences among the various droplet sizes. Low cooling rates of the system also tend to decrease these concentration differences while high cooling rates have exactly the opposite effect. The mass/size distribution of the condensation nuclei influences quantitatively, but not qualitatively, the above concentration differences. The effects of equilibration processes on wet and dry deposition were then investigated and furthermore the accuracy of the currently used modelling approaches of these phenomena was examined. Atmospheric equilibration processes between two phases with different deposition velocities have the potential to affect significantly the amount of total material deposited on the ground. The magnitude of the effects of the equilibration processes depends primarily on the ratio of the deposition velocities of the two phases, on the production/emission rate of the gas-phase species, and on the initial distribution of species between the two phases. At this point all the tools were available for the detailed investigation of the cyclical relationship between the aerosol and aqueous droplets; a polluted atmosphere with high aerosol concentration assists the formation of the aqueous phase which itself appears to enhance smog production, visibility reduction and aerosol sulfate levels after its dissipation. A model including descriptions of aerosol and droplet microphysics, gas and aqueous-phase chemistry and deposition was used to study the transformation of aerosol to fog droplets and back to aerosol in an urban environment. Fogs in polluted environments have the potential to increase aerosol sulfate concentrations, but at the same time to cause reductions in the aerosol concentration of nitrate, chloride, ammonium and sodium as well as in the total aerosol mass concentration. The sulfate produced during fog episodes favors the aerosol particles that have access to most of the fog liquid water which are usually the large particles. Aerosol scavenging efficiencies of around 80...|$|R
