5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>has</b> stimulated interest.|$|E

25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>has</b> {{not always been}} harmonious. The US {{did not have a}} good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came as no surprise that the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E

Less formal shirts may feature larger pockets, dual pockets, or pockets with flap closures; safari or other military styled shirts often feature two large pockets with buttoned flaps. Less formal shirts may have small pockets on the sleeves as well. Shoulder straps are virtually non-existent on formal shirts, with the exception of military clothing.|$|E

The songs which I've always made often share the same views and ideas as the listener, but this time, they're more like shouts and prayers from my individual innermost self. With this image, I've probably gotten closer to how I was like inside when I first debuted.

500|$|American activist David Swanson wrote {{a three-part}} review of Jesus for President in Christianity Today, {{in which he}} writes that the {{popularity}} of the book is due to its [...] "prophetic zeal and prankster's wit". Swanson argues that [...] "Claiborne and Haw make a compelling case that the church <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>has</b> become much too cozy with the state", a case that Swanson finds to align with his own personal observations. While agreeing that the gospel should take precedence over secular affairs, Jordan Hylden of Christianity Today [...] writes that Claiborne and Haw advocate for too great a withdrawal from secular politics. Hylden writes that he favors the arguments of Paul the Apostle and Martin Luther, who Hylden claims all reason that Christians should engage with government because God works through such institutions providentially.|$|E

500|$|Although other labels {{expressed}} interest in Taking Back Sunday, Victory encouraged them to record an album. Tell All Your Friends was recorded {{over a period of}} two weeks in December 2001 at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studio in New Jersey with producer Sal Villanueva. The sessions ended up costing $10,000. The band arrived without a drum set, presuming that the studio would have one. Engineer Tim Gilles said, [...] "No major studio <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>has</b> their own [...] set. You've gotta be fucking kidding me". The group wanted to re-record [...] "Your Own Disaster" [...] from their demo, but was unable to due to time and money constraints. Instead, it was re-recorded for Taking Back Sunday's next album, Where You Want to Be (2004). Villanueva contributed guitar work and co-mixed the recordings with Rumblefish. The album was engineered by Gilles, Erin Farley, and Arun Venkatesh, with mastering by Gilles at Surgical Sound.|$|E
500|$|Under Nazi control, Le Soir was {{publishing}} {{a variety of}} anti-Semitic articles, calling for the Jews to be further excluded from public life and describing them as racial enemies of the Belgian people. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline noted {{that there was a}} [...] "remarkable correlation" [...] between the anti-Semitic nature of Le Soir editorials and The Shooting Star depiction of Jews. Within months of the story's publication, legislation was passed to collect and deport Jews from Belgium to Nazi concentration camps. Thus, The Shooting Star reflected trends in the Belgian political situation at the time. However, the story {{was not the first time}} that Hergé had adopted such a perspective in his work; he had recently provided illustrations for Robert de Vroyland's Fables, a number of which contained anti-Semitic stereotypes, reflecting the racism in much of de Vroyland's book. Similarly, his depiction of the character of Rastapopoulos, who was introduced in Tintin <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> <b>has</b> been cited as being based upon anti-Semitic stereotypes.|$|E
500|$|Tierney, {{described}} as [...] "an unwavering liberal" [...] by CQ's Politics <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> <b>has</b> consistently high approval ratings from Democratic and liberal interest {{groups such as}} Americans for Democratic Action, and low approval ratings from conservative {{groups such as the}} American Conservative Union. His votes have been closely aligned with the other Democratic representatives from his state. Described as [...] "a favorite of the House Democratic leadership," [...] he maintains a close relationship with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; her daughter Christine Pelosi served as his chief of staff from 2001 to 2005. Tierney was speculated as a candidate to succeed United States Senator Ted Kennedy in a special election after Kennedy's death in 2009, but he decided not to run. In 2010 Washington paper The Hill published a speculation that Tierney, with a $1.3 million war chest, was a likely candidate to run against Kennedy's successor Scott Brown in the 2012 election. Tierney later stated that he would not contest the Senate seat and would instead seek a ninth term as Congressman.|$|E

500|$|Similar to {{his studio}} debut album Pieces of a Man, Winter <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>has</b> Scott-Heron exercising his {{baritone}} and deep tenor-singing abilities with some spoken-word elements. The album {{served as a}} move into more conventional song structures, {{in contrast to the}} Scott-Heron's debut live album, A New Black Poet - Small Talk at 125th and Lenox (1970), which was composed entirely of spoken-word poetry, and the rapping style of his previous album Free Will. According to music writer Karl Keely, Pieces of a Man and Winter in America exhibit further departure by Scott-Heron from his prominent [...] "angry and militant poet" [...] persona. BBC Online writer Daryl Easlea wrote that it [...] "captures Scott Heron at a turning point, largely leaving his heavier raps behind in favour of a floating ambience, with his poetry and song being illuminated by Jackson's superb instrumentation". In addition, the album features more themes of social commentary, Afrocentrism and balladry than Pieces of a Man. Winter in America features a more stripped-down production and melancholy mood along with songs that exceeded four minutes, as opposed to Free Will, which was criticized for its brevity and time constraints.|$|E
500|$|Winter <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>has</b> been {{recognized}} by music writers {{as one of the}} prominent examples of early rap, along with the early work of The Watts Prophets and The Last Poets. [...] "The Bottle" [...] was covered by latin soul musician Joe Bataan for his album Afrofilipino (1975). Recordings featured on the album, along with other Scott-Heron/Jackson compositions, were sampled by hip hop artists. This [...] further expanded Scott-Heron's legacy as one of the progenitors of hip hop. The diverse sound and mellow instrumentation featured on the album, referred to by Scott-Heron as bluesology, later inspired neo soul artists in the 1990s and helped solidify Scott-Heron's and Jackson's legacy in the genre. On Jackson's legacy, All About Jazz described him as [...] "one of the early architects of the neo-soul", while citing his early work with Scott-Heron as [...] "an inspirational and musical Rosetta stone for the neo-soul movement". Pierre Jean-Critin of the French music magazine Vibrations wrote of Scott-Heron and the album, stating [...] "As an artist who conceives his albums as newspapers and similar testimonies, Gil Scott-Heron is one of America's finest observers and commentators of social reality as well as being one of the most creative and influential figures in African-American music, and this landmark album announced his arrival." ...|$|E
