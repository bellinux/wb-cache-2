Because potassium channels {{play an important}} role in the regulation of vascular tone, this study explores the impact of diabetes on potassium channel function in the <b>fetoplacental</b> vascular bed. STUDY DESIGN: Vascular potassium channel function was investigated by ex vivo dual perfusion of isolated placental cotyledons (n = 47). Appropriate control experiments were carried out to exclude nonspecific effects. RESULTS: Glibenclamide (KATP channel blocker) increased perfusion pressure to a maximum <b>fetoplacental</b> arterial pressure of 37 +/- 6 mm Hg in controls versus 15 +/- 6 mm Hg in diabetes (P <. 05). 4 -Aminopyridine (KV channel blocker) equally increased <b>fetoplacental</b> arterial pressure in controls, and in diabetes (21 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 22 +/- 2 mm Hg).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is {{associated}} with an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, resulting in reduced effects of the endothelium-derived, relaxing-factor nitric oxide (NO). Antioxidants, like N-acetylcysteine (NAC), remove reactive oxygen species, resulting in an improvement of endothelial function. We aimed to investigate the effect of NAC on the NO-pathway in the human <b>fetoplacental</b> circulation in preeclampsia and control pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: The NO-pathway was investigated by use of the NO-synthase inhibitor L-NAME in an ex vivo cotyledon perfusion model. RESULTS: At baseline, <b>fetoplacental</b> arterial pressure was comparable in preeclamptic pregnancies (n= 8) and control pregnancies (n= 8), and increased dose-dependently after L-NAME. The maximal L-NAME-induced rise in <b>fetoplacental</b> arterial pressure was attenuated in preeclamptic versus control pregnancies (20. 8 +/- 2. 0 mm Hg vs 36. 7 +/- 3. 5 mm Hg, P<. 05).

40|$|Preeclampsia (PE), gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM), and maternal supraphysiological hypercholesterolaemia (MSPH) are pregnancy-related conditions that cause metabolic disruptions leading to alterations of the mother, fetus and neonate health. These syndromes result in <b>fetoplacental</b> vascular dysfunction, where nitric oxide (NO) plays a crucial role. PE characterizes by abnormal {{increase in the}} placental blood pressure and a negative correlation between NO level and fetal weight, suggesting that increased NO level and oxidative stress could be involved. GDM courses with macrosomia along with altered function of the fetal cardiovascular system and <b>fetoplacental</b> vasculature. Even when NO synthesis in the <b>fetoplacental</b> vasculature is increased, NO bioavailability is reduced due to the higher oxidative stress seen in this disease. In MSPH, there is an early development of atherosclerotic lesions in fetal and newborn arteries, altered function of the <b>fetoplacental</b> vasculature, and higher markers of oxidative stress in fetal blood and placenta, thus, vascular alterations related with NO metabolism occur {{as a consequence of}} this syndrome. Potential mechanisms of altered NO synthesis and bioavailability result from transcriptional and post-translational NO synthases (NOS) modulation, including phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles, coupling/uncoupling of NOS, tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability, calcium/calmodulin-NOS and caveolin- 1 -NOS interaction. Additionally, oxidative stress also plays a role in the reduced NO bioavailability. This review summarizes the available information regarding lower NO bioavailability in these pregnancy pathologies.

40|$|During normal pregnancy, {{elevated}} angiotensin II (Ang II) {{concentrations in}} the maternal and fetal circulations are associated with dramatic increases in placental angiogenesis and blood flow. Much is known about a local renin–angiotensin system within the uteroplacental vasculature. However, the roles of Ang II in regulating <b>fetoplacental</b> vascular functions are less well defined. In the fetal placenta, the overall in vivo vasoconstrictor responses of the blood vessels to Ang II infusion {{is thought to be}} less than that in its maternal counterpart, even though infused Ang II induces vasoconstriction. Recent data from our laboratories suggest that Ang II stimulates cell proliferation and increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO) in ovine <b>fetoplacental</b> artery endothelial cells. These data imply that elevations of the known vasoconstrictor Ang II in the fetal circulation may indeed {{play a role in the}} marked increases in <b>fetoplacental</b> angiogenesis and that Ang II-elevated endothelial NO production may partly attenuate Ang II-induced vasoconstriction on vascular smooth muscle. Together with both of these processes, the high levels of Ang II in the fetal circulation may serve to modulate overall <b>fetoplacental</b> vascular resistance. In this article, we review currently available data on the expression of Ang II receptors in the ovine fetal placenta with particular emphasis on the effects of Ang II on ovine <b>fetoplacental</b> endothelium.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Antenatal {{maternal}} {{psychological distress}} {{may be associated}} with reduced placental circulation, which could lead to lower birthweight. Studies investigating this in humans show mixed results, which may be partially due to type, strength and timing of distress. In addition, the arterial vascular resistance measures often used as outcome measures do not detect smaller changes in placental volume blood flow. We aimed to investigate the effect of a specific stressor, with increased levels of stress early in pregnancy, on the <b>fetoplacental</b> volume blood flow in third trimester. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 74 pregnant women with a congenital malformation in a previous fetus or child. Psychological distress was assessed twice, around 16 and 30 weeks' gestation. Psychometric measures were the General Health Questionnaire- 28 (subscales anxiety and depression), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Impact of Event Scale- 22 (subscales intrusion, avoidance, and arousal). Placental circulation was examined at 30 weeks, using Doppler ultrasonography, primarily as <b>fetoplacental</b> volume blood flow in the umbilical vein, normalized for abdominal circumference; secondarily as vascular resistance measures, obtained from the umbilical and the uterine arteries. RESULTS: Maternal distress in second but not third trimester was associated with increased normalized <b>fetoplacental</b> blood flow (P-values 0. 006 and 0. 013 for score > mean for depression and intrusion, respectively). Post-hoc explorations suggested that a reduced birthweight/placental weight ratio may mediate this association. Psychological distress did not affect vascular resistance measures in the umbilical and uterine arteries, regardless of adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant women with a previous fetus or child with a congenital malformation, higher distress levels in second trimester were associated with third trimester <b>fetoplacental</b> blood flow that was higher than expected for the size of the fetus.

40|$|Placental up-regulation of free fetal {{haemoglobin}} (fHbF) occurs in preeclamptic (PE) pregnancy. Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{is an important}} vasculoprotective enzyme in the catabolism of the associated heme porphyrin structure. We have previously shown that fHbF negatively influences the vasculoprotective capacity of the fetal circulation. Here we study fHbF levels in the fetal cord blood of pregnancies complicated by PE; a pathology associated with dysregulated <b>fetoplacental</b> vascular tone. We have previously shown that fHbF binds nitric oxide (NO) to elicit elevated vascular resistance in the <b>fetoplacental</b> circulation, using ex vivo human dual placental perfusion and in vitro placental endothelial cell shear stress studies. Furthermore, fHbF causes morphological changes to the <b>fetoplacental</b> endothelium. Here we hypothesise that elevated levels of fHbF in fetal plasma associated with placental pathology contribute to <b>fetoplacental</b> hypertension. Purpose: To evaluate and derive a robust cord blood collection and processing protocol for the accurate measurement of fetal plasma fHbF levels in normal and PE pregnancies. Methods: Fetal venous cord blood was collected by syringe and needle, or Vacutainer method into either EDTA or citrate tubes, within 10 minutes of partum. Plasma recovery occurred immediately, or after 30 minutes, prior to centrifugation at 2000 g x 10 min at room temperature. Following evaluation to reduce mechanical haemolysis, newly collected normal & PE plasma (n= 13 & 6, respectively) was subjected to ELISAs for HbF and HO- 1. Results: Venipuncture collection of cord venous blood taken from the cord-placenta insertion point by Vacutainer system with a 21 G needle, into citrate collection tubes with immediate centrifugation prevented mechanical haemolysis. There {{was no difference in}} plasma HO- 1 between groups (medians = 5. 9 & 5. 3 ng/mL; normal & PE, respectively; Mann-Whitney). Whilst {{there was no difference in}} fHbF between groups (Mann-Whitney), variability was high in the PE group and there were some very high values for fHbF compared to the normal range, whilst fHbF values in the control group were within a tighter lower range (medians & ranges = 45. 9 & 0 - 206 and 118. 8 & 29 - 640 μg/mL). Conclusion: Fetal plasma HO- 1 levels appear stable in preeclamptic fetal plasma, permitting fHbF to remain unchecked in some cases. High pathophysiological levels of fHbF in some cases of PE pregnancies are capable of evoking elevated vascular resistance within the <b>fetoplacental</b> circulation, caused by nitric oxide sequestration and disruption to the endothelium.

40|$|This review will {{consider}} whether adrenomedullin (AM) {{plays a role}} in the different aspects of perinatal medicine: contributing to maternal systemic vasodilatation during pregnancy, regulating uterine and placental blood flow, being involved in the process of implantation and participating in uterine quiescence prior to parturition. In addition, this will also consider whether a modification of AM secretion contributes to some pathological conditions in pregnancy such as preeclampsia and impairment of fetal growth. The biosynthesis of AM increases in gravid rats and in pregnant women, and the placenta represents an important site of AM production during pregnancy. Both the peptide and its receptors have been found in the uterus, placenta, fetal membranes and cord vessels, and fetal membranes and placental tissues in culture secrete AM. AM contributes to maternal systemic vasodilatation, the placental vessels are relaxed by AM in a dose-dependent manner and AM is expressed in the <b>fetoplacental</b> and umbilical vascular endothelium where basal production of AM contributes to low <b>fetoplacental</b> vascular resistances.

30|$|We {{concluded}} that both labetalol and hydralazine intravenous infusion regimens are well tolerated and effective in controlling severe hypertension in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia {{in combination with}} magnesium sulfate. Both drugs are reassuring as they {{are not related to}} any significant changes in <b>fetoplacental</b> circulation. Fetal heart rate did not change significantly after treatment in both groups.|$|E
30|$|Sander {{described}} {{that the}} cause of FGR might be the diversion of blood away from the maternal intervillous space and that fetal anemia might be a result of a microangiopathic process occurring within the aberrant placental vasculature (Sander 1993). In addition, thrombosis in chorionic vessels might have caused FGR associated with <b>fetoplacental</b> circulatory insufficiency in our case.|$|E
