25|$|In {{the same}} cave where God once {{appeared}} to Moses and revealed Himself as <b>gracious</b> <b>and</b> merciful, Elijah {{was summoned to}} appear before God. By this summons he perceived {{that he should have}} appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.|$|E

25|$|Gustavus Adolphus shared Maria Eleonora's {{interest}} in architecture and {{her love of}} music, while she was sentimentally devoted to her husband. Often, she lamented that she never had her hero for herself. Foreign ambassadors found her <b>gracious</b> <b>and</b> beautiful and she had good taste, although her character showed some extravagant traits. Maria Eleonora had a definite liking for entertainment and sweetmeats, and she soon succumbed to the current fashionable craze for buffoons and dwarfs. She spoke French, the court language of the age, but never bothered to learn to write German or Swedish correctly.|$|E
25|$|The Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin W. Crowninshield, {{was equally}} <b>gracious</b> <b>and</b> thankful. Since a vacancy {{was about to}} occur in the board of Navy commissioners with the {{retirement}} of Commodore Isaac Hull, the Secretary was most anxious to offer the position to Decatur, which he gladly accepted. Upon his appointment Decatur made his journey to Washington, where he was again received with cordial receptions from various dignitaries and countrymen. He served on the Board of Navy Commissioners from 1816 to 1820. One of his more notable decisions as a commissioner involved his strong objection to the reinstatement of James Barron upon his return to the United States after being barred from command for five years for his questionable handling of the Chesapeake, an action that would soon lead to Barron challenging him to a duel.|$|E

25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being <b>gracious</b> <b>and</b> merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E

Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that {{there was a time when}} he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings [...] "Here Come the Tears" [...] from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.|$|E

[...] while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards the validity of mind cure adding, [...] "These things are true, or they are not. If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago {{it would be difficult to}} satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now."< His daughter Clara Clemens became a Christian Scientist and wrote a book about it, Awake to a Perfect Day (1956).|$|E
