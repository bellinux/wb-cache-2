Asking your pardon for the trouble I cause you, I guarantee your safe return to your ship.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} none of us {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E

500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> have to say I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain {{she must have been}} under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E

A year later he offered [...] "a fatter typescript (the London chapters had been added)" [...] to Faber & Faber, where T. S. Eliot, then an editorial director, also rejected it, stating: [...] "We did find it of very great interest, but <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> say that it does not appear to me possible as a publishing venture." ...|$|E

[...] When the conference failed to reach a binding, meaningful agreement, Tuvalu's representative Ian Fry said, [...] "It looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future...

"Ute John scalped {{all of the}} dead, {{unknown to}} the General {{or any of the}} officers, and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> state a few, a very few, brutalized {{soldiers}} followed his savage example. [...] Each took only a portion of the scalp, but the exhibition of human depravity was nauseating. [...] The unfortunate should have been respected, even in the coldness and nothingness of death. [...] In that affair surely the army were the assailants and the savages acted purely in self defense." [...] Even [...] "Ute John" [...] respected the cold clay of the brave Sioux leader Chief American Horse and his corpse was not subjected to the scalping process." [...] Captain Jack told readers of the Omaha Daily Bee that he had taken [...] "one top-knot" [...] during the Battle of Slim Buttes in which he [...] "came near losing" [...] his own hair. He later regretted the bloody deed and never spoke of it in public performances.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, William Dever {{established}} the secular, non-biblical school of Syro-Palestinian archaeology and mounted {{a series of}} attacks on {{the very definition of}} biblical archaeology. Dever argued that the name of such inquiry should be changed to [...] "archaeology of the Bible" [...] or [...] "archaeology of the Biblical period" [...] to delineate the narrow temporal focus of Biblical archaeologists. Frank Moore Cross, who had studied under Albright and had taught Dever, emphasized that in Albright's view, biblical archaeology was not synonymous with Palestinian archaeology, but rather that, [...] "William Foxwell Albright regarded Palestinian archaeology or Levantine archaeology as a small, if important section of biblical archaeology. One finds it ironical that recent students suppose them interchangeable terms." [...] Dever agreed that the terms were not interchangeable, but claimed that [...] "'Syro-Palestinian archaeology' {{is not the same as}} the 'biblical archaeology'. <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> say that all who would defend Albright and 'biblical archaeology' on this ground, are sadly out of touch with reality in the field of archaeology." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Saturday, September 19, {{when the}} regular brigade was falling back, he behaved with most {{conspicuous}} gallantry; {{with a sword}} {{in one hand and}} his bugle in the other, he sounded constantly the [...] "Halt," [...] the [...] "Rally," [...] and the [...] "Forward;" [...] espying a stand of colors belonging to the Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, he rushed up to them and sounded [...] "To the color." [...] His conduct attracted the notice and elicited the admiration of the whole brigade. On Sunday, September 20, before our battalion was engaged, the Eighteenth, being pressed by vastly superior numbers, was falling back; Carson by some means became the possessor of a musket and constituted himself a [...] "provost guard." [...] One of the officers attempted to pass him, but he positively refused to allow it, stating that it was against his orders. All this time he continued to sound the various calls on his bugle. <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> state that his fate remains a mystery; he was last seen by me late on Sunday afternoon behind the breastworks. I can only hope that he is a prisoner."....|$|E
