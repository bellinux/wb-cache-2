5|$|The <b>greatest</b> <b>number</b> of {{fatalities}} involving one aircraft {{occurred in}} 1985 when 520 {{people died in}} the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123. The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The <b>greatest</b> <b>number</b> of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision, to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes. The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths.

30|$|A <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> of non-dominated {{solutions}} {{is obtained}} with the Combined strategy: regarding {{the number of}} solutions, we can observe in Table 3 that the search-based algorithms find a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> of non-dominated solutions when using the strategy Combined. An explanation {{for this is that}} the Incremental+ strategy imposes restrictions to the algorithms and this reduces the search space, decreasing, as a consequence, the number of possible solutions. GA for the system AJHotDraw is the single exception where the Incremental+ strategy found a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> of solutions. The other exception involves the systems with a single solution, cases where there is no difference.|$|R
