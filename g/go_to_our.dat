This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling, who produced [...] "The Absent-Minded Beggar" [...] on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that [...] "they are at your service. ... turn [...] over {{to any one of}} the regularly ordained relief-funds, as a portion of your contribution. I don't want my name mixed up in the business except as it will help to get money. It's catchpenny verse and I want it to catch just as many pennies as it can. ... It isn't a thing I shall care to reprint; so there is no need of copyrighting it in America. If any one wants to sing it take care that the proceeds <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> men." [...] It was first published in the Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success. Maud Tree, the wife of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, recited it at the Palace Theatre, every night before the show, for fourteen months, and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere, giving part of the profits to the fund. The manuscript itself was auctioned for £500, and a Special Edition de Luxe was issued.|$|E

2500|$|The first budget {{introduced}} by Martin in February 1994, {{who had become}} the Finance Minister in November 1993 {{was described as a}} [...] "mild and tame" [...] budget focused only on the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, and brought in modest cuts, mostly to defence spending. Until the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Chrétien government tended to be hostile towards defence spending with the government's white paper [...] "Defence 94" [...] declaring that in a post-Cold War world there would be less and less need for armed forces, which accordingly meant reduced budgets for the military. The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein in his 2004 book Who Killed the Canadian Military? accused the Chrétien government of putting the military in the uncomfortable position in the 1990s of having to do more and more UN peacekeeping missions while cutting defence spending at the same time. Granatstein accused Chrétien of having [...] "finished off the Canadian Forces" [...] through a policy of heavy cuts inspired by a deep personal dislike of the military and of using the military as UN peacekeepers rather preparing to fight a war. Outside of defence spending, there were few cuts in the 1994 budget. In a radio interview with Ron Collister in March 1994, Chrétien stated: [...] "To <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> goal of 3 per cent of GNP, all the cuts been announced in the budget. There will not be a new round." [...] According to the diplomat James Bartleman, Chrétien told him in early 1994 that major cuts to government spending outside of defence were out of the question, and instead he hoped that economy would grow enough on its own that the deficit would disappear without any cuts. Chrétien's plans in early 1994 for economic growth were to increase exports by embracing globalization and free trade with as many nations as possible, arguing that the export offensive would stimulate the economy out of the early 1990s recession. The 1994 budget was widely criticised by journalists such as Andrew Coyne as useless in even achieving its target of reducing deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, let alone eliminating the deficit, and led to a celebrated clash between Coyne and Martin in the boardroom of the Globe and Mail newspaper. Investor reaction to the 1994 budget was very negative with many concluding that the Liberals had no serious interest in dealing with the debt problem with one economist recalling that after the 1994 budget the consensus amongst economists was that [...] "They don’t get it. They just don’t get it". David A. Dodge, the Deputy Finance Minister complained repeatedly to Martin throughout 1994 that the 3% target was meaningless as Canada did not plan to join the European Union, that it was unlikely to be achieved with the current levels of cuts outlined in the 1994 budget, and would even if achieved would do nothing to help the economy. Accordingly, Dodge advocated far more drastic cuts, policy advice that both Martin ignored until late 1994 and Chrétien until early 1995. Dodge had appointed deputy finance minister by Mulroney in 1992, and thus his views were something to the right of both Martin and Chrétien. In April 1994, interest rates in Canada started a steady rise that would continue until early 1995.|$|E
