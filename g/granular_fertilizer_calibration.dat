The planting was established in Apr. 2006 at a field site located in western Oregon. The plants were grown on raised beds and mulched every 2 years with sawdust.

Each fertilizer was applied at three N rates, which were increased each year as the plants matured (63 to 93, 133 to 187, and 200 to 280 kg·ha⁻¹ N) and compared with non-fertilized treatments (0 kg·ha⁻¹ N). Canopy cover, which was measured in 2008 only, and fresh pruning weight were greater with fertigation than with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and often increased with N rate when the plants were fertigated but decreased at the highest rate when <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied. Yield also increased with N fertilizer and was 12 % to 40 % greater with fertigation than with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> each year as well as 17 % greater with ammonium sulfate than with urea in 2011. The response of berry weight to the treatments was variable but decreased with higher N rates during the first 3 years of fruit production. Leaf N concentration was greater with fertigation in 4 of 5 years and averaged 1. 68 % with fertigation and 1. 61 % with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Leaf N was also often greater with ammonium sulfate than with urea and increased as more N was applied. Soil pH declined with increasing N rates and was lower with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> than with fertigation during the first 3 years of fruit production and lower with ammonium sulfate than with urea in every year but 2010.

Department of Agriculture, Corvallis, OR, USA 2 Departamento de Fitotecnia, Instituto de Ciências Agrárias e Ambientais Mediterrânicas, Universidade de Évora, Évora, Portugal A 2 -year study was done to compare the effects of nitrogen (N) fertigation and <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application on growth and availability of soil N during establishment of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L. “Bluecrop”). Treatments included four methods of N application (weekly fertigation, split fertigation, and two non-fertigated controls) and four levels of N fertilizer (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg·ha− 1 N). Fertigation treatments were irrigated by drip and injected with a liquid urea solution; weekly fertigation was applied once a week from leaf emergence to 60 d prior {{to the end of}} the season while split fertigation was applied as a triple-split from April to June. Non-fertigated controls were fertilized with granular ammonium sulfate, also applied as a triple-split, and irrigated by drip or microsprinklers. Weekly fertigation produced the smallest plants among the four fertilizer application methods at 50 kg·ha− 1 N during the first year after planting but the largest plants at 150 kg·ha− 1 N in both the first and second year. The other application methods required less N to maximize growth but were less responsive than weekly fertigation to additional N fertilizer applications. In fact, 44 – 50 % of the plants died when <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied at 150 kg·ha− 1 N. By comparison, none of the plants died with weekly fertigation.

40|$|Phosphorus {{availability}} is a {{major factor}} limiting crop production in highly calcareous soils. Recent field trials on calcareous soils in southern Australia have shown that fluid fertilizers may provide a useful alternative to <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> products. Fluid sources of P enhance P uptake and yield when compared with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> applied at the same rate. This work aimed to compare the behavior of one fluid (technical grade monoammonium phosphate, TG-MAP) and one granular (monoammonium phosphate, MAP) form of P fertilizer in a highly calcareous soil. Changes in soil pH, P diffusion, solubility, and lability (using isotopic dilution techniques) were determined at different distances from the point of application over 5 wk. Furthermore, reaction products in MAP granules were investigated using spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated that P from fluid TG-MAP diffused more and was more available than P supplied as granular MAP. Also, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray microanalyses (EDXMA) of the MAP granules indicated that a significant percentage (12 %) of the initial P remained in the granules even after 5 wk of incubation in the soil. The enhanced P availability of fluid fertilizers observed in field trials compared with granular forms is discussed in relation to differences in the dissolution, diffusion, and reaction processes in soils.

40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} to measure the mass flow of <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> material in aerial spreader ducts. The flow process was regarded as the sequential passage of clusters containing multiple particles with varying diameters. An optical sensor {{was used to measure}} the cluster lengths on the fly. In a low-density flow regime, the diameter of each particle could be measured individually (this is called the single-particle approach). After conversion to a volume of a sphere and multiplication by the true material density, the mass flow could be computed. In a high-density mass flow regime (called the mass flow approach), particles form clusters, and cluster lengths would be measured instead of particle diameters. The first step in performing mass flow measurement was to develop a reconstruction algorithm that estimates the number of particles in a cluster from the measured cluster length. This algorithm, called the Exponential Estimator, was developed using simulation and is reported in Part I. This article, Part 2, describes the use of the mass flow sensor as well as the reconstruction algorithm to assess the accuracy of the complete system. Tests were carried out under laboratory conditions, using mass flows of spherical particles as well as urea fertilizer under varying flow velocities and densities. The mass flow of identical spherical particles of 4. 45 mm diameter was measured with an accuracy of 3 %, even under high-density flow conditions. For <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> the flow was measured with an accuracy of 2 % for high-density flows and 4 % for low-density flow...|$|R

Recently apple (Malus ×domestica) orchards in the Trentino area of northeastern Italy have converted from traditional sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation, both {{with or without}} fertigation. An experimental field trial was started {{at the end of}} 2008 in a ‘Golden Delicious’/M 9 orchard at Tres (Province of Trento) to develop specific fertilization plans, in order to limit fertilizer input and reduce nutrient runoff into waterways. A factorial experiment with two fertilizer treatments (soil application of <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> or fertigation through drip emitters) and two water application rates (1500 or 3000 m 3 /ha/yr) was established. Compared with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> fertigation significantly increased leaf greenness, increased leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, and reduced phosphorus (P) concentration in the fruits at harvest. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, a measure of canopy growth, were affected by both fertilization and water rate. Fertigation, through the end of July, enhanced NDVI values compared to granular fertilization, while NDVI values during the growing season had variable responses to water application rate. Application of the higher water rate decreased sugar and firmness values of fruits. The reduced water application rate decreased the concentrations of N, boron (B), and calcium (Ca) in the fruits, and increased fruit magnesium (Mg) concentration. The results of this three-year Trentino apple trial suggest a generally positive effect of fertigation on enhanced effectiveness of fertilization and improved fruit quality.

Conclusive positive results of deep-banding P fertilizers compared with broadcast application and the chemistry of reduced-tillage systems remain unclear. Knowledge of the dominant solid P species present in soil following application of P fertilizers and the resulting potential P availability would help us understand and efficiently manage P in reduced-tillage systems. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the influence of placement (broadcast vs. deep-band P), <b>fertilizer</b> source (<b>granular</b> vs. liquid P), and time on the reaction products of P under field conditions. Changes in soil pH, resin-extractable P, total P, and speciation of P were determined at different distances from the point of fertilizer application at 5 wk and 6 mo after P application at a rate of 75 kg ha− 1 to a soil system that was under long-term reduced tillage. Resin-extractable P was lower for broadcast treatments compared with deep-band treatments for both time periods. Resin-extractable P was greater in the liquid P-treated soils than in the granular P-treated soils. Speciation results showed that <b>granular</b> P <b>fertilizers</b> tended to form Fe–P-like forms, whereas liquid forms remained in adsorbed P-like forms in the soil 5 wk after application; moreover, speciation results showed <b>granular</b> P <b>fertilizers</b> precipitated less when deep-banded.

Treatments included four application methods (split fertigation, continuous fertigation, and two non-fertigated controls) and four rates of N application (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg/ha N). Fertigation treatments were irrigated by drip and injected with liquid urea fertilizer; split fertigation was applied as a triple-split from April to June while continuous fertigation was applied weekly from leaf emergence to approximately 2 {{months prior to the}} end of the growing season. Non-fertigated controls were fertilized with a triple-split of granular ammonium sulfate and irrigated by drip or microsprays.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Northern highbush {{blueberry}} is a long-lived perennial crop {{that is well}} adapted to low soil pH conditions. The plants are often shallow rooted and absorb primarily the ammonium (NH₄) form of nitrogen (N) rather than nitrate-N (NO₃-N). Traditionally, commercial blueberry fields have been irrigated with overhead sprinklers and fertilized using granular sources of NH₄-N. However, many new plantings of blueberry are irrigated by drip and fertigated by injecting liquid sources of N directly through the drip system. Three studies were conducted in western Oregon to compare fertigation to <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and to develop methods to enhance {{the potential benefits of}} the practice. The first study was conducted in an established planting of 'Bluecrop' blueberry during the first 5 years of fruit production (year 3 - 7). Liquid sources of ammonium sulfate or urea were injected through a drip system in equal weekly applications from mid-April to early August. Granular sources of the fertilizers were applied on each side of plants, in three split applications from mid-April to mid-June, and washed into the soil using microsprinklers. Each fertilizer was applied at three N rates, which were increased as the plants matured (63 to 93, 133 to 187, and 200 to 280 kg·ha⁻¹ N) and compared with non-fertilized treatments (0 kg·ha⁻¹ N). Yield was 12 % to 40 % greater with fertigation than with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> each year as well as with ammonium sulfate than with urea during the fourth year. Leaf N concentrations were also greater with fertigation in 4 of 5 years and greater with ammonium sulfate than with urea each year. The plants produced fewer roots with fertigation than with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> but the median lifespan of the roots was 60 days longer with fertigation. Soil pH declined with increasing N rates and was lower with <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> than with fertigation the first 3 years and was lower with ammonium sulfate than with urea in all but one year. Total yield averaged 32 to 63 t·ha⁻¹ in each treatment over the first 5 years of fruit production and was greatest when plants were fertigated with ammonium sulfate or urea at rates of at least 63 to 93 kg·ha⁻¹ N per year. The second study was conducted to evaluate the use of conventional drip and alternative micro irrigation systems in six newly planted cultivars ('Earliblue', 'Duke', 'Draper', 'Bluecrop', 'Elliott', and 'Aurora') of northern {{highbush blueberry}}. The drip system included two lines of tubing {{on each side of the}} row with in-line drip emitters at every 0. 45 m. The alternative systems included geotextile tape and microsprinklers. The geotextile tape was placed alongside the plants and dispersed water and nutrients over the entire length. Microsprinklers were installed between every other plant at a height of 1. 2 m. Nitrogen was applied by fertigation at annual rates of 100 and 200 kg·ha⁻¹ N by drip, 200 kg·ha⁻¹ N by geotextile tape, and 280 kg·ha⁻¹ N by microsprinklers. By the end of the first season, plant size, in terms of canopy cover, was greatest with geotextile tape, on average, and lowest with microsprinklers or drip at the lower N rate. The following year, canopy cover was similar with geotextile tape and drip at the higher N rate in each cultivar, and was lowest with microsprinklers in all but 'Draper'. In most of the cultivars, geotextile tape and drip at the higher N rate resulted in greater leaf N concentrations than microsprinklers or drip at the lower N rate, particularly during the first year after planting. By the third year, yield averaged 3. 1 to 9. 1 t·ha⁻¹ among the cultivars, but was similar with geotextile tape and drip at either N rate, and was only lower with microsprinklers. Overall, drip was more cost effective than geotextile tape, and fertigation with 100 kg·ha⁻¹ N by drip was sufficient to maximize early fruit production in each cultivar. Microsprinklers were less effective by comparison and resulted in white salt deposits on the fruit. The final study was conducted in a new planting of 'Draper' blueberry to identify methods to increase the efficiency of fertigation with N fertilizer. Previous research indicated that more N was needed by fertigation during first year or two after planting because, unlike <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> which could be applied by hand around the base of the plants, at least half of the N injected through the drip system was applied between the plants and beyond the root system. Twelve treatments were included in the present study, including four with different drip configurations, six with alternative fertilizers, and two to determine whether pre-plant or late-season applications of N fertilizer was beneficial with fertigation in blueberry. After 2 years, total plant dry weight was 28 % to 58 % greater with one or two drip lines near the base (crown) of the plants than with two lines located at 20 cm on each side of the row, even when <b>granular</b> or slow-release <b>fertilizer</b> was applied in early spring prior to fertigation with the wider drip lines. Wider drip lines often resulted in lower leaf N concentrations than other treatments and increased salinity (electrical conductivity) in the root zone. The use of alternative fertilizers such as urea sulfuric acid was effective at reducing soil pH but resulted in the same plant dry weight as liquid urea, while humic acids with N and other nutrients increased root dry weight by an average of 60 % relative to any other treatment, including a control that contained the same nutrients. Pre-plant and extended N application had no measureable effect on plant growth. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that fertigation was generally more beneficial than granular applications of N fertilizer and, in new plantings, was most effective when drip lines were located near the base of the plants. Humic acids were also useful for increasing root production during establishment...|$|R
40|$|Data {{indicate}} that fluid fertilizers {{are superior to}} granular for delivery of phosphorus (P) for crop nutrition in calcareous soils. Field and glasshouse experiments have demonstrated in southern Australian soils the benefits of fluid formulations for crop nutrition. Experiments were performed using similar fertilizer products delivered either in fluid or granular form to calcareous soils. Isotopic and spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize reactions. <b>Granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> {{were found to be}} inferior to fluids (even with the same formulations) due to the precipitation of insoluble Ca/Al phosphates similar to crandallite in the fertilization zone (i. e., in and around the granule). As determined by isotopic dilution studies, P diffusion from the incorporation zone was inhibited with granular applications and the ability of P in the fertilized zone was also reduced when P was applied in granular form. Fixation of applied P is minimized when fertilizers are supplied in fluid form. Some formulations may have the added advantage of liberating fixed P in the soil-to-plant available forms...|$|R

The treatments consisted of seed mixed times of B. ruziziensis (0; 4; 8; 16; 24; 48; 96 and 192 hours) with urea, besides control treatment. It was used a completely randomized design with four replications. Moreover, {{with the passage of time}} in contact with urea, water content and electrical conductivity of seed increased, while there was decrease in percentage of germination, first count, the emergence and emergence speed index.

40|$|Fluid {{phosphorus}} (P) fertilizers {{are more}} efficient than <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> in calcareous soils, but their potential to improve P use efficiency in strongly P-sorbing acidic soils is not known. We therefore evaluated P uptake by wheat (Triticum aestivum) from granular (calcium phosphate and ammonium phosphate) and fluid (ammonium phosphate) fertilizers in two Andisols from Chile and New Zealand, two Oxisols and a calcareous soil from Australia, by using an isotope (33 P) dilution technique. All fertilizers were applied {{at a rate of}} 150 mg kg− 1 soil. The availability of soil P was very low in the Oxisols and Andisols, and most P (> 71 %) was derived from the seed in the control treatment. Addition of P fertilizer increased dry matter yield up to sevenfold compared with the control, except with ammonium phosphates in the Chile soil, likely due to Ca deficiency limiting plant growth, and with triple superphosphate in the Oxisol with the highest pH, likely due to precipitation of fertilizer P. The percentage of P in the shoots derived from the fertilizer (%Pdff) in the P-amended Andisols and Oxisols ranged from 65 to 88 %. No significant difference in %Pdff between granular and fluid sources was observed in these soils, except for the calcareous soil, in which significantly more P was derived from fertilizer with fluid than with granular MAP (as found previously). We conclude there is no agronomic benefit of fluid over <b>granular</b> P <b>fertilizer</b> sources in soils in which P availability is controlled by strong adsorption, that is, Andisols and Oxisols.

40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal {{employees}} when contributing to this work. This is the publisher’s final pdf. The published article is copyrighted by the American Society for Horticultural Science and can be found at: [URL] highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) is well adapted to acidic soils with low nutrient availability, but often requires regular applications of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients for profitable production. Typically, nutrients accumulate in the plant tissues following the same pattern as dry matter and are lost or removed by leaf senescence, pruning, fruit harvest, and root turnover. Leaf tissue testing is a useful tool for monitoring nutrient requirements in northern highbush blueberry, and standards for analysis have been updated for Oregon. Until recently, most commercial plantings of blueberry (Vaccinium sp.) were fertilized using <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> However, many new fields are irrigated by drip and fertigated using liquid fertilizers. Suitable sources of liquid N fertilizer for blueberry include ammonium sulfate, ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium phosphate, urea, and urea sulfuric acid. Several growers are also applying humic acids to help improve root growth and are injecting sulfuric acid to reduce carbonates and bicarbonates in the irrigation water. Although only a single line of drip tubing is needed for adequate irrigation of northern highbush blueberry, two lines are often used to encourage a larger root system. The lines are often installed near the base of the plants initially and then repositioned 6 – 12 inches away once the root system develops. For better efficiency, N should be applied frequently by fertigation (e. g., weekly), beginning at budbreak, but discontinued at least 2 months {{before the end of the}} growing season. Applying N in late summer reduces flower bud development in northern highbush blueberry and may lead to late flushes of shoot growth vulnerable to freeze damage. The recommended N rates are higher for fertigation than for <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> during the first 2 years after planting but are similar to granular rates in the following years. More work is needed to develop fertigation programs for other nutrients and soil supplements in northern highbush blueberry...|$|R

The {{effect of}} {{rejuvenation}} of Aspen Parkland ecoregion grass-legume pastures on botanical composition. Can. J. Plant Sci. 81 : 673 – 683. A 3 -yr study was con- ducted at five different {{sites in the}} Aspen Parkland of Saskatchewan {{to determine the effect}} of spiking, burning, mowing, deep- banding (Trt) and applications of N, P, K and S liquid and <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (Fert) on changes in botanical composition of predominantly smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pastures established on Black Chernozemic and Gray Luvisolic soils in central Saskatchewan. Fertilizer application was in a liquid form blended to provide 100 kg N ha– 1, 45 kg P O ha– 1, 23 kg K O ha– 1 and 12 kg S ha– 1 in 350 kg of fertilizer ha– 1. The experimental design at each 252 site was a randomized complete block in a split-plot arrangement. Main plots were spike, burn, mow, deep-band, deep-band liq- uid fertilizer and control. The split-plot treatment was <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> broadcast at 0 and 350 kg ha– 1 (providing 100 kg N ha– 1, 45 kg P O ha– 1, 23 kg K O ha– 1 and 12 kg S ha– 1). All treatments were applied in the spring of 1994. Interaction effects of 252 Trt × Yr and Fert × Yr were significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), indicating a wide range of response to the rejuvenation methods among years. Spiking reduced grass and legume composition, and increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) the presence of annual weeds and bare ground. Burning increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) alfalfa composition in years 2 and 3 at three sites and tended to decrease (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) bluegrass composition in all 3 yr.

40|$|Fertigation {{is now the}} {{accepted}} method of applying most of the crops nutrition, with many sun melon growers using liquid soluble fertilizer rather than spreading <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> {{and waiting for the}} rain or sprinklers to wash the fertilizer into the root zone.

Proper management requires the knowledge of fertigation rate and nutrient uptake by the crop to ensure maximum of crop productivity. In this study, the effect of fertilization methods including the fertigation inside netted house; non-fertigation inside netted house, fertigation outside netted house as well as non-fertigation outside netted house toward sun melon were evaluated. Growth parameters data such as the height of plant, circumference of stem and the number of leaves per plant were collected.

Our objective in this field {{study was to determine the}} relative soil profile distribution of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) applied as a liquid fertilizer in a surface band. Research was conducted during six years (2001 - 2006) at three locations in central Iowa. Exchange-resin membranes were used to measure nutrient availability. Phosphorus movement was characterized after 15 kg P ha- 1 were dribbled on the soil surface 5 cm to the side of the maize row at the time of planting. The material was a blended combination of 7 - 9 - 6 (N-P-K) liquid and 32 - 0 - 0 urea ammonium nitrate solution. Potassium movement was characterized after 28 kg K ha- 1 were: i) surface broadcast as 0 - 0 - 50 (N-P-K) granular fertilizer; ii) applied as a 0 - 0 - 50 <b>granular</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in a subsurface band 5 cm to the side of the maize row; or iii) applied as a liquid (0 - 0 - 8) surface band 5 cm to the side of the maize row. In 2001, the highest concentration of available P was found at a depth of > 7 cm below the surface 43 days after application. In 2002, movement of fertilizer P from the surface (0 - 2. 5 cm) soil layer into the profile (8 - 10 cm) was evident 43 days after {{application of}} both a low N (17 kg N ha- 1) and a high N (67 kg N ha- 1) material. Given that P diffusion in soil is a relatively slow process, the volume of material applied (280 L ha- 1) and the porosity of the soil probably played a role in P movement. Higher concentrations of available K were measured below the soil surface for all three of the K placements 28 days after application in 2004. Similar results were recorded in 2005 and 2006. At the time of the second sampling, K concentrations in treated plots were similar to those in control plots in all three years. Increased levels of available P and K in the root zone could benefit the plant throughout the early part of the growing season. Movement of P and K into the soil will also minimize potential losses by runoff and erosion...|$|R
