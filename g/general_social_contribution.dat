Critical of European austerity, he declared that he would defy the requirement to maintain a budget deficit under 3% of GDP and intended to strengthen intelligence services, require six months of civic service, and achieve gender equality. He also proposed €30 billion in spending to stimulate economic growth, lower the <b>general</b> <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) to increase individuals' purchasing power by €800 a year, create 5,000 new posts in hospitals, call a referendum on a new republic, promulgate a law on the separation of banking activities (as Hollande did), impose a European carbon tax, and establish a national anti-terrorism prosecutor.|$|E

Until recently, {{there was no}} wide taxation on social expenditure, contrary to most of its European partners. However, {{in order to find}} a solution to the problems of financing of the social security, governments have had to broaden its range of resources by the introduction of additional tax, notably the <b>general</b> <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) and the repayment of the debt of social security (CRDS) at a rate of 0.5%, to repay the debt of the ASSO.|$|E

50|$|In this context, the {{structure}} of the funding of the social security administrations has been more and more assured by taxes rather than social contributions. In particular, new taxes were levied to help fund the social security administrations, such as the <b>general</b> <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) and the contribution for the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). More recently, the central government has helped to fund the social security administrations by the revenues from the excise on alcohol and tobacco, in part to offset reductions in social contributions. As for the growth of the revenues for the benefit of local administrations, it is only due to the devolution, begun with the 1992 laws, and continued with the reforms in 2003.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{beneficiaries}} of the tax revenues: in 2007, social security administrations have received just over half; {{the state and the}} central government bodies near a third; the local administrations (APUL) nearly 13%; the European Union (EU) less than 1%.Direct and indirect taxes account for 62.8% of total revenues in 2007. State resources come almost entirely from taxes. The social security bodies are financed largely by social contributions but also by taxes, including the <b>general</b> <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) and the contribution for the repayement of the social debt (CRDS), which represented in 2007 a quarter of the funding of the Social Security administrations. Local administrations are mostly financed by the four main local direct taxes (housing tax, property taxes and business tax).|$|E
50|$|Established by the Finance Act 1991, the <b>general</b> <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) is payable by {{individuals}} living in France and who {{benefit from the}} compulsory health insurance. Revenues from the CSG are allocated to social security budget, specifically to the National Family Allowance, the Solidarity Fund pension schemes and insurance. Indeed, unlike the social contributions that give those who pay a right to benefit from them, the CSG, is levied without direct compensation (like any other tax). The CSG has a very broad base as it applies in principle to earnings and income from wealth. The CSG is composed of three separate contributions. Incomes from work are taxed at 7.5%. The rate applied to income from investments is 8.2%. It also applies to financial investment (with exceptions for certain untaxable products : Codevi, livret jeune, livret A, livret d'epargne populaire). In 2005, the revenue from the CSG amounted to €71.47 bn.|$|E
30|$|Public {{economics}} literature highlights two alternative {{definitions of}} the nature of <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> On the one hand, they can represent a deferred salary if the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and <b>social</b> benefits (pensions and unemployment benefits) is high. This is the case of pension systems with defined contributions. On the other hand, they might be considered a regular payroll tax (such as the labour income tax), if the tax-benefit link is weak, {{as is the case in}} many defined-benefit pay-as-you-go pension systems. In this paper we opt for an intermediate position, so <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> would be treated as a particular labour tax whose revenues are partially affected by social security financing. Therefore, we will concentrate on the labour market dynamics to analyse the incidence of <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and, in <b>general,</b> of labour taxes.|$|R
40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> or <b>general</b> taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment – unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> Other funding bases like income taxes and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups – and not just wage earners – they may be less detrimental to employment than <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the “progressivity ” of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.

50|$|Hollande's {{economic}} policies are wide-ranging, including supporting {{the creation of}} a European credit rating agency, the separation of lending and investment in banks, reducing the share of electricity generated by nuclear power in France from 75 to 50% in favour of renewable energy sources, merging income tax and the <b>General</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contribution</b> (CSG), creating an additional 45% for additional income of 150,000 euros, capping tax loopholes at a maximum of €10,000 per year, and questioning the relief solidarity tax on wealth (ISF, Impôt de Solidarité sur la Fortune) measure that should bring €29 billion in additional revenue. Hollande also signalled his intent to implement a 75% income tax rate on revenue earned above 1,000,000 euros per year, to generate the provision of development funds for deprived suburbs, and to return to a deficit of zero percent of GDP by 2017. The tax plan proved controversial, with courts ruling it unconstitutional in 2012, only to then take the opposite position on a redrafted version in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{the share}} of {{resources}} financing social protection has been changing. Traditionally, French social protection was financed by contributions rather than by taxes. Over the last three decades, {{there has been a}} reduction in the proportion of contributions (although still the primary source of funding) and an increase in funding from broader fiscal measures. In particular, revenue from the <b>General</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contribution</b> (CSG), created in 1991, has increased considerably to become the second most important fiscal stream in France (after VAT). This development has arisen from the need to finance social protection not only with deductions from earnings, but also from a broader base. It also helps distinguish the financing of benefits corresponding to national solidarity from those covered by insurance. France has thus come closer to the average European Union member's social protection financing structure, although it remains among the countries having the highest percentage of direct contributions relative to earnings.|$|E

Additional day-care services and related services for working mothers and families were introduced, and a new allowance for skilled baby-sitters (L'aide a la famille pour l'emploi d'une AFEAMA) was created in 1990 to promote the employment of skilled baby-minders, recognised by public authorities, through a reduction of insurance contributions and through tax incentives. A year earlier, in 1989, childminding expenses were made tax-deductible. Public housing for the poor was improved while the aged and handicapped received new benefits, and a new law was passed that allowed for the suspension of all civic rights (including voting or running for office) for anyone convicted of serious racist or anti-Semitic offences. The postal and telephone system was considerably reformed, together with the judicial professions. Key reforms were also adopted in the financing of political parties and campaigns, while other reforms were carried out in the penal code and in regulations that governed the terms of psychiatric internment.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that tax competition amongst EU member {{states has been}} mounting {{over the past two}} decades, and has become fiercer since the latest enlargement in 2004. The completion of monetary union is also likely to aggravate this tendency, by making other instruments of non-cooperative strategies, in particular currency devaluations, unavailable. France is particularly exposed to tax competition, because of its high overall tax pressure and the concentration of tax burden on the more mobile taxpayers (high-income earners, wealth holders and firms). This paper describes a tax reform proposal that has been designed with the objective of responding to tax competition. It is meant to preserve total tax revenues and leaving the after-tax income distribution unchanged compared to current one. It simplifies direct taxation by abolishing the personal wealth tax, merging personal income tax with the <b>general</b> <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> into a three-bracket general income tax, and alleviating corporate income taxation.
