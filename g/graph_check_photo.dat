40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} efficient algorithm, ILIGRA, for inverse line graph construction. Given a line graph H, ILIGRA constructs its root graph G with the time complexity being linear {{in the number of}} nodes in H. If ILIGRA does not know whether the given graph H is a line graph, it firstly assumes that H is a line graph and starts its root graph construction. During the root <b>graph</b> construction, ILIGRA <b>checks</b> whether the given graph H is a line graph and ILIGRA stops once it finds H is not a line graph. The time complexity of ILIGRA with line <b>graph</b> <b>checking</b> is linear in the number of links in the given graph H. For sparse line graphs of any size and for dense line graphs of small size, numerical results of the running time show that ILIGRA outperforms all currently available algorithms.

30|$|Given a {{knowledge}} graph and a fact (a triple statement), fact checking {{is to decide}} whether the fact belongs to the missing part of the graph. Facts in real-world knowledge bases are typically interpreted by both topological and semantic context that is not fully exploited by existing methods. This paper introduces a novel fact checking method that explicitly exploits discriminant subgraph structures. Our method discovers discriminant subgraphs associated with a set of training facts, characterized by a class of <b>graph</b> fact <b>checking</b> rules. These rules incorporate expressive subgraph patterns to jointly describe both topological and ontological constraints. (1) We extend <b>graph</b> fact <b>checking</b> rules (GFCs) to a class of ontological <b>graph</b> fact <b>checking</b> rules (OGFCs). OGFCs generalize GFCs by incorporating both topological constraints and ontological closeness to best distinguish between true and false fact statements. We provide quality measures to characterize useful patterns that are both discriminant and diversified. (2) Despite the increased expressiveness, we show that it is feasible to discover OGFCs in large graphs with ontologies, by developing a supervised pattern discovery algorithm. To find useful OGFCs as early as possible, it generates subgraph patterns relevant to training facts and dynamically selects patterns from a pattern stream with a small update cost per pattern. We verify that OGFCs can be used as rules and provide useful features for other statistical learning-based fact checking models. Using real-world knowledge bases, we experimentally verify the efficiency and the effectiveness of OGFC-based techniques for fact checking.|$|R
