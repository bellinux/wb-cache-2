25|$|The {{described}} system handles extremely well, {{as it is}} able {{to accommodate}} various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel will spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each <b>half-shaft,</b> power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheel slip.|$|E
2500|$|A spur-gear {{differential}} has two equal-sized spur gears, one {{for each}} <b>half-shaft,</b> with a space between them. Instead of the Bevel gear, {{also known as a}} miter gear, assembly (the [...] "spider") at the centre of the differential, there is a rotating carrier on the same axis as the two shafts. Torque from a [...] or transmission, such as the drive shaft of a car, rotates this carrier.|$|E
2500|$|By far {{the most}} {{significant}} change to the Mark IV was to the rear suspension, which was de-cambered and redesigned to incorporate what Triumph called a [...] "Swing Spring". With this system one leaf was eliminated from the stack and only the bottom leaf was attached rigidly to the differential. The remaining leafs were mounted such {{that they were able}} to pivot freely. With this change Triumph was able to eliminate the worst characteristics of the original swing-axle design. This was a different approach than that taken with the Triumph GT6 Mk II (GT6+) and Triumph Vitesse Mark 2, both of which received new lower wishbones and Rotoflex <b>half-shaft</b> couplings. In either case the result on all these cars was safe and progressive handling even at the limit.|$|E
50|$|Reduced {{unsprung}} weight {{compared to the}} Hotchkiss drive (live axle), since the differential and <b>half-shafts</b> {{are connected to the}} chassis.|$|R
5000|$|Upgrades to the {{drivetrain}} included heavier (24 millimeters versus 22mm stock) <b>half-shafts</b> and a Tochigi Fuji Sangyo KK Super limited-slip differential {{was part}} of the package.|$|R
50|$|The car uses a donor pack from a BMW 3 Series. The donor pack {{includes}} differential, <b>half-shafts,</b> brakes, {{steering column}} and lower steering shaft and if required, engine and gearbox. The chassis comes with BMW engine mounts already welded to the chassis to ease fitment.|$|R
50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} cars and trucks, the engine turns a {{driveshaft}} (also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle {{at the rear}} of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a live axle, but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one half-axle or <b>half-shaft</b> connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second <b>half-shaft</b> does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle.|$|E
50|$|A {{drive shaft}} {{connecting}} a rear differential to a rear wheel {{may be called}} a <b>half-shaft.</b> The name derives {{from the fact that}} two such shafts are required to form one rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{determining}} the anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether the suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and <b>half-shaft</b> driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} was by upper A-arms {{and lower}} lateral links triangulated by the anti-roll bar. Rear suspension was by tapering box-section trailing arms and lower lateral links. The <b>half-shafts</b> had {{no provision for}} plunge and handled some of the lateral forces. There were coil-over shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{driveline}} {{layout of}} the Eclipse is a transverse-mounted 4-cylinder Mitsubishi 4G37 or 4G63 engine situated on the left-hand {{side of the car}} driving an automatic or manual transmission on the right-hand side. AWD models have a different transmission which includes a limited-slip center differential and output shaft for a transfer case, which drives the rear differential (also available as limited-slip) and <b>half-shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car uses a donor pack from a BMW 3 Series. The donor pack {{includes}} differential, <b>half-shafts,</b> brakes, prop shaft, {{steering column}} and lower steering shaft and if required, engine and gearbox. The large engine bay helps accommodate most engines, including 2.0-litre Cosworth, BMW straight six and Rover V8. The chassis comes with BMW engine mounts already welded to the chassis to ease fitment.|$|R
5000|$|A spur-gear {{differential}} has two equal-sized spur gears, one {{for each}} <b>half-shaft,</b> with a space between them. Instead of the Bevel gear, {{also known as a}} miter gear, assembly (the [...] "spider") at the centre of the differential, there is a rotating carrier on the same axis as the two shafts. Torque from a prime mover or transmission, such as the drive shaft of a car, rotates this carrier.|$|E
50|$|In a drive suspension, the knuckle has no spindle, {{but rather}} has a hub into which is affixed the {{bearings}} and shaft {{of the drive}} mechanism. The end of the drive mechanism would then have the necessary mounting studs for the wheel/tire and/or brake assembly. Therefore, the wheel assembly would rotate as the drive shaft (or <b>half-shaft)</b> dictates. It would not turn freely by itself, {{but only if the}} shaft was disengaged from the transaxle or differential.|$|E
50|$|A {{connection}} {{from the}} ring gear to each wheel's <b>half-shaft</b> is made by left and right side clutches. Each drive clutch consists of three elements: an electromagnetic coil, a ball-cam device, {{and a set of}} 19 wet clutch plates which are similar in design to clutches used in an automatic transmission. Ten of the plates are splined (mechanically connected) to {{the ring gear}} while nine of the plates are splined to a half shaft. Left and right clutches are identical.|$|E
5000|$|Increased weight â€” The {{components}} of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle's power train are less complex, but they are larger. The driveshaft adds weight. There is extra sheet metal to form the transmission tunnel. There is a rear axle or rear <b>half-shafts,</b> which are typically longer than those in a front-wheel-drive car. A rear-wheel-drive car will weigh slightly more than a comparable front-wheel-drive car (but less than four-wheel drive).|$|R
25|$|Remnants of the {{old church}} were {{incorporated}} in the new. The arch of the original Saxon south door was reset in the north wall, surrounding a 13th-century grave-slab. The jambs and arch are undecorated and unmoulded, but outside these are three <b>half-shafts</b> and half-rolls, above which are plain slabs as capitals. Above the door is a stone bearing the date 1635, when the old church was restored, {{and the names of}} the two then churchwardens.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} linear and non-linear driveline {{models for}} Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) {{in order to}} evaluate the main parameters for optimal tuning, when considering the drivability. The implemented models consider the linear and non-linear driveline dynamics, including {{the effect of the}} engine inertia, the clutch damper, the driveshaft, the <b>half-shafts</b> and the tires. Sensitivity analyses are carried out for each driveline component during tip-in maneuvers. The paper also analyses the overall frequency response using Bode diagrams and natural frequencies...|$|R
50|$|The giubo is {{believed}} first {{to have been}} used for this purpose on the Alfa Romeo model 1900, produced between 1950 and 1959. As used on several British cars, such as the Hillman Imp, Triumph GT6 MKII/GT6+, Lotus Elan and some early versions of the Land Rover Discovery, the item is known as a Rotoflex coupling.. The Porsche 917 used a Giubo centered on the rear <b>half-shaft,</b> but in a manner that did not require the joint to laterally flex.|$|E
50|$|Andretti ran {{his first}} night race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, the first {{race of the}} 2008 season, with a 2nd-place finish behind Scott Dixon. He also led the most laps of the race - leading 85 - and {{received}} an additional three points. At St. Petersburg, Andretti snapped a <b>half-shaft</b> on his car trying to leave the pits, causing him to retire. In the third race of the season at Motegi, Japan, Andretti spun out on the first lap of the race. At the 2008 Indianapolis 500, Andretti finished third, after leading several laps. During the race, he passed teammate, Tony Kanaan, who then crashed into the wall, blaming Andretti.|$|E
50|$|Dale Coyne and {{his team}} built their new {{proprietary}} chassis, the DC-1, for 1986 but results did not substantially improve. The car missed the field in its first attempt at Phoenix and caught on fire in pit lane at Long Beach. It wasn't until September that the car managed to finish a race, with Coyne bringing home a 12th-place finish at Sanair Super Speedway. Coyne was earlier credited with 12th place at Cleveland {{even though he was}} taken out of the race by a broken <b>half-shaft.</b> The 2 points that he earned for these races would be the most he would earn in a season in his career and he was credited with 34th place in the championship standings.|$|E
5000|$|This four-wheel {{steering}} mechanism was integrated with Muehl limited-slip differentials {{on both the}} front and rear axles; these solid axles had very high ground clearance as well, as engine power was transmitted to the four wheels from the dual differentials through rotating <b>half-shafts</b> that were positioned parallel to but above the load-bearing [...] "dead" [...] axles. This combination of innovative features constituted a revolutionary approach to four-wheel drive and allowed the Quad to traverse soft or muddy conditions with unprecedented effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|On the road, it {{can drive}} up to 70 mph with normal traffic. The Transition Production Prototype's folded {{dimensions}} of 6 ft high, 7 ft wide and 18 ft long are designed to fit within a standard household garage. When operated as a car, the engine power take-off near the propeller engages a variable-diameter pulley CVT automatic transmission to send power to the trailing-suspension mounted rear wheels via <b>half-shafts</b> powering belt drives. In flight, the engine drives a pusher propeller. The Transition has folding wings and a twin tail.|$|R
25|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. The sun gears (which drive the axle <b>half-shafts)</b> will rotate at different speeds relative to the ring gear (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the left wheel making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|R
50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length <b>half-shaft</b> {{universal}}ly jointed at each end. The universal joints act as {{inner and outer}} pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at {{the output of the}} differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined stub axle (for knock-off wheels) or a stub axle and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|E
5000|$|Cogan was {{involved}} in the start of the race incident with Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt. Foyt was able to re-start the race after the red flag, but Andretti, a crowd favorite, was unable to repair his Patrick Wildcat Mk8B #40 in time. It has been suggested that Cogan broke a <b>half-shaft</b> under the force of acceleration due to the slower than normal start. [...] Two other cars driven by Dale Whittington and Roger Mears farther back in the pack also collided and were out of the race. Cogan was blamed for the accident that eliminated four cars from the 1982 Indy 500 and Kevinâ€™s racing career never recovered from this incident.|$|E
5000|$|In fact, Joel Finn {{states in}} his book [...] "Maserati Birdcage" [...] Published by Osprey in 1980 that by 1962: [...] "Engine swaps began to become common {{in an effort to}} make them faster, but these were usually {{failures}} because it caused transaxle and <b>half-shaft</b> breakages. None of this caused engine swap proponents to abandon trying, but did lead to the destruction of a number of Birdcages. Either that or they were modified so greatly that it would be very difficult to ever put them back to original again." [...] Finn also states that the only reason the Birdcages came back were because they became desirable cars in vintage racing in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|The chassis {{and rear}} {{suspension}} were redesigned, with an upper link added {{at the rear}} to alleviate strain on the <b>half-shafts.</b> The brakes were also improved. Giugiaro designed an aerodynamic body kit for the car, with a rear lip spoiler, prominent louvered rear hatch, more substantial bumpers, a deeper front airdam, and air ducts in the sills {{just ahead of the}} new three-piece 15" [...] Compomotive rear wheels. Inside scarlet leather combined with a roof-mounted Panasonic stereo for a dramatic environment. 45 Essex Esprits were built, interspersed and followed by a number of non-Essex-liveried but otherwise identical specification dry sump turbo cars.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} literature discusses {{traction control}} system designs for electric vehicles. In general, the proposed control structures do not include consideration of the actuation dynamics, which are especially important for vehicles with on-board drivetrains, usually characterized by significant torsional dynamics of the <b>half-shafts.</b> This paper compares {{the performance of a}} selection of traction controllers from the literature, with that of PID and âˆž control structures specifically designed for on-board electric drivetrains. The analysis in the frequency domain and the simulation results in the time domain show the significant performance improvement provided by the control system designs considering the actuation dynamics...|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} of redecoration and repair {{of the church}} {{interior}} and churchyard occurred during Digby Walshâ€™s tenure as vicar, i.e. sometime between 1858-1869, with a second taking place in 1884. Records are unclear about the intervening period, but the church was again redecorated completely in 1967-8, {{and as part of}} the redecoration the <b>half-shafts</b> of the pillars on the walls were removed, apart from at the far east and west ends of the church. In 2009 the church was repaired and redecorated internally, with the colour scheme changing from blues and stone colours to reds, pinks, white and gold.|$|R
5000|$|This second-generation Type 2 {{lost its}} {{distinctive}} split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are Breadloaf and Bay-window, or Loaf and Bay for short. At 1.6 L and [...] DIN, {{the engine was}} also slightly larger. The battery and electrical system was upgraded to 12 volts, making it incompatible with electric accessories from the previous generation. The new model also did away with the swing axle rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height. Instead, <b>half-shaft</b> axles fitted with constant velocity joints raised ride height without the wild changes in camber of the Beetle-based swing axle suspension. The updated Bus transaxle is usually sought after by off-road racers using air-cooled Volkswagen components.|$|E

50|$|The FX3B {{was used}} for the first three races of the 1973 season, and had been driven by New Zealander Howden Ganley and Italian Nanni Galli, {{although}} Jackie Pretorius had filled in at the South African Grand Prix when Galli was injured. The new IR appeared at the fourth race of the season, the Spanish Grand Prix, with Ganley and the returning Galli at the wheel. Qualifying on the last two rows of the grid, the Italian finished 11th while Ganley retired when he ran out of fuel. Both drivers retired in Belgium, through an engine failure for Galli and an accident for Ganley when his throttle stuck. Both drivers retired with <b>half-shaft</b> failures at the Monaco Grand Prix, although Ganley had qualified tenth fastest, and after the race Galli left the team and announced his retirement from Formula One.|$|E
50|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the input}} shaft (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn runs on the ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to <b>half-shafts</b> inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential is enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel.|$|R
50|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel.

5000|$|Due to {{geometry}} and packaging constraints, the CV joints (constant-velocity joints) {{attached to the}} wheel hub {{have a tendency to}} wear out much earlier than the universal joints typically used in their rear-wheel-drive counterparts (although rear-wheel-drive vehicles with independent rear suspension also employ CV joints and <b>half-shafts).</b> The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
