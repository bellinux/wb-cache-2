5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from <b>fenestrated</b> capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{surgical}} {{techniques are}} recommended to perform cholecystectomy safely in difficult cases, such as conversion to open operation or subtotal cholecystectomy (STC). Reconstituting and <b>fenestrating</b> STC are 2 techniques for STC. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the short and long-term morbidity and quality of life associated with STC and to compare the outcomes after reconstituting and <b>fenestrating</b> STC. STUDY DESIGN: Patients who underwent STC were identified. Short-term morbidity assessed included bile leakage, bile duct injury, intra-abdominal infection, reinterventions, and readmittance. Long-term morbidity included bile duct stenosis and recurrent biliary events. Differences in the outcomes of <b>fenestrating</b> and reconstituting STC were assessed. Quality of life was assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimensions, Short-Form 36 Questionnaire, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index questionnaires. RESULTS: Subtotal cholecystectomy was performed in 191 patients, of which 102 (53 %) underwent <b>fenestrating</b> STC and 73 (38 %) underwent reconstituting STC. Bile leakage was significantly more common after <b>fenestrating</b> STC (18 % vs 7 %, respectively; p < 0. 022). After a median of 6 years follow-up (interquartile range 5 to 10 years), recurrence rate of biliary events was lower after <b>fenestrating</b> than reconstituting STC (9 % vs 18 %, respectively; p < 0. 022). Overall reintervention rate did not differ between the 2 groups: 32 % in the <b>fenestrating</b> STC group and 26 % in the reconstituting STC group (p = 0. 211). Completion cholecystectomy was performed significantly more in patients after <b>fenestrating</b> STC (9 % vs 4 %; p < 0. 022). CONCLUSIONS: Subtotal cholecystectomy is a safe and feasible technique for difficult cases for which conversion only will not solve the difficulty of an inflamed hepatocystic triangle. The choice for reconstituting or <b>fenestrating</b> STC depends on intraoperative conditions and both techniques are associated with specific complications...|$|R

25|$|Given {{that the}} subcommissural organ is not highly {{permeable}} {{and does not}} possess <b>fenestrated</b> capillaries like other subventricular organs, it {{has emerged as a}} major site of congenital hydrocephalus. It is suggested that this is related to immunological blockage of SCO secretions and Sylvian's aqueduct malformation and obliteration or turbulent cerebrospinal fluid flow due to the absence of Reissner's fibers. There is evidence that in transgenic mice the overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal midline of the diencephalon in a dose-dependent manner and that the conditional inactivation of presenilin-1 or the lack of huntingtin in wnt cell lineages leads to congenital hydrocephalus, which highlights the role of these proteins mediating the relation between the SCO and the condition. A more recent study using HTx rats reinforced the idea that the abnormal and dysfunction of the SCO precedes the development of the hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|In the Haeckel’s work, Collodaria {{was named}} {{the first order of}} Radiolaria, and defined as “Spumellaria without {{latticed}} shell.” This definition of Collodaria was further expanded to include organisms that either completely lack the skeleton or have numerous spicules that loosely scatter throughout the calymma around the central capsule. In recent literature, the definition of Collodaria has been altered with molecular phylogenetic characteristics. In Haeckel’s phylogeny, the second order in Radiolaria, Sphaerellaria, includes all Radiolaria with any trace of latticed or <b>fenestrated</b> shell. In the last decade, Radiolarians are reclassified in five taxonomic orders as characterized by the composition and morphology of the mineral skeletons which include Acantharia with strontium sulphate skeleton, Taxopodida with silica skeleton, Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria with polycystine silica skeleton. Hence, in the current classification Collodaria now has four sister orders instead of having one sister order as in Haeckel’s original tree. Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria are sometimes called the Polycystines for their shared skeleton composition character.|$|E
25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with <b>fenestrated</b> openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E

5000|$|Bryozoans {{have contributed}} to {{carbonate}} sedimentation in marine life since the Ordovician period. Bryozoans take responsibility {{for many of the}} colony forms, which have evolved in different taxonomic groups and vary in sediment producing ability. The nine basic bryozoan colony-forms include: encrusting, dome-shaped, palmate, foliose, <b>fenestrate,</b> robust branching, delicate branching, articulated and free-living. Most of these sediments come from two distinct groups of colonies: domal, delicate branching, robust branching and palmate; and <b>fenestrate.</b> <b>Fenestrate</b> colonies generate rough particles both as sediment and components of stomatoporiods coral reefs. The delicate colonies however, create both coarse sediment and form the cores of deep-water, subphotic biogenic mounds. Nearly all post- bryozoan sediments are made up of growth forms, with the addition to free-living colonies which include significant numbers of various colonies. “In contrast to the Palaeozoic, post-Palaeozoic bryozoans generated sediment varying more widely with the size of their grains; they grow as they moved from mud, to sand, to gravel.” ...|$|R
40|$|Massive calcium {{carbonate}} mud mounds are present within the St. Joe Limestone (Lower Mis-sissippian) of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas. These lenticles {{are up to}} 30 feet thick and 300 feet long. Thln-bedded crinoldal imestones enclose the bioherms. The enclosing lime-stones onlap the bioherms and by successive overlap extend over the mounds. Point-count analyses of thin sections from nine localities were made. The bioherms consist mainly of calcite-mudstone (about 80 percent) with {{only a small percentage}} (approximately 13 percent) of skeletal remains and 5 per-cent sparry calcite. <b>Fenestrate</b> bryozoans are the most abundant skeletal constituents, making up about 8 percent of the rock. Echinoderm fragments comprise only 2 percent of the mounds. Other known skeletal components are present in a total amount generally less than. 3 percent. The interbiohermal beds contain 47 percent skeletal grains including 13 percent <b>fenestrate</b> bryozoans and 25 percent echinoderm remains, 51 percent calcite mud and about 1 percent sparry calcite. The most acceptable hypotheses for the origin of the bioherms are: (1) the interaction of physical environmental f ctors and bathymetry; (2) the sedlment-trapping and-stabilizing activities of <b>fenestrate</b> bryozoans, and; (3) the sediment-trapping and-stabilizing activities of plants, not preserved. Although none of the three hypotheses can be completely rejected, it is possible that <b>fenestrate</b> bryozoans alone may have caused the growth and accumulation of these Missouri bloherms. It is also possible that the bryo-zoans were at least assisted by plants of which there are no preserved remains...|$|R

500|$|Rudder, stern-mounted and {{vertical}} axial: Lawrence V. Mott, who defines a steering oar as a rudder, states the ancient Egyptian use of stern-mounted rudders {{can be traced}} back to the 6th dynasty (2350–2200 BC). Mott states that the method of attachment for rudders in the Arab, Chinese, and European worlds differed from each other, leading him to doubt the spread of the Chinese system of attachment by socket-and-jaws or block and tackle (versus European pintle-and-gudgeon invented by c. 1180 AD). In regards to Mott's definition of a steering oar as a rudder, Joseph Needham, Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes, K.S. Tom, Chung Chee Kit, S.A.M. Adshead, Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that a steering oar is not a rudder; the steering oar has the capacity to interfere with handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its helmsman, was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in China. Leo Block writes of the use of the steering oar in the ancient Mediterranean world (specifically in regards to the Phoenicians, 1550–300 BC): [...] "A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a break." [...] The oldest depicted rudders at the back of a ship, without the use of oars or a steering oar, comes from several ceramic models of Chinese ships made during both the Western and Eastern eras of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). According to the scholars Zhang Zunyan and Vassilios Christides, there is literary evidence to suggest that the axial stern rudder existed in China since the 1st century BC, while Gang Deng asserts the first reference was made in the Huainanzi of the 2nd century BC, and K.S. Tom says the first clear reference dates to the 5th century AD. However, K.S. Tom points to the fact that all Chinese pottery models of ships before this Guangzhou tomb model show steering oars instead of a rudder, which he states is strong evidence for the rudder's invention only by the 1st century AD. Jacques Gernet states that while the Chinese had invented the rudder in the 1st century AD, it was not completely fixed to the sternpost of Chinese ships until the end of the 4th century. The bulkhead ship design of the junk, which appeared roughly the same time as the rudder, provided the essential vertical components for the hinged axial rudder. Deng points out that an Eastern Han (25–220) model distinctly shows a rudder located in its own separate cabin, suggesting that helmsmanship had already become an established profession. Following the invention of the balanced rudder pivoted on an axis, Tom and Deng state that the Chinese then innovated the <b>fenestrated</b> rudder by the Song Dynasty (960–1279), with deliberate puncturing and boring out of holes in shapes such as diamonds, which, according to Tom, made the rudder [...] "easier to steer, reduced turbulence drag, did not affect efficiency and was hydrodynamically sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peptide hormones have {{important}} influences upon the hypothalamus, {{and to do}} so they must pass through the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is <b>fenestrated</b> to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. [...] Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.|$|E

We had dined together and we went there because we thought that with a fitful moon and clouds adrift, on a night when the air was a crystal air that gladdened and brightened, that crescent of great buildings and steely, soft-hurrying water must needs be altogether beautiful.
