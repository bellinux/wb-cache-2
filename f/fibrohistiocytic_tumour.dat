40|$|Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumours {{are very}} rare, {{apparently}} benign neoplasms of the superficial soft tissue: only two series and one case report {{have been described}} in the literature. Macroscopically located within the dermis or superficial subcutis, they seem to predominate in the upper limbs of children and young adults. Moreover their reccurrence rate is relatively high. We report {{the case of a}} 56 year old male patient presenting such a plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumour</b> of the hand, which was surgically excised after a progressive clinical evolution of approximately 5 years and in which no recurrence has been observed with a follow-up of more than 24 months. © 1994 Société d'Édition de l'Association d'Enseignement Médical des Hôpitaux de Paris.

40|$|We {{report a}} unique {{case of a}} 4 -year-old girl with an {{intriguing}} <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumour.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a dural mass of variegated intensity compressing the left occipital pole and apparently extending toward the superior sagittal sinus. Grossly, the cut surface of the surgical specimen was yellow, pale, and soft with reddish kernel-like crusts. Histologically, the yellow areas resembled cholesterol granulomas with widespread coagulative necrosis, cholesterol clefts, powdery calcification, foreign body-type giant cells, and foamy macrophages, while the scattered red spots contained numerous multinucleated giant cells of foreign-body and Touton types, the former with amphophilic to slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase reactions confirmed the expression of histiocytic markers and vimentin. As far as we know, no tumour displaying these peculiar morphological features has yet been described...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 85 {{spontaneous}} rat <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumours</b> were evaluated histologically and assessed {{for the presence}} or absence of metastases. The overall incidence in controls from 2 -year carcinogenicity studies was 2. 7 %.

Four histological types were recognized: histiocytic (17 %), pleomorphic (33 %), cellular (17 %) and very fibrous (33 %). Histiocytic tumours were highly malignant, and most produced metastases. Pleomorphic and cellular neoplasms occasionally produced metastases and must be regarded as potentially malignant. Very fibrous lesions were essentially benign.

40|$|AIMS: Cutaneous benign <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumours</b> {{are among}} the most common soft tissue lesions. Their {{biological}} nature, in particular whether they are neoplastic or reactive, has long been disputed. Some morphological subtypes can be confused with sarcoma. Since available karyotypic data in these lesions are scarce, this study was undertaken to determine whether their cytogenetic analysis might demonstrate clonality and might help in differential diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen karyotyped benign cutaneous fibrous histiocytomas (BFH) were morphologically reassessed and classified as ordinary BFH (eight cases), cellular BFH (four cases), and one ankle-type lesion. Five cases (38 %) showed clonal cytogenetic changes, although the aberrations varied and did not correlate with histological subtypes. Karyotypic aberrations were more common in cellular BFH (3 / 4) than in the ordinary BFH (2 / 8). CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of clonal chromosome abnormalities, in at least some cases, supports the neoplastic nature of cutaneous BFH. The karyotypic changes identified are different from those in dermatofibrosarcoma, with which cellular BFH is often confused histologically. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} reliability of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in distinguishing benign and malignant lesions in the retroperitoneum and correlate the diagnosis by cytology of retroperitoneal masses with the results obtained by histology. The clinicopathological study {{was carried out in}} 50 patients presenting with retroperitoneal masses on ultrasonography. Fine needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance of these masses was performed by 20 - 22 G needle after thorough clinical examination. Malignant lesion constituted the maximum number of cases- 31 (62 %) followed by benign and inflammatory lesion- 16 cases (32 %). Eleven cases out of 23 renal masses were Wilm’s tumour, 4 were renal cell carcinoma and there was a single case of angiomyolipoma of kidney. Out of 20 cases with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy 12 cases (60 %) were inflammatory, mainly tuberculosis and 8 (40 %) had malignancy. Out of the 7 cases of miscellaneous retroperitoneal masses, 3 were <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumour</b> and 2 were myxoid liposarcoma.

40|$|The {{distributions}} of laminin, fibronectin, and interstitial collagen type III {{have been investigated}} {{in a series of}} 60 soft tissue tumours by immunochemistry. Positive laminin staining was seen in sites predicted by the distribution of ultrastructurally visible basal lamina. Pericellular laminin was present in all benign tumours of Schwann cell and smooth muscle origin examined, in the two malignant Schwannomas examined, and in six of 13 leiomyosarcomas. It was also evident around nests of cells in an alveolar soft part sarcoma and around malignant endothelial cells in an angiosarcoma. In fibroblastic and <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumours</b> it was found only in blood vessel walls. The results of laminin staining led to revision of the original histopathological diagnosis in seven of the 60 cases studied. Fibronectin was abundant in the stroma of most neoplasms, both benign and malignant. It was also found in a distribution parallel to that of laminin. In some tumours this was clearly distinguishable from the distribution of interstitial collagen. Intracellular fibronectin was shown consistently only in mast cell granules. Its demonstration in synovial cells, fibroblasts, and histiocytes was more variable. Interstitial collagen type II had the most irregular distribution of the three proteins. It was as plentiful in tumours of smooth muscle origin as in tumours of fibroblastic origin, but was scanty in fibrous histiocytomas. Its distribution appeared similar to that of laminin and fibronectin in leiomyomas, but differed from these two proteins in Schwann cell tumours and other neoplasms. In one leiomyosarcoma fibronectin, laminin, and type III collagen appeared to be lost concomitantly from tumour cell peripheries...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Soft tissue tumours (STT) {{are defined}} {{traditionally}} as mesenchymal proliferations {{that occur in}} the extra-. skeletal nonepithelial tissues of the body excluding viscera, meninges and lymphoreticular system. These tumours occur in children where they may result in severe debilitating disease. This study was therefore aimed at determining the age, gender and site distribution of soft tissue tumours in the young. Materials and Methods: The records of all pathology consultations during the 20 year period from (1990 - 2010), from the Department of Morbid Anatomy/Histopathology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital from birth to 20 years, were utilized for this study. The lesions were standardized in accordance with the world health organization (WHO) classification. Permission for this study was obtained from the UBTH ethics committee (protocol number ADM/E 22 /A/VOL. VII/ 142). Results: A total of 139 lesions were recorded, 72 males and 67 females with a male/female ratio of 1. 1 : 1. Benign tumours constituted 113 (81 %) while malignant tumours accounted for 26 (19 %). This study demonstrated that, nerve sheath tumours and vascular tumours accounted for 25 % of STT in children followed by adipocytic tumours 22 %, skeletal muscle <b>tumours</b> 17 %, <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumours</b> 7 %, fibroblastic tumours 5 %, and perivascular tumours 1 % respectively. Majority of these tumours were located in the head and lower extremities with fewer in the upper extremities and trunk. These lesions were predominant in females of the older age group (10 - 20 years) unlike in their male counterparts. Conclusion: This study has shown that benign soft tissue tumours are more prevalent than the malignant varieties in juveniles...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -A {{total of}} 85 {{spontaneous}} rat <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumours</b> were evaluated histologically and assessed {{for the presence}} or absence of metastases. The overall incidence in controls from 2 -year carcinogenicity studies was 2. 7 %. The tumours occurred principally in the subcutaneous and deep soft tissues, and generally appeared after 18 months of age. Four histological types were recognized: histiocytic (17 %), pleomorphic (330 /), cellular (17 %) and very fibrous (33 % 0). Histiocytic tumours were highly malignant, and most produced metastases. Pleomorphic and cellular neoplasms occasionally produced metastases and must be regarded as potentially malignant. Very fibrous lesions were essentially benign. The close resemblance, both histologically and biologically, between rat and human fibrohistiocytic neoplasms supports the use of the fibrohistiocytic concept in laboratory-animal pathology. Study of these rat tumours may provide insight into the development of human fibrohistiocytic neoplasms. THE OCCURRENCE of fibrous histiocytic neoplasms in human soft tissues has become widely recognized since the early sixties, when the late Arthur Purdy Stout introduced the concept of malignant fibrous tumours differing from the conventional fibrosarcoma (O'Brian & Stout, 1964). The term "fibrous histiocytoma" now embraces entities formerly referred to variously as sclerosing angioma, dermatofibroma and fibrous xanthoma, thus reflecting the different theories of histogenesis of these neoplasms (Mackenzie, 1975). Both benign and malignant forms exist, the latter being less common (Weiss & Enzinger, 1978). Their spectrum of histological appearances has been found useful in characterizing their behaviour (Soule & Enriquez, 1972) and this provides the stimulus for the use of the term for rodent tumours. Only passing reference to the existence of these neoplasms in rats can be found in the literature: it has been stated that they occur in control rat...|$|R
