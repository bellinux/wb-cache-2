40|$|Due to {{its highly}} autonomy, the strapdown {{inertial}} navigation system (SINS) is widely used in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) navigation. Initial alignment is crucial because the initial alignment results {{will be used as}} the initial SINS value, which might affect the subsequent SINS results. Due to the rapid convergence of Earth meridians, there is a calculation overflow in conventional initial alignment algorithms, making conventional initial algorithms are invalid for polar UUV navigation. To overcome these problems, a polar initial alignment algorithm for UUV is proposed in this paper, which consists of coarse and fine alignment algorithms. Based on the principle of the conical slow drift of gravity, the coarse alignment algorithm is derived under the <b>grid</b> <b>frame.</b> By choosing the velocity and attitude as the measurement, the fine alignment with the Kalman filter (KF) is derived under the <b>grid</b> <b>frame.</b> Simulation and experiment are realized among polar, conventional and transversal initial alignment algorithms for polar UUV navigation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} telerobotics simulation {{is described}} suitable for studying human operator (HO) performance. Simple manipulator pick-and-place and tracking tasks allowed quantitative comparison {{of a number}} of calligraphic display viewing conditions.

This was true especially if geometrical display parameters such as azimuth and elevation were arranged to be near optimal. Quantitative comparisons were made possible, utilizing control performance measures such as root mean square error. There was a distinct preference for controlling the manipulator in end-effector Cartesian space for the primitive pick-and-place task, rather than controlling joint angles and then, via direct kinematis, the end-effector position. An introduced communication delay was found to produce decrease in performance. In considerable part, this difficulty could be compensated for by preview control information. The fact that neurological control of normal human movement contains a sampled data period of 0. 2 s may relate to this robustness of HO control to delay...|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} {{unavailability}} {{of a traditional}} strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in the polar region, a polar grid navigation algorithm for UUVs is proposed in this paper. Precise navigation {{is the basis for}} UUVs to complete missions. The rapid convergence of Earth meridians and the serious polar environment make it difficult to establish the true heading of the UUV at a particular instant. Traditional SINS and traditional representation of position are not suitable in the polar region. Due to the restrictions of the complex underwater conditions in the polar region, a SINS based on the <b>grid</b> <b>frame</b> {{with the assistance of the}} OCTANS and the Doppler velocity log (DVL) is chosen for a UUV navigating in the polar region. Data fusion of the integrated navigation system is realized by a modified fuzzy adaptive Kalman filter (MFAKF). By neglecting the negative terms, and using T-S fuzzy logic in the adaptive regulation of the noise covariance, the proposed filter algorithm can improve navigation accuracy. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the polar grid navigation algorithm can effectively navigate a UUV sailing in the polar region...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{behaviour}} {{of insect}} vectors {{has an important}} bearing on the epidemiology of the diseases they transmit, and on the opportunities for vector control. Two sorts of electrocuting device have been particularly useful for studying the behaviour of tsetse flies (Glossina spp), the vectors of the trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. Such devices consist of grids on netting (E-net) to catch tsetse in flight, or on cloth (E-cloth) to catch alighting flies. Catches are most meaningful when the devices catch {{as many as possible}} of the flies potentially available to them, and when the proportion caught is known. There have been conflicting indications for the catching efficiency, depending on whether the assessments were made by the naked eye or assisted by video recordings. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using grids of 0. 5 m 2 in Zimbabwe, we developed catch methods of studying the efficiency of E-nets and E-cloth for tsetse, using improved transformers to supply the grids with electrical pulses of 40 kV. At energies per pulse of 35 – 215 mJ, the efficiency was enhanced by reducing the pulse interval from 3200 to 1 ms. Efficiency was low at 35 mJ per pulse, but there seemed no benefit of increasing the energy beyond 70 mJ. Catches at E-nets declined when the fine netting normally used became either coarser or much finer, and increased when the <b>grid</b> <b>frame</b> was moved from 2. 5 cm to 27. 5 cm from the grid. Data for muscoids and tabanids were roughly comparable to those for tsetse. Conclusion/Significance: The catch method of studying efficiency is useful for supplementing and extending video methods.

40|$|Past {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that thermal dissociation analysis of nucleic acids hybridized to DNA microarrays would improve discrimination among duplex types by scanning through a broad range of stringency conditions. To more fully constrain the utility of this approach using a previously described gel-pad microarray format, artificial neural networks (NNs) were trained to recognize noisy or low-quality data, as might derive from nonspecific fluorescence, poor hybridization, or compromised data collection. The NNs were trained to classify dissociation profiles (melts) into groups based on selected characteristics (e. g., initial signal intensity, area under the curve) using a data set of 21, 044 profiles derived from 186 probes hybridized to a study set of RNA extracted from 32 microbes common to the human oral cavity. Three melt profile groups were identified: one group consisted mostly of ideal melt profiles; another group consisted mostly of poor melt profiles; and, the remainder were difficult to classify. Screening of melting profiles of perfect-match hybrids revealed inconsistencies in the form of melting profiles even for identical probes on the same microarray hybridized to same target rRNA. Approximately 18 % of perfect-match duplex types were correctly classified as poor. Experimental variability and deviation from ideal melt behavior were shown to be attributable primarily to a method of local background subtraction that was very sensitive to displacement of the <b>grid</b> <b>frames</b> used for image capture (both determined by the image analysis system) and duplexes with low binding constants. Additional results showed that long RNA fragments limit the discriminating power among duplex types...|$|R
