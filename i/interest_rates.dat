5|$|As of January 2014, {{and since}} the {{introduction}} of the euro, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of most members countries (particularly those with a weak currency), have decreased.

5|$|The {{effect of}} declining <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> {{combined}} with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E

5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E

Such high <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth.

50|$|To hedge {{costs on}} the sale of {{variable}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> bonds, which can rise and fall with the market, local governments, such as Baltimore, purchased <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps which exchange a variable <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for a fixed <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> In a swap deal, when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> rises, the swap seller pays the local government the increased cost on the bond, while when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> falls, the swap seller saves and pays the local government the decreased cost on the bond. The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swap mechanism generally works well, however, between 2007 and 2010 the payments to local governments on their swaps artificially decreased but the cost on their bonds remained at actual market rates. This was because most <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps are linked to the Libor <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> while municipal bond rates are linked to the SIFMA Municipal Bond Index <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> During the financial crisis the two benchmark rates decoupled.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> often they will become much lower than <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

5|$|The ECB targets <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{rather than}} {{exchange}} rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets.
