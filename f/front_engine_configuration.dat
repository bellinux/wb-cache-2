25|$|The Lancia Aurelia {{introduced}} the <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> rear transmission <b>configuration</b> later used by Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Porsche, GM, and Maserati, {{as well as}} the V6 engine, which is now common. It also had inboard rear brakes, an important way of reducing un-sprung weight.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{was designed for}} commercial usage, so it used a simple leaf spring setup and wasn't intended for ride quality. Low cost, light weight, and a flat, low loading floor were the main consideration. The AD van was designed for very basic duties, and the options list was kept small to enhance economical use and running costs. The AD van used a <b>front</b> wheel drive <b>engine</b> <b>configuration</b> shared with the Sunny. The AD Van was marketed as the Nissan Sunny in some European markets such as Belgium (glazed five-door), beginning with the 1984 model year. In the Netherlands this version was sold as a [...] "Stationwagen" [...] {{as well as a}} van, both with the 1.3-liter engine. The United Kingdom received three three-door panel van version with the 1.3-litre E13 engine and [...] Payload is 1113 lb.|$|R
50|$|The crash {{displayed}} the F.32's most notable problem; it was underpowered, {{which was made}} worse by the aircraft's back-to-back <b>engine</b> <b>configuration,</b> with an <b>engine</b> on {{each end of the}} underwing nacelles. The <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> powered a two-bladed propeller and the rear engine a three-bladed one. The after propellers, working in the disturbed air from the front, were inefficient, and the rear engines suffered from cooling problems. The underpowering problem was partially solved by replacing the prototype's Pratt & Whitney Wasp engines with more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-1860 Hornet Bs on later planes, but the other issues remained with the planes throughout their short service lives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Front</b> mounted {{longitudinal}} <b>engines</b> with {{rear-wheel drive}} (FR) {{is a common}} layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted <b>front</b> mounted <b>engines</b> with front-wheel drive (FF) and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while {{more expensive than the}} FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and other <b>engine</b> <b>configurations</b> with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, Fiat {{released}} the <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> Fiat 500 economy car {{to meet the}} demands of the post-war market. It had a 2-door coupe body with sun-roof, which was later complemented by an Estate version. Both continued until 1954 when they were replaced by an all-new, lighter car. The new car had a rear-mounted engine, on the pattern of the Volkswagen Beetle, just like its bigger brother the 1955 Fiat 600. Several car makers followed the now uncommon rear <b>engine</b> <b>configuration</b> at the time and were quite successful. The Neckar version of the 500 was manufactured in Heilbronn under a complicated deal involving NSU, and was introduced in October 1961. [...] Steyr-Puch produced cars based on the Fiat 500 under license in Graz, Austria.|$|R

40|$|Engine {{airframe}} integration {{effects are}} investigated for supersonic through-flow fan engines installed on a Mach 3. 20 supersonic cruise vehicle.

40|$|Proper engine {{selection}} for Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs) {{is a key}} factor in the design of low cost reusable launch systems for routine access to space. RLVs typically use combinations of different types of engines used in sequence over the duration of the flight. Also, in order to properly choose which engines are best for an RLV design concept and mission, the optimal trajectory that maximizes or minimizes the mission objective must be found for that <b>engine</b> <b>configuration.</b> Typically this is done by the designer iteratively choosing engine combinations based on his/her judgment and running each individual combination through a full trajectory optimization to find out how well the <b>engine</b> <b>configuration</b> performed on board the desired RLV design. This thesis presents a new method to reliably predict the optimal <b>engine</b> <b>configuration</b> and optimal trajectory for a fixed design of a conceptual RLV in an automated manner. This method is accomplished using the original code Steele-Flight. This code uses a combination of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Non-Linear Programming (NLP) based trajectory optimizer known as GPOPS II to simultaneously find the optimal <b>engine</b> <b>configuration</b> from a user provided selection pool of engine models and the matching optimal trajectory. This method allows the user to explore a broad range of possible <b>engine</b> <b>configuration...</b>|$|R
