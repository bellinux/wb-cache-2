500|$|Injection {{moulding}} uses a ram or screw-type plunger {{to force}} molten plastic material into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to the contour of the mould. It is {{most commonly used}} to process both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, with the volume used of the former being considerably higher. Thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics which make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as {{the ease with which}} they may be recycled, their versatility allowing them to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, [...] and their ability to soften and flow upon heating.

500|$|Two-shot or {{multi-shot}} moulds {{are designed}} to [...] "overmould" [...] within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> with two or more injection units. This process is actually an <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a different colour, is injection-moulded into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys, for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and remain legible with heavy use.|$|R

40|$|Plastic <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> are a {{positive}} {{example of the}} possibilities in terms of performance and energy efficiency of modern hydraulic drives technology. In addition to the performance and energy efficiency of the machines, {{the quality of the}} plastic mouldings and an easy to use machines control is the focus. To ensure a constant plastics part quality the set process parameters of the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> are kept constant by appropriate closed loop control strategies today. Assuming a constant quality of the processed plastic raw material, this strategy is effective. If it comes to a qualitative variation in the processed plastics, which often leads to a change in viscosity of the plastics melt, keeping processing parameters constant will not lead to a constant quality of the moulded parts. The deviations in the plastics viscosity have such a great influence on the moulding process that the relevant process parameters have to be adjusted manually in many cases. Often the stroke of the reciprocating screw system has to be adapted to reach a constant filling volume of the cavity and therefore avoid burr formation or short shots. In this paper an approach for adaptive process control is introduced. This control loop is able to correct the set points of specific machines parameters online within the production cycle and therefore is able to avoid changes in the produced parts quality...|$|R
