40|$|AbstractIt {{is a key}} step of {{quantitative}} risk analysis (QRA) to estimate <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> of flammable materials after leakage accidents. This paper reviews the available literature and expert opinion on how to evaluate and determine <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> value, and it was detailedly discussed on the main influencing factors of <b>ignition</b> <b>probability,</b> including flammable material properties, mass flow rate of flammable materials spillage, ignition resources and ignition controls. Moreover, the operational and practical <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> value could be estimated from the all way of classifications of flammable material, mass flow rate, ignition resources, hazardous areas and ignition prevention and control measure. Furthermore, the more practical <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> model was put forward that the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> was the maximum value of the probability decided by material properties (PMP), mass flow rate(PQ) and ignition resources(PIS) with the factor of preventing and controlling ignition (KIC). Finally, the further research was proposed to assign some feasible weigh factors of the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> for flammable materials after leakage accidents...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} climate-caused spatio-temporal {{variation of}} forest fire <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> in Finland based on empirical ignition experiments and 37 years of meteorological data from 26 meteorological stations scattered across Finland.

Second, based on data from empirical ignition experi-ments, fuel moisture content was linked with forest fire <b>ignition</b> <b>probability.</b> In southern Finland average forest fire <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> typically peaks in late May and early June, whereas {{in the northern part of}} the country the peak occurs at the end of June. There was a three-fold difference in the average annual <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> between the north-eastern part (3 %) and south-western part of the country (9 %).

40|$|The {{probabilistic}} {{nature of}} ignition of turbulent highly-strained lean premixed flames has been investigated. Two flow configurations {{have been considered}} in this study; counter-flow and bluff-body flames. Different successful and non-successful ignition events in both flows have been observed directly with high-speed imaging. In addition, the flame front structure during the flame propagation following the ignition has been observed using OH-PLIF technique. Moreover, the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> has been measured in both flows with different equivalence ratios and flow velocities. It {{has been found that}} high bulk velocities decrease the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> in all locations and for all flames. For counter-flow flames, ignition is sometimes possible even in locations where there is negligible probability of finding flammable mixture and is sometimes impossible in locations with high probability of flammable flow. The edge flame propagation speed has also been detected in this type of flames. For bluff-body flames, the flame propagation behavior following the spark ignition depends mainly on the location of the spark in respect to the recirculation zones. Furthermore, the flame inside the side recirculation zone (SRZ) quenches soon after the whole flame lights-up. Failed ignition has been viewed close to the extinction flow conditions of the flame. Igniting the flame away from the extinction conditions results in 100 % <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> regardless of the ignition location. However, close to extinction, <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> decreases gradually and achieving ignition is not possible at all outside the central recirculation zone (CRZ). The obtained <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> contours of both flows have been compared with the previously-studied <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> contours of turbulent non-premixed flames of the same burners.

Analysis of the resulting frames showed that auto-ignition is the dominant mechanism stabilizing the flame. Ignition kernels are formed randomly and are convected downstream while growing in size and connecting to other kernels. The statistics of these processes were studied, showing that <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> become larger for larger coflow temperatures. No strong influence of coflow temperature on flame propagation speeds is found.

40|$|Particle {{size and}} {{distribution}} {{play an important}} role in ignition. The size and distribution of the cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) particles were investigated by Laser Particle Size Analyzer Malvern MS 2000 before experiment and calculation. The mean size of particles is 161 [*]μm. Minimum and maximum sizes are 80 [*]μm and 263 [*]μm, respectively. The distribution function is like a quadratic function. Based on the distribution of micron scale explosive particles, a microscopic model is established to describe the process of ignition of HMX particles under drop weight. Both temperature of contact zones and <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> of powder explosive can be predicted. The calculated results show that the temperature of the contact zones between the particles and the drop weight surface increases faster and higher than that of the contact zones between two neighboring particles. For HMX particles, with all other conditions being kept constant, if the drop height is less than 0. 1 [*]m, <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> will be close to 0. When the drop heights are 0. 2 [*]m and 0. 3 [*]m, the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> is 0. 27 and 0. 64, respectively, whereas when the drop height is more than 0. 4 [*]m, <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> will be close to 0. 82.

Although peat fires in which significant quantities of the soil organic material is consumed by smouldering combustion are uncommon, the ecological and environmental impacts of these fires can be very severe. The most important factor determining <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> and extent of the damage in a peat fire is the moisture content of the peat.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} spark {{ignition}} of various turbulent non-premixed flames namely, jet, counter-flow and bluff-body flames. This detailed fundamental study of spark ignition aims to provide useful information for solving the high-altitude relight {{problem in the}} aviation gas turbine. A specially designed ignition unit has been built. Different spark parameters and flow conditions have been examined to study their effects on the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> defined as successful flame establishment. The <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> results have been correlated with the measured or estimated flow velocity and mixture fraction. The whole ignition and flame propagation events have been visualized by a high-speed camera and OH-PLIF. In the jet flames, {{it was found that}} after an initially spherical shape, the flame took a cylindrical shape with a propagating edge upstream. The probability of successful ignition P ign increases with high spark energy, thin electrode diameter and wide gap, but decreases with increasing dilution of the jet with air. The flame kernel growth rate is high when the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> is high for all parameters, except for jet velocity. Increasing the jet velocity decreases the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> at all locations. The estimated net propagation speed relative to the incoming flow was about 3 to 6 laminar burning velocities of a stoichiometric mixture S L. In the counter-flow flames, {{it was found that the}} flame spread as an edge flame with a large scatter in its radial position. P ign decreased with bulk velocity, which suggests that the local strain rate can be detrimental to ignition so that, even with the strongest spark tested, ignition could not be achieved at a bulk velocity about 90 % of the extinction velocity. P ign was greater than zero even in regions well into the fuel and air streams where the mixture fraction fluctuations were virtually zero, giving zero probability of finding flammable mixture at the spark location. The estimated edge flame speed relative to the radial flow is higher than S L for the premixed flame and is less than S L for the non-premixed flames.

40|$|Bushfires pose a {{significant}} threat to lives and property. Fire management authorities aim to minimise this threat by employing risk management procedures. This paper proposes {{a process of}} implementing, in a Geographic Information System environment, contemporary integrated approaches to bushfire risk analysis that incorporate the dynamic effects of bushfires. The system is illustrated with a case study combining ignition, fire behaviour and fire propagation models with climate, fuel, terrain, historical ignition and asset data from Hobart, Tasmania, and its surroundings. Many of the implementation issues involved with dynamic risk modelling are resolved, such as increasing processing efficiency and quantifying probabilities using historical data. A raster-based, risk-specific bushfire simulation system is created, using a new, efficient approach to model fire spread and a spatiotemporal algorithm to estimate spread probabilities. We define a method for modelling <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> using representative conditions in order to manage large fire weather datasets. Validation of the case study shows that the system can be used efficiently to produce a realistic output {{in order to assess}} the risk posed by bushfire.

40|$|Abstract – Releases of {{flammable}} {{materials from}} chemical plant are a hazard since their dispersion down to safe levels only occurs at {{some distance from}} their source. Within this distance, accidental ignition can give rise to fires or explosions. This paper describes the development of computational fluid dynamic models capable of predicting the ignition hazards presented by turbulent releases of flammable materials. A mathematical model, based on solutions of the fluid flow equations, is described, with a prescribed probability density function (p. d. f.) approach {{used to determine the}} distribution of conserved scalar quantities. Three distributions are explored, and their ability to simulate experimental data in jet and wake flows, in isolation of fluid flow calculations, is tested. A composite p. d. f. (consisting of b-and d- functions, and a power law distribution for the viscous super-layer) demonstrates excellent agreement with data, particularly in those regions of a flow that contain significant intermittency. Coupling of this p. d. f. with flow field calculations yields reasonable predictions of scalar p. d. f. ’s in a methane jet, with <b>probabilities</b> of <b>ignition</b> implied from measured and predicted p. d. f. ’s being in close accord. The results demonstrate that prescribed p. d. f. methods are likely to be capable of predicting <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> in many practical flows...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fire {{scientists}} in the United States began exploring the relationships of fire-danger and hazard with weather, fuel moisture, and <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> as early as 1916. Many of the relationships identified then persist today {{in the form of}} our National Fire-Danger-Rating System. This paper traces the evolution of fire-danger rating in the United States, including discussions of significant developmental milestones, innovative instrumentation, and a succession of analogue fire-danger meters, or calculators. Although the primary theme of this paper is an historical review of pioneering efforts leading up to our current state-of-knowledge, a common thread throughout this paper is the desire by every generation of developer to achieve a ‘purely analytical system’. A national system was first introduced in 1964. The current system used throughout the USA was implemented in 1978, with optional revisions added in 1988. We present this evolution within the context of three periods of development: first, the pioneering efforts initiated at the Priest River Experiment Station in northern Idaho; second, the implementation of a national, standardised fire-danger-rating system; and third, spatially explicit delivery systems that provide a national view of weather and fire potential, which include national fire-danger and weather maps and satellite-derived maps that reflect the state of live vegetation across the United States...|$|R

We must to achieve this alliance integrate fire, climate and society variables. Meeting grand challenges in remote sensing and geographic information science (GIS) define first steps toward wildland fire management. The grandest challenge of all is, however, integrated decision support that empowers people and fire to co-exist, thus stabilize atmospheric processes and benefit from the renewal fire brings to natural systems. A Fire-Climate-Society (FCS) prototype uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to bring together suites of fire probability variables (e. g., fuel moistures; lightning and human <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities)</b> and societal values at risk (e. g., property; recreation; endangered species). Resulting maps create consensus on high priority fuel treatment areas. 1 THE PREHISTORY OF GLOBAL FIRE There was no intent by early humans to limit fire; {{it was a natural}} part of living. Nomadic agrarians laid down a pattern of surface fire wherever they traveled. Early societies thus joined a fire cycle that sustained them and their fire-adapted habitats (Pyne, 2001). Fire promoted a natural biodiversity (Wright and Bailey, 1982). Climate always played a key role: Precipitation promoted production of fine grass fuels.

40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for estimating industrial dust explosion hazards {{in terms of}} three probabilities or co-factors: The dispersion of the dust, {{the existence of a}} flammable dust concentration, and the presence of an effective source of ignition. This method or rationale is proposed as a replacement for the "explosibility index" that was first suggested 25 yr ago, but which, by consen-sus among leading researchers in the field, is now outdated. This report presents a detailed critique of the deficiencies of that old, material-oriented index, and develops the logical rationale for its re-placement by an approach that is better suited for quantitative hazard evaluations. A variety of such evaluations are illustrated, which show how a quantitative prediction of explosion frequencies can be obtained from laboratory measurements and operating conditions in a given indus-trial facility. The method has some pitfalls, particularly as they re-late to the correlation of events or their randomness. These are discussed, as well as the method's other limitations and uncertainties. This work is intended to provide a beginning to a quantitative approach to explosion hazard assessment. To that end, a new method is proposed for estimating thermal <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> in terms of the measured laboratory autoignition temperature of a dust, its relationship to the operating temperature, and its distribution within a given industrial system...|$|R
40|$|We study a budgeted cut problem {{known as}} Graph Protection, where {{the goal is}} to remove edges of a given graph in order to protect {{valuable}} nodes from stochastic, infectious threats. This problem was recently proposed by Shmoys and Spencer to model challenges associated with wildfire prevention when resources are limited and only probabilistic data of ignition location is known. The input consists of a graph with node values and edge costs, a budget, and probabilistic data signifying the likelihood a set of nodes will ignite; {{the goal is to}} remove a set of edges with total cost at most the budget so as to maximize the expected protected value unreachable from these stochastic ignition scenarios. Our focus is on the design of approximation algorithms for Graph Protection when an ignition scenario can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, a setting mostly left open in the literature. Our main positive result is the design of constant-factor approximation algorithms for Graph Protection when the input graph is a tree and each node has an independent chance of being an ignition point. We also show that in the general case when <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> are defined by a distribution over subsets of nodes, the problem becomes at least as hard as the Densest k-Subgraph problem and thus, such an approximation algorithm is unlikely to exist...|$|R

40|$|Several {{tests to}} {{determine}} the dust explosibility parameters were presented in the technical and scientific literature {{which can be used}} to assess the characteristics of a dust sample. Some parameters describe a countable variable, which is defined by a numerical value (e. g. P max, kst) while others define a threshold above (or below) which the explosion should not occur (MIE, LOC, autoignition temperature). These latter should be regarded as limit values at which the probability of occurrence of ignition (or explosion propagation in case LOC or LEL are considered) is low enough to be considered negligible. Technical standards describe the procedure to measure the different parameters. The Cloud Autoignition Temperature (AIT), according to the European standard CEI EN 50281 is the temperature at which 10 consecutive ignition attempts result negative (no ignition). Similar assumption is made by UNI 13821 as MIE is considered. Generally speaking, these technical standards do not state what is the confidence of the threshold value determined by standard procedures. The <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> at such threshold is supposed to be zero, but to date it has to be considered just as an assumption, since the relationship between the probability of occurrence of the studied phenomenon (ignition for example) and the independent variable (the temperature, in the case of AIT) is not yet well established. Nevertheless, it is known that <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> does not change abruptly from 0 to 1 as a step function but through a smooth slope over a temperature interval. This work aims to investigate the dependence of the cloud Autoignition probability of a Lycopodium cloud versus the temperature in the temperature interval close to AIT with a twofold purpose. The first is to describe the relationship <b>Ignition</b> <b>probability</b> vs temperature in the range where the probability varies from zero to one (we call such range probability escalation interval, PEI), providing an appropriate statistical model to describe this dependency. The second goal of the study is to investigate the reliability of the AIT value determined by the procedure defined by technical standards and to propose a new method of defining the AIT, based on statistically sound methodology. Experimental data can indeed be used to identify the threshold below which the <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> is lower than a suitably predefined level with prescribed confidence, providing a more solid ground on which the definition of the AIT could be based...|$|E

40|$|ASTM G 74 {{has been}} used for many years to {{evaluate}} nonmetallic materials and components for oxygen service. When originally published in 1982, this standard considered a “passing” result to be zero ignitions of a material out of 20 samples tested. However, researchers have recognized that the originally prescribed methodology results in a cumulative binomial confidence of about 36 % for a passing result. As a result, the low confidence for a passing result could be potentially misleading when results are used to qualify materials or components for oxygen service, unless the data is analyzed through available statistical approaches. This paper summarizes research performed to evaluate the statistical aspects of gaseous fluid impact testing so that <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> can be considered in the test methodology. Data derived by the test method are evaluated by a logistic regression approach in order to describe the behavior of the materials being tested and to compare different materials or test conditions. Therefore, the statistical aspects of the test are shown to be crucial to understanding and applying the data obtained. This paper demonstrates that the ASTM G 74 test and all international tests of a similar nature because all use the same test embodiment and are inherently probabilistic and subject to variability that seems random without application of appropriate statistical analysis. However, meaningful results can be developed when the appropriate statistical tools are utilized.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} under laboratory conditions to assess, on the one hand, the capacity of several fuel beds to be ignited by firebrands and to sustain a fire and, on the other hand, the capability {{of different types of}} firebrands to ignite fuel beds,. Fuel beds and firebrands were selected amongst the most common in Southern Europe. Regarding fuel bed flammability, results show that grasses are more flammable than litters and, amongst litters, Pinus species are the most flammable. The increase of bulk density and FMC involves an increase of the time-to-ignition, and a decrease of the other flammability parameters. The capability of firebrands to ignite fuel beds is higher when the firebrands drop in flaming phase and with no air flow than in glowing phase with air flow. Logistic regression models to predict fuel bed <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> were developed. As a whole, results show a relationship between <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> of fuel bed and type or weight of firebrands. Pinus pinaster cone scale, Pinus halepensis cone scale, Eucalyptus globulus leaf and bark can have ignition probabilities at least twice higher than bark of Pines when fallen in flaming combustion...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{geographic}} information system (GIS) -based model was developed to calculate the post-earthquake <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> of a building, considering damage to the building's interior gas and electrical distribution system and the overturning of appliances. In order to make our model more reliable and realistic, a weighting factor was used to define the possible existence of each appliance or other contents in the given occupancy. A questionnaire was prepared to weigh {{the relevance of the}} different components of post-earthquake ignitions using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The questionnaire was evaluated by researchers who were experienced in earthquake engineering and post-earthquake fires. The developed model was implemented to HAZTURK's (Hazards Turkey) earthquake loss assessment software, as developed by the Mid-America Earthquake Center with the help of Istanbul Technical University. The developed post-earthquake ignition tool was applied to Küçükçekmece, Istanbul, in Turkey. The results were evaluated according to structure types, occupancy types, the number of storeys, building codes and specified districts. The evaluated results support the theory that post-earthquake <b>ignition</b> <b>probability</b> is inversely proportional to the number of storeys and the construction year, depending upon the building code...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} ignition and burn risk due to wildfire in a region of Ontario, Canada using a methodology which is applicable to the entire boreal forest region. A generalized additive model was employed to obtain <b>ignition</b> risk <b>probabilities</b> and a burn probability map using only historic ignition and fire area data. Constructing fire shapes according to an accurate physical model for fire spread, using a fuel map and realistic weather scenarios is possible with the Prometheus fire growth simulation model. Thus, we applied the Burn-P 3 implementation of Prometheus to construct a more accurate burn probability map. The fuel map for the study region was verified and corrected. Burn-P 3 simulations were run under the settings (related to weather) recommended in the software documentation and {{were found to be}} fairly robust to errors in the fuel map, but simulated fire sizes were substantially larger than those observed in the historic record. By adjusting the input parameters to reflect suppression effects, we obtained a model which gives more appropriate fire sizes. The resulting burn probability map suggests that risk of fire in the study area is much lower than what is predicted by Burn-P 3 under its recommended settings...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E : Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering [© IMechE] and is also available at: [URL] paper describes a scheme by which the explosion frequencies and resulting overpres- sures can be predicted for modules on an offshore platform. Given a leak of gas, the success and failure of the isolation, blow-down and deluge systems, which are designed to activate following a leak to mitigate the consequences, are considered. The frequency of each possible response to the leak is predicted using a conventional event tree and fault tree approach. Each scenario has a potential escape inventory, which together with the hole size distribution provides the escaping mass flowrate. Once the flowrate into the module is established, the wind conditions are used to determine the gas in air concentration build-up. The concentration profile with respect to time is linked to the <b>ignition</b> source <b>probabilities,</b> from which calculations can be made to assess the likelihood that an explosion will occur within a specific concentration range. The initial models assume that the gas concentration at any specific time is uniform within the locality of the leak. The work presented in this paper proposes an approach that determines the explosion probability dependent on the volume fraction of gas within the module and the likelihood of encountering an ignition source...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forestry, 2010 The {{introduction}} of non-native pathogens can have profound effects on forest ecosystems resulting in tree mortality, changes in species composition, and altered fuel structure. The 1990 ???s {{introduction of}} Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen recognized as causing {{the tree and}} plant disease known as sudden oak death, has caused rapid decline and mortality of tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) in forests of coastal California, USA. To understand the potential effect that mortality could have on fuel structure and fire behavior, foliar moisture content of uninfected tanoaks, sudden oak death-infected tanoaks, sudden oak death-killed (dead) tanoaks, and surface litter was tracked for 12 months. Foliar moisture content of uninfected tanoaks averaged 82. 3 % for the year whereas foliar moisture content of infected tanoaks had a lower average of 77. 8 %. Dead tanoaks had significantly lower foliar moisture content than uninfected and infected trees, averaging 12. 3 % for the year. During fire season (June through September), dead tanoak foliar moisture content reached a low of 5. 8 %, with {{no significant difference between}} dead canopy fuels and surface litter. Remote automated weather station (RAWS) 10 -hour timelag fuel moisture data corresponded to foliar moisture content of dead leaves, holding promise as a predictor of seasonal crown fire hazard. Decision support tools, based on Van Wagner???s (1977) crown ignition equation, can predict canopy base height values to escape crown ignition, however the Van Wagner equation was developed for conifers, not broadleaf trees (such as tanoak). No empirical data exist to corroborate ignition thresholds for extremely low foliar moistures found in dead foliage. To quantify crown base height ignition thresholds, a laboratory experiment was employed to measure foliar ignition and consumption at crown base heights from 0. 5 m to 1. 5 m across the range of foliar moistures found in healthy, sudden oak death-infected, and sudden oak death-killed tanoaks. Results from laboratory burning showed all foliage was consumed at the lowest simulated crown base heights in the laboratory, however consumption of live foliage dropped off quickly with increasing crown base height, with minimal consumption occurring at 1 m and above. Consumption of dead foliage declined with increasing simulated crown base heights, with some consumption still occurring at the highest crown base height tested (1. 5 m). Using logistic regression, variables of crown base height, temperature, and duration of temperatures above 320 ??C or 410 ??C were used to predict crown <b>ignition</b> <b>probabilities</b> for all foliar moisture treatments tested (80 %, 70 %, 9 %, and 5 % foliar moisture content). Crown base height performed well as a predictor of crown ignition with correct predictions 87 % to 91 % of the time. Minimizing the probability of live tanoak foliage ignition results in a crown base ignition threshold lower than the Van Wagner model, while the dead tanoak foliage ignition threshold is considerably lower than an extrapolated Van Wagner equation. This suggests that tanoak will resist crown ignition at a lower threshold than conifers across the crown base heights tested. Results from this study will help refine the decision support tools for fire managers in sudden oak death-affected areas as well as {{serve as a model for}} other forests where diseases and insect epidemics have altered forest crown fuels.
