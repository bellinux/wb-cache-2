500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's going to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> and I'll just {{look forward to working}} with him. I'm still really young in the [...] job as well and very inexperienced at this level, so I think I can learn a lot off him." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> on the script. We {{wanted to do a}} show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E
500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their [...] "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".|$|E

500|$|Pokémon Black and White have {{received}} largely positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 87% on Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly awarded the game a perfect 40/40 score, becoming the 15th game to receive such a distinction, {{as well as}} obtaining the highest score ever given to a Pokémon video game by the publication. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez remarked that [...] "Pokémon Black and White <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level." [...] VideoGamer.com's Jamin Smith criticized the games for not innovating as much as some people would have liked, but stated that [...] "rest assured {{in the knowledge that}} Black and White are damn fine games; the best the series has to offer." [...] Official Nintendo Magazine referred to them as [...] "A beautiful refinement of a great series [...] the best Pokémon ever." [...] Nintendo Power expressed that [...] "the Pokémon series's latest pair of adventures is as addictive as ever.

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

2500|$|Voice of Desmond Miles, Nolan North, urged Ubisoft {{to adopt}} motion capture methods similar to Naughty Dog's Uncharted. Speaking in an interview, North {{admitted}} there's a [...] "disconnect" [...] in the Ubisoft game's current setup, which has voice actors provide voice facial animation separately from body motion capture, which is recorded by different actors. [...] "I wish it wasn't done separately," [...] North said. [...] "Don't get me wrong, the mo-cap actors <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job,</b> {{but there will}} always be somewhat of a disconnect when it's done this way. After my experiences on the Uncharted franchise, where the actors do both performance and voice, I can honestly say there is absolutely a difference," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's David Chapman {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 3.5 out of 5. Of the graphics, he wrote [...] "there haven't {{been a lot}} of improvements over the original game. Placed side-by-side, players would be somewhat hard pressed to guess which game was the newer release." [...] He was critical of the lack of differentiation between the game and its predecessor, arguing [...] "it feels more like an expansion than a true sequel. If you've played the first game, Ties That Bind simply feels like more of the same." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind is a solid action title that should satisfy fans of the original game. Although the game doesn't bring a lot of new experiences to the table, it does <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of adding to the experience gamers enjoyed the first time around." [...] Scott Osborne scored the PC version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "the gameplay feels stuck in the past, like a rerun of the first game." [...] He was critical of the port, citing [...] "graphics glitches," [...] "problems loading saved games," [...] and game-breaking bugs. He concluded, [...] "The gameplay and locales aren't particularly exciting, yet the pacing is taut, and the story and acting are above par. Fans of the first game should enjoy learning more about Torque's clouded life, but if you're new to the series, you're probably better off picking up the original." ...|$|E

For example, University of Texas psychology professor Jacqueline Woolley helped conduct a study that found, to the contrary, that children seemed competent in their use of logic, evidence, and comparative reasoning even though they might conclude that Santa Claus or other fanciful creatures were real: The adults they count on to provide reliable information about the world introduce them to Santa. Then his existence is affirmed by friends, books, TV and movies. It is also validated by hard evidence: the half-eaten cookies and empty milk glasses by the tree on Christmas morning. In other words, children <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of scientifically evaluating Santa. And adults <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of duping them. Jacqueline Wooley ...|$|E
