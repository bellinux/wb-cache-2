40|$|The {{diagnosis}} problem {{arises when}} a system's actual behavior contradicts the expected behavior, thereby exhibiting symptoms (a collection of conflict sets). System diagnosis is then {{the task of}} identifying faulty components {{that are responsible for}} anomalous behavior. To solve the diagnosis problem, the present invention describes a method for finding the minimal set of faulty components (minimal <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set)</b> that explain the conflict sets. The method includes acts of creating a matrix of the collection of conflict sets, and then creating nodes from the matrix such that each node is a node in a search tree. A determination is made as to whether each node is a leaf node or has any children nodes. If any given node has children nodes, then the node is split until all nodes are leaf nodes.

40|$|Morphology Discrimination is a {{discriminator}} {{based on}} QRS morphology analysis {{that has been}} recently implemented in dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).

Then, a series of discriminators (Morphology Discrimination, Stability, Sudden Onset) analyze the rhythm {{according to specific criteria}} and the number of discriminators required for VT diagnosis (i. e., requiring "any" or "all" of the specific discriminators to indicate VT). The discriminating accuracy of the algorithm was evaluated in 645 detections recorded during the follow-up of 25 patients. The overall specificity for 397 supraventricular arrhythmias was 73. 5 % (292 / 397) with the tachycardia <b>diagnosis</b> criteria <b>set</b> to "any" and 90. 9 % (361 / 397) with the tachycardia <b>diagnosis</b> criteria <b>set</b> to "all.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the number of}} Earth orbiters and deep space probes has grown {{dramatically}} {{and is expected to}} continue in the future as miniaturization technologies drive spacecraft to become more numerous and more complex. This rate of growth has brought a new focus on autonomous and self-preserving systems that depend on fault diagnosis. Although diagnosis is needed for any autonomous system, current approaches are almost uniformly “ad-hoc, ” inefficient, and incomplete. Systematic methods of general diagnosis exist in literature, but they all suffer from two major drawbacks that severely limit their practical applications. First, they tend to be large and complex and hence difficult to apply. Second and more importantly, in order to find the minimal <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set,</b> i. e., the minimal set of faulty components, they rely on algorithms with exponential computational cost and hence are highly impractical for application to many systems of interest. In this paper, we propose a two-fold approach to overcome these two limitations and to develop a new and powerful diagnosis engine. First, we propose a novel and compact reconstruction of General Diagnosis Engine (GDE), {{as one of the most}} fundamental approaches to model-based diagnosis.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{approach}} to model-based diagnosis consists of a two-step process: (1) Generating conflict sets from symptoms; (2) Calculating minimal <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set</b> from the conflicts. Here a conflict set {{is a set of}} assumptions on the modes of some components that is not consistent with the model of the system and observations, and a minimal diagnosis is a set of the consistent assumptions of the modes of all components with minimal number of abnormal components. However, there are major drawbacks in the current model-based diagnosis techniques in efficiently performing the above two steps that severely limit their practical application to many systems of interest. For conflict generating problem, these techniques are usually based on different versions of Truth Maintenance (TM) method, which lead to exhaustive search in the space of possible modes of the components. The most common method for finding minimal diagnosis from the conflicts is based on Reiter’s algorithm [9], which requires both exponential time and exponential space (memory) to be implemented. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and two-fold approach: First, we propose a new approach for generating conflict sets based on mapping this problem onto the well-studied problem of finding paths in a graph [5]. This approach can significantly accelerate the conflict generation step by bounding the search space and thus avoiding unnecessary search. Second, we propose a novel algorithmic approach and a set of new algorithms for calculation of minimal <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set,</b> which is an inherently intractable (NP-complete) problem [3]. However, our new approach allows the development of new algorithms that enable more efficient solution for large and realistic problems. More specifically, our new approach allows us to calculate the lower and upper bounds {{on the size of the}} solution. Utilizing these new insights, we are able to develop a new version of the branch-and-bound method for solving the problem...|$|E

This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework that exploits the topology of a physical system to be diagnosed to limit inter-diagnoser communication and compute diagnoses in an anytime and any information manner, making it robust to communication and processor failures. The framework adopts the consistency-based diagnosis formalism and develops a distributed constraint satisfaction realization of the diagnosis algorithm.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} {{a variety of}} circuit verification approaches, from simulation-based verification used in netlist verification to equivalence checking of high-level circuit representations. All the methods employ Arithmetic Transform (AT), which, depending of the needs, is used for netlist error representation, test vector generation, formal circuit description and finally modeling of precision errors in imprecise circuits. The thesis first presents the methodology for simulation-based verification under a fault model. We propose an implicit fault model that is especially suitable for arithmetic circuit verification. The model {{is based on the}} AT representation of the faults, enabling the verification by the Universal <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>Set</b> (UDS) approach to test vector generation. We draw useful relations between the Arithmetic and Walsh-Hadamard spectrum that bound the AT error spectrum, and place the verification in the context of inducing a class of small error circuits. Next, we address the problem of identifying redundant errors, which significantly degrade the performance of the overall verification. New algorithms are presented for exact and approximate identification of redundant faults by don't care calculation and satisfiability formulation. These algorithms can further benefit from employing fast manufacturing fault detection schemes. Finally, we propose extensions to AT that are suitable for equivalence checking of sequential datapaths. We show that the proposed forms further facilitate verification of imprecise arithmetic circuits by a direct polynomial maximization over Boolean inputs...|$|E

40|$|Current quantum {{annealing}} (QA) hardware {{suffers from}} practical limitations such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In particular we {{develop a new}} embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly into hardware. The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give {{an example of a}} class of CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding. We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set</b> of size N using 1000 N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a leading SAT-based sampling method.

40|$|Reconfigurable logic {{devices that}} are based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) {{substrate}} are gaining widespread acceptance. As such devices are used in many different configurations, manufacturers need to ensure that each potential configuration will not fail due to device defects.

Furthermore, a scheme for the incorporation of the test architecture, which reduces test and diagnostic times of reconfigurable logic interconnects, is described. The test architecture includes added Feedback Shift Register (FSR) components that change the circuit configuration during testing but are completely transparent during the eventual customer's usage.

From the one hand, high level of Ab-TG and heterogeneous structure may be estimated as particular qualities of hyperthyroidism clinical course during AIT by amongst children. However, absence of the row of diagnostic signs with long-lasting euthyroid condition do not allow us to estimate that cases as hyperthyroidism phase of AIT. From the other hand, we can suppose that we observe the diagnostic of natural clinical course of GD cases in phase of immunological remission. The detection of normal level of TBII in absence of typical clinical signs of GD amongst children with manifestation of hyperthyroidism let us retreat from active therapeutic intervention and choose the method of dynamic observation...|$|E

However, the register prevalence of asthma obtained from the medical records in the same municipality and age groups was found to be only 2. 1 %. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to investigate whether the low register prevalence of asthma was caused by an underdiagnosis of asthma in primary health care and to validate a first diagnosis of asthma set by GPs in primary health care. METHODS: During a period of 3 months in 1997, all patients seeking care in the primary health care units of the municipality of Lund (population 171 877) with upper or lower airway infections, prolonged cough, allergic rhinitis, fatigue or a first positive diagnosis of asthma were recorded (n = 3025). RESULTS: In the whole group of 3025 patients, 99 patients were found to have received a diagnosis of asthma for the first time during the study period. The diagnosis was verified in 52 of those 68 patients who attended a follow-up and examination by a respiratory physician.

40|$|Introduction: Hip {{fractures}} {{are commonly}} diagnosed by plain radiography. When a patient presents with negative radiographs and high clinical suspicion of fracture, guidelines recommend proceeding with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) to diagnose the patient. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the use of MRI in diagnosing hip fractures following trauma to the hip and describe clinical outcome after MRI-diagnosed hip fractures. The perspective was to develop new recommendations for MRI use. Materials and methods: 616 patients at a university hospital fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having an MRI scan of the hip following trauma between the years of 2005 and 2014. Data was collected from the patients' medical records. Results: The annual number of MRIs increased over the ten-year period. Out of 616 MRI scans 228 (37 %) showed fracture of the hip with a dominance of trochanteric fractures, 185 (30 %) revealed pelvic fracture and 183 (29 %) were negative. No patient with acute pelvic fracture had associated fracture of the hip. The main reason to proceed with MRI was a strong clinical suspicion of fracture in patients with negative initial radiographs. Amongst the 228 patients with fracture, 187 (82 %) were treated operatively. Of patients with hip fracture, 90 (39 %) patients suffered a general complication and 11 (5 %) had hip complications. The complication rate of patients with fracture on MRI was compared to that of a cohort of general hip fracture patients at our hospital. No significant difference in twelve months' survival or general complications could be found, but the MRI group had a significantly lower hip complication rate. Conclusion: The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set</b> by MRI, with high share of pelvic fractures or no fracture, reflects the difficulty in differential diagnosing this group of patients. The rate of occult hip fractures was low and patients with pelvic fractures already known from X-ray did not have additional hip fractures. We found an increase in the annual number of MRIs during the 10 -year-period. MRI-diagnosed hip fracture patients do not suffer more complications than the regular hip fracture patient...|$|E
40|$|Background: Endometriosis {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in current gynecology due to steady increase of its incidence, involvement of young females, high frequency of infertility and difficulties with diagnostics and treatment. Confirmation of diagnosis of advanced endometriosis is still within the competence of research centers and big federal treatment establishments. Aim: To improve ultrasound diagnostics and to develop an algorithm of assessment in retrocervical endometriosis. Materials and methods: Seventy two females were assessed laparoscopically due to a gynecology disorder or infertility. Based on intraoperational data and results of pathomorphological assessments, two groups were formed: group 1 (control group, n = 26) comprised patients in reproductive age who had been admitted for elective surgery due to a gynecological disorder. Group 2 (main group, n = 46) included patients with various types of endometriosis. Patients from group 2 were divided into 3 subgroups: 2 а (n = 17) – with superficial forms of external genital endometriosis; 2 b (n = 18) – with endometrioid cysts; 2 c (n = 11) – with deep infiltrative types of endometriosis. Results: Patients with superficial external genital endometriosis were characterized by positive symptom of “folding” (“freezing”) of posterior uterine surface and of the walls of adjacent intestine. In endometriosis of posterior surface of cervix uteri, the diagnosis made by an ultrasound assessmentin 100 % matched the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>set</b> during surgery, whereas if sacrouterine ligaments were involved, the diagnostic match was only 3 %. In the group of patients with endometrioid cysts, in most of cases the cysts had specific ultrasound signs; coincidence of an ultrasound and a morphological diagnosis was seen in 98 % of cases. Most cases of deep infiltrative endometriosis showed involvement of sacrouterine ligaments (72 %) and of parametrium (81 %). There was a positive folding sign and a “Indian headdress symptom”. Retrocervical endometriosis was characterized by involvement of adjacent organs, such as rectum and rectosigmoideal flexion of the colon, vaginal walls, vaginorectal septum, parametrium, as well as obstructive uretheral adhesions with a pyeloectasy on the site of involvement. Diagnostic mismatches between the ultrasound method and surgery was seen in 4 % of females. False positive results were found in 2 % of cases. Based on the assessments performed, an original algorithm of ultrasound diagnostics of endometriosis is proposed. Conclusion: Ultrasound assessment has a proven diagnostic value in retrocervical endometriosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGlaucoma is {{the most}} common optic {{neuropathy}} characterized by normal to raised intraocular pressure (IOP), visual field defects, loss of retinal nerve fiber layer, thinning of the neuroretinal rim, and cupping of the optic disc. IOP reduction by medical, laser, or surgical therapies remains the only clinically proven treatment of glaucoma. The challenges in glaucoma management are diverse. They include early detection and <b>diagnosis,</b> <b>setting</b> of appropriate target IOP, choice of treatment, monitoring of quality of life and sight, and compliance with the treatment. Early diagnosis can be made by assessing optic nerve structure using imaging devices and optic nerve function through perimetry. Reducing IOP and controlling its fluctuations are considered {{to be the most important}} factors in limiting progression of glaucoma. Selection of the best suitable therapy out of medical, surgical, or laser treatment options is yet another management challenge. Patients suffering from glaucoma experience poor quality of life owing to the diagnosis itself, functional visual loss, inconvenience and cost of treatment, and side effects of treatment. All these factors lead to poor compliance, adherence, and persistence to treatment, and further progression of the disease. It is, therefore, important that ophthalmologists keep all the aforementioned factors in mind when managing patients with glaucoma...|$|R
40|$|How do {{individuals}} {{judge the}} risks and benefits of toxicogenomics, an emerging field of research which is completely unfamiliar to them? The hypothesis is that individuals' perceptions of {{the risks and}} benefits of toxicogenomics are fragile and can by influenced by different issues and context framings as a technology. The researchers expected that the effects on risk and benefit judgements would differ between lay individuals and experts in toxicogenomics. A 2 × 2 × 2 experiment that encompassed three factors was conducted. The first factor, issue framing incorporated the field of application for the technology (therapy vs. <b>diagnosis</b> <b>setting).</b> The second factor, context framing included organisations and institutions that would profit from the technology (companies vs. regulatory agencies) and the third factor encompasses the quality of individuals' level of knowledge, for example lay vs. expert knowledge. Research results suggest the differential power of framing effects. It seems that the clues provided by context frames - but not by issue frames - are able to influence the ways in which lay people and experts process information. The findings are interpreted in the line of the fuzzy trace theory that predicts reliance on fuzzy gist representations formed by stereotypes {{on a wide range of}} judgement problem including risk and benefit perceptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between patient and therapist {{in mental health}} care {{is one of the}} most important treatment factors. It is a reliable predictor of treatment outcome, regardless of <b>diagnosis,</b> <b>setting</b> or of the type of therapy used. On the other hand, influence and coercion occur in patient–physician relationships in psychiatry. We investigated the associations between patients' perceived coercion and the therapeutic relationship. A total of 116 psychiatric patients, who have been admitted to the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich, were interviewed using a structured interview. Data were collected by using Scale To Assess the Therapeutic Relationship (STAR) (therapeutic relationship) and Mac Arthur Admission Experience Survey (AES) (perceived coercion). Associations were investigated using bivariate and multivariate methods. Perceived coercion predicts the patients' appraisal of the therapeutic relationship. We found a moderate relation between the patients' and the clinicians' view of their relationship. Perceived coercion is related to a higher symptom level and a lower level of global functioning at admission, and higher perceived coercion is related to a more negative patient–therapist relationship rated by the patient. Perceived loss of autonomy goes hand in hand with a more negative {{relationship between}} the patient and the clinician. This phenomenon has to be impeded, regarding the unambiguous impact relationship quality has on treatment outcome...|$|R
