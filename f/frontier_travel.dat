50|$|Located in the British Colony of Virginia, {{even after}} the American Revolution and {{independence}} and statehood for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the areas west of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains were known as the <b>frontier.</b> <b>Travel</b> over the mountains in a wagon was nearly impossible except where nature afforded some gap between them. Until after the Civil War, Jarmans Gap, only some six miles northeast of Waynesboro, was the major crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains in that area, making Waynesboro a convenient location for a stop for many who wished to venture west.|$|E

50|$|In 1944, Dimitrov {{returned}} to Bulgaria after 22 years in exile and became {{leader of the}} Communist party there. After the onset of undisguised Communist rule in 1946, Dimitrov succeeded Kimon Georgiev as Prime Minister, while keeping his Soviet Union citizenship. Dimitrov started negotiating with Josip Broz Tito {{on the creation of}} a Federation of the Southern Slavs, which had been underway since November 1944 between the Bulgarian and Yugoslav Communist leaderships. The idea was {{based on the idea that}} Yugoslavia and Bulgaria were the only two homelands of the Southern Slavs, separated from the rest of the Slavic world. The idea eventually resulted in the 1947 Bled accord, signed by Dimitrov and Tito, which called for abandoning <b>frontier</b> <b>travel</b> barriers, arranging for a future customs union, and Yugoslavia's unilateral forgiveness of Bulgarian war reparations. The preliminary plan for the federation included the incorporation of the Blagoevgrad Region ("Pirin Macedonia") into the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and the return of the Western Outlands from Serbia to Bulgaria. In anticipation of this, Bulgaria accepted teachers from Yugoslavia who started to teach the newly codified Macedonian language in the schools in Pirin Macedonia and issued the order that the Bulgarians of the Blagoevgrad Region should claim а Macedonian identity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a field validation of a corridor travel time prediction system that uses automated license plate recognition–the <b>Frontier</b> <b>Travel</b> Time project. As part of the Frontier project, the Oregon Department of Transportation deployed a video image processing system with license plate recognition and privacyprotecting data encryption, a central server, and proprietary algorithms to predict corridor travel times on a 25 mile section of rural highway in northwest Oregon. The system predicted travel times were compared to data independently collected by probe vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System devices. The comparison shows that the predicted travel times were not statistically different than the travel times observed by the probe vehicles. Despite attempts to validate the system under congested conditions, all comparisons were made under essentially free flow travel. Further validation of the system in a congested corridor with alternate routes is recommended. T I...|$|E

40|$|Travel {{behavior}} {{researchers have}} been intrigued {{by the amount of}} time that people allocate to travel in a day, i. e., the daily travel time expenditure, commonly referred to as a “travel time budget”. Explorations into the notion of a travel time budget have once again resurfaced in the context of activity-based and time use research in travel behavior modeling. This paper revisits the issue by developing the notion of a travel time frontier (TTF) that is distinct from the actual travel time expenditure or budget of an individual. The TTF is defined in this paper as an intrinsic maximum amount of time that people are willing to allocate for travel. It is treated as an unobserved frontier that influences the actual travel time expenditure measured in travel surveys. Using travel survey datasets from around the world (i. e., US, Switzerland and India), this paper sheds new light on daily travel time expenditures by modeling the unobserved TTF and comparing these frontiers across international contexts. The stochastic frontier modeling methodology is employed to model the unobserved TTF as a production frontier. Separate models are estimated for commuter and non-commuter samples to recognize the differing constraints between these market segments. Comparisons across the international contexts show considerable differences in average unobserved TTF values. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.

60|$|Here was {{a sudden}} change in what had long been a fixed {{condition}} of human life, the maximum rate of land transport. After the Russian disaster, Napoleon travelled from near Vilna to Paris in 312 hours. This was a journey of about 1,400 miles. He was travelling with every conceivable advantage, and he averaged {357} under 5 miles an hour. An ordinary traveller {{could not have done}} this distance in twice the time. These were about the same maximum rates of travel as held good between Rome and Gaul in the first century A.D. Then suddenly came this tremendous change. The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary traveller to less than forty-eight hours. That is to say, they reduced the chief European distances to about a tenth of what they had been. They made it possible to carry out administrative work in areas ten times as great as any that had hitherto been workable under one administration. The full significance of that possibility in Europe still remains to be realized. Europe is still netted in boundaries drawn in the horse and road era. In America the effects were immediate. To the United States of America, sprawling westward, it meant the possibility of a continuous access to Washington, however far the <b>frontier</b> <b>travelled</b> across the continent. It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would otherwise have been impossible.|$|R

40|$|The essay {{analyses}} {{a selection}} of poems written by young people {{all around the world}} on the theme You /Me. What and how many are the forms in which the dual infinity of the world is represented? Which are the forms of otherness? If the mystery of any relationship is part of our living, what account does the soul make to itself? These were the questions raised in the language of poetry. ‘Otherness’, explored according to many approaches, turns out as constant character, unavoidable ‘truth’, utmost because open and fragile in the boundlessness of the limit in which the paths of human beings and their lives are built. The key adopted in reading the texts is surely demanding. On the one hand it does not account – it could not account – for all the emotional levels and deep meanings of the poems taken one by one (not to mention stylistic aspects, that sometime would deserve a specific underlining), on the other hand it senses, in the multiplicity of texts, a ‘cultural’ and coherent content made of questions and answers, of hesitations and certainties, of doubts that let imagine internal reasons. An interpretation in the terms of a ‘poetics of otherness’ seems to be an essential aspect of youth culture. “Youth culture”: This too is not without problems. Young people of different age, Countries and cultures, languages. It is impossible to ignore all the criticalities stressed by decades of reflections about language, its characterisation as uniqueness without identity and by the debates about comparativism in literature. But one cannot fail to address also the ‘youth’ component that qualifies the ‘culture’ embedded in such poetics of otherness, across canons and languages, as those who are the bearers, the young authors, live in a ‘pierced’ world (albeit deeply torn and marked by unsustainable <b>frontiers),</b> <b>travel,</b> see landscapes and people, listen to stories and songs, meet and speak ‘hybrid’ languages willing to communicate with no subjection. Perhaps it is poetry itself that commits to otherness, with the multiple levels of tension between perfection and imperfection of the word, between creation and listening, tradition and translation, intuitive synthesis and form of representation, among all the level of knowledge that poetry spreads...|$|R

40|$|On {{the morning}} of February 10, 1676, the townspeople of Lancaster, Massachusetts, woke to chaos when the loosely allied Narragansett, Nipmuck, and Wampanoag tribes {{attacked}} their frontier village.

40|$|From {{the ancient}} times Chinese literati devoted {{many of their}} {{writings}} to the description in verse and prose of famous landscapes and the recording in diary form of long travels and short excursions. In consequence of Ming’s new territorial conquests and the strengthening of Chinese imperial rule in peripheral, the new lands (Yunnan province in particular, with its tablelands, mountains and grottoes) became new sources of inspiration and contributed to enlarge the <b>frontiers</b> of Chinese <b>travel</b> writing genre. The authors increased in number, {{and even if they}} are not all equally notable, their works represent a new important literary trend. Central government’s officials, transferred to working in far-away regions, educated non-Chinese literati, anxious {{to make a name for}} themselves and their lands, exiled officials spending their time to explore unknown territories, travellers going around the country for different purposes or only for pleasure, were shocked by new and intense experiences. They describe, through painting or literature, the splendid peculiarities of new territories. In this paper the author translates three examples of travel writings, two being short trip accounts written by two literati of the first half of the sixteenth century, Young Shen and Li Yuanyang, and the third a passage from the long diary of Xu Xiake’s travel in Yunnan dating back to the first half of the seventeenth century. By reading these works, each characterized by a personal mark, it is possible to appreciate the different interests, experiences and culturally education of their authors. These works are valuable sources for different kinds of research as well...|$|R
40|$|Through the ages, {{traveling}} through the world through tourism has familiarized the foreign. Unknown <b>frontiers</b> become urbanized; <b>travel</b> pathways coalesce around human evolution in spaces; and governance structures harness the power that such exploratory opportunities present. This research navigates the spatial dimension of travel evolution alongside the attendant expansion of urbanization. It defines the nexus between tourism as a global demand and the physical infrastructure that accommodated such a force. The built environment, manifested in both its urban forms and its systems of mobility, has shaped and been shaped by many factors, including tourism. This work explores the historical co-evolution of urbanization and tourism. Egypt, {{considered one of the}} world's oldest tourist destinations, is used here to demonstrate the interlocking relationship of tourism and urbanization; it is difficult to separate these two phenomena because the evolution of tourism through time is not only attributable to demand, but also to the shape and form of the destination and the transport systems available in each era and locale. This research focuses on the contemporary Egyptian era because it is dynamic and replete with diverse forms of tourism. Both professional and academic literature has widely discussed the concept of ecotourism as an important, and growing, subset of the tourism industry. Nevertheless, no accurate definition of ecotourism has been agreed upon. This research compares ecotourism to conventional or mass tourism along the Red Sea coast of Egypt. It systematically examines the tourist establishments in the study area based on identifiable environmental parameters, including swimming pool surface area, distance from mangrove patches, conflict with flood plains, extent of lawn area, and means of access to deep water. The investigation finds that ecotourism establishments are not significantly different from typical tourism resorts and that they create comparable stress on ecological resources. The research concludes that ecotourism is a self-proclaimed designation in this rapidly developing international tourism zone. The study recommends that future ecotourism operations be modified in two key ways. First, on the planning level, the regional master plan created by the central government tourism authorities must be modified to recognize the unique environmental characteristics of specific sites, and these plans must guide development with specific requirements designed to protect the region’s unique environmental resources. Second, on the site design level, significant improvements to design approval processes must be introduced in the build-out process to ensure compliance with environmental requirements and minimize stress on local environmental resources. After examining the Egyptian case study, the research explores the governing rubric for tourism development and land use in that area. Despite being {{one of the most important}} revenue sources for Egypt, tourism development remains a byproduct of a very complex governing system. Although current tourism development causes much environmental degradation along the Red Sea coast (scholarly work has delineated its footprint), little has been written on the governance of this tourism development and its implications for the enduring environmental footprint of tourism along the Red Sea. This piece defines the various institutions responsible for tourism development and explores the relationship between institutions and development modes on their specific land jurisdictions. It concludes that tourism development will likely continue to create more adverse impacts if the governing agencies responsible for shaping its development do not overhaul their operating paradigms to take into account the attendant holistic and discrete ramifications of their appropriation choices...|$|R
