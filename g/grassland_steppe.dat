50|$|Perissodactyls inhabit {{a number}} of {{different}} habitats, leading to different lifestyles. Tapirs are solitary and inhabit mainly tropical rainforests. Rhinos tend to live alone in rather dry savannas, and in Asia, wet marsh or forest areas. Horses inhabit open areas such as <b>grasslands,</b> <b>steppes,</b> or semideserts, and live together in groups. Odd-toed ungulates are exclusively herbivores that feed, to varying degrees, on grasses, leaves, and other plant parts. A distinction is often made between primarily grass feeders (white rhinos, equines) and leaf feeders (tapirs, other rhinos).|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} found in <b>grassland,</b> <b>steppe,</b> {{cultivated}} land, orchards, clearings and woodland borders. It is unique among mice in its habit of building mounds in the autumn. These are constructed {{by a number of}} mice and can be up to 4 m in diameter, although a more normal size is 1 to 2 m. Some four to fourteen mice cooperate to build the mounds, and these {{have been shown to be}} closely related, probably through the mother's line. The mound is built over storage chambers which can hold up to 10 kg of seeds and grains, underneath which is a nesting chamber. Up to twenty mounds per hectare (eight per acre) is typical but there can be many more than this under particularly favourable conditions.|$|E

40|$|Directional {{reflectance}} {{factors that}} spanned the entire exitance hemisphere {{were collected on}} the ground throughout the morning period for common cover types in Tunisia, Africa. NOAA 7 / 8 AVHRR bands 1 (0. 58 - 0. 68 micron) and 2 (0. 7301. 1 micron) were used in data collection. The cover types reported were a plowed field, annual <b>grassland,</b> <b>steppe</b> grassland, hard wheat, salt plain, and irrigated wheat. Several of these cover types had geometric structures that are extreme as compared to those reported in the literature. Comparisons were made between {{the dynamics of the}} observed reflectance distributions and those reported in the literature. It was found that the dynamics of the measured data could be explained by a combination of soil and vegetation scattering components. The data and analysis further validated physical principles that cause the reflectance distribution dynamics as proposed by field and simulation studies in the literature. Finally, the normalized difference transformation (Band 2 - Band 1) /(Band 1 + Band 2), which is useful in monitoring vegetation cover, generally decreased the variation in signal with changing view angle.

40|$|We had an {{opportunity}} to research the soil of the <b>grassland</b> (<b>steppe</b> and meadow) in Baiinxilc, Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia in 1987. The research area is located at the Xilin River basin which is the principal part of the Inner Mongolia grassland. We have 5 Plots for soil survey by excavating pits. The soil survey Plots were the same as the vegetation and the soil animal survey Plots. Plot 1 is heavey grazing land, Plot 2 is meadow-light graging land, Plot 3 is grazingland, Plot 4 is meadow land, and Plot 5 is Populus afforestation land. The soils of each Plot are chestnut soil (Plot 1, 2, 3), chernozem (Plot 4) and grey forest soil (Plot 5). In spite of that the soil texture of the grassland is SL-L, the soils in absorbing root sphere (0 - 50 cm horizon) are compact with poor developed soil structure. But on the contrary, it seems to control to strongly dry the soil. And so, it seems that the u[?]ilization form of the grassland and the soil physical properties closcly related.

40|$|In Inner Mongolia, <b>steppe</b> <b>grasslands</b> face {{desertification}} or degradation {{because of}} human overuse and abandonment after inappropriate agricultural management. The soils in these abandoned croplands exist in heterogeneous environments characterized by widely fluctuating microbial growth. Quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} analysis of microbial genes encoding proteins involved in the nitrogen cycle was used to study Azotobacter species, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers in the soils from <b>steppe</b> <b>grasslands</b> and croplands abandoned for 2, 6, and 26 years. Except for nitrifying archaea and nitrous oxide-reducing bacteria, the relative genotypic abundance of microbial communities involved in nitrogen metabolism differed by approximately 2 - to 10 -fold between abandoned cropland and <b>steppe</b> <b>grassland</b> soils. Although nitrogen-cycle gene abundances varied with abandonment time, the abundance patterns of nitrogen-cycle genes separated distinctly into abandoned cropland versus light-grazing <b>steppe</b> <b>grassland,</b> {{despite the lack of}} any cultivation for over a quarter-century. Plant biomass and plant diversity exerted a significant effect on the abundance of microbial communities that mediate the nitrogen cycle (P < 0. 002 and P < 0. 03, respectively).
