40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} moderating effect of {{competitive}} intensity {{on the relationship}} between <b>innovative</b> efforts <b>and</b> performance. The study proposes that a firm’s competitive intensity acts as a quasi-moderator of the relationship between <b>innovative</b> efforts <b>and</b> performance. The results support the predictions of the study. The results indicate that competitive intensity moderates the relationship between <b>innovative</b> efforts <b>and</b> performance such that when competitive intensity is high, the relationship between <b>innovative</b> efforts <b>and</b> performance is positive, and vice versa, when the competitive intensity is low, the relationship between <b>innovative</b> efforts <b>and</b> performance is negative.

40|$|Orientation: An {{important}} {{evaluation function}} is to determine whether creative <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> thinking <b>and</b> problem-solving skills can be developed through training and to assess whether these skills, on their own, are sufficient to ignite innovation in organisations. Research purpose: The evaluation question that the present study aimed to address is whether employees in a corporate context, such as a financial services organisation, can develop creative <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> thinking <b>and</b> problem-solving skills through an intervention such as a workshop. Motivation for the study: A financial services organisation commissioned the primary author of this article to design a workshop {{with the intent to}} develop the creative <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> thinking <b>and</b> problem-solving skills of their employees in order to ignite innovation and competitiveness. Research design, approach and method: This study employed mainly qualitative research. Utilisation-focused evaluation (UFE) was employed and findings from the literature review, questionnaires, pen-and-paper tests and interviews were used. The unit of analysis was a niche business unit in a South African financial services organisation. Main findings: From this study’s point of view, the most critical finding related to the confirmation that individuals can acquire creative <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> thinking <b>and</b> problemsolving skills. The acquisition of these skills, however, is not sufficient on its own to establish a culture supportive of creativity and sustainable innovation. Practical/managerial implications: The development of creative <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> thinking <b>and</b> problem-solving skills of employees is not sufficient on its own to support sustainable innovation. Managers should consciously establish determinants on an organisational as well as an individual level to create an environment supportive of sustainable innovation. Contribution/value-add: The present study indicated how a workshop can assist individuals to develop creative <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> thinking <b>and</b> problem-solving skills. The acquisition of these skills is not sufficient on its own to ignite sustainable innovation...|$|R

In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured <b>innovative</b> <b>and</b> distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E

5|$|Tetsuji Takechi {{was born}} Tetsuji Kawaguchi in Osaka on 10 December 1912 {{to a family}} headed by a wealthy industrialist.

In 1939 he began publishing a journal, Stage Review in which he printed his writings on the theater. In the early 1940s, he began publishing collections of these writings in book form. When World War II came to an end, Takechi used his inheritance from his father to establish a theatrical troupe. Under his direction, the Takechi Kabuki, as the group was known, put Takechi's theatrical ideas into practise by giving <b>innovative</b> <b>and</b> popular performances of kabuki classics in Osaka from 1945 to 1955.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the concepts of entrepreneurial <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> marketing <b>and</b> how these concepts may be identified in the singular and/or plural context. No comprehensive theory exists in the domain of the integration of entrepreneurship and marketing. This paper proposes a conceptual entrepreneurial <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> marketing approach from the literature, integrating academic and practice theory. Based upon abstract, generalized and explicit theoretical concepts, this paper is the first to integrate an implicit, intuitive and tacit resource of practice within a single conceptual model. Theoretical underpinnings are developed from a newly conceptualized definition of entrepreneurial <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> marketing, perspectives on the emerging nature of entrepreneurial <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> marketing, <b>and</b> models of application of entrepreneurial <b>and</b> <b>innovative</b> marketing. The proposed model facilitates entrepreneurs, innovators and corporate venturers toward establishing high growth ventures. Opportunities for further research are identified from a conceptual and empirical approach...|$|R

Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied. Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the University of Wisconsin Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley. Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known as popular and <b>innovative,</b> <b>and</b> Agard became the Classics department chair.|$|E
5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was <b>innovative</b> <b>and</b> highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E

The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had {{a hole in his}} spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone.
