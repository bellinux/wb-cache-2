Ichiki was so confident in the superiority of his men that he decided to destroy the American defenders before the remaining majority of his force arrived, even writing in his journal [...] "18 August, landing; 20 August, march by night and battle; 21 August, enjoyment of the fruit of victory". He concocted a brazenly simple plan: march straight down the beach and through the American defenses. Leaving about 100 personnel behind as a rear guard, Ichiki marched west with the remaining 800 men of his unit and made camp before dawn about [...] east of the Lunga perimeter.

6000|$|Now, a novel, in our days, is {{a three-story}} affair,--a complicated, complex, multiform composition, {{requiring}} {{no end of}} scenery and dramatis personae, and plot and plan, together with trap-doors, pit-falls, wonderful escapes and thrilling dangers; and the scenes transport one all over the earth,--to England, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, and Kamtschatka.

It is, moreover, a story with a moral; and for fear that you shouldn't <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the moral is, we shall adopt the plan of the painter who wrote under his pictures, [...] "This is a bear," [...] and [...] "This is a turtle-dove."

6000|$|Now {{come the}} questions, WHY did Christ {{rise from the}} dead?--and HOW did he rise? And, first, I will {{say a few words}} about how he rose from the dead. And this the Bible will answer for us, as it will every thing else about the spirit-world. Christ, says the Bible, was put to death in the flesh; but quickened, that is, brought to life, by the Spirit. Now what is the Spirit but the Lord and Giver of Life,--life of all sorts--life to the soul--life to the body-- life to the trees and plants around us? With that Spirit Christ is filled {{infinitely}} without measure; it is HIS Spirit. He is the Prince of Life; and the Spirit which gives life is His Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son. THEREFORE the gates of hell could not prevail against Him--THEREFORE the heavy grave-stone could not hold Him down--THEREFORE His flesh could not see corruption and decay as other bodies do; not because His body was different from other bodies in its substance, but because HE was filled, body and soul, with the great Spirit of Life. For this is the great business of the Spirit of God, in all nature, to bring life out of death--new generations out of old. What says David? [...] "When Thou, O God, turnest away Thy face, things die and return again to the dust; when Thou lettest Thy breath (which is the same as Thy spirit) go forth, they are made, and Thou renewest the face of the earth." [...] This is the way that seeds, instead of rotting and perishing, spring up and become new plants--God breathes His spirit on them. The seeds must have heat, and damp, and darkness, and electricity, before they can sprout; but the heat, and damp, and darkness, do not make them sprout; they want something more to do that. A philosopher can <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> a seed is made of, and he might make a seed of the proper materials, {{and put it in the}} ground, and electrify it--but would it grow? Not it. To grow it must have life--life from the fountain of life--from God's Spirit. All the philosophers in the world have never yet been able, among all the things which they have made, to make a single living thing--and say they never shall; because, put together all they will, still one thing is wanting-- LIFE, which God alone can give. Why do I say this? To shew you what God's Spirit is; to put you in mind that it is near you, above you, and beneath you, about your path in your daily walk. And also, to explain to you how Christ rose by that Spirit,--how your bodies, if you claim your share in Christ's Spirit, may rise by it too.|$|E
