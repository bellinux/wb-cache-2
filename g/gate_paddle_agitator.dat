2500|$|A paddle – {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a slacker, clough, or (in American English) wicket – is the simple valve by which the lock chamber is filled or emptied. The paddle itself is a sliding wooden (or nowadays plastic) panel which when [...] "lifted" [...] (slid up) {{out of the way}} allows water to either enter the chamber from the upper pound or flow out to the lower pound. A <b>gate</b> <b>paddle</b> simply covers a hole in the lower part of a gate; a more sophisticated ground paddle blocks an underground culvert. There can be up to 8 <b>paddles</b> (two <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> and two ground paddles at both upper and lower ends of the chamber) but there will often be fewer. For a long period since the 1970s it was British Waterways policy not to provide <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> in replacement top gates if two ground paddles existed. The reason for this was given as safety, since it is possible for an ascending boat to be swamped by the water from a carelessly lifted <b>gate</b> <b>paddle.</b> However, without the <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> the locks are slower to operate and this has been blamed in some places for causing congestion. Since the late 1990s the preferred method has been to retain or re-install the <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> and fit 'baffles' across them to minimise the risk of inundation.|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics is used {{to solve}} 3 D hydrodynamics of a mixing vessel for <b>paddle</b> <b>agitators</b> and two-blade {{impellers}} with different blade heights operating in laminar regime. These results are compared with available experimental data: good agreement is observed. The tangential velocities calculation was carried out for <b>paddle</b> <b>agitator</b> with height W = 1. 5 T. Early studies confirmed {{that this type of}} geometry generates essentially a tangential flow. The results obtained show good agreement with those obtained by many authors. The second agitator height was W = 0. 25 T which behaves, generally, like a turbine and generates more important axial and radial velocities which are at the origin of secondary flows {{on both sides of the}} blade. The axial velocities calculation for blades of various heights confirmed the observations of many authors; especially, a maximum velocity for the lowest height considered. The position of the impeller in the tank was analysed and the axial velocity change with the positions of the impeller...|$|R

A sophisticated modern windlass may have an adjustable-length arm.|$|R
25|$|There {{were plenty}} of {{incidents}} with negligent lockkeepers. On September 11, 1895 at Lock 22, the boat Excelsior arrived, and tried to lock through. The lockkeeper was so drunk, he opened the lower <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> too early. The boat hit the mitre sill, broke in half, and sank with its 113 tons of coal. Richard A. Moore, {{the owner of the}} boat, collected over $1,300 in damages, and the lockkeeper was fired.|$|R
5000|$|The lock {{was built}} in the early 18th century and was {{originally}} turf-sided. It was enlarged in the mid 18th century to cope with larger [...] "Newbury barges" [...] and has 20th century alterations. It consists of brick chamber walls of 11 scalloped bays, with brick coping and has 2 sets of double wooden gates, all with mechanical <b>gate</b> <b>paddle</b> gearing. The lock is a grade II listed building, and scheduled ancient monument.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} build locks with a larger fall than was {{possible}} with conventional <b>gate</b> <b>paddles,</b> Steers built two of the locks with sluices and ground paddles, which fed water {{into the bottom of}} the lock through the side walls. Water supply for the summit level was taken from local streams, supplemented by water from Lough Shark, which was used as a reservoir. As a whole, the work was not well executed, and the innovative locks had to be rebuilt soon after 1750.|$|R

50|$|Pickett's Lock (No 15) is {{a lock on}} the River Lee Navigation in the London Borough of Enfield, England and {{is located}} near Edmonton, London. It gives {{its name to the}} {{surrounding}} area of Picketts Lock. In common with other locks as far as Ponder's End Lock it is large enough to take barges of up to 130 tons. However it has not been upgraded to power operation and so it must be manually operated. It has <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> but these do not have gate baffles to mitigate the rush of water into the lock.|$|R
2500|$|On the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{there is}} a variety of {{different}} lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal wing nut (butterfly nut) lifting a screw-threaded bar attached {{to the top of the}} paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a wooden plate which seals the culvert. These are known locally as [...] "jack cloughs". Bottom <b>gate</b> <b>paddles</b> are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a wooden plate sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift. Many of these idiosyncratic paddles have been [...] "modernised" [...] and they are becoming rare.|$|R
40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) {{scientists}} monitored butter-making on five Ethiopian farms for a nine-month {{period in}} 1989 {{to see if}} traditional butter-making practices could be accelerated whilst leaving the basic technique unchanged. Traditionally, milk for churning is collected in a clay Dot for several days, soured naturally, and then churned by shaking the pot until butter granules form. This takes up to four hours of churning. The ILCA team developed a simple internal wooden <b>paddle</b> <b>agitator</b> to improve {{the efficiency of the}} simple clay pot churn. The temperature and acidity of the milk are not changed. Fifty-nine churnings were observed, of which the shortest was 50 minutes and the longest 65.

40|$|We {{established}} a new indoor mesocosm facility, 12 fully controlled “Planktotrons”, designed to conduct marine and freshwater experiments for biodiversity and food web approaches using natural or artificial, benthic or planktonic communities. The Planktotrons are {{a unique and}} custom-tailored facility allowing long-term experiments. Wall growth can be inhibited by a rotating <b>gate</b> <b>paddle</b> with silicone lips. Additionally, temperature and light intensity are individually controllable for each Planktotron and the large volume (600 L) enables high-frequency or volume-intense measurements. In a pilot freshwater experiment various trophic levels of a pelagic food web were maintained for up to 90 d. First, an artificially assembled phytoplankton community of 11 species was inoculated in all Planktotrons. After 22 d, two ciliates were added to all, and three Daphnia species were added to six Planktotrons. After 72 d, dissolved organic matter (DOM, an alkaline soil extract) was added as an external disturbance to six of the 12 Planktotrons, involving three Planktotrons stocked with Daphnia and three without, respectively. We demonstrate the suitability of the Planktotrons for food web and biodiversity research. Variation among replicated Planktotrons (n[*]=[*] 3 minimum) {{did not differ from}} other laboratory systems and field experiments.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of in vitro {{parameters}} on the theophylline release from the hydrogel system of atactic -PVA/NaCl/H 2 O, in vitro parameters such as agitators, rotation speed, release medium and release temperature were evaluated. Theophylline release was studied {{for a period of}} 750 min using <b>paddle</b> and propeller <b>agitator,</b> rotation speed (25, 50, 100 and 150 rpm), release medium (simulated fluids pH 1. 2, 7. 5 and phosphate buffer pH 8. 5 with 0. 05 M at 37 °C) and release temperatures (27, 37 and 47 °C). SEM and DSC studies were performed to evaluate the surface morphology and heat capacity as well as melting temperatures of the hydrogels affected by various simulated fluids and phosphate buffer. A regular Fickian diffusion was found (Higuchi Model) for first 60 to 70 % release. A faster release rate was found in paddle rotation than that of propeller one. Among the release medium comparatively high release rate in extremely low pH (1. 2) and near about same release rate in distilled water, pH 7. 5 and pH 8. 5 were found. DSC thermogram of these treated xerogels showed low melting temperature as well as high heat capacity of pH 1. 2 sample than that of others. Rotation speed had a little effect on release rate but the diffusion exponent. It decreased linearly with increasing rotation speed. On the other hand release rate increased proportionally to temperature where diffusion exponent decreased with increasing temperature in a parabolic fashion. Theophylline release behavior was regular Fickian diffusion (Higuchi Model) irrespective of in vitro conditions studied here.
