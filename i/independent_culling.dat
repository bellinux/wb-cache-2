40|$|An exact {{transformed}} culling {{method for}} any number of traits or stages of selection with explicit solution for multistage selection is described in this paper. This procedure does not need numerical integration and is suitable for obtaining either desired genetic gains for a variable proportion selected or optimum aggregate breeding value for a fixed total proportion selected. The procedure has similar properties to multistage selection index and, as such, genetic gains from use of the procedure may exceed ordinary <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> level selection. The relative efficiencies of transformed to conventional <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> ranged from 87 % to over 300 %. These results suggest that for most situations one can chose a multistage selection scheme, either conventional or transformed culling, which will have an efficiency close to that of selection index. After considering cost savings associated with multistage selection, there are many situations in which economic returns from use of <b>independent</b> <b>culling,</b> either conventional or transformed, will exceed that of selection index...|$|E

The experiments were conducted at South Valley University Experimental Farm at Qena during 2007 through 2010 summer seasons. The F 3, F 4, F 5 and F 6 generations of the grain sorghum hybrid (Giza 15 x Dorado) were studied. Highly significant differences were observed among F 3 families for all studied traits. After three cycles of selection, the genetic variability retained after <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> level was larger and more pronounced than that after single trait selection. However, the genetic variability retained in the F 6 was larger after late than after early selection. Late pedigree selection in the F 5 increased grain yield/plant by 9. 57 % compared to 12. 70 % from the bulk sample after three cycles of selection for this trait started early in the F 3. Selection for early flowering and 1000 -grain weight improved these traits but decreased yield in both early and late selection. Late selection in the F 5 generation in these materials was more efficient than early selection in the F 3 families. Pedigree selection though proved to be an efficient selection procedure for improving the selected traits. However, it was accompanied with some deleterious effects in some unselected related traits.

Background. The Sidney ProjectTM was created over three years ago and began as a pilot program at two hospitals: University Hospital in Tamarac, Florida and Broward Hospital, Ft. Lauderdale. Since its inception the program has grown to include additional hospitals who have utilized the curricula in the program on an ongoing basis. As the program has grown, more residents {{have had the opportunity to}} be exposed to the concepts of spirituality and medicine and compassionate care and have learned hands on tools for implementing these topics in patient care. In addition, the program has provided for a 2 ̆ 2 safe place 2 ̆ 2 for residents to discuss topics that are not usually spoken about. The program was created in honor of my dad, Sidney, who lost his life needlessly in a hospital setting. Methods. The methods used included preliminary surveys that would distributed to participants to examine their beliefs about the importance of spirituality and medicine and compassionate care in patient care, self-care, spiritual assessments, and previous exposure to the topics. A post-survey was also distributed to participants at the end of the program (a year later.) In addition, each lecture that was given also received evaluations from the participants.

30|$|If {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} genetic {{correlations between the}} three identified KTs and a NKT of particular interest can be obtained, {{then it would be}} possible to increase the weight given to the NKT in question, elevating potential gain from selection. The main drawback to such an approach would lie in the situation whereby the NKT was unfavourably correlated with a number of the KTs. Considerable penalty would be incurred in the unfavourably correlated KTs if any gain was to be achieved through selection for the NKT(s) in question. Under normal circumstances, if such a situation was to arise, one would select for this NKT based on <b>independent</b> <b>culling,</b> but absence of measurement data means this cannot generally be considered at present.

40|$|Profitability is {{the primary}} goal for most beef cattle producers. The main source of {{long-term}} profitability for a beef cattle operation lies in its production efficiency relative to other operations (Harris, 1970). There are numerous approaches to achieve greater efficiency including nutrition, reproduction, management, and genetics. The goal in animal breeding and genetics is to improve animal populations and future generations of animals (Dekkers et al., 2004). Expected progeny differences (EPD) are the traditional genetic tools used to select parents. A drawback to EPD is that they represent genetic merit in only one trait while in reality multiple traits influence an animal’s value (Hazel, 1943). With EPD as a sole selection tool, producers are left to individually determine their optimal use and ultimately the economic importance of each trait (Bourdon, 1998). Selection indices account for multiple traits simultaneously and consider both biological production levels and economics (Parish, 2011). Falconer and Mackay (1996) recommend the use of selection indices for multi-trait selection in animal populations. According to Hazel and Lush (1942), selection for an index which gives proper weight to each trait is more efficient than tandem selection or selection for multiple traits with <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels. Tandem selection involves selection for one trait {{at a time until}} all traits have been improved to the desired level. This method is inefficient because selection pressure is placed on only one trait at a time, making genetic progress slow. Additionally, progress made in one trait could be eroded as selection pressure is placed on a different trait. When selection is based on <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels, a certain level of merit is established for each trait and all individuals below that level are culled regardless of their performance in other traits. The main concern with this method is that an animal with superior performance in many traits may be culled if it is barely under the thresh hold level for just one trait. In this situation selection indices are an appropriate alternative because they allow for superior performance in one trait to compensate for poor performance in other traits...|$|E

Non-key traits were omitted from the selection model, as they would not be considered at this stage of selection. Technical weights were multiplied by the individual-tree breeding values, as calculated by Eq.  1. The top 2 % of individuals (252 from 12600) for the index were selected.

Four sets of 97 S 3 lines from each population, each line crossed to Mo 44, and three checks (N 501 D, N 152 x Mo 44, and B 73 x Mo 17) were evaluated in 1987 and 1988. Twenty-five selected testcrosses from each population were recombined to synthesize four synthetics, thereafter refered to collectively as (HG x Mo 44) TCsyns, and individually as SynOM, SynIM, SynPM, and SynCM. In 1990, 196 full-sib families from each synthetic were evaluated in two locations at Nebraska, and planted in the nursery for selfing and selection within full-sib families. In 1991, S 1 families were evaluated in two stress environments. Using data on full-sib and S 1 families, three methodologies of selection were compared; using either (1) YIELD, or (2) lodging as sole criterion of selection, and (3) <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> for YIELD and lodging. Using (3), lines were selected from the (HG x Mo 44) TCsyns, and Syn N(HG x Mo 44) was synthesized. In 1992 the original populations, the (HG x Mo 44) TCsyns, synthetics of full-sibs and S 12 ̆ 7 s derived from (HG x Mo 44) TCsyns, and the check (NSSS(C 7)) were evaluated in two stress environments.

(HG x Mo 44) TCsyns had significantly greater YIELD, and reduced lodging than the original populations. Plant and ear height, and days to male flowering were significantly reduced, except for SynOM. Mo 44 negatively modified synchronization between male and female flowering.

40|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>culling</b> level {{selection}} is often practiced in breeding programs because extreme animals for some particular traits are rejected by breeders or because records on which genetic evaluation is based are collected sequentially. Optimizing these selection procedures {{for a given}} overall breeding objective is equivalent to finding the combination of truncation thresholds or culling levels which maximizes the expected value of the overall genetic value for selected animals. A general Newton-type algorithm has been derived to perform this maximization {{for any number of}} normally distributed traits and when the overall probability of being selected is fixed. Using a powerful method for the computation of multivariate normal probability integrals, it has been possible to undertake the numerical calculation of the optimal truncation points when up to 6 correlated traits or stages of selection are considered simultaneously. The extension of this algorithm to the more complex situation of maximizing annual genetic response subject to nonlinear constraints is demonstrated using a dairy cattle model involving milk production and a secondary trait such as type.

30|$|This {{approach}} of using <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> to improve NKTs not strongly correlated {{with any of}} the KTs is only likely to lead to gains in the current production population, as gene frequencies that improve the NKTs are not increased in the breeding population. The trade-offs in gain selecting for just a few uncorrelated traits, demonstrated earlier, illustrate the importance of concentrating improvement upon only a few traits of most economic importance. As P. radiata is grown on a large number of site types and has such a wide variety of uses, it has been a challenge to keep the breeding objectives down to only a few traits (Shelbourne [1997]). Calculation of economic weights for NKTs is likely to prove difficult, as a particular trait may be of importance for some growers and producers and for others not, for example, with widely varying incidence of Dothistroma infection across different regions. Earlier generations of the New Zealand breeding programme partitioned the main breeding population into several breeds that concentrated on improving specific traits (Jayawickrama and Carson [2000]). These breeds were later combined to form the current breeding population which had the benefit of reducing costs and increasing selection intensity. Identification of other NKTs uncorrelated to the KTs used for selection may see the return of specific breeds if enough demand for their improvement exists.|$|E

In this context, our {{aim was to}} assess the possibility of selecting tropical maize lines that are simultaneously N-stress tolerant and N-use efficient and check for differences between simultaneous selection statistical methods. Sixty-four tropical maize lines were evaluated for Nitrogen Agronomic Efficiency (NAE) and Low Nitrogen Tolerance (LNTI) response indices and two per se selection indices, Low Nitrogen Agronomic Efficiency (LNAE) and Harmonic Mean of Relative Performance (HMRP). We performed eight selection scenarios: LNAE; HMRP; Additive index; Mulamba-Mock index; and <b>Independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels. The last three was predicted by REML/BLUP single-trait and multi-trait using genotypic values of NAE and LNTI. The REML/BLUP multi-trait analysis was superior to the single-trait analysis due to high unfavorable correlation between NAE and LNTI. However, the accuracy and genotypic determination coefficient of NAE and LNTI were too low. Thus, neither single- nor multi-trait analysis achieved a good result for simultaneous selection nor N-use efficiency nor N-stress tolerance. LNAE obtained satisfactorily accurate values and genotypic determination coefficient, but its performance in selection gain was worse than HMRP, particularly in terms of N-use efficiency. Therefore, because of the superior performance in accuracy, genotypic determination coefficient and selection, HMRP was considered the best simultaneous selection methodology of the scenarios tested for N-use efficiency and N-stress tolerance...|$|E

The genetic gain was estimated as the deviation between selected lines and the respective unselected lines at 42 days of age. In female lines, body weight improved 504, 548 and 587 g; average breast area increased 27. 60; 16. 99 and 26. 43 cm²; adjusted feed conversion (42 - 49 d) improved - 1. 46; - 0. 97 and 1. 76 units, and egg production varied 6. 99; 7. 12 and - 3. 43 % units for PP, VV and KK, respectively.

The control strain was established by randomly mating one male from each sire family to a non-related female from each dam family and was used to monitor genetic change in the selected lines. CC and DD were selected using family and individual information on hen-day egg production up to 40 weeks of age, egg weight, sexual maturity and 16 -week-old body weight over five generations. <b>Independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels (ICL) were also used during population expansion to eliminate sires and dams with low fertility (FERT) and hatchability (HATC).

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{total of}} 399 {{crossbred}} ewes from two birth years were raised under two management systems, irrigated vs. dryland hill pastures. The crossbred ewes were sired by North Country Cheviot, Dorset, Finnsheep and Romney rams that were mated to Suffolk and Columbia-type ewes. Hampshire rams were the terminal sire breed used to mate the crossbred ewes throughout the experiment. Total feed cost and gross income from feeder and orphan lambs were estimated per ewe for either 4 or 5 potential years of production. Efficiency {{was defined as}} estimated dollars net revenue per ewe, the difference between estimated gross income and estimated feed and ewe ownership cost. Crossbred group and crossbred group x management system interaction significantly affected net revenue. The relative merit of crossbred groups was strongly dependent upon {{the environment in which}} the comparison was made. Ten ewe lamb traits were then used (individually and in combinations) in regression analyses to determine their relationships with lifetime production efficiency (LPE). The ewe's within-year birthdate, postweaning average daily gain, age at first estrus and lambing date during her first production year were not predictive of subsequent LPE. Ewes born as triplets had better future LPE than those born as either twins or singles (P <. 05), but single-born ewes surpassed twins in LPE. Actual weaning weight (WWt), weaning weight adjusted for age of dam, date of birth and type of birth and rearing (AWWt), postweaning weight (PWWt) and lamb production and net revenue of ewes mated to lamb at 12 months of age were correlated to the ewe's LPE (P <. 05). Results of "paper selection" involving single traits, <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> level based upon birth type and postweaning weight and backward selection showed that either of the three ewe lamb weights (WWt, AWWt, PWWt) was a good predictor of future cumulative and subsequent ewe productivity (excluding first year contribution).

40|$|Data on 5130 {{registered}} Hereford cattle {{owned and}} {{managed by the}} San Carlos Apache Indian tribe were used to study cow productivity in terms of Most Probable Producing Ability and fertility. Analyses of variance and regression analyses were utilized to investigate sources of variation in the weaning weights of the calves and in their day of birth (which was a measure of cow fertility). Heritability estimates for various weights and gains and correlations (genetic, environmental and phenotypic) for weights, gains and MPPA were also calculated. Large year effects caused the most variation in weaning weight. Important too, were the effects of age of dam, interaction between year and age of dam and regression of weaning weight on day of birth. The repeatability of weaning weight was. 25. This value was low compared to the average usually seen. Heritability estimates for weaning weight were. 05 for males and. 18 for females. Not much progress could be made selecting for weight at that stage. The heritability of postweaning weights were higher. The values for 20 -month-weight were. 46 for males and. 31 for females, indicating reasonable progress could be made selecting for weight at that age. Twelve-month-weight had heritability estimates of. 21 (males) and. 17 (females). Since a weight loss occurred during the period between weaning and the 12 -month-stage, the trait being measured may be a response to nutritional stress. The genetic correlations between weights at various stages were high. Some of the same genes are responsible for weights at various stages of growth.

The following traits were assessed subjectively on a linear scale ranging from 1 to 50 at the second, third and fourth shearings, namely fullness of face covering, fullness of the neck, fullness of belly and points, style, character, evenness of fleece, softness of face and ears, pigmentation {{in the face and}} on the ears, and kemp and medullated fibres. Heritability and repeatability estimates were obtained by fitting repeatability animal models under a DFREML programme. Heritability for body weight was higher in the JEF (0. 47 ± 0. 01) than in the Angora studs (0. 35 ± 0. 05), while the same heritabilities were estimated for fleece weight (0. 22 ± 0. 04) and fibre diameter (0. 30 ± 0. 05) in both data sets. The repeatability of body weight was higher in the JEF (0. 63) than in the studs (0. 53), but it was lower for weight (0. 27 vs. 0. 41) and fibre dianleter (0. 35 vs. 0. 68) in the JEF. Heritability and repeatability estimates for all subjectively assessed traits, with the exception of face cover in the JEF and pigmentation in both data sets, were moderate, too. Due to the fact that young bucks in South Africa are sold at 14 - 16 months of age with their full third fleece, perfornance has to be done at 8 - 9 months of age at the second shearing. As fleece weight had the lowest repeatability of the three production traits, it was recommended that the fleece weight be left out of the selection index. The possible inclusion of style in the selection index needs to be investigated further. As far as the other subjectively assessed traits are concerned, it is recommended that any selection for the further improvement of these traits should be based on <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels and they could not be included in the selection index...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{selection}} for yield and prolificacy, using <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels, {{was made in}} a Colombian maize (Zea mays L.) population, MB 21, which corresponds to an advanced crossing of ETO x USA 342 (West Indian Composite). The research was conducted in Palmira, Colombia for 10 years, using three environmental situations: selection at the A semester, the less favorable cropping season, selection at the B semester, the more favorable cropping season, and selection at both the A and B semesters;Changes in the three populations developed (MB 21 A, MB 21 B, and MB 21 AB), respect to the original population (MB 21), were evaluated in two seasons (A and B semesters), using Design I. The means of prolificacy and yield, and other correlated traits (ear height, days to silk, ear weight, and grain moisture at harvesting) increased with selection. Greater gains were achieved with selection in both semesters (AB). Selection at the less favorable environment (semester A), on the average, produced better results than the selection at the more favorable environment (semester B). Gains by year for prolificacy were 2. 3, 2. 0, and 3. 8 %, for MB 21 A, MB 21 B, and MB 21 AB, respectively. For yield those gains were 3. 8, 3. 4 and 5. 3 %;The additive genetic variance for prolificacy increased {{in each of the}} selected populations. For yield the additive genetic variance was greater in MB 21 AB, and smaller in MB 21 A and MB 21 B populations. The heritability on a plot basis for yield and prolificacy was reduced in the selected populations. Selection at the less favorable environment (semester A) reduced the additive genetic x environmental effects for yield, whereas selection at the more favorable environment (semester B) increased those effects. Expected gains were higher than realized changes, particularly in the testing A semester, which would indicate that the additive genetic variances were overestimated;The efficiencies of the indirect responses showed that the correlated response due to selection at the less favorable environment was at least equal to the direct response for selection at the best environment. It was suggested that additional gains from selection could be realized if off-season nurseries and stations were used in selection programs. Selection for yield was more efficient to increase the level of prolificacy than vice versa. Selection for the two traits, however, was more efficient than {{selection for}} yield only...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{records of}} within-year {{spawning}} date in two cultivated populations of coho salmon, named as even (n= 2272) and odd (n= 1347) year classes are analyzed. Both populations {{were selected for}} harvest weight and early spawning for four generations, using <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels. Hat-vest weight was selected using breeding values obtained from an animal model in males and females, while early spawning was selected phenotypically only in females. A post-selection analysis to estimate breeding values in both characters allowed comparison of the phenotypic response (R) and genetic selection response (GR) to selection for early spawning, narrow sense heritability (h(2)), and genetic Correlation with harvest weight (r(g)). Mean spawning dates were 13 and 15 days earlier after four generations of selection in the even and odd year class, respectively. This represents a phenotypic response to selection of - 2. 74 +/- 0. 7 (P = 0. 03) and - 3. 23 +/- 1. 3 (P = 0. 09) days per generation in the even and odd year classes, respectively. The heritability estimates, by regression of the selection differential on phenotypic change, were h(2) = 1. 78 +/- 0. 37 (P < 0. 05) for the even year class and h(2) = 1. 90 +/- 0. 42 (P < 0. 05) for the odd year class. In both cases, calculated values were greater than the highest possible value for heritability (h(2) = 1) which indicates that the response is overestimated due to a positive environmental effect which was not quantified. The estimates of narrow sense heritability using an animal model were high in both populations (even year class h(2) = 0. 40 +/- 0. 05, odd year class h(2) = 0. 44 +/- 0. 06). Breeding value analysis showed the genetic selection response was - 0. 62 and - 1. 13 days per generation in the even and odd year classes, respectively. The genetic correlation between spawning date and harvest weight was low in both year classes (even r(g) = 0. 25 +/- 0. 13; odd r(g) = - 0. 02 +/- 0. 24). The genetic selection differentials (GS) were lower in males than in females (even year class GS(f) = - 1. 12 y GS(m) = - 0. 13; odd year class GS(f) = - 1. 46; GS(m) = - 0. 36), which reflects selection practiced only on females...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the genetic {{response}} to selection {{and the effects}} of inbreeding oil harvest weight in two populations (which spawned as even and odd years classes) of Coho salmon are described. Artificial selection was performed using the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of breeding values obtained from ail animal model. Both populations were also selected for early spawning date using <b>independent</b> <b>culling</b> levels; these results are presented in a companion paper. The estimation of genetic parameters was based on the phenotypic records of 12, 208 animals randomly sampled at harvest time (random These fish represented a mean of 64 % and 48 % of all animals with phenotypic records in the even and odd year classes, respectively. The narrow sense heritability estimated for harvest weight was high and very similar in the two populations, 0. 39 +/- 0. 03 in the even year class and 0. 40 +/- 0. 04 in the odd year class. Due to the mating design, the genetic selection differentials were 2. 3 times greater in males than in females. The mean genetic selection response obtained was high in both populations, 383. 2 g or + 1. 26 sigma and 302. 4 g or + 1. 23 sigma per generation in the even and odd year classes, respectively. This is equivalent, oil the average, to all increase in weight of 13. 9 % per generation compared to the base population, or 10. 2 % per generation with respect to the difference between successive generations. After the 4 th generation of selection the mean inbreeding level was 9. 5 % in the even year class and 4. 4 % in the odd year class, which are close to preliminary estimates based oil the records of the random group plus a group of animals with high harvest weight (Gallardo, J. A., Garcia, X., Lhorente, J. P., Neira, R., 2004 b. Effects of nonrandom mating schemes to delay the inbreeding accumulation in cultured populations of Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Can. J. Fish. Aqua. Sci. 61 547 - 553.). The estimated effects of inbreeding depression oil harvest weight were negative, but not significant]), different from 0 in either the even year class (b(f) = - 7. 04 g/Delta F, s. e. = - 3. 9; Mean = 4118 g; inbreeding depression per 10 % of Delta F was - 1. 7 %; P = 0. 06) or the odd year class (b(f) = - 4. 8 g/Delta F, s. e. = - 0. 33; Mean = 3243 g; inbreeding depression per 10 % of Delta F was - 1. 5 %; P = 0. 33). Other programs in salmon have selected for more than one character, however, there are still no estimates of economic weights published in salmon breeding programs, which are necessary to calculate the total genetic merit for these animals...|$|E
