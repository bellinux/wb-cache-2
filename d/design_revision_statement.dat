40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structured, two-pronged {{approach to the}} development of a framework for assessing the severity of occurrence of <b>design</b> <b>revisions</b> and determining the causes of these revisions. The development of the framework involves the identification of a causal taxonomy consisting of categories of the causes of <b>design</b> <b>revisions</b> and the formalization of a set of indices for measuring and comparing the magnitudes of designer-times expended on <b>design</b> <b>revisions.</b> The framework could be used both as a diagnostic instrument to determine the health of the design phase and also as a forecasting tool for the estimation of designer resources required for a construction project. The framework was tested using data obtained from twelve building projects in China. The category that caused the maximum expenditure of designer time on <b>design</b> <b>revisions</b> in the building projects surveyed was found to be owner-initiated changes. <b>Design</b> <b>Revisions</b> <b>Design</b> Process Design Productivity,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multi-FPGA {{systems have}} {{tremendous}} potential, providing a high-performance computing substrate for many different applications. These systems harness multiple FPGAs, connected in a fixed pattern, to implement complex logic structures. In order {{to use such}} a system effectively, it is a key for constructing a good performance hardware platform. The configuration scheme {{is an important part}} in hardware design. This paper aims at small scale Multi-FPGA systems composed of SRAM-based FPGAs developed by Xilinx Corporation, proposes a novel configuration technique by using Platform Flash PROM XCF 32 P. Using this scheme, only adopting one XCF 32 P and one Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) we can configure four FPGAs with monolithic configuration data smaller than 8 Mbit. When the number of FPGA is more than four, <b>Design</b> <b>revisioning</b> allows the user to cascade more XCF 32 P PROMs to realize. Since Xilinx Platform PROM and Xilinx FPGA/CPLD are used to get a single-vender solution, the design for hardware and software is simplified.

40|$|The epistemic {{program in}} game theory uses formal models of {{interactive}} reasoning to provide foundations for various game-theoretic solution concepts. Much {{of this work}} is based around the (static) Aumann structure model of interactive epistemology, but more recently dynamic models of interactive reasoning have been developed, most notably by Stalnaker [39] and Battigalli and Siniscalchi [6], and used to analyze rational play in extensive form games. But while the properties of Kripke structures are well understood, without a formal language in which belief and belief <b>revision</b> <b>statements</b> can be expressed, it is unclear exactly what are the properties of these dynamic models. Here we investigate this question, by defining such a language. A semantics and syntax are presented, with soundness and completeness theorems linking the two. ...|$|R
