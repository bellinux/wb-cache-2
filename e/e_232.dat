Assessment of p 97 /VCP oligomerization revealed that p 97 R 155 P and p 97 A <b>232</b> <b>E</b> formed hexameric ring-shaped structures of ∼ 600 kDa. p 97 R 155 P and p 97 A <b>232</b> <b>E</b> exhibited an ∼ 3 -fold increase in ATPase activity compared to wild-type p 97 (p 97 WT) and displayed increased sensitivity to heat-induced upregulation of ATPase activity. Protein fluorescence analysis provided evidence for conformational differences in the D 2 rings of both hIBMPFTD mutants. Furthermore, both mutations increased the proteolytic susceptibility of the D 2 ring. The solution structures of all p 97 /VCP proteins revealed a didispersed distribution of a predominant hexameric population and a minor population of large-diameter complexes. ATP binding significantly increased the abundance of large-diameter complexes for p 97 R 155 P and p 97 A <b>232</b> <b>E,</b> but not p 97 WT or the ATP-binding mutant p 97 K 524 A.

Recently, we reported that the S 3 -S 4 linker of HCN 1 channels influences activation, and {{that part of the}} linker is helical with the determinants G 231, M <b>232,</b> and <b>E</b> 235 clustered on one side. Here we explored the undefined role of the G 231 <b>E</b> 235 M <b>232</b> triplet by systematic substitutions. Replacing G 231 or M 232 next to the "neighboring" E 235 in the S 3 -S 4 helix with an anionic residue (i. e., G 231 <b>E,</b> M <b>232</b> <b>E)</b> rendered channels non-functional although they were localized on the membrane surface. Interestingly, this loss of function could be readily rescued either by introducing a countercharge at position 235 (G 231 E/E 235 R, M 232 E/E 235 R) or by interchanging residues 231 or 232 and 235 (G 231 E/E 235 G, M 232 E/E 235 M).

40|$|AbstractMutations of the cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cause CF disease by altering the biosynthesis, maturation, folding and ion conductance of this protein. Our laboratory {{has focused on}} expression and structural analysis of the CFTR transmembrane (TM) domains using two-TM segments (i. e., helix–loop–helix constructs) which we term ‘helical hairpins’; these represent the minimal model of tertiary contacts between two helices in a membrane. Previous studies on a library of TM 3 / 4 hairpins of the first CFTR TM domain suggested that introduction of non-native polar residues into TM 4 can compromise CFTR function through side chain-side chain H-bonding interactions with native Q 207 in TM 3 [Choi, M.

Comparative analysis of 15 N and 1 H chemical shift variations among HSQC spectra of WT-, V 232 D-, I 231 D- and Q 207 N/V 232 E-TM 3 / 4 indicated that hairpin conformations vary with the position of a polar mutation (i. <b>e.,</b> V <b>232</b> D and I 231 D vs. WT), but remain similar when hairpins with identically-positioned polar partners are compared (i. <b>e.,</b> V <b>232</b> D vs. Q 207 N-V <b>232</b> <b>E).</b> The overall findings suggest that a polar mutation in a TM helix can potentially distort native interfacial packing determinants in membrane proteins such as CFTR, with consequences that may lead to disease...|$|R

40|$|Proteins of the CLC {{family are}} {{comprised}} of two subunits, {{each with its}} own fast-gated protopore, both of these being regulated simultaneously by a slower common gate. Based on the X-ray crystal structure of a bacterial CLC, the carboxyl side chain of glutamate residue <b>E</b> <b>232</b> has been proposed as the fast gate of hClC- 1, swinging into each pore to close it and competing with chloride. We now show, using hClC- 1 mutants expressed in whole-cell patch-clamped HEK 293 cells, that elimination of this side chain in the <b>E</b> <b>232</b> Q mutation prevents fast gate closure at all voltages but common gating is also eliminated suggesting that <b>E</b> <b>232</b> could be the final effector of both fast and common gating. We hypothesise that the conformational information essential for common gating flows between the two <b>E</b> <b>232</b> protopore residues across the intra-membrane interface, rather than via any cytoplasmic carboxyl-tail interface, to drive common gating. Informed by in silico modelling, we have produced five site-directed mutants that increase the volumes of residues which might be involved in allosteric transfer (A 272 V, A 272 L, S 289 L, V 292 L and T 293 L) and assessed them for effects on gating.

Methods: During April to August 2011, a total of <b>232</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates were collected from various clinical specimens of patients. Isolates were identified, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened for ESBL production as per standard methods. The double-disk diffusion method was used to confirm ESBL production using antimicrobial disks of ceftazidime (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), with or without clavulanic acid (10 μg). A zone difference of > 5 mm between disks was considered indicative of ESBL production. Results: Out of <b>232</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates, 70 (30. 2 %) {{were found to be}} positive for ESBL by the applied phenotypic methods. ESBL-producing isolates yielded high resistance rates for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (98. 6 %), tetracycline (88. 6 %), nalidixic acid (81. 4 %) and ciprofloxacin (81. 4 %). The highest antimicrobial activities of ESBL-producing isolates were observed for amikacin (95. 7 %), followed by tobramicin (74. 3 %) and nitrofurantoin (68. 6 %). Resistance to quinolones, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol was higher in ESBL than non-ESBL isolates (p< 0. 05). The frequency of ESBL-producing isolates varied among hospitals (18. 2 % to 45. 1 %), although a high prevalence was recorded as 45. 1 % at Khartoum Teaching Hospital.

ABSTRACT: Myotonia congenita is an inherited disease caused by loss-of-function mutations of the skeletal muscle ClC- 1 chloride channel, characterized by impaired muscle relaxation after contraction and stiffness. In the present study, we provided an in-depth characterization of F 484 L, a mutation previously identified in dominant myotonia, in order to define the genotype-phenotype correlation, and to elucidate the contribution of this pore residue to the mechanisms of ClC- 1 gating. Patch-clamp recordings showed that F 484 L reduced chloride currents at every tested potential and dramatically right-shifted the voltage dependence of slow gating, thus contributing to the mild clinical phenotype of affected heterozygote carriers. Unlike dominant mutations located at the dimer interface, no dominant-negative effect was observed when F 484 L mutant subunits were co-expressed with wild type. Molecular dynamics simulations further revealed that F 484 L affected the slow gate by increasing the frequency and stability of the H-bond formation between the pore residue <b>E</b> <b>232</b> and the R helix residue Y 578. In addition, using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we characterized three other myotonic ClC- 1 mutations. We proved that the dominant L 198 P mutation in the channel pore also right-shifted the voltage dependence of slow gating, recapitulating mild myotonia. The recessive V 640 G mutant drastically reduced channel function, which probably accounts for myotonia. In contrast, the recessive L 628 P mutant produced currents very similar to wild type, suggesting that the occurrence of the compound truncating mutation (Q 812 X) or other muscle-specific mechanisms accounted for the severe symptoms observed in this family. Our results provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying normal and altered ClC- 1 function...|$|E
40|$|Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing {{proteins}} that control embryonic development in multiple contexts. Up to 30 Hox genes, distributed among all four clusters, are expressed during mammalian kidney morphogenesis, but functional redundancy between them {{has made a}} detailed functional account difficult to achieve. We have investigated {{the role of the}} HoxD cluster through comparative molecular embryological analysis of a set of mouse strains carrying targeted genomic rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, and inversions. This analysis allowed us to uncover and genetically dissect the complex role of the HoxD cluster. Regulation of metanephric mesenchyme-ureteric bud interactions and maintenance of structural integrity of tubular epithelia are differentially controlled by some Hoxd genes during renal development, consistent with their specific expression profiles. We also provide evidence for a kidney-specific form of colinearity that underlies the differential expression of two distinct sets of genes located on both sides and overlapping at the Hoxd 9 locus. These insights further our knowledge of the genetic control of kidney morphogenesis and may contribute to understanding certain congenital kidney malformations, including polycystic kidney disease and renal hypoplasia.

40|$|In Laser Materials Processing {{there has}} always been a need for {{suitable}} methods to supervise and monitor the processes on line, to ensure correct production quality or to trigger alarms when failures are detected. Numerous investigations have been made in this field, including experimental and theoretical work. It is common practice in this field to monitor surface temperature, plasma radiation and back-reflected laser light, coaxially with the laser beam. Traditionally, the monitoring systems involved carry out no statistical analysis of the signals received - they merely involve thresholds. This thesis looks at the feedback collected during laser welding using such a co-axial setup from a Digital Signal Processing point of view and also uses high speed video photography to correlate signal perturbations with process anomalies. Modern Digital Signal Processing techniques such as Kalman filtering, Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis have been applied to the measurement data and have generated new ways to describe the weld behaviour using parameters such as reflected pulse shape. The limitations of commercially available welding supervision systems have been studied and design suggestions for the next generation of on line weld monitoring equipment have been formulated.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellar motor is a {{rotary motor}} {{in the cell}} envelope of bacteria that couples ion flow across the cytoplasmic membrane to torque generation by independent stators anchored to the cell wall. The recent observation of stepwise rotation of a Na(+) -driven chimeric motor in Escherichia coli promises to reveal the mechanism of the motor in unprecedented detail. We measured torque-speed relationships of this chimeric motor using back focal plane interferometry of polystyrene beads attached to flagellar filaments {{in the presence of}} high sodium-motive force (85 mM Na(+)). With full expression of stator proteins the torque-speed curve had the same shape as those of wild-type E. coli and Vibrio alginolyticus motors: the torque is approximately constant (at approximately 2200 pN nm) from stall up to a "knee" speed of approximately 420 Hz, and then falls linearly with speed, extrapolating to zero torque at approximately 910 Hz. Motors containing one to five stators generated approximately 200 pN nm per stator at speeds up to approximately 100 Hz/stator; the knee speed in 4 - and 5 -stator motors is not significantly slower than in the fully induced motor. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the absolute torque depends on stator number, but the speed dependence does not. In motors with point mutations in either of two critical conserved charged residues in the cytoplasmic domain of PomA, R 88 A and R <b>232</b> <b>E,</b> the zero-torque speed was reduced to approximately 400 Hz. The torque at low speed was unchanged by mutation R 88 A but was reduced to approximately 1500 pN nm by R <b>232</b> <b>E.</b> These results, interpreted using a simple kinetic model, indicate that the basic mechanism of torque generation is the same regardless of stator type and coupling ion and that the electrostatic interaction between stator and rotor proteins is related to the torque-speed relationship...|$|R
