25|$|Dehejia {{states that}} Vedic {{literature}} has {{no mention of}} any practice resembling Sati. There is only one mention in the Vedas, of a widow lying down beside her dead husband who is asked to leave the grieving {{and return to the}} living, then prayer is offered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> life for her with children and wealth. Dehejia writes that this passage does not imply a pre-existing sati custom, nor of widow remarriage, nor that it is authentic verse because its solitary mention may also be explained as a later date insertion into the text. Dehejia writes that no ancient or early medieval era Buddhist texts mention sati, and if the practice existed it would likely have been condemned by these texts.|$|E
25|$|Some romance novel {{authors and}} readers believe the genre has {{additional}} restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the protagonists' meeting {{early on in}} the story), to avoiding themes (such as adultery). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the romantic love between the two main characters (e.g., Romeo and Juliet). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules. Therefore, the general definition, as embraced by the RWA and publishers, includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending.|$|E

Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize the potential <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> life with her. Some critics viewed it as a sequel to Beyoncé's 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] as the two songs are thematically similar.

The ballad was also likened to Vanessa Carlton's 2002 single [...] "A Thousand Miles" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|The Kampung Boy was {{successful}} {{due to its}} realistic presentation of Malaysia's cultural past. [...] Many Malaysians {{who grew up in}} the 1960s or earlier fondly remembered the laidback lives they had in the kampung upon reading the book. [...] Stevenson said that The Kampung Boys portrayal of the past would resonate with everyone's fondness <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> experience in his or her own past. [...] Those unfamiliar with the ways of the kampung could relate to the [...] "universal themes of childhood, adolescence, and first-love". [...] According to Stevenson, the illustrations help to clarify any unfamiliar terms the reader might face and the narrative force of Lat's story depends more on the protagonist's experiences than on the details. [...] The book's appeal to both children and adults lies in Lat's success in recapturing the innocence of childhood.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for The New York Times Book Review, noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, [...] "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> surprise." [...] Helen Adams Masten of the Saturday Review called the book Geisel's tour de force and wrote, [...] "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their {{children are going to}} have the exciting experience of learning that they can read after all." [...] Polly Goodwin of the Chicago Sunday Tribune predicted that The Cat in the Hat would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to [...] "look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters".|$|E

40|$|There is {{consistent}} evidence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moderate negative {{association between the}} pursuit of financial goals and subjective well-being (SWB; cf. Dittmar, 2008; Kasser & Kanner, 2004). However, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that this negative link may hold only with respect to particular motives for wanting money (Sheldon, Ryan, Deci, & Kasser, 2004; Srivastava, Locke, & Bartol, 2001). We propose the quest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> self and success as two additional motives not examined previously, and examine a model in which the financial goal-SWB link is reduced to nonsignificance once money-motives are taken into account. Structural equation modeling in two studies, one with student samples from the United Kingdom and Iceland (N = 145, N = 139) and one with professional employees in the United Kingdom (N = 261), provides empirical support for the model, and demonstrates that the quest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> self through money is a particularly negative predictor of well-being...|$|R

500|$|In the Pāli Canon, {{an enlightened}} person {{is said to}} be neutral in terms of karma, that is, the person no longer generates karma, merit, or demerit. Some {{scholars}} have interpreted this to mean that an enlightened person attains a state where distinctions between good and evil no longer exist. Other scholars have criticized this as making little sense, considering how the Buddha would normally emphasize ethics. The fact that an enlightened person is neutral in terms of karma, does not mean he is [...] neutral. Indeed, the Buddha is quoted in the Tipiṭaka as saying he is foremost in 'higher morality' (adhisīla). Keown attempts to overcome this problem by proposing that enlightened people are beyond the accumulative experience of good deeds (merit, puñña), since they are already perfected. They therefore do not need to accumulate goodness and the resulting happiness anymore. They no longer need to strive <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> rebirth in the next life, because they have gone beyond rebirth. Their enlightenment is, however, an [...] perfection as well, though this is solely described as kusala, not as puñña.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique".

500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review feeling the episode to explore [...] "Torchwoods {{bread and butter}} topic: {{the intersection of the}} human and the alien, {{and what it means to}} be human in the aftermath." [...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up".
