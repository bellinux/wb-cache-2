5|$|In 1912, Selbie, then General Manager, {{thought that}} some professionalism was needed and {{suggested}} a company be formed {{to take over}} from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. World War I delayed these plans and it was 1919, with expectation of a <b>housing</b> <b>boom,</b> before Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice, which was that although the Met had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it. An independent company was created, although {{all but one of}} its directors were also directors of the Met. MRCE developed estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner, and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth, and created places such as Harrow Garden Village.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increased}} flood protection {{afforded by the}} Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California <b>housing</b> <b>boom</b> in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transition—from agricultural to urban. The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplain—an area once occupied by farms—and the river became confined to a narrow channel—a flood {{similar to the ones}} surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as urban runoff. In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Dam—probably saving Orange County from an even greater flood—Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} extent to which {{manufacturing}} decline and <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> contributed to changes in U. S. non-employment during the 2000 s. Using a local labor market design, we estimate that manufacturing decline significantly increased non-employment during 2000 - 2007, while local <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> decreased non-employment by roughly the same magnitude. The effects of manufacturing decline persist through 2011, but we find no persistent non-employment effects of local <b>housing</b> <b>booms,</b> most plausibly because <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> were associated with subsequent busts of similar magnitude. We also find that <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> significantly reduce the likelihood that displaced manufacturing workers remain non-employed, suggesting that <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> “mask”non-employment growth that would have otherwise occurred earlier {{in the absence of the}} booms. Applying our estimates to the national labor market, we find that hosing booms reduced non-employment growth by roughly 30 percent during 2000 - 2007 and that roughly 40 percent of the aggregate increase in non-employment during 2000 - 2011 can be attributed to manufacturing decline. Collectively, our results suggest that much of the non-employment growth during the 2000 s can be attributed to manufacturing decline and these effects would have appeared in aggregate statistics earlier had i...|$|R

40|$|JOB MARKET PAPER This paper {{incorporates}} speculation {{into the}} standard supply-and-demand frame-work {{used to analyze}} <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> and busts. Speculation reverses the common intu-ition that elastic housing supply attenuates <b>housing</b> <b>booms.</b> <b>Housing</b> market frictions make land a more attractive speculative investment than housing. As a result, unde-veloped land both facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This insight explains the frequent <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> and busts that coincide with high construction activity (e. g. Las Vegas, 2000 - 2010). These episodes {{are most likely to}} occur when a housing market nears but has not yet reached a long-run development constraint. Consistent with the recent U.

25|$|The state, {{especially}} around {{the capital of}} Cuernavaca, has experienced a <b>housing</b> <b>boom</b> since the late 1990s.

Finally, the empirical findings uncover positive duration dependence in <b>housing</b> market <b>booms</b> of European and non-European countries and housing busts of European countries.

25|$|Many of {{the earlier}} homes were {{replaced}} by multi-unit apartment structures. Early, smaller apartment buildings predominate in the area, particularly along Second Avenue.

With Ridgewood developer August Bauer, they built 150 single-family row houses by 1928. In 1931, Bauer, collaborating with builder Paul Stier, built some 7-room houses at 78th Street and Furmanville Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Vlach's theory {{behind the}} earlier African origin {{is tied to}} the history of New Orleans. In 1803 there were 1,355 free blacks in the city. By 1810 blacks outnumbered whites 10,500 to 4,500. This caused a <b>housing</b> <b>boom.</b> As many of both the {{builders}} and inhabitants were Africans by way of Haiti, Vlach maintained it is only natural they modeled the new homes after ones they left behind in their homeland.

25|$|In 1855, the Sydney-Parramatta railway {{was built}} {{through the area}} {{which led to a}} <b>housing</b> <b>boom</b> around the {{stations}} at Ashfield and Burwood.

In 1874 a new station was built on the boundary of the two areas and was named Five Dock after another settlement to the north. Because Five Dock was actually a long way north some confusion ensued and Ashfield Council renamed the station in 1876 to Croydon after the suburb in London. The suburb remains divided between the two neighbouring councils to this day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} heterogeneous beliefs among {{households in}} a small open economy model for the Canadian economy. The model suggests that simultaneous boom-bust cycles in house prices, output, investment, consumption and hours worked emerge when credit-constrained mortgage borrowers expect that future house prices will rise and this expectation is neither shared by savers nor realized ex-post. With sticky prices and a standard monetary policy rule, the model shows that the nominal policy interest rate and the CPI inflation rate decline during <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> and rise as house prices fall. These results replicate the stylized features of housing-market boom-bust cycles in industrialized countries. Policy experiments demonstrate that stronger policy responses to inflation amplify housing-market boom-bust cycles. Also, higher loan-to-value ratios amplify housing-market boom-bust cycles by encouraging speculative housing investments by mortgage borrowers during <b>housing</b> <b>booms</b> and increasing liquidation of housing collateral during housing busts.

25|$|Very little housing {{had been}} built during the Great Depression and World War, except for {{emergency}} quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended {{on the availability of}} automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great <b>housing</b> <b>boom.</b> Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing non-farm units had been constructed from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 units built annually from 1946 through 1955.|$|E
25|$|The Report also legislated on the required, minimum {{standards}} necessary for further suburban construction; this included regulation on the maximum housing density and their arrangement and it even made recommendations on the ideal number of bedrooms and other rooms per house.

The design of many of these houses, highly characteristic of the era, was heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement, taking influence from Tudor Revival, chalet style, and even ship design.|$|E
