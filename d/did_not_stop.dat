In a 2010 student referendum the JCR decided to reaffiliate. However, in 2013, in a fresh referendum, the Oriel JCR again voted to disaffiliate from OUSU.|$|E

5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{would be}} {{automatically}} included in any British {{declaration of war}} due to its lack of diplomatic powers, but that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the colonial government from attempting to demonstrate its loyalty and legislative independence through supportive parliamentary motions and gestures.

5|$|At the 13 February 1971 election, Askin's {{majority}} {{was reduced}} by four seats to the Labor Party under Pat Hills.

5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, city leaders debated the {{responsibility}} and expense {{of creating a}} waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s {{as a sign of}} prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. With little regard for beauty, steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Pechersky {{was arrested}} by the Soviet {{authorities}} along with his brother during the countrywide Rootless cosmopolitan campaign against the Jews suspected of pro-Western leanings. Only after Stalin's death in 1953 was he released from jail {{due in part to}} mounting international pressure. However, the harassment <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> there. Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet government from testifying in multiple international trials related to Sobibor, including the Eichmann Trial in Israel. The last time he was refused the permission to exit the country and testify was in 1987, for a trial in Poland.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's lure <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> at that. On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent}} to the Allied {{headquarters}} at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E
5|$|Patton <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> {{with the}} {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The French {{opened fire}} on the forts of Salé at 10:00a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated {{instantly}} with forty batteries of artillery weapons. An hour into the confrontation, the batteries in Salé were destroyed, and the artillery in Rabat were damaged to a level that they became almost useless. The French fire intensified, but at 3:30p.m., the damaged batteries {{were removed from the}} city by Moroccan forces; however, resistance <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> until 5:00p.m. Sané and Gomer, lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle, while Henri IV continued its barrage on the city until 7:00a.m. the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{government}} confiscated {{portions of}} land {{owned by the}} landed gentry {{in order to raise}} revenue for these projects, an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the Song's defensive preparations. Financial matters were made worse by the fact that many wealthy, land-owning families—some of which had officials working for the government—used their social connections with those in office in order to obtain tax-exempt status.|$|E
5|$|The gentry {{distinguished}} {{themselves in}} society through their intellectual and antiquarian pursuits, while {{the homes of}} prominent landholders attracted a variety of courtiers, including artisans, artists, educational tutors, and entertainers. Despite the disdain for trade, commerce and the merchant class exhibited by the highly cultured and elite exam-drafted scholar-officials, commercialism played {{a prominent role in}} Song culture and society. A scholar-official would be frowned upon by his peers if he pursued means of profiteering outside of his official salary; however, this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> many scholar-officials from managing business relations through the use of intermediary agents.|$|E
5|$|This {{apparent}} {{reconciliation between}} Venice and the Pope <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the French from again invading the Veneto in March. Pitigliano's death in January had left Andrea Gritti {{in command of}} the Venetian forces; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis, the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May. Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army, but Louis, more concerned by the death of his advisor, the Cardinal d'Amboise, abandoned his plans for a siege.|$|E

5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens in 1946, {{the first year}} since his motion picture debut {{that there was no}} Spencer Tracy release. His next film was The Sea of Grass (1947) a drama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm {{response}} from critics <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. He followed it later that year with Cass Timberlane, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.|$|E
5|$|Until 1999, {{competing}} {{songs were}} only permitted in Swedish, apart from 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975.
