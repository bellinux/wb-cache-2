40|$|Adaptation {{to climate}} change” {{as a new}} field of {{knowledge}} challenges agricultural and <b>horticultural</b> (vocational) <b>education</b> and extension. Farmers and horticulturists are confronted with vague scientific findings at best. A broad variety of global climate scenarios is “projected” onto regions and exact predictions are usually not possible. Often, personal observations and experiences seem to contradict scientific assertions. Under this condition farmers and policy makers must decide about future land use. What does this imply for capacity building? How to transform insecurity into concrete educational measures and programs? The authors discuss their first experiences within a German R&D network (INKA BB) in which they develop capacity building programs. Two examples from urban agriculture / urban gardening {{will be used as}} case studies. Strengths and weaknesses of the development processes and their management will be discussed. Since the topic is complex and adaptation is a continuous activity, learning in connection with climate change adaptation ideally begins on elementary level, continues in higher and vocational training, and does not end with extension. In other words: “learning chains” must be developed which enable life-long learning in formal, non-formal and informal learning environments. Competencies are needed beyond classical technological and economic skills. Problem solving - from problem perception, analysis, generation of alternative solutions, to implementation and evaluation - with a key competence in critical analysis and reflection of contemporary research findings - gain in importance. In INKA BB, participation is seen as axiomatic. As a consequence, an action-oriented, participatory approach has been chosen which enables mutual learning among partners from research, formal and informal, elementary, higher and vocational education. A crucial point is the question of “Who could be the bridge between science and the educational practitioner?” In INKA BB, a specific working group (the subproject on “Knowledge Management and Transfer”) facilitates the development processes and therefore plays a liaison role between theory and practice. In the long-run, sustainable ownership of this process must be achieved. A combination of network building, mutual learning in permanent work groups, provision of technical trainings, and joint planning, testing, monitoring and evaluation is seen as a precondition...|$|R

40|$|Horticulture is the {{fastest-growing}} {{sector of the}} agricultural industry, and this is true particularly in Iowa where the number of private horticultural businesses {{has more than doubled}} since 1993. The industry is relying more on non-English–speaking employees, especially Spanish-speaking workers, for golf course maintenance, landscape installation, and nursery production. Determining and serving the educational and training needs of a workforce that is not fluent in English is historically difficult for university extension programs. This study assessed educational needs and technical issues of English-speaking managers of primarily Spanish-speaking workers in the horticultural industry in Iowa, with special attention to language and cultural issues. Four focus groups were conducted, with managers recruited in cooperation with state professional horticultural associations. Communication gaps and challenges interpreting cultural differences were cited as key difficulties experienced by managers of Latino workers. The study produced a list of ideas for educational initiatives that would improve lateral (two-way) communications and delivery of Iowa-specific <b>horticultural</b> <b>education</b> and job-site training between English-speaking managers and Latino employees...|$|E
40|$|Horticultural {{knowledge}} and skills training have been with humankind for some 10, 000 to 20, 000 years. With permanent settlement and rising wealth and trade, horticulture products and services became a source of fresh food for daily consumption, {{and a source of}} plant material in developing a quality environment and lifestyle. The knowledge of horticulture and the skills of its practitioners have been demonstrated through the advancing civilizations in both eastern and western countries. With the rise of the Agricultural Revolutions in Great Britain, and more widely across Continental Europe in the 17 th and 18 th centuries, as well as the move towards colonisation and early migration to the New Worlds, many westernised countries established the early institutions that would provide education and training in agriculture and horticulture. Today many of these colleges and universities provide undergraduate, postgraduate and vocational and technical training that specifically targets horticulture and/or horticultural science with some research and teaching institutions also providing extension and advisory services to industry. The objective of this chapter is to describe the wider pedagogic and educational context in which those concerned with horticulture operate, the institutional structures that target horticulture and horticultural science education and training internationally; examine changing educational formats, especially distance education; and consider strategies for attracting and retaining young people in the delivery of world-class <b>horticultural</b> <b>education.</b> In this chapter we set the context by investigating the <b>horticultural</b> <b>education</b> and training options available, the constraints that prevent young people entering horticulture, and suggest strategies that would attract and retain these students. We suggest that effective strategies and partnerships be put in place by the institution, the government and most importantly the industry to provide for undergraduate and postgraduate education in horticulture and horticultural science; that educational and vocational training institutions, government, and industry need to work more effectively together to improve communication about horticulture and horticultural science in order to attract enrolments of more and talented students; and that the horticulture curriculum be continuously evaluated and revised so that it remains relevant to future challenges facing the industries of horticulture in the production, environmental and social spheres. These strategies {{can be used as a}} means to develop successful programs and case studies that would provide better information to high school career counsellors, improve the image of horticulture and encourage greater involvement from alumni and the industries in recruitment, provide opportunities to improve career aspirations, ensure improved levels of remuneration, and promote the social features of the profession and greater awareness and recognition of the profession in the wider community. A successful career in horticulture demands intellectual capacities which are capable of drawing knowledge from a wide field of basic sciences, economics and the humanities and integrating this into academic scholarship and practical technologies...|$|E

Master Gardener programs have been seen as a way to provide <b>horticultural</b> <b>education,</b> while also providing outreach using the program??s service requirement. Extension professionals have used a variety of training methods throughout the years. These methods include face-to-face workshop trainings, interactive television, and more recently World Wide Web methodologies. This study sought to test the effectiveness of CD-based training materials versus a traditional face-to-face training. Turfgrass management modules chosen for testing in this study included nutrient, water, and pest topics. Participants?? knowledge levels were measured using a pre-test/post-test design. Student satisfaction with the learning materials and their perceptions of lawn care also were measured during the study. Results indicated that CD-based materials were more effective than were face-to- face workshops for teaching difficult turfgrass material to the Master Gardener trainees. Community development is one of the four focus areas for Texas Cooperative Extension. A secondary purpose was to determine if the Master Gardener program affected community development. Descriptive statistics were used to compare participants?? past experiences with their anticipated experiences after completion of the Master Gardener program. Results indicated that community development activities were being completed, but the extent and type of development could not be measured. This study revealed several surprising and far-reaching implications for extension programming. These implications and recommendations for improvement of extension programs are discussed further.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{horticulture}} {{has been a}} rapidly expanding industry in Australia and New Zealand, {{with an increase in}} the value of both the production and lifestyle sectors. In contrast, the last 25 years has seen a significant decline in student numbers, graduates, course titles and descriptions of horticulture offered as applied science or horticultural science in Australia and New Zealand. A 2008 - 2009 study evaluated the opportunities for <b>horticultural</b> <b>education,</b> training and careers in Australia and New Zealand. A survey was conducted in association with 20 Universities that offered agricultural/horticultural/environmental science programs both in Australia and New Zealand. Results show that horticulture has become marginalized within Australian and New Zealand academia and universities. Of the 47 recognized universities in Australia and New Zealand only 10 % offered horticulture as a standalone degree program. Less than 20 % offered horticulture either as a major, as a core discipline area, or as an individual subject. This trend is less apparent in vocational education and training. Some initiatives are in place to address these challenges. These promote horticulture and/or science and improve program delivery (specializations, dual degrees, industry-based degrees). Other initiatives include the adoption of new methods of learning (e-learning, web-based systems) and approaches to promote horticulture as a career and profession. These and similar initiatives may help to improve the image of horticulture as a profession and ensure courses remain relevant in a changing world. To meet industry needs, future horticultural research, teaching and training may need to encompass technical, marketing and leadership skills...|$|E
40|$|Lyons, Robert E. While gardens {{typically}} offer educational {{programming for}} adults and elementary school-aged children, many institutions struggle with serving the teenage audience, defined in this research as youth ages 13 - 19. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the current state of adolescent programming in order to aid and inspire institutions to create and implement positive development opportunities for teenagers, and to take on a greater role in the cultural and <b>horticultural</b> <b>education</b> of today’s adolescents. Using a mixed methods approach, both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to characterize adolescent programming, as well as to identify the institutional benefits, the potential challenges, and the strategies of offering long-term adolescent programming. Institutional members of the American Public Gardens Association completed an initial survey. The Chicago Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden were selected to serve as case study sites representing large institutions; the perspectives of smaller institutions were captured through phone interviews with staff at the Delaware Center for Horticulture, Fellows Riverside Garden, and Bowman’s Hill Wildflower Preserve. A follow-up survey of directors of institutions offering long-term adolescent programming was also completed. The results of the survey yielded statistics on the current state of adolescent programming, including the amount and types of programming being offered. Seven institutional benefits emerged, with the three major benefits being building relationships with new audiences, building interest in horticulture, and supporting the institution’s mission and growth. And seven potential challenges were identified, with the three major challenges being funding, staff time, and adolescent interest. A list of seven overarching strategies was also developed, highlighting the areas of high quality staff, curriculum, partnerships, youth decision-making, compensation, engaging activities, and evaluation.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the current status of postharvest horticulture education, research training and consultancy in the Asia-Pacific region with an emphasis on the universities in the region. In a recent survey conducted results show that about one-third of universities in the region have baccalaureate and/or postgraduate qualifications that target postharvest horticulture. However, there is a general consensus that there are insufficient postgraduates in postharvest horticulture currently entering the market to replace those that were retiring. There is also an emerging opportunity for training people at the vocational level to provide the necessary skills/artisan training in postharvest horticulture and food technology. Higher priority areas for research training are in quality assurance, handling, packaging and transport, maturation, ripening and product losses, and storage and in consultancy area the higher priority areas are in handling, packaging and transport, cool chain and storage, economics, market access, and quality assurance. Challenges to be faced in the research and teaching sectors of postharvest horticulture include the need to seek further investment so as to strengthen a weak research and development sector, and greater collaborative and interdisciplinary research and teaching with the institutions and institutes, both nationally and internationally...|$|E
40|$|Burnley Gardens has {{a history}} {{spanning}} 140 years. Its history parallels much of Victoria's history. From its earliest beginnings in 1861, it {{was involved in the}} assessment of produce for the growing colony. This vital work was undertaken by a group of prominent citizens, including Ferdinand von Mueller, and their society later became Victoria's Royal Horticultural Society. A victim of Australia's first Depression, Burnley Gardens was acquired in 1891 by the Victorian government, where it established Australia's first school of horticulture. So began its role in <b>horticultural</b> <b>education</b> in Australia, championing educational opportunities for women at a time when these were both controversial and limited. By promoting their admission and in many cases employing them as teachers, it provided support for the tenuous careers of Australia's pioneering women landscape designers. The changing needs of the workforce and the economy meant a shift in emphasis between production horticulture, agriculture, and amenity horticulture. Throughout au these changes, the grounds were used as an outdoor laboratory, with trialling of plants and education of students and the public undertaken. Burnley graduates were employed throughout Australia in every sphere of horticulture, and the Burnley method of horticultural practice was widespread throughout the country, influencing generations of people in the horticultural field. As a government institution, social policy was also implemented at Burnley. The initial geometric and symmetrical form of Burnley Gardens was redesigned between 1897 and 1907 in the English derived 'free' or landscape style, and though an actively utilised teaching garden, it has matured into a landscape of great ambience and beauty. Throughout its long history, Burnley Gardens has provided pleasure and respite from the neighbouring industrialized experience of Richmond, and for the wider Melbourne community.

40|$|Research {{shows that}} a diet rich in fruit and {{vegetables}} {{is associated with a}} decreased risk of many chronic diseases and can form part of an effective weight management strategy. However, only one in five children consume the recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables - and there are wider concerns about the steady increase in childhood obesity. Garden enhanced education in schools is increasingly recognised as a promising strategy for promoting healthier eating for children. It may also have other benefits, such as promoting environmental awareness. Whilst {{a growing body of research}} indicates the positive impact of focused interventions led by external experts, less is known about the effectiveness of multi-component programmes sustained by stakeholders from the school community. The Food for Life Partnership Flagship growing skills programme is one part of a whole school food reform initiative in England in which schools are assisted to make comprehensive changes to their garden based educational work. Drawing upon the reports of lead teaching staff, this report focuses on 76 participating schools (55 primary, 19 secondary, 2 special) from the year prior to enrolment to approximately 18 months into the programme. Prior to enrolment, the majority of schools lacked the basic facilities needed to deliver an effective garden enhanced education; staff with applied horticultural skills; specific safety guidelines; or multiple links between growing activities and the curriculum. The FFLP growing skills programme is associated with a range of positive changes for schools: New training in <b>horticultural</b> <b>education</b> for staff in over three quarter of cases.

H. F. du Pont was passionately involved with horticulture for the majority of his long life. Today the magnificent gardens and landscape of his former estate, "Winterthur," north of Wilmington, Delaware, attest to his horticultural and aesthetic genius. Yet little is known about H.

He helped with the workmen's chores on the estate and gained practical experience in husbandry and horticulture. At the age of thirteen he was sent to boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts, where he further enjoyed horticulture as a pastime. But it was during his college career at Harvard University that H. F. du Pont began seriously to pursue a formal education in horticulture. He studied horticultural practices, landscape design, and plants at Harvard' s Bussey Institution, one of America' s first colleges of practical agriculture and horticulture. Receiving his Bachelors degree from Harvard in 1903, H. F. du Pont continued to develop his horticultural knowledge by visiting the great gardens, nurseries, and exhibitions of the day in Europe and America; by reading extensively; by cultivating a friendship with the talented landscape architect Marian Cruger Coffin; and by establishing relations with amateur and professional plantsmen such as Charles Sprague Sargent. Simultaneously, he carried out a series of horticultural experiments at Winterthur, testing both plants and design ideas. Further inspired by the English school of gardening, his efforts transformed the grounds of the family estate into a very personal vision of horticultural beauty and order. Upon his inheritance of the Winterthur estate in 1927 following his father's death, H. F. du Pont was ready to apply all that he had learned over the previous forty-seven years to the creation of Winterthur Gardens...|$|E
