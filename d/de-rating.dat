50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{attributes}} that shall {{be considered in}} the component placement system: accuracy, speed and flexibility. Accuracy involves the aspects of resolution, placement accuracy and repeatability. Speed involves the aspects of equipment placement rate, <b>de-rating</b> strategy and production through-put. Placement rate is determined by machine type and the distance between components on a board. Flexibility involves the aspects of component variety, number of feeders and PCB size range.|$|E

50|$|Three phase {{induction}} motors {{are probably}} {{the most common type of}} three phase load and are used in a variety of equipment including refrigeration, pumps, air conditioning, conveyor drives as well as their more obvious applications. The <b>de-rating</b> effects of overvoltage and three phase imbalance on AC motors are well known. Excessive overvoltage results in saturation of the iron core, wasting energy through eddy currents and increased hysteresis losses. Drawing excessive current results in excess heat output due to copper losses. The additional stress of overvoltage on motors will decrease motor lifetime.|$|E

50|$|The Oakey-Cooyer {{branch line}} is also of early {{surveying}} significance. Rail engineering {{practice of the}} period avoided the construction of tunnels, so significant surveying was undertaken to avoid tunnelling and to minimise rail gradients. The largest gradient of a line mandates a larger, more expensive loco or a <b>de-rating</b> of carrying capacity, both of which {{would result in a}} less economical service for the line as a whole. The Oakey-Cooyar branch line was repeatedly surveyed to arrive at its built route, which had a negligible gradient over its length, but which required the 300m tunnel. The low gradient required a devious route, particularly at Narko and adjacent to the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Unemployment {{remained}} {{a major issue}} in Bethnal Green at the 1929 general election, both workers and for rate-payers, who had seen high rates to pay for relief for those out of work, leading to closure of factories. The Conservative campaign of Captain Alan Bell focused on <b>de-rating,</b> and the Liberal candidate Major Harry Nathan stressed the employment-generating prospects of LLoyd George's plans to cut armaments and boost road-building. Bell and Nathan blamed each other for splitting the anti-Socialist vote, but when the votes were counted Bell's 7.7% was low enough to allow Nathan to take the seat from Windsor with a majority of 589 votes (2.5%).|$|E

50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring <b>de-rating</b> the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.) An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|E
50|$|Donnellan became {{disenchanted with}} the party in the mid-1930s, as did many {{supporters}} {{in the province of}} Connacht. He became involved in talks with a number of farmers {{in order to create a}} new Farmers' Party. The original group was known as the Irish Farmers Federation, however it split shortly afterwards between the larger more conservative farmers and poorer more radical farmers from the West over the issue of <b>de-rating.</b> Donnellan led the radical faction, which founded Clann na Talmhan in 1939. In 1940 a by-election was called in the Galway West constituency and his supporters persuaded him to stand. Fine Gael stood aside hoping to inflict damage on Fianna Fáil, which won, though Donnellan secured almost 30% of the votes cast. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a TD for Galway West at the 1943 general election.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposing}} candidates adopted classic by-election positions. Boyle {{defending the}} Conservative government record, Hutchinson attacking it.

Rye was a largely rural seat and Boyle chose {{to focus on}} agricultural issues praising the Agricultural Rates Act of 1896, which had led to the <b>de-rating</b> of farm land, as {{a step in the}} right direction and promising to keep up Brookfield’s campaign to press legislative proposals for the defence of the hop industry. On the controversial issue of education, following the 1902 Education Act, Boyle took the view that, while this was not a perfect piece of legislation, it was an honest attempt to deal with a difficult matter. Boyle also took a stand against Irish Home Rule stating he was ‘absolutely against a separate Parliament for Ireland’.|$|E
