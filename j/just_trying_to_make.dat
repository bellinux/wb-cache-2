5|$|I was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a point. I {{wanted to}} show people {{how easy it is}} to {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
500|$|Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, {{was signed}} up {{by a major}} British {{recording}} company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason {{that it did not}} seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the book}} was published, Crichton demanded a {{non-negotiable}} fee of $1.5 million {{as well as a}} substantial percentage of the gross. Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Columbia Pictures and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante bid for the rights, but Universal Studios eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg. After completing Hook, Spielberg wanted to film Schindler's List. Music Corporation of America (then Universal Pictures's parent company) president Sid Sheinberg gave a green light to the film on the condition that Spielberg made Jurassic Park first. The director later declared that by choosing a creature-driven thriller, [...] "I was really <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a good sequel to Jaws, on land." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{portrayal}} of the Britten family was praised by television critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was keen to Isaacs' acting in the series. [...] "It helps enormously to have Isaacs playing the lead. This actor knows how to convey a gravity that contrasts well with the series' airy concept, but he avoids becoming heavy and morose." [...] West summated that the cast [...] "really couldn't be better on this series"; [...] "Isaacs [...] a stellar performance as the intelligent detective, and loving father and husband who’s <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sense of what’s going on and probably not entirely regretful to be experiencing a split reality. Cinema Blend Kelly West claimed that [...] "Laura Allen and Dylan Minnette also deliver strong performances as Michael's wife and son respectively". Critics IGN, TV Fanatic, and the Paste magazine all argued that Jason Isaacs performance deserves an Emmy.|$|E
500|$|Dan the Automator {{criticized the}} release, stating [...] "That wasn't a Dr. Octagon record. Dr. Octagon is me, Kool Keith, and Q-Bert. The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to get {{involved}} in a legal battle...Keith's my man, <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a little bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think that those are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something real simple, {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good music." [...] The album {{was described as a}} [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{taking over}} the hosting duties, Bolling {{announced}} a new direction for Cashin' In: [...] "While we work hard, pay our taxes and <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ends meet, law makers from DC to state houses across America are [...] "Cashin' In". We will use this show as a megaphone, calling out Washington for the waste, fraud and abuse of our tax dollars." [...] Bolling delivered this new show message {{at the end of}} the 1/26/13 show.|$|R
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to}} the promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E

500|$|Marceline {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{characters}} in Adventure Time. Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by series creator Pendleton Ward. Ward purposely set out <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Marceline's character complex, as he explained that [...] "with the female characters it’s easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés [...] I <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have." ...|$|R
60|$|Old Mrs. Possum {{said this}} <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Sammy Jay talk, for Sammy is very quick-tempered, and quick-tempered people often {{say a lot}} more than they mean to. You see, Mrs. Possum was quite sure that if Sammy Jay knew how worried she was over Unc' Billy Possum, he would refuse to tell her whether or not he had seen Unc' Billy, for Sammy Jay is mean and loves to torment others.|$|R
2500|$|While in {{his senior}} year of high school, Fabolous began to pursue a career in hip hop music. He was invited to rap live on American record {{producer}} and music executive DJ Clue's radio show, then on New York City radio station Hot 97. DJ Clue subsequently signed Fabolous to his record label, Desert Storm Records. Fabolous was then featured on several DJ Clue mixtapes, as well as mixtapes with Roc-A-Fella artists. This earned Fabolous and Desert Storm a distribution deal with Elektra Records. In a September 6, 2001 interview with Hot104.com, Fabolous said he never planned on becoming a rapper and told the website: [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some money, ya know? I got tired of being broke. This was something where I could make some money. It just happened for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Culshaw {{produced}} {{a series of}} Decca recordings of Britten's music with the composer as conductor or pianist. The Times described them as [...] "a priceless heritage for posterity." [...] Culshaw persuaded Decca {{to make the first}} complete recording of Peter Grimes, arguing that unless they did so they should abandon their exclusive agreement with the composer and so [...] "give him a chance to try his luck with other companies". Decca, unwilling to lose out to competition, gave the go-ahead. Culshaw, who was then responsible for recordings in Vienna, was unavailable to produce that pioneering recording, which was also the first modern opera to be recorded in stereo: instead, he [...] "planned it down to the last detail", and passed his detailed instructions to Erik Smith, who produced the recording. Among the works Culshaw himself recorded with Britten were the operas Albert Herring (1964), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1967), and Billy Budd (1968). Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York Post {{wrote that}} the lyrics [...] "express {{emotions}} ranging from the flip to the resigned". Sharan Shetty of Slate stated that the song is about [...] "heartbreak and redemption", while a Yahoo! News reviewer noted that it is about [...] "personal travails and confusion". Nora Crotty of Elle magazine described the single as an [...] "ode to repenting {{in the morning for}} the foolish mistakes you made the night before". Billboards Vena stated that a [...] "plucky acoustic guitar" [...] accompanies Rihanna's vocals while she sings the lines, [...] "I think I've had enough/ Might get a little drunk/ I say what's on my mind/ I might do a little time. Cause all of my kindness/ Is taken for weakness." [...] After the first chorus West sings, [...] "Woke up an optimist/ Sun was shining, I'm positive/ Then I heard you was talking trash/ Hold me back/ I'm about to spazz." [...] On the second chorus, he and Rihanna harmonize as they sing, [...] "Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'/ And we got three more days 'till Friday/ I'm <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it back home by Monday morning." [...] McCartney's voice can be heard sped up underneath West's opening vocals. McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone. McCartney's lyrics were improvised mid-performance and are for the most part drowned out by West's vocals except for the lines [...] "We can run around" [...] and [...] "How 'bout a mystery" ...|$|E
50|$|The Illuminati {{approach}} Noh-Varr, a Kree warrior who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{take over}} the Earth, in his prison, reasoning {{that it is better}} to convince him to change on his own rather than <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him change using their abilities. They demonstrate the Kree connection to the Inhumans, and their desire to protect Earth. They demonstrate the primitive nature of humanity, but also the potential of the race to evolve and better itself. Ultimately, using Captain Marvel (a deceased, Kree-born superhero), they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> convince Noh-Varr to use his powers to protect the Earth and guide humans to better themselves.|$|R
5000|$|With The Room, {{the goal}} was [...] "to make the best iOS game we could, not <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a big console game for iOS", {{according}} to Fireproofs' Barry Meade. They wanted to emphasise {{the use of the}} touchscreen of mobile devices in its own unique way, similar to the success of Cut the Rope and Angry Birds. At the same time, they wanted to create a game that would be immersive for the player, and had devised the appropriate touch controls to provide tactile responses that worked alongside their art and music assets to help towards this.|$|R
500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> things harder for myself, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> myself a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|R

He had sat in the top of a tall pine-tree where he could see all that happened, and he had chuckled wickedly as he had seen Farmer Brown's boy climb to Hooty's nest and take out an egg. He felt sure that he would take both eggs. He hoped so, anyway.|$|E

He looked over his shoulder, and what he saw helped him to make up his mind in a hurry. There, creeping over the frozen snow, was Mr. Lynx, and the sides of Mr. Lynx were very thin, and the eyes of Mr. Lynx looked very hungry and fierce, and the claws of Mr. Lynx were very long and strong and cruel looking.
