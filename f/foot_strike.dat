2500|$|Ki {{started the}} 2011–12 {{campaign}} in Celtic's opening match against Hibernian in the SPL. Scoring the second goal in a 2–0 victory, a 25-yard left <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> {{into the right}} hand bottom corner and also won the Man of the Match award from the official Celtic website. He impressed Celtic manager Neil Lennon {{so much in the}} Hibernian match that he said: ...|$|E
5000|$|During incline running {{increases}} in {{activation of the}} rectus femoris and gastrocnemius were noted by Cai. [...] Yokozawa found incline running to produce increased activation in the vasti group, hamstrings, iliopsoas, and adductors. [...] Neither of these two provided timing on what point of gait these increases occurred. Swanson also recorded EMG data, but compared differences before <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> (swing phase) and after <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> (stance phase) {{as well as on}} a wider range of muscles. Results showed significant {{increases in}} activation of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial hamstring, biceps femoris, and gluteus maximus before <b>foot</b> <b>strike.</b> Following <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> increases were seen in all muscles {{with the exception of the}} tibialis anterior and medial hamstring.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{researchers}} classify <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> by {{the initial}} center of pressure; this is mostly applicable to shod running (running while wearing shoes). In this classification: ...|$|E

50|$|Unsportsmanlike conduct: Acting in {{a manner}} not {{befitting}} an athlete or a role model. Including cursing at a competitor, kicking your <b>feet,</b> <b>striking</b> other skaters or officials, etc.|$|R
5000|$|... ripple: {{using only}} the toe tap of one <b>foot,</b> <b>striking</b> with {{the outer edge}} of the tap, {{followed}} by the inner edge, followed by the ball of the foot.|$|R
5000|$|Gait Deviations - Decreased gait {{velocity}} and stride length due to Hypokinetic movement, Decreased cadence due to Bradykinetic movements. Increased double-limb support. 17 They also exhibit Flat <b>foot</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Foot</b> <b>strike</b> varies to {{some degree}} between strides, and between individuals. It varies {{significantly}} and notably between walking and running, and between wearing shoes (shod) and not wearing shoes (barefoot).|$|E
50|$|Proper running form is {{important}} in injury prevention. A major aspect of running form is <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> pattern. The {{way in which the}} foot makes contact with the ground determines how the force of the impact is distributed throughout the body. Different types of modern running shoes are created to manipulate <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> pattern in an effort {{to reduce the risk of}} injury. In recent years, barefoot running has increased in popularity in many western countries, because of claims that it reduces the risk of injury. However, this has not been proven and is still debated.|$|E
50|$|Jogging is also {{distinguished}} from running {{by having a}} wider lateral spacing of <b>foot</b> <b>strikes,</b> creating side-to-side movement that likely adds stability at slower speeds or when coordination is lacking.|$|R
50|$|Isidor Sekseri {{preferred}} {{using both}} his feet. Sometimes, {{you will be}} able to see him using his left <b>foot</b> the <b>strike,</b> and other times he will be using his right <b>foot</b> to <b>strike.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Eb! Eb! Get up! Quickly, for God's sake!" [...] she cried. A smothered exclamation, a woman's quick voice, {{the heavy}} thud of <b>feet</b> <b>striking</b> the floor {{followed}} Betty's alarm. Then the door opened.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Boutsianis {{signed for}} Essendon United coached by P.Gani, who {{play in the}} Victorian Provisional North/West 1 league. He scored on his home debut with a {{trademark}} left <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> against Whittlesea United at Aberfeldie Park.|$|E
50|$|Drop foot IC: Initial contact of {{the foot}} that is in motion will not have normal heel-toe <b>foot</b> <b>strike.</b> Instead the foot may either slap the ground or the entire foot may be planted on the ground all at once.|$|E
50|$|Initial contact (IC): The {{point in}} the gait cycle when the foot {{initially}} makes contact with the ground; this represents {{the beginning of the}} stance phase. It is suggested that heel strike not be a term used in clinical gait analysis as in many circumstances initial contact is not made with the heel. Suggestion: Should use <b>foot</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While landing under a {{parachute}} canopy, the jumper's <b>feet</b> <b>strike</b> the ground first and, immediately, he throws himself sideways {{to distribute the}} landing shock sequentially along five points of body contact with the ground: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A moi, Anglais, a moi!" [...] cried a voice, and Nigel saw {{the young}} rider stagger to his <b>feet,</b> <b>strike</b> round {{him with his}} sword, and then fall once more before the rush of his assailants.|$|R
50|$|In the January {{transfer}} window, he {{was linked}} with a loan move with Dundee {{but to no}} avail and stayed at Aberdeen. Paton scored his second league goal for Aberdeen against Hibernian at Easter Road, on 10 February 2010 and his first goal at Pittodrie three days later against Celtic, with a superb left <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> {{from the edge of the}} box.|$|E
5000|$|Ki {{started the}} 2011-12 {{campaign}} in Celtic's opening game against Hibernian in the SPL. Scoring the second goal in a 2-0 victory, a 25-yard left <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> {{into the right}} hand bottom corner and also won the Man of the Match award from the official Celtic website.

5000|$|A 2012 study {{involving}} Harvard University runners {{found that}} those who [...] "habitually rearfoot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike". This was the first study that investigated the link between <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> and injury rates. However, earlier studies have shown that smaller collision forces were generated when running forefoot strike compared to rear-foot strike. This may protect the ankle joints and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries experienced by rear-foot strikers.|$|E
60|$|There was a rustle somewhere, {{the vague}} {{sound of a}} <b>foot</b> <b>striking</b> a stone, and then there fell silence upon that old Christian church--a stagnant, heavy silence which closed round Kennedy and shut him in like water round a {{drowning}} man.|$|R
50|$|With {{a running}} gait, the foot-loading order {{is usually the}} reverse of walking. The <b>foot</b> <b>strikes</b> {{the ground with the}} ball of the foot, and then the heel drops. The heel drop elastically extends the Achilles tendon; this {{extension}} is reversed during the push-off.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{kinetic energy}} is absorbed in running every time one's <b>foot</b> <b>strikes</b> {{the ground and}} {{continues}} as one's mass overtakes the foot. At this moment, elastic recoil energy is at its maximum and {{a large amount of}} this energy is absorbed and is added to the next stride.|$|R
50|$|During the 2015 Outdoor Retailer Summer Market, Altra {{introduced}} {{their first}} smart shoe, Altra IQ. Powered by iFit, the Altra IQ uses technology to help runners analyze their running biomechanics. Slated {{to be released}} in Spring of 2016, the Altra IQ will collect data on stride, pace, <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> zone (heel vs. midfoot vs. forefoot), ground contact time, left foot vs. right foot imbalances, and more, and will transmit the data via Bluetooth to a mobile device such as a smartphone or watch for analysis.|$|E
50|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease {{have reduced}} impact at heel strike and this {{mechanism}} {{has been found}} to be related to the disease severity with impact decreasing as the disease progresses. Also, Parkinson patients show a trend towards higher relative loads in the forefoot regions combined with a load shift towards medial foot areas. This load shift is believed to help in compensating for postural imbalance. The intra-individual variability in <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> pattern is found to be surprisingly lower in PD patients compared with normal people.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{in normal}} gait, the heel strikes {{the ground before}} the toes (also called heel-to-toe walking), in Parkinsonian gait, motion is characterised by flat <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> (where the entire foot {{is placed on the}} ground at the same time) or less often and in the more {{advanced}} stages of the disease by toe-to-heel walking (where the toes touch the ground before the heel). In addition, PD patients have reduced foot lifting during the swing phase of gait, which produces smaller clearance between the toes and the ground.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes also {{referred}} to as a soccer kick. The wrestler kicks an opponent, who is sitting on the mat, vertically to their back, with the <b>foot</b> <b>striking</b> the base of the spine, and the shin striking the back of the head. This was used by Katsuyori Shibata as the PK - Penalty Kick.|$|R
50|$|Carey has {{represented}} the Republic of Ireland at youth, under-17 and under-19 level. He has six Under-21 caps. His debut for the Under-21s came under Don Givens in February 2009 at Turners Cross against Germany. He scored his first goal {{at that level}} away to Georgia with an impressive 18-yard left <b>footed</b> <b>strike</b> after a clever one two with Cillian Sheridan.|$|R
50|$|After impressing at Varese, In January 2013, Grillo joined Serie A side Siena. He {{made his}} debut against Juventus in Serie A. On May 12, 2013 in the 2-1 loss gainst S.S.C. Napoli, Grillo scored his first {{goal in the}} top flight with a left <b>footed</b> <b>strike.</b> However, Siena were relegated to Serie B {{at the end of}} the 2012/13 season.|$|R
5000|$|So called 'traditional' {{running shoes}} are {{designed}} to give more support and cushion the landing to reduce the effects of impact. They allow for more comfortable running on hard surfaces such as asphalt and also protect the foot when stepping on rocks or other potentially sharp objects. However, the cushioning provided in traditional running shoes is thought to encourage a <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> pattern, where the heel lands first. Heel striking generates a relatively large amount of impact force that can put {{different parts of the}} lower extremities under excessive stress.|$|E
50|$|In Burnley's 2008-09 League Cup {{campaign}} Kevin McDonald scored both {{goals in}} a 2-0 win over Arsenal at Turf Moor. His second strike against the Gunners was particularly precise, an outside of the right <b>foot</b> <b>strike</b> {{from the edge of}} the area. This moment proved to be the peak of a promising Burnley career, little did the fans know what would happen against Man City in the 2009-10 season.Out of the first team he signed for Scunthorpe United on a one-month loan in October 2010 followed by another loan to Notts County in February 2011, running until the end of the season.|$|E
50|$|Those {{who wish}} to {{approximate}} the experience of running barefoot, but would prefer some protection, can resort to shoes that mimic barefoot locomotion. Such shoes as water socks, running sandals, moccasins, huaraches, dime-store plimsolls, Vibram FiveFingers footwear and other minimal running shoes have relatively thin soles but provide some protection. However minimal shoes do not give runners the same feedback from the plantar mechanoreceptors. Because of the greater protection they offer in comparison to barefoot running, minimal shoes may also interfere {{with the development of}} a gentle <b>foot</b> <b>strike,</b> toughening of the soles of the feet, and awareness of road hazards.|$|E
50|$|Since his {{retirement}} {{he has played}} in three Masters football tournaments for Celtic once and twice for Barnsley. Most recently, he helped to guide Barnsley to local victory in the Yorkshire masters and even struck home a thunderous right- <b>footed</b> <b>strike</b> in the final against Sheffield Wednesday to force the game into penalties where he tucked his away past the despairing Kevin Pressman.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} I could do. To cry out or {{to attempt to}} reason with him would only have drawn the mutineers' attention. I heard his <b>feet</b> <b>strike</b> the deck beneath as he let go. Immediately he started for'ard. Little enough {{precaution}} he took. I swear that clear to the 'midship- house I heard the dragging age-lag of his feet. Then that ceased, and that was all.|$|R
50|$|Energy Return System (E.R.S.) is a {{technology}} created by Reebok where {{a series of}} cylinders composed of the plastic DuPont Hytrel are placed under the midsole of an athletic shoe. The system was introduced in 1988 to compete with Nike Air, and was gradually phased out of production upon the arrival of Reebok’s Hexalite cushioning. Reebok claims that the cylinders act as springs, releasing energy after a <b>foot</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
