50|$|Until recently, {{the only}} other {{available}} <b>device-based</b> treatment was the left ventricular assist device (LVAD). LVAD therapy is indicated in patients with severe illness and is associated with several hours of surgery (involving a cardiopulmonary bypass). It is usually considered as a therapy providing a “bridge to transplant” for heart failure patients classified as NYHA class IV, and is intended to support heart function until a heart transplant is received.Current research {{results suggest that the}} therapeutic gap described above could now be closed by CCM therapy. Additionally, a long-term study on CCM showed that the therapy was able to stop the common and prognostically unfavorable long-term prolongation of QRS duration in heart failure patients. This result was interpreted as signaling the safety of the treatment and as an indicator that patients could benefit from CCM therapy in the long term. If the QRS-stabilizing effect were to be confirmed in further studies, CCM would become the first <b>device-based</b> treatment for heart failure with the potential to halt QRS prolongation, a factor associated with a poor prognosis.|$|E
5000|$|Reduced {{expression}} of this protein has {{been implicated in}} cardiomyopathies, and left ventricular assist <b>device-based</b> therapy does not restore S100A1 levels in patients. S100A1 has shown promise as an early diagnostic biomarker for acute myocardial ischemia, presenting with a distinct timecourse in human plasma following an ischemic event relative to traditional markers creatine kinase, CKMB and troponin I. This injury-released, extracellular pool of S100A1 was investigated in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and was shown to prevent apoptosis via an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, suggesting that the release of S100A1 from injured cells is an intrinsic survival mechanism for viable myocardium. [...] S100 has also shown promise as a biomarker for uncontrolled hyperoxic reoxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass in infants with cyanotic heart disease and in adults. S100A1 gene transfer to engineered heart tissue was shown to augment contractile performance of the tissue implants, suggesting that S100A1 may be effective in facilitating cardiac tissue replacement therapy in heart failure patients. However, the clinical efficacy of this strategy remains to be determined.In addition, multiple drugs, including Pentamidine, Amlexanox, Olopatadine, Cromolyn, and Propanolol, are known to bind to S100A1, although their affinities are often in the mid-micromolar range.|$|E
5000|$|In CCM therapy, {{electrical}} stimulation {{is applied to}} the cardiac muscle during the absolute refractory period. In this phase of the cardiac cycle, electrical signals cannot trigger new cardiac muscle contractions, hence this type of stimulation is known as a non-excitatory stimulation. However, the electrical CCM signals increase the influx of calcium ions into the cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). In contrast to other {{electrical stimulation}} treatments for heart failure, such as pacemaker therapy or implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), CCM does not affect the cardiac rhythm directly. Rather, the aim is to enhance the heart’s natural contraction (the native cardiac contractility) sustainably over long periods of time. Furthermore, unlike most interventions that increase cardiac contractility, CCM is not associated with an unfavorable increase in oxygen demand by the heart (measured in terms of Myocardial Oxygen Consumption or MVO2). This may be explained by the beneficial effect CCM has in improving cardiac efficiency. [...] A meta-analysis in 2014 [...] and an overview of <b>device-based</b> treatment options in heart failure in 2013 [...] concluded that CCM treatment is safe, that it is generally beneficial to patients and that CCM treatment increases the exercise tolerance (ET) and quality of life (QoL) of patients. [...] Furthermore, preliminary long-term survival data shows that CCM is associated with lower long-term mortality in heart failure patients when compared with expected rates among similar patients not treated with CCM.|$|E

[Purpose] Device based {{therapy for}} {{low back pain}} (LBP) {{involves}} quantitative assessment of muscle strength, resistance and lumbar motion and tailoring the rehabilitation protocol based on this objective assessment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effectiveness of device based therapy for LBP. [Subjects and Meth-ods] In this retrospective study, clinical data of 235 patients who underwent <b>device-based</b> physiotherapy for low back pain was reviewed. Pre and post-treatment outcome measures for pain (visual analogue scale or VAS score), disability (Oswestry disability index) and functional ability were compared to determine effectiveness of <b>device-based</b> physiotherapy at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. [Results] All outcome measures including VAS Score and mean Oswestry Disability Score showed significant improvement at the end of 6 weeks of <b>device-based</b> physical therapy. Before treatment, 73 % of patients had moderate to severe disability which reduced to 28 % after treatment. [Conclusion] <b>Device-based</b> therapy is effective in relieving pain, improving function and reducing disability in patients with low back pain in the short term. <b>Device-based</b> therapy may help to objectively evaluate the function of the spine and paraspinal muscles and help the therapist tailor treatment accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Automation and {{computerized}} {{control of}} processes in electric power plants were intensively {{started at the}} end of seventies and at the beginning of eighties during the introduction of microprocessor–based computer systems. The first generation of the information processing equipment has in most cases already become disused. From that time, visibility of controlled process has been increased by installing new and modern devices which enable better informing about all relevant events. The increased quantity of information by which processes can be described implies that new and more efficient techniques for information modeling should be developed. In this paper a <b>device-based</b> approach to process information modeling is proposed. Such modeling approach is more efficient than function-based approach we used before. The efficiency {{lies in the fact that}} <b>device-based</b> approach is in the very essence an object-oriented modeling approach. Therefore, <b>device-based</b> information models can be easily mapped to object-oriented models. Both function-based and <b>device-based</b> modeling approaches are described in the paper and differences between two modeling paradigms are emphasized. In the last Chapter of the paper analogy between <b>device-based</b> and object-oriented models is described. This analogy represents basis for the model mapping...|$|E
40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{has long been}} one of the most serious medical {{conditions}} in the United States; in fact, in the United States alone, heart failure accounts for 6. 5 million days of hospitalization each year. One important goal of heart-failure therapy is to inhibit the progression of congestive heart failure through pharmacologic and <b>device-based</b> therapies. Therefore, there have been efforts to develop <b>device-based</b> therapies aimed at improving cardiac reserve and optimizing pump function to meet metabolic requirements. The course of congestive heart failure is often worsened by other conditions, including new-onset arrhythmias, ischemia and infarction, valvulopathy, decompensation, end-organ damage, and therapeutic refractoriness, that have an impact on outcomes. The onset of such conditions is sometimes heralded by subtle pathophysiologic changes, and the timely identification of these changes may promote the use of preventive measures. Consequently, <b>device-based</b> methods could in the future have an important role in the timely identification of the subtle pathophysiologic changes associated with congestive heart failure...|$|E

Optimal concordance of AV and VV intervals between echocardiographic-based assessment and a <b>device-based</b> automatic programming with a hemodynamic sensor was investigated, together with left ventricle (LV) reverse remodeling after 6 months of regular automatic <b>device-based</b> optimization. Methods: We evaluated blindly 30 systematic echocardiographic examinations during 6 months in 17 patients (12 men, 64 ± 10 years, in sinus rhythm and New York Heart Association class III; 76 % with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, LV ejection fraction [LVEF] 40 %). A statistically significant increase in LVEF was observed between baseline and 6 months post implant (P< 0. 01). One patient died from non-cardiac causes. Conclusion: Concordance between echocardiographic methods and <b>device-based</b> hemodynamic sensor optimization was found in most examinations (80 %) post CRT. After 6 months of systematic optimization with SonR, patients showed a statistically significant increase in LVEF, with a high rate of reverse remodeling.

40|$|Wastewater-based {{epidemiology}} is {{an established}} approach for quantifying community {{drug use and}} has recently been applied to estimate population exposure to contaminants such as pesticides and phthalate plasticizers. A major source of uncertainty in the population weighted biomarker loads generated is related to estimating {{the number of people}} present in a sewer catchment at the time of sample collection. Here, the population quantified from mobile <b>device-based</b> population activity patterns was used to provide dynamic population normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile <b>device-based</b> population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. Dynamic population normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31 %. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using dynamic population normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55 % in static normalized data. Mobile <b>device-based</b> population activity patterns allow for dynamic normalization that yields much improved temporal and spatial trend analysis...|$|E

40|$|Context: To {{systematically}} {{review and}} provide an informative synthesis of findings from longitudinal studies published since 1996 reporting on relationships between self-reported sedentary behavior and <b>device-based</b> measures of sedentary time with health-related outcomes in adults. Evidence acquisition: Studies published between 1996 and January 2011 were identified by examining existing literature reviews and by systematic searches in Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsycINFO. English-written articles were selected according to study design, targeted behavior, and health outcome. Evidence synthesis: Forty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria; of these, 46 incorporated self-reported measures including total sitting time; TV viewing time only; TV viewing time and other screen-time behaviors; and TV viewing time plus other sedentary behaviors. Findings indicate a consistent relationship of self-reported sedentary behavior with mortality and with weight gain from childhood to the adult years. However, findings were mixed for associations with disease incidence, weight gain during adulthood, and cardiometabolic risk. Of the three studies that used <b>device-based</b> measures of sedentary time, one showed that markers of obesity predicted sedentary time, whereas in conclusive findings have been observed for markers of insulin resistance. Conclusions: There is {{a growing body of}} evidence that sedentary behavior may be a distinct risk factor, independent of physical activity, for multiple adverse health outcomes in adults.

40|$|AbstractThe {{extensive}} usages of WLANs {{and mobile}} devices {{have increased the}} interest in Indoor localization systems for wireless environments. In the context of wireless-based localization system, researchers have always focused on <b>device-based</b> localization system, in which tracked entities must have a device attached.

These all location based systems need a device to be attached with tracked entity, in order to run part of localization algorithm. Thus, all these systems are called as active <b>device-based</b> location systems. Recently a new concept device-free localization system is introduced; this system can detect and track any entity without carrying any radio device or participating actively in the localization process.
