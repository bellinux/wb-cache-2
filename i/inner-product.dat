40|$|Abstract — From the {{classical}} reproducing kernel theory of function spaces it is well-known {{that there is}} an inverse relation-ship between <b>inner-products</b> and kernels. In applications, such as linear system theory and machine learning, these kernels are often highly structured. In order to exploit algebraic structure, it is common to choose basis functions and fall back to matrix representations. However, the basis has to be chosen {{in a way that is}} compatible with the algebraic structure, which is itself a nontrivial task. We therefore choose a different approach and use standard duality theory where additional algebraic structures form no obstacle. This is demonstrated by examples from linear system theory, namely two variable polynomials given by Bézoutians and quadratic differential forms...|$|R
