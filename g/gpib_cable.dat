50|$|HC100 Color Plotter.The HC100 is a four-color plotter {{designed}} to make waveform plots directly from the Tektronix 2430-series oscilloscopes. It does not require an intervening controller. Under program control from the instrument attached by a <b>GPIB</b> <b>cable,</b> front panel commands {{can be used to}} plot digitally stored waveforms and printouts of instrument setup information. They are sometimes for sale, but do not have a GPIB interface, which you need.|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{spectrum}} analyzer {{is a hot}} instrument for signal analysis and spectrum monitoring. It has wide applications in wireless communication and high potential for smart reading. However, it is characterized with a high cost. Hence, a designed light version based on already available lab instruments is constructed for use in school lab. In this thesis, a simple oscilloscope and a computer {{were used in the}} process. Both instruments communicated through <b>GPIB</b> <b>cable</b> and MATLAB software was used for the processing tasks. In order to test the designed one, a simple signal generator was used. The signal was analyzed in both time domain and frequency domain. Then measurements of the signal over time were updated to a matrix of FFT and were plotted in 3 D, showing spectrum variation over time. The application of this project to radio frequency analysis was also discussed...|$|E
40|$|PDW is a Microsoft Windows {{printer driver}} for the Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. It {{provides}} a previously unavailable linkage between this printer and IBM PC compatibles running Microsoft Windows. This driver supports all {{the text and}} graphics features normally found in other laser printer drivers. The user can ensure true WYSIWYG (what {{you see is what}} you get) compatibility between the on-screen display of high-end application programs and the final hardcopy image because PDW supports the unique Microsoft Windows operating system requirement that printer drivers assist in the drawing of graphical objects on the video display as well as on the hardcopier. PDW can be called upon by the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) to draw graphical objects (circles, lines, etc.) directly to the hardcopier or to render graphical objects to shared memory so that the objects can then be copied to the video screen by the screen driver. This allows Microsoft Windows, in conjunction with the screen driver, to provide maximum WYSIWYG fidelity while a document is being composed whenever PDW is selected. PDW can reside simultaneously on up to three separate PCs, each attached to a single Raytheon printer utilizing the printer's standard IEEE- 488 (GPIB) interface. PDW contains special software to check for bus contention before attempting to access the printer. PDW is written in C-language for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS v 4. 0 or later and Microsoft Windows v 3. 0 or later. It requires 8 Mb of RAM for execution. PDW also requires a National Instruments PC-compatible <b>GPIB</b> board and <b>cable</b> and a Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. If the source code needs to be modified, a Microsoft Quick C for Windows compiler is required. The Microsoft UniTool may also be required if the source code is being completely rewritten for another printer. An electronic copy of the documentation is available on the media in Microsoft Word for Windows format. The standard distribution medium for PDW is a set of two 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskettes. PDW was developed in 1993...|$|R
