This event is actually mentioned in For (<b>Give)</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Bit during an argument between Miley and Jackson, meaning that the movie would fit {{right in the middle of}} season 3 as if it were a part of the season.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
25|$|The prehistoric period {{ended with}} the arrival of the Roman army, who began their campaigns against the Welsh tribes in 48 AD with an attack on the Deceangli in {{north-east}} Wales. Wales was divided between a number of tribes, of which the Silures and the Ordovices put up the most stubborn resistance. The Roman conquest of Wales was complete by 79 AD. The reports of Roman historians such as Tacitus <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more information about Wales in this period, such as that the island of Anglesey was apparently a stronghold of the Druids. The impact of the arrival of the Romans may have varied from one part of Wales to another; for example there is evidence that some hillforts, such as Tre'r Ceiri, continued to be occupied during the Roman period.|$|E

500|$|Editing helped {{determine}} how nonverbal moments shape {{the first meeting}} between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. [...] "In a scene like that, there {{is a sort of}} playfulness that goes on," [...] editor, Dana E. Glauberman said. [...] "There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] {{was written}} by Kara DioGuardi, Steve Morales and David Siegal, and was {{produced}} by Morales and Ric Wake. The song became DioGuardi's first writing credit for an artist from her native country. Simpson's vocals were recorded by Dan Hetzel at Sony Music Studios, New York City, and the track was mixed by Hetzel along with Richie Jones at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York. Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is for guys {{to listen to the}} girl". [...] "A guy needs to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more of himself, {{a little bit more of}} his time. It's about the love going so much further, the guy would actually be selfless," [...] she expanded on the song's theme. In the United States, [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was released as the second single from Irresistible. The song saw an airplay-only release there, while in Australia, a physical single was issued on October29,2001. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song was also utilized for the company's promotional advertisement campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by long-time collaborator Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z. The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again". She was then inspired to shoot a music video for the bonus track. In an interview with People magazine in August 2010, Knowles explained: [...] "I came up with the concept for that video because lately I decided to take a break, and I’ve been home, being a wife. I figured it could be nice to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wink toward the things that I’ve been doing, so that’s why I’m a housewife in the video." [...] However, she explained that the video is [...] "an exaggerated, over-the-top version" [...] of what she was doing right then, just living her life, being a woman at home, relaxing and trying to enjoy her life other than performing and creating music. For instance, dusting off her Grammys and getting under the hood of a car while wearing six-inch heels are not regular occurrences for Knowles.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode an F and criticized the episode's plot and, most notably, its ending. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that the episode diluted the characters of Doggett and Scully in a [...] "mechanical plot", writing [...] "'Salvage' would never have made a great episode, but if it had only bothered to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more depth to Doggett and Scully, it might still have been an entertaining one." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris referred to the episode as an [...] "assembly line monster-of-the-week episode" [...] and criticized it for failing to make the audience truly empathetic to Ray Pearce's plight. However, Vitaris did praise the make-up in the episode, noting that [...] "that makeup is [...] William's performance [...] he is an astonishing sight." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He applauded the way the guest star was allowed to [...] "take over" [...] the episode, but felt that the de-emphasis on Scully and Doggett rendered their scenes [...] "boring". Ultimately, VanDerWerff noted that the problem with {{it was that the}} two halves of the story—Dogget and Scully investigation, and Ray's plight—were largely unconnected.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the police search, a legal defence fundraiser for Hager was {{set up on the}} website <b>Give</b> <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> by former Young Labour leader Meg Bates, who described Hager as a [...] "hero" [...] who [...] "exposed a twisted web of power and influence in New Zealand politics". As at April 2016, over $65,000 had been donated to the fund, despite attempts to shut it down and criticism from Slater's sympathisers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{upper and}} lower central drums are linked by downcomers. Unusually these are {{internal}} to the boiler and are heated, although not strongly, by the exhaust gases. They are formed as several (eight or nine) [...] vertical tubes on the centreline of the boiler. They are formed into a shallow S-shape to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flexibility against thermal expansion. [...] The small wing drums {{are connected to the}} lower central drum alone, by large external pipes outside the rear casing of the boiler.|$|E
2500|$|Woodward and {{executive}} director Alison Harris led a $30.6 million renovation, transforming the old barn into a modern, year-round theatre facility. The renovated theatre reopened in 2005. At Woodward's suggestion, {{a piece of the}} original stage floor was placed at the dressing room entrance to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra luck to the actors. Woodward stepped down from her job in January 2006, and was followed by actor, opera and theatre director, and playwright Tazewell Thompson. However, Woodward and Newman have both continued to contribute to the Westport Country Playhouse's [...] "Campaign for a New Era." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 25 March 1919, Fokker married Sophie Marie Elisabeth von Morgen in Haarlem. This {{marriage}} {{ended in}} divorce in 1923. In 1927, he married Canadian Violet Eastman in New York City. On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to 'vertigo victim' {{at the request of}} her husband's staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, [...] "I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because I thought there was nothing that could be more important than my airplanes... I have now learned, by bitter experience, that one must <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too; in love one has to use one's brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of {{training}} camp Tortorella promised to make changes {{to the way the}} Canucks played. He wanted to make the team tougher to play against. Some of the techniques he felt would accomplish this were hard forechecking, protecting the puck, being strong along the boards, and increasing shot blocking. The Canucks finished the 2012–13 season as the 27th ranked team in blocked shots while the Rangers finished sixth. Tortorella also said that he would use the Sedin twins to kill penalties. The Sedins had asked Vigneault to be used on the penalty kill, but he opted to keep them rested for their offensive role instead. Upon learning that they would be killing penalties Henrik Sedin said: [...] "It's something that I think {{is a big part of}} becoming a great player. You have to be on the ice for all situations. For us, we were counted upon to score goals, and if we didn't, then we were terrible. I think you grow as players when you play all situations." [...] Tortorella put the Canucks through a physically demanding training camp. Players were asked to run two miles in 12 minutes and were put through a series of intense skating drills. Tortorella believed he could learn about his players when they were exhausted and asked them to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more.|$|E
