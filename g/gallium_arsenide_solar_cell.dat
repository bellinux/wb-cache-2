40|$|Abstract—Based on a {{perfectly}} flat <b>gallium</b> <b>arsenide</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell,</b> {{we show that}} it is possible to modify the flow of light and enhance the absorption without modifying the active material structure or degrading its electrical properties. The sunlight couples into confined resonant modes formed by a periodic arrangement of dielectric nanospheres above the solar cell. The incoupling element is lossless and, thus, has the advantage that no energy is lost within the dielectric nanospheres. This stored energy is absorbed by the underlying active material which directly contributes to the photocurrent enhancement of the solar cell.

The pressure pulses were monitored with a Sandia type quartz pressure gauge. It was discovered that the relatively low power densities used were capable of removing the silicon dioxide antireflective and gold contact layers of the solar cell after only a few shots of the laser. An exponential relationship between the initial thicknesses of these layers and the pressure pulse generated in the gallium arsenide substrate was indicated for gold contact layers of less than 5000 A thickness. Evidence was found that the principal pressure generation mechanism is thermomechanical. Gold films of thickness greater than 5000 A were found to be able to absorb the power densities used with no apparent damage. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
