40|$|Recent {{areas of}} digital library innovation, such as digital rights {{management}}, have led librarians to apply risk management (RM) principles to certain circumscribed areas of library management. This paper {{will attempt to}} argue that risk management principles can in fact be applied much more generally in modern library administration.

Because this is a conceptual piece, there is ample room for further experimental testing of these hypotheses. This paper rejects some of the principles of RM that are less relevant to the 'people management' problems of hybrid (print-electronic) library administration. It offers an abstract statement of RM principles that should be of genuine practical usefulness to middle managers helping staff cope with the problems of 'mixed media', hybrid library environments.

These two risks jointly create a nonlinear risk premium, which simultaneously explains momentum and the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model.

40|$|GOAL 	The goal of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} whether fundamental risk explains future profitability in high-tech firms. Finance theories suggest that there is a positive connection between risk and returns. However, {{it is also possible that}} high risk leads to financial distress which can result in lower future profitability. I expect to find a significant association between fundamental risk and future profitability. The direction of the association is hard to predict, as current evidence is mixed. SAMPLE	The sample used in the empirical tests consists of 14 749 publicly listed high-tech firms from 81 countries. The data was collected from Thomson One Banker database and it covers the years 1990 - 2010. RESEARCH METHODS	The main tests were done using binary logistic regression. The dependent variable was a dummy that receives the value 1 when return on assets is zero or larger and 0 otherwise. The independent variables measure profitability, <b>general</b> <b>business</b> <b>risk</b> and financial risk. Two kinds of models were constructed: Parsimonious and Comprehensive. The Parsimonious model uses a narrower selection of independent variables and does not use lagged data. The Comprehensive model uses a wider range of risk proxies. Robustness tests were done using both ordinal logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS	The study found that there is a negative association between fundamental risk and future profitability. This implies that financial statement information is useful in explaining future profitability in high-tech firms. Interestingly, high risk seems to lead to lower future profitability, which is in contrast with the risk-return premise in finance. This connection is even stronger in IPO firms which are presumed to be riskier than seasoned firms. It is evident that a model with a few key figures has the 'maximum' explanatory power and the use of a more comprehensive model is not beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{and loss}} are common words {{that need to}} be clearly defined when embarking on the task of {{assessing}} operational risks. Financial institutions may rush into implementing the methodologies proposed by Basel in the hope of achieving better risk management – or simply to satisfy a regulatory request – but without giving enough thoughts to this enterprise. We show that the methodologies proposed by Basel to assess risks and calculate capital requirements are indeed poorly defined and, as far as they can be understood, misconceived. When restricting our attention to operational risks we find that their impact {{in the vast majority of}} cases is negligible compared to other risks, be they credit, market or <b>general</b> <b>business</b> <b>risks.</b> A few truly exceptional operational risks may, of course, lead to catastrophic consequences, but then the answer is not in an extra capital buffer that would have to be enormous to be of any use. An attempt to aggregate purely operational risks, as proposed by Basel in the so-called Advanced Measurement Approaches, is as futile as it is difficult. What matters in risk management is balancing all risks, whatever they are, against costs and revenues. And risks do not add up; it is the interaction between operational risks and other risks and the risk/reward trade-off that is of interest. Basel recognises this broader aspect of operational risk management in its guidance notes for the development of an operational risk management framework and the supervision of risk management. Recent redrafting of these notes suggest a change of emphasis from loss data collection towards more forward-looking risk assessment and comprehensive risk management.

40|$|Excerpt] In recent years, {{strategy}} {{researchers have}} {{examined the relationship between}} <b>business</b> <b>risk</b> and performance. The logic underlying this relationship is that organizations facing greater <b>business</b> <b>risk</b> seek to offset it with the prospect of higher financial returns. The research typically involves various financial measures of organization performance regressed on measures of risk. Surprisingly, the findings are contradictory. While some studies report evidence supporting a positive relationship between the risk organizations face and their performance (Aaker 2 ̆ 6 Jacobson, 1987; Fiegenbaum 2 ̆ 6 Thomas, 1988), others reported an inverse relationship (Bowman, 1982, 1984). These different results called into question the basic premise about the form of the risk-return relationship and left a void in understanding why organization decision makers might pursue more risky strategies. Advancing this line of inquiry, Miller and Bromiley (1990) noted that <b>business</b> <b>risk,</b> like financial performance, is multi-dimensional.
