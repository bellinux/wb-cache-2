5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus <b>encouraging</b> <b>the</b> redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

The energy system introduces an element of strategy, <b>encouraging</b> <b>the</b> player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{directly}} involved with Sheffield football, Charles Alcock {{had a major}} role in relations between the local and London associations. He acted as a go between <b>encouraging</b> <b>the</b> FA to accept rules from the Sheffield Rules.

5|$|Concerns over {{possible}} violent outbreaks {{continued for}} many years. Chartism became {{prominent in the}} region in the late 1830s, again causing Bute considerable worries in 1839 and leading to him <b>encouraging</b> <b>the</b> mobilisation of military forces to deal with the threat. Bute began to advocate the creation of a police force to suppress the problems in the northern valleys, for once allying himself with the local ironmasters to overcome rural opposition to the scheme. In 1841 the scheme was passed by the Glamorgan magistrates, with a chief constable and headquarters established that year.|$|E

5|$|Despite its aims, the Committee was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, <b>encouraging</b> <b>the</b> Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E

5|$|During most of {{the medieval}} period, Iberia was divided between Christian and Islamic kingdoms, neither of which {{traditionally}} built keeps, instead building watchtowers or mural towers.

5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline.
