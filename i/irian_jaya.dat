5|$|The Australian {{withdrawal}} from Vietnam brought {{to an end}} the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR {{took the lead in}} developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR. In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, {{as well as a number}} of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders. Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military counter-terrorism response force, for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982. In addition to being able to respond to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR counter-terrorism unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms together with clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch. In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{returned to}} Australia in 1971, having been deployed overseas {{for a total}} of 13 years. After Vietnam, No. 2 Squadron was based at Amberley, west of Brisbane, Queensland. It briefly returned to bombing role in training, but in the later years of the Canberra bomber's RAAF operations, it was predominately used for target towing in support of the RAAF's fleet of Dassault Mirage III fighters and survey photography to support the aerial mapping of Australia and other locations including Papua New Guinea, <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> and the Cocos and Christmas Islands. Eventually, the squadron's Canberra bombers were retired from service and in late July 1982 the squadron was disbanded.|$|E

The Dumont d'Urville Station on Antarctica is also named after him, as is the Rue Dumont d'Urville, a street near the Champs-Élysées in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, and the Lycée Dumont D'Urville in Caen.|$|E
25|$|Glaciation of the Southern Hemisphere {{was less}} {{extensive}} because of current configuration of continents. Ice sheets {{existed in the}} Andes (Patagonian Ice Sheet), where six glacier advances between 31,500 and 11,900BCE in the Chilean Andes have been reported. Antarctica was entirely glaciated, much like today, but the ice sheet left no uncovered area. In mainland Australia {{only a very small}} area in the vicinity of Mount Kosciuszko was glaciated, whereas in Tasmania glaciation was more widespread. An ice sheet formed in New Zealand, covering all of the Southern Alps, where at least three glacial advances can be distinguished. Local ice caps existed in <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya,</b> Indonesia, where in three ice areas remnants of the Pleistocene glaciers are still preserved today.|$|E
25|$|Ground stone adzes {{are still}} in use {{by a variety of}} people in <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> (Indonesia), Papua New Guinea and some of the smaller Islands of Melanesia and Micronesia. The hardstone is ground on a {{riverine}} rock with the help of water until it has got the desired shape. It is then fixed to a natural grown angled wood with resin and plant fibers. The shape and manufacture of these adzes is similar to those found from the Neolithic stone age in Europe. A variety of minerals are used. Their everyday use is on a steady decline, as it is much more convenient to cut fire wood using imported steel axes or machetes. However, certain ceremonial crafts such as making canoes, ceremonial shields, masks, drums, containers or communal houses etc. may require the use of traditional-made stone adzes.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indigenous}} people live within the rainforest as hunter-gatherers, or subsist as part-time small scale farmers supplemented {{in large part by}} trading high-value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest. Peoples have inhabited the rainforests {{for tens of thousands of}} years and have remained so elusive that only recently have some tribes been discovered. These indigenous peoples are greatly threatened by loggers in search for old-growth tropical hardwoods like Ipe, Cumaru and Wenge, and by farmers who are looking to expand their land, for cattle(meat), and soybeans, which are used to feed cattle in Europe and China. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes. The province of <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> or West Papua in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.|$|E
25|$|ASEAN {{has also}} failed to abolish human rights {{violations}} in West Papua, including <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya,</b> committed by Indonesian military officials and political authorities. It is estimated that more than 500,000 indigenous Papuans {{have been killed in}} the name of Indonesian nationalism by Indonesian authorities. Native Papuans have been lobbying for independence from Indonesia since the 1900s, however, they have not succeeded due to intense Indonesian army operations which resulted in expansive genocide. Independence organizations in the western half of Papua vocalized their concerns and aspiration to ASEAN, however, no action was made by the association. In 2014, all independence movement groups in West Papua and Iriran Jaya finally formed under a single umbrella organization, the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP). Due to the December 2016 Independence Rally in West Papua, where more than 500 native Papuans were arrested by Indonesian officials, a bloc of nations swore to support the West Papua Independence Movement in the entrance of 2017. Among these coalition of nations are Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga, Tuvalu, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. The FLNKS, which represents New Caledonia Independence Movement, also supported the West Papua independence movement. The bloc of nations lambasted Indonesia's human rights record in West Papua, which includes <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya,</b> and the referendum conducted by Indonesia to control the region, where only 0.02% of the population were allowed by Indonesia to vote in a previous referendum marred by political threats from Indonesian authorities. The ambassador of Guinea-Bissau implied that the movement is the same with the movement made by Timor-Leste, and thus should be respected. The probable support base of the African leader is due to the support of the Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, who backed West Papuan independence from Indonesia. On the other hand, the ambassador of Papua New Guinea spoke against the coalition of nations due to ties with Indonesia, despite being ethnically and geographically related to West Papua. All of the statements made were committed during the 2017 meeting of Council of Ministers of the 79-member Africa Caribbean Pacific Group of States (ACP). The indigenous Maori people of New Zealand also expressed their support for West Papua during the ULMWP's visit in the country. The Aborigines of Australia also expressed their support for the movement.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the larger}} Indonesian islands {{have at least one}} {{international}} airport. The biggest airport in Indonesia, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, is located in Tangerang Regency, Banten. There are five more international airports on Java, Adisumarmo International Airport (IATA: SOC) in Solo, Central Java, Juanda International Airport (IATA: SUB) in Surabaya, East Java, Achmad Yani International Airport (IATA: SRG) in Semarang, Central Java, Husein Sastranegara International Airport (IATA: BDO) in Bandung, West Java and Adisucipto International Airport (IATA: JOG) in Yogyakarta. On Kalimantan, there is one international airport and there are two on Sumatra such as Minangkabau International Airport in Padang, West Sumatra. Bali, {{which is part of the}} Nusa Tenggara Islands, has the Ngurah Rai International Airport (IATA: DPS). Selaparang Airport (IATA: AMI) located on the west coast of Lombok was closed to flight operations on 30 September 2011. The new Lombok International Airport opened on 1 October 2011. Selaparang Airport will either be redeveloped or may possibly be retained for development as Indonesia's first General Aviation hub airport. Sam Ratulangi International Airport, also known as Manado International Airport, is located in North Sulawesi, 13 kilometres northeast of Manado. The airport is named after the Minahasan educator and independence hero Sam Ratulangi. The Manado airport is also a hub to remote areas of Eastern Indonesia, including Halmahera with both Kao airport as well as Galela, Ambon, Tidore, and <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> or West Papua. There are also direct flights to Manado International Airport (IATA: MDC) from Singapore daily with Silk Air a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} {{that with the}} help of an accomplice, Bryan Wickham, [...] he had taken them by car to Weipa in Australia's far north, and by boat from the Cape York Peninsula to Merauke, in the Indonesian province of <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya.</b> From there he took them to Malaysia via Sulawesi, where the authorities retrospectively awarded him custody, and the children were then settled with their father in Terengganu. Wickham spent one year planning the abduction, arranging vehicles and a boat, studying the escape route. Wickham later served nine months in an Australian jail for his part. Malaysia is not a party to the Hague Convention, which recognises custody by the habitual residence of minor children, and so the Convention could not be used to return the children to Australia.|$|E

Thus [...] "BIS" [...] represents the Bismarck Archipelago at Level 3. This area is not subdivided, so [...] "BIS-OO" [...] can be used to represent it at Level 4. As an example, the complete division of the Level 2 Papuasia region is shown below.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 it was {{proposed}} {{to split the}} province into three government-controlled sectors, sparking Papuan protests. In January 2003 President Megawati Sukarnoputri signed an order dividing Papua into three provinces: Central <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> (<b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> Tengah), Papua (or East <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya,</b> <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> Timur), and West Papua (<b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> Barat). The formality of installing a local government for Jaraka in <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> Barat (West) took place in February 2003 and a governor was appointed in November; a government for <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> Tengah (Central <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya)</b> was delayed from August 2003 due to violent local protests. The creation of this separate Central <b>Irian</b> <b>Jaya</b> Province was blocked by Indonesian courts, who declared it to be unconstitutional and in contravention of the Papua's special autonomy agreement. The previous division into two provinces was allowed to stand as an established fact.|$|E
