In recent literature, researchers have used different approaches, which are not always correct or complete. We discuss the parameter constraints required to obtain such perfectly correlated latent factors in the context of 4 commonly used models: (a) the oblique factor model, (b) the hierarchical factor model, (c) models in which the factors are predicted by a covariate, and (d) models in which the factors are predictors of a dependent variable. It is shown that the necessary constraints depend on the choice of scaling. We illustrate testing the <b>indistinctiveness</b> of factors with 2 real data examples...|$|E
40|$|The {{securitization}} framework {{has greatly}} improved empirical analysis of security threats. Yet, it {{could benefit from}} heightened analysis of two often neglected aspects. First, this article argues that securitizers may invoke multiple referent objects to strengthen their argument that the referent object possesses the ‘right to survive’. Second, by drawing attention to the presentation of securitizing moves, {{as well as their}} content, it highlights how securitizers attempt to persuade multiple audiences that their securitizing moves should be accepted and coun-termeasures enacted. These claims are illustrated through the analysis of an atypical case of securitization performed by an unlikely set of securitizers, humanitarian aid organizations, as they argue that indis-tinctiveness poses an existential threat both to their material security and to their identity.

40|$|The {{acculturation}} {{paradigm of}} measuring assimilation, separation, integration and marginalization confuses dimensional and categorical conceptions of its constructs, fails to produce ipsative data from mutually exclusive scales, misoperationalizes marginalization as distress, mismeasures biculturalism using double-barreled questions instead of computing it from unicultural measures, and then tends to misinterpret and miscite this faulty science. Extensive published but widely uncited data {{cast doubt on}} claims that integration is preferred by minority groups or is beneficial for them. Such salient but unseen problems suggest that the community of acculturation researchers is biased and blinded by an ideology, probably the commendable ideology of liberalism, which advocates freedom of choice, tolerance, plurality, and redress of harm. Phenomenological observations that challenge the paradigm include the absence of studies of majority group acculturation, the well-replicated fact that minorities never prefer pure uniculturalism, the <b>indistinctiveness</b> of cultures, and the predominance of researchers, theory and data from similar Anglo-Saxon settler societies (USA, Australia, Canada) ...|$|E
40|$|By linking {{nature and}} culture in a {{relationship}} of mutual presupposition or basic <b>indistinctiveness,</b> the framework of buen vivir seems to offer a “sustainable” alternative to the exploitation of the biophysical world and human communities that neoliberal globalization is taking to the extreme. Buen vivir, however, is an “invented tradition”, still under elaboration. Indigenous cultures are read {{in the light of}} most recent developments in social theory, which connect emancipatory practices and deconstruction of classic ontologies. On their side, new post-constructivist ontologies (this contribution focuses on feminist “new materialism”) build to a remarkable extent on the conceptualizations of nature provided by technoscience, which in their turn are attuned to neoliberal rationality. One may wonder, therefore, if the post-constructivist approach is pointing to a target of decreasing significance, while failing to acknowledge its own alignment with the vision of nature that underlies neoliberal policies. In any case, buen vivir remains a promising framework, especially in regard to its grafting onto a worldview that differs profoundly from the one which underpins both the greedy individualism of neoliberalism and the decentred post-humanism of contemporary social theory...|$|E
40|$|Melbourne {{has been}} a {{relatively}} ubiquitous presence in the cinema since the very first films shot by a Lumière cameraman in Australia in late 1896. These initial Australian films feature iconic (Derby Day, part of the Melbourne Cup Carnival) and relatively indistinct images {{of the city that}} set up a paradigm for Melbourne&# 039;s representation that continues to this day. This combination of iconic identifiability - determined by such elements as Melbourne&# 039;s seeming obsession with sport and the &# 039;marvellous&# 039; Victorian-era architecture that defines the city&# 039;s popular identity - and <b>indistinctiveness</b> is reflective of the city&# 039;s geography, history, cultural identity, and insistent competitive relationship to the more obviously spectacular and picturesque Sydney. Melbourne, arguably defined as a &# 039;second city&# 039; in contradistinction to its northern counterpart, is often considered more cultured, more literary, more liveable (the &# 039;world&# 039;s most&# 039; according to various highly publicised polls), more structured (it served as Australia&# 039;s administrative capital and parliament in the early years after Federation), less brash, and as a place that you must spend time in to truly experience. Melbourne-set films, complete with the difficulties they encounter in introducing the city and finding easy markers of identification, are defined by a dispersed and piecemeal psycho-geography of the city...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{interest}} in relations between arts and workplace related health has increased. The focus has mostly {{been on the}} work of arts and health from a disease perspective and {{to the best of our}} knowledge the research focusing on relation between the artists and workplace related health from a salutogenic perspective is rare. In 2007 a project called the Contemporary Artists in Contemporary Society (CACS) Scania project was implemented and evaluated. The project consisted of twelve visual artists being positioned at eight workplaces on half time for a period of six months. The idea of the project was that unprejudiced meetings between the artists and the staff could result in workplace related health promoting processes. This study will try to unravel some of the mystery of how artists’ presence can result in workplace related promotion of health.     Aim The aim was to identify success factors for visual artists functioning as health promoters at a workplace.   Procedure The search for success criterion started with going through the project descriptions and the evaluation reports from the CACS Scania project. This exposition led to the selection of one project that was considered a particularly successful case. Two artists had been placed at the office for management of regional development in Scania. The employees consisted mainly of civil servants and administrators. The evaluation material belonging to this particular project was studied, searching for possible explanations to the success of the project. The material consisted of digital recordings from a focus group interview with five of the participating staff, an interview with the manager, an interview with the two artists as well as stories written by the two artists throughout the project and finally the project description as well as the folder that the two artists produced as a summary of the project. The analysis of the material was influenced by qualitative content analysis and three categories of success factors were found.   Results The experience of the participating staff The result showed that the staff mainly had had positive project related experiences. The staffs’ experiences could be linked to the salutogenic factors comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. The various project related activities were found to be meaningful and the different activities were considered a pleasant reflective break from an everyday routine based and hectic practice. Some of the staff reported having problems managing the openness and <b>indistinctiveness</b> of the project, but the frequent communication with the artists, as well as support from the manager made the <b>indistinctiveness</b> manageable. The presence of the artists and the different project related activities were often found to be amusing, with adherent facilitation of wellbeing among the staff. At other occasions the presence of the artists could be considered disturbing. The artists brought new perspectives into the workplace that sometimes challenged the staffs’ customary way of thinking and acting, opening up possibilities for creativity and reflective processes of work related learning. It seemed as if the positive health related experiences of the staff relied on communication and mutual construction of intellectual fellowship and project related meaning (intersubjectivity).   A framework for the work of the artists Four criteria were considered a useful framework for a description of the artists successful work at the workplace. 1. Presence - The artists were often present at the workplace. 2. Inspiration – The artists were inspired by the workplace. 3. Activity - The artists were constantly presenting things and activated the staff through out the project 4. Communication – The artists communicated with the staff during the development, implementation and completion process of the project.   Organisational climate It seemed as if the organisational climate was suitable for using artists as health promoters. The staff and the manager were for instance describing them as willing to try new and innovative strategies for the development of their work in general and their work related health in particular.   Conclusion To conclude there is a health promoting potential when involving artists as health promoters at a workplace. For this potential to be realised we found three categories of success factors. The experience of the participating staff were considered important since positive experiences, with adherent positive feelings, form the base for psychological and biological processes that generally have a positive impact on health. These experiences are on the other hand dependent on other facilitating factors, that here can be linked to for instance the artists as well as the organisational climate. ...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{structural}} {{reliability assessment}} techniques {{are based on}} precise and crisp (sharp) definitions of failure and non-failure (survival) of a structure in meeting a set of strength, function and serviceability criteria. These definitions are provided {{in the form of}} performance functions and limit state equations. Thus, the criteria provide a dichotomous definition of what real physical situations represent, in the form of abrupt change from structural survival to failure. However, based on observing the failure and survival of real structures according to the serviceability and strength criteria, the transition from a survival state to a failure state and from serviceability criteria to strength criteria are continuous and gradual rather than crisp and abrupt. That is, an entire spectrum of damage or failure levels (grades) is observed during the transition to total collapse. In the process, serviceability criteria are gradually violated with monotonically increasing level of violation, and progressively lead into the strength criteria violation. Classical structural reliability methods correctly and adequately include the ambiguity sources of uncertainty (physical randomness, statistical and modeling uncertainty) by varying amounts. However, they are unable to adequately incorporate the presence of a damage spectrum, and do not consider in their mathematical framework any sources of uncertainty of the vagueness type. Vagueness can be attributed to sources of fuzziness, unclearness, <b>indistinctiveness,</b> sharplessness and grayness; whereas ambiguity can be attributed to nonspecificity, one-to-many relations, variety, generality, diversity and divergence. Using the nomenclature of structural reliability, vagueness and ambiguity can be accounted for in the form of realistic delineation of structural damage based on subjective judgment of engineers. For situations that require decisions under uncertainty with cost/benefit objectives, the risk of failure should depend on the underlying level of damage and the uncertainties associated with its definition. A mathematical model for structural reliability assessment that includes both ambiguity and vagueness types of uncertainty was suggested to result in the likelihood of failure over a damage spectrum. The resulting structural reliability estimates properly represent the continuous transition from serviceability to strength limit states over the ultimate time exposure of the structure. In this section, a structural reliability assessment method based on a fuzzy definition of failure is suggested to meet these practical needs. A failure definition can be developed to indicate the relationship between failure level and structural response. In this fuzzy model, a subjective index is introduced to represent all levels of damage (or failure). This index can be interpreted as either a measure of failure level or a measure of a degree of belief in the occurrence of some performance condition (e. g., failure). The index allows expressing the transition state between complete survival and complete failure for some structural response based on subjective evaluation and judgment...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho realizamos uma reflexão teórica acerca de um modo de acontecer da linguagem que, embora amplamente investigado no processo de aquisição da primeira língua, tem recebido pouca atenção no campo de ensino de Línguas Estrangeiras, a saber, a fala egocêntrica ou fala privada (como é denominada em nosso campo por pesquisadores inseridos na perspectiva histórico-cultural). Partindo das discussões de Vygotsky acerca da fala egocêntrica e da linguagem {{interior}}, ampliamos nosso foco com base nos trabalhos do Círculo de Bakhtin, buscando redimensionar a compreensão da fala privada. A maioria dos trabalhos em nossa área concebe a fala dirigida ao próprio sujeito como monológica e mantém a dicotomia interno/externo, social/privado. A fala privada tem sido, pois, considerada como a fala estritamente dirigida ao próprio sujeito, não possuindo um interlocutor. Porém, tomando por base a indistinção entre interno e externo e concebendo linguagem enquanto atividade significante, processo, ação, e considerando a não-unicidade do sujeito falante, sua fundante heterogeneidade e dialogicidade, a fala privada revela-se muito mais rica e complexa. Consideramos a fala privada como um indício da atividade que ocorre no âmbito do discurso interior (que sempre pressupõe um interlocutor), não indicando apenas a internalização da linguagem ou sua função auto-reguladora como tem sido o foco principal de muitas pesquisas. Nossos dados, coletados durante interações em sala de aula de língua inglesa com um grupo particular de três jovens universitários, demonstram a plurifuncionalidade dessa fala e evidenciam que pode estar mesclada à fala dirigida ao outro presente na interação. Indicam também sua natureza essencialmente dialógica e argumentativa (sendo a argumentação aqui concebida como "agir sobre o outro"). Verificamos um denso diálogo entre palavras, enunciados, contextos; confrontos de vozes e posições (avaliativo-valorativas, sociais, enunciativas), indicando a intensa movimentação e interlocução que ocorrem nessa fala muitas vezes ignorada em sala de aula ou até mesmo silenciada. Ela nos dá pistas do trabalho realizado pelos alunos/linguagem no processo de constituição de conhecimento e revela uma outra 'dimensão' da dinâmica discursiva de sala de aula que, embora muitas vezes permaneça inaudível, dela também participa e na qual muitas outras vozes falam. Desta forma, os interlocutores ampliam-se para além daqueles presentes na interação (ou mesmo presentes nos materiais utilizados) e podemos ter um vislumbre dos destinatários interiores de nossos alunos. A fala privada também indica os modos de apropriação do discurso do outro (pelas retomadas, tentativas, prosódia, escrita, gestualidade, confrontos, conflitos); a compreensão ativa da palavra do outro (que sempre implica em nossas contrapalavras no discurso interior); a linguagem como atividade, trabalho; a linguagem como atividade dialógica, discursiva. No entanto, toda a riqueza desse modo de realização da linguagem só pode ser compreendido se não o isolarmos e o 'congelarmos', mas sim, se o concebermos como um evento fluido, participante, acontecente, imbricado na/da dinâmica discursiva em sala de aula, aonde a linguagem é transformada, criada, aonde significados/sentidos são produzidos. This {{thesis is}} the result of a theoretical reflection upon a manner of language realization that, despite being amply investigated in the process of first language acquisition, has not received much attention in the field of second (or foreign) language acquisition (SLA), namely egocentric speech or private speech (term used by researches under the culturalhistorical tradition). Following Vygotsky's discussion on egocentric and inner speech, we have broadened our scope based on the bakhtinian concept of language and the Circle of Bakhtin's reflections on inner discourse, trying to re-dimension the concept of private speech. Most of the work done in the field of SLA conceives private speech as monological and maintains the internal/external, social/private dichotomies. Private speech has thus, being considered as speech strictly directed towards oneself, not having an interlocutor. However, assuming the <b>indistinctiveness</b> of internal and external, and conceiving language as a significant activity, as process, as action and the heterogeneity and dialogicality inherent to language and the speaker, private speech reveals itself as much richer and much more complex. In this line of thought, we consider private speech as traces, vestige, of the activity that occurs in the realm of inner discourse (which always presupposes na interlocutor), indicating not only the internalization of language or the role of language in self-regulation, which has been the main focus of several researchers. Our data, collected during classroom interactions in a private English course for a group of three university students, shows the multiplicity of functions of private speech and how it can often be intertwined with the speech directed at others individuals present in the interaction. Data also indicates its essentially dialogical and argumentative nature (being the argumentation herein considered as 'acting upon the other'. We have observed a dense dialogue amongst words, utterances, contexts; a confrontation of voices and positions (evaluationalvalorative, social, enunciative), indicating the intense movement and interlocution that occur in this speech commonly ignored - or even silenced - in the classroom. It gives us clues as to the work performed by the students/language in the process of knowledge constitution and reveals another 'dimension' of the discursive dynamics in the classroom that, even though often inaudible, also participates and in which several other voices can be heard. Therefore, the scope of interlocutors is broadened, including not only those who are present in the interaction (or in the resources used in the classroom) and we can get a glimpse of the inner destinataires of our students. Private speech also indicates how students appropriate the discourse of the other (by 'repeating', trying out, interpreting, establishing relations with personal/social experiences, writing, by the prosody, gestures, confrontations, conflicts). It indicates the active comprehension of the other's word (which always implies in our response in inner discourse); language as activity, work; language as a dialogical, discursive activity. However, all the richness of this mode of language realization can only be understood if we do not isolate or 'freeze' it, but if we conceive it as a fluid event, enmeshed in the discursive dynamics in the classroom, where language is transformed, created, where meanings/senses are produced (and not reproduced) ...|$|E
