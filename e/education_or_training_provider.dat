40|$|Young people {{disengage}} {{from mainstream}} secondary schooling {{for a variety}} of complex reasons. In the thesis, I explore young people's talk to investigate what these reasons are and I use voice as a research approach to hear first-hand how young people feel about leaving school early. In collaboration with the youth coaches from Te Runanga o Nga Maata Waka, (Nga Maata Waka) an indigenous Youth Service NEET (not in <b>education,</b> employment <b>or</b> <b>training)</b> <b>provider,</b> we gathered young people's voices as shared knowledge. For Nga Maata Waka these voices offer an opportunity to explore policy and practice implications in the Youth Service NEET environment and for me, so I could understand the constraining and enabling or push/pull factors of disengagement from mainstream secondary schooling. To guide and support me throughout this collaborative journey I draw on multiple sociological theories and methodologies such as Kaupapa Māori, critical ethnography and symbolic interactionism. To analyse their voices I use multiple methods such as the Listening Guide of Carol Gilligan, thematic analysis and elements of discourse analysis. The voices in this thesis add to the ongoing debate of disengagement, by suggesting young people are sensitive towards their unsuccessful schooling identities. I also gathered talk from the staff at Nga Maata Waka who offer their operational perspectives of working in a Youth Service NEET environment. From their talk the following themes emerged-the importance of relationships, the ethos and role of the youth coach and the voice of knowing, which connects with the important concepts 'silence' and 'silencing'. I address these two concepts in the ways we, as others, with our voice of knowing, intentionally or unintentionally speak on the behalf of young people and influence their choice to disengage from mainstream secondary schooling...|$|R

500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any <b>education</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b>|$|R
